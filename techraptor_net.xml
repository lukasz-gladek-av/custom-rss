            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, Nintendo held a fully-fledged Nintendo Direct presentation that offered around an hour of information about upcoming Switch 2 and original Switch games. Here's everything that was announced during that presentation!</p>

<hr><h2>It's the 40th anniversary of&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Bros.</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/super-mario-galaxy-nintendo-direct-september-2025.jpg?itok=zPEF2Fx7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/super-mario-galaxy-nintendo-direct-september-2025.jpg?itok=VBxUKk14 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Super Mario Galaxy&nbsp;</em>and its sequel are coming to the Switch 2.</figcaption></figure><p>We kicked off with a 40th-anniversary&nbsp;<em>Super Mario&nbsp;</em>celebration, and there's lots going on in the world of Nintendo's most bankable character.</p>

<p>We're getting a sequel to the&nbsp;<em>Mario&nbsp;</em>movie by the name of&nbsp;<em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em>, and to celebrate, the two&nbsp;<em>Mario Galaxy&nbsp;</em>games are also getting re-releases on Switch and Switch 2 on October 2nd.</p>

<p>We're also getting a new&nbsp;<em>Mario Tennis&nbsp;</em>game in the form of&nbsp;<em>Mario Tennis Fever</em>, as well as a Switch 2 Edition for&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder&nbsp;</em>that's also bringing some new stuff to the table.</p>

<p>The anniversary celebrations for&nbsp;<em>Mario&nbsp;</em>closed with a glimpse at a new&nbsp;<em>Yoshi&nbsp;</em>platformer,&nbsp;<em>Yoshi and the Mysterious Book</em>, which looks positively adorable. It's coming in spring next year.</p>

<h2><em>Storm Lancers&nbsp;</em>is another new action roguelike</h2>

<p>Inspired by 80s anime, this 2D action roguelike boasts solo and co-op play, and it's coming later today, so you won't have to wait long to decide whether you want to check it out or not.</p>

<h2>Aussie farming sim&nbsp;<em>Dinkum&nbsp;</em>is coming to the Switch 2</h2>

<p>That's right: the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dinkum" rel="nofollow">cozy Aussie farming sim</a> is making its way to the Switch 2, and you'll be able to check it out on Nintendo's console on November 5th.</p>

<h2><em>Popucom&nbsp;</em>has strong&nbsp;<em>Splatoon&nbsp;</em>vibes</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/popucom-nintendo-direct-september-2025.jpg?itok=WvyendCU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/popucom-nintendo-direct-september-2025.jpg?itok=8iywwu_8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Popucom</em>, which launched in June this year for other platforms, is coming to Switch 2 as well.</figcaption></figure><p>Next, we got to see a&nbsp;<em>Splatoon</em>-esque puzzle platformer that foregrounds color as one of its main mechanics. It's also got a party mode if you're up for testing some friendships.&nbsp;<em>Popucom&nbsp;</em>is coming to Switch 2 this holiday.</p>

<h2><em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream&nbsp;</em>lives the dream in spring</h2>

<p>We got another look at the offbeat Mii life sim&nbsp;<em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream&nbsp;</em>next, and it looks exactly as weird as you'd hope. It's coming in spring 2026 to the Switch.</p>

<h2><em>Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection&nbsp;</em>is koming to Switch and Switch 2</h2>

<p><em>Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection</em>, which kollects several old&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat&nbsp;</em>games as well as a museum of kuriosities for the franchise, is coming to the Switch 2 and the original Switch on October 30th. A physical version is launching on December 12th.</p>

<h2>Relive Cloud's fever dream in&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em></h2>

<p>The <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/final-fantasy-vii-remake" rel="nofollow">first game</a> in Square Enix's planned trilogy of&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy VII Remake&nbsp;</em>titles is coming to Switch 2 on January 22nd, so you can relive Cloud's hugely enjoyable (if totally baffling) journey soon.</p>

<h2><em>Lynked: Banner of the Spark&nbsp;</em>is every game, it's all in...it</h2>

<p>Next, we got to see something that essentially looks like every video game rolled into one.&nbsp;<em>Lynked: Banner of the Spark</em>&nbsp;is an action roguelike, but it's also a cozy farming sim, and it's launching later today on both Switch machines.</p>

<h2>A full release date for&nbsp;<em>H</em><em>ades II&nbsp;</em>is finally here</h2>




<p>Supergiant Games showed off a new animated trailer for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hades-ii" rel="nofollow">action roguelite&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hades-ii" rel="nofollow">Hades II</a>&nbsp;</em>next, and we got a full release date for the 1.0 version, which is arriving on September 25th. A physical version is also coming on November 20th.</p>

<h2>Two new <em>Kirby</em>-themed Amiibos</h2>

<p>Two new amiibo figures were announced during today's Nintendo Direct, namely Kirby riding a Warp Star and a new bandana-clad Waddle Dee amiibo. They're launching on November 20th, and they'll be compatible with&nbsp;<em>Kirby Air Riders</em>.</p>

<h2><em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment&nbsp;</em>launches in November</h2>

It's coming on February 5th and it looks pretty cute, and what's more, it's not in the HD-2D style.</p>

<h2>Nintendo Today's getting a new theme, but also...</h2>

<p>The Nintendo Today app is getting a new <em>Kirby&nbsp;</em>theme, but more importantly, Virtual Boy games are coming to Switch 2 and Switch via the Switch Online service. You will, however, need a brand new Virtual Boy peripheral to play them. No, I'm not making this up.</p>

<h2><em>Suika Game Planet&nbsp;</em>goes 360-degree</h2>

<p>Watermelon puzzler&nbsp;<em>Suika Game&nbsp;</em>is getting a followup in the form of&nbsp;<em>Suika Game Planet</em>, and&nbsp;fruit now falls towards the center of a circle as part of a new 360-degree variant on the game's core gameplay. You can check this one out this winter.</p>

<h2><em>Pokemon Pokopia&nbsp;</em>looks positively adorable</h2>

<h2>New Mega Evolved forms revealed for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em></h2>

<h2><em>Fire Emblem: Fortune's Weave&nbsp;</em>is the next mainline&nbsp;<em>Fire Emblem&nbsp;</em>title, it seems</h2>
