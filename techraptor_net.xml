It's not clear exactly which departments will be most affected by this latest round of staff cuts.</p><figure role="group">

<p>According to GI.biz, the aforementioned voluntary redundancy program "had some takeup", but Ubisoft deemed "additional steps" were necessary in order to further cut costs.</p><p>An internal email sent by Ubisoft to staffers apparently states that the layoffs are nothing to do with staff performance and that the direction of both studios remains the same.</p><p>Just in case you need a reminder, Massive Entertainment is the studio behind 2024's <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/star-wars-outlaws" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fdd3085d-9457-4fdd-8120-72f7ba52b3c0" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></a>, and it's also the developer responsible for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="0d6d339e-943d-4392-8a44-bd5f8ec47fda" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</em></a><em> </em>and the <em>Division </em>franchise. A third installment of said franchise is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-quietly-drops-tom-clancys-division-3-announcement" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e673ceae-2dd8-421f-9ea7-ad4b555e54c5" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">currently in the works</a>.</p><p>It's been a shaky start to the year for Ubisoft. Just last week, the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-halifax-shutdown" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5c381dd9-8d80-4d19-ac2f-5c64bbb6ef55" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">shut down its Halifax branch</a>, a decision that carried with it some pretty unfortunate timing; Halifax had become the first North American Ubisoft <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-halifax-union" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="22333ad9-7422-4ae5-b9c7-e8c3a1c689d3" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">studio to unionize</a> just weeks before its closure.</p><figure role="group">

<p>These layoffs and studio closures are part of a wider set of cost-cutting measures for Ubisoft; the publisher also cut staff at <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-layoffs-redlynx-restructuring" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c40ca2ba-0c2c-453f-a503-eb81293d2704" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Trials </em>developer RedLynx in October</a> as well, so I wouldn't be surprised if more cuts are on the way.</p><p>We'll have to wait and see how else Ubisoft plans to reduce its spending, but I'm betting we haven't heard the last of job losses (and potentially even studio closures) from the publisher. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Arc Raiders </em>sales have soared past another huge milestone, according to developer and publisher Embark Studios, and there's a lovely free gift waiting for you to claim by way of a thank you.</p><p>As <a href="https://x.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/2010985172632797620" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">revealed</a> on social media earlier today, <em>Arc Raiders </em>has now sold 12 million copies, which means that in the time between <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/arc-raiders-sales-4m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="08dd5792-c4a8-4824-90f6-27b50a7dc7fa" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">mid-November</a> and now, the game has racked up a whopping eight million more sales for itself. Not bad at all.</p><p>The free gift in question is available until 11:59pm CET today (that's around 5:59pm Eastern), and it was originally prepared for <em>Arc Raiders </em>hitting 10 million sales, but as Embark says, players "blew straight past [that milestone] over the winter break".</p><figure role="group">

<p>News of <em>Arc Raiders</em>' new sales milestone accompanies a rather small patch that was released earlier today; it's not a big one, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1808500/view/527616545148373537" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">check out the patch notes here</a> if you want to know what's changed.</p><p>If you're not familiar with <em>Arc Raiders</em>, it's an extraction shooter created by Embark Studios, the company responsible for destructo-FPS <em>The Finals</em>.</p><p>Set on a "lethal future Earth", <em>Arc Raiders </em>sees you (and, optionally, your buddies) taking on massive monsters that now stalk the land, as well as other survivors who may not have the best intentions.</p><p><em>Arc Raiders</em>' success probably won't come as a surprise if you checked out Steam's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steam-best-of-2025" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="506dd7fd-a10c-4745-bcb4-ef7cfe0636c8" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">list of best-selling games from 2025</a> earlier this year, although it is also one of several games on that list to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/almost-20-of-top-new-sellers-on-steam-in-2025-used-generative-ai" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="16d0c419-db96-434f-99c7-9e50c881e987" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">openly use generative AI</a>, which is a controversial topic in the industry right now.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road </em>has reached a new sales milestone, developer and publisher Level-5 has announced, and the game will be getting a second major update in the near future as well.</p><p>As revealed in a <a href="https://www.inazuma.jp/victory-road/en/topics/260113_01/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">news post</a> on the game's official website, <em>Victory Road </em>has racked up 800,000 sales since launching last November.

<p>Level-5 will no doubt be pleased with <em>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</em>'s performance, especially given what a long road it's been to get here (and not one with a guaranteed chance of victory, either).</p><p>Originally known as <em>Inazuma Eleven: Heroes' Great Road</em>, the game has been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/inazuma-eleven-heroes-great-road-delayed-until-2021" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="291efc63-1f35-4892-bcb7-01502230543a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">delayed</a> numerous times, and a Western release was by no means guaranteed until Level-5 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-will-come-west-new-trailer-details-revealed" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c93004cd-65c8-4edc-afb5-782c92344e4c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">announced one in 2023</a>.</p><p>Just like its predecessors, <em>Victory Road </em>is an RPG that combines tactical soccer battles with overworld exploration. It takes place around 25 years after the original <em>Inazuma Eleven </em>and follows a new protagonist, Dustin Billows (Sasanami Unmei in the Japanese version).</p><p>Billows isn't capable of hitting the field himself, but he can recruit other students to join his team, and so he serves as their commander, building a team of unconventional soccer heroes to take on all comers.</p>
<p><em>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road </em>forms part of what is arguably a big comeback for Level-5, with cozy RPG <em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time </em>also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-girl-who-steals-time-sales-1-5m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4638dd4a-d2d1-40e8-b386-03f485297eeb" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">doing pretty well in the sales stakes</a>.</p><p>You can check out <em>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road </em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2799860/INAZUMA_ELEVEN_Victory_Road/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/inazuma-eleven-victory-road/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/inazuma-eleven-victory-road/9NVX87ZG7WSC" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and both <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/INAZUMA-ELEVEN-Victory-Road-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2950552.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Switch 2</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/INAZUMA-ELEVEN-Victory-Road-2950387.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Switch</a> right now.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
