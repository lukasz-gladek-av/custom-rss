            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has revealed the release date for&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.7, which brings a "highly anticipated" playable character, a brand new permanent game mode, and more early next month.</p>

<p>As announced in a press release, Version 3.7, "As Tomorrow Became Yesterday", launches on November 5th across all platforms. As you'd probably expect, the update's story follows on from that of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-3-6-release-date" rel="nofollow">Version 3.6</a>&nbsp;and "marks the climactic finale of the Amphoreous saga".</p>

<p>You'll explore the Ruins of Time, where a huge sword marks the place in which Phainon used his power to seal away the dread Irontomb. Naturally, Irontomb is stirring once more, and it'll be up to you and your team to put him down again.</p>

Just by having her in your team, your party's damage will be increased.</p>

<p>Not only that, but Cyrene can deploy a Zone on the battlefield that deals an additional instance of damage to any enemy within it that's struck by an ally. Her Ultimate uses stacks of the Remembrance resource to activate her teammates' Ultimate abilities and to buff teammates further.</p>

<p>You can also expect a new gameplay mode in the form of Currency Wars, which sees players forming teams of up to ten fighters in order to take part in combat operations. 61 characters will be available as part of this mode, and you'll be able to try them all out as part of a free trial as well.</p>




<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em><a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right now for free</a> on PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices. Version 3.7, "As Tomorrow Became Yesterday", will launch on November 5th across all of these platforms. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>
