<p>The certification process for Ubisoft’s Halifax union began last year, but the vote couldn’t be officially counted until Ubisoft responded, according to CTV News.</p><p>The publication goes on to say that Ubisoft dropped the challenges it had for the Halifax union after “a few hearings”. Employees from European Ubisoft unions, particularly those based in France, have apparently given their support to Huffman and the Halifax arm.</p><p>Ubisoft Halifax’s move comes after Bethesda subsidiary and legendary <em>Doom</em> developer id Software <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/id-software-union" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="798f9a5e-70df-4a38-b29c-fcb262d46b24" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">voted to unionize earlier this month</a>, and after <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> behemoth Rockstar was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rockstar-union-busting-accusation-gta-6" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2fb963bf-6dd1-47b3-bfbd-3f16511b3076" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">accused of union-busting</a> following the firing of several employees involved in union activity back in November.</p><p>It also follows layoffs at Ubisoft earlier this year, with <em>The Division</em> developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/massive-entertainment-ubisoft-layoffs" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="eb337fd6-aaaa-412a-8249-337dc274de4e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Massive Entertainment</a> and <em>Trials</em> studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-layoffs-redlynx-restructuring" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c40ca2ba-0c2c-453f-a503-eb81293d2704" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">RedLynx</a> both being hit by restructuring efforts.

<p>We’ll have to wait and see whether other Ubisoft studios decide to follow Halifax’s example and unionize, but with jobs across the industry seemingly less secure than they’ve ever been, it’s hard to imagine how unionization could be anything but a boon for Ubisoft employees.

<p>Zampella's career in the video game industry didn't begin with his work on the <em>Medal of Honor </em>franchise, but that's arguably the starting point for what he would go on to do. Alongside developer 2015, Zampella worked as lead designer on 2002's <em>Medal of Honor: Allied Assault</em>.</p><p>Following his work on <em>Medal of Honor</em>, Vince Zampella went on to co-found Infinity Ward with fellow designer Jason West, alongside whom he co-created the <em>Call of Duty </em>franchise. Needless to say, the franchise is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/circana-november-2025-call-of-duty" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="42bce328-3994-40a9-986f-20f01ece89b8" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">still going (relatively) strong today</a>.</p><p>For its own part, Infinity Ward <a href="https://x.com/InfinityWard/status/2003224882688283000" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">lamented</a> Zampella's death on X, describing his "legacy of creating iconic, lasting entertainment" as "immeasurable" and sending its condolences to his family.</p><p>Zampella would remain with Infinity Ward until 2010, when, along with West, he was dismissed from the company in an acrimonious split. Again alongside West, he subsequently founded Respawn Entertainment, which is best known for franchises like <em>Titanfall</em>, <em>Apex Legends</em>, and the <em>Star Wars Jedi </em>series.</p><figure role="group">
