            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s one of my favorite times of the year – when game developers come out like Santa’s elves and show off what they’ve been working on in their hidden little workshops. That’s right, it’s time for another Steam Next Fest, and for the February Steam Next Fest of 2026, there are over 3,500 demos for people to try.</p><p>With all those demos to try, no one can play them all. But to help you out I’ve spent the last few weeks trying a bunch of them, and I’m here to point out 10 of the demos you really should check out. Some of them are popular, some of them are obscure, and I’ve tried to capture a variety of genres here so that there’s something for everyone.</p><p>With all of that here are ten of the best and most interesting February 2026 Steam Next Fest Demos.</p><h3><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3265700/Vampire_Crawlers_The_Turbo_Wildcard_from_Vampire_Survivors/" rel="nofollow"><em>Vampire Crawlers</em></a></h3><p>There were two dungeon crawlers in this Next Fest that fought for space in this top 10, and <em>Vampire Crawlers </em>beat out the boomer shooter inspired <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4176460/Dungeons_of_DUSK/" rel="nofollow"><em>Dungeons of Dusk </em></a>by New Blood in a messy match. <em>Vampire Crawlers's </em>sheer energy and style plays near perfectly mixing dungeon crawlers, roguelite deckbuilding, and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/vampire-survivors" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7938a993-0699-46f6-b76d-06acb4234348" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Vampire Survivors </em></a>IP into a cascade of fun.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vampire-crawlers-cards_0.jpg?itok=1tkZfocq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vampire-crawlers-cards_0.jpg?itok=LIEokzDE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p>It has some distinct and unique ideas that play differently in spots like the Crawler cards, and it feels really good to play. This was a demo I lost hours in, in a way that I never really have with <em>Vampire Survivors </em>itself.</p><h3><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3559900/Voidling_Bound_Demo/" rel="nofollow"><em>Voidling Bound</em></a></h3><p>I originally came across <em>Voidling Bound </em>last year, as they released their demo originally last spring. I’m happy that I can now talk about this monster taming/collecting game in this article, because it is a lot of fun. It takes that idea of finding and collecting monsters and turns it into a third-person shooter as you take control of the little creatures, called Voidlings, and explore and battle on different missions.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/voidling-bound.jpg?itok=tJvzQsyI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="810">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/voidling-bound.jpg?itok=2tV3NWFY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="506">
                  

  </picture><p>The controls are snappy, the combat fluid, and the variation in creatures and abilities intriguing. <em>Voidling Bound </em>is at its best in its exploration levels, but there’s fun in its hoard levels as well, and the mixture makes for a compelling proposition.</p><h3><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3110830/Bobo_Bay_Demo/" rel="nofollow"><em>Bobo Bay</em></a></h3><p>Sticking with cute little creatures, if you want a less action-packed game with little dudes, <em>Bobo Bay </em>might be up your alley. This is a game that takes inspiration from raising sims, and the Chao Garden from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/top-7-3d-sonic-games" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2dc244cb-c7c9-44f5-8d24-6555e3a2dce4" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Sonic Adventure </em></a>and has you raising these little creatures around and putting them into competitions.&nbsp;</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bobo-bay-fight.jpg?itok=lD5mliUg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="810">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bobo-bay-fight.jpg?itok=C3NDisBO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="506">
                  

  </picture><p>Get them trained up, fed up, and put them into competitions that their skills are best suited to and eventually into even bigger projects. Beyond that there’s a cheerful energy that infuses the game, and it's fun to move around in a way that a lot of games just don’t have.</p><h3><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4268760/Battlestar_Galactica_Scattered_Hopes_Demo/" rel="nofollow"><em>Battlestar Galactica: Shattered Hopes</em></a></h3><p>From the persistently cheerful realm of <em>Bobo Bay</em>, we go to the darkness of space, and that no less of the 12 Colonies. In command of a small fleet escaping the Cylon destruction, you must guide them through tough decisions and difficult battles as you attempt to rejoin the Battlestar Galactica with your own ship and the civilians you are protecting. More than anything, <em>Shattered Hopes </em>captures the feel of the modern <em>Battlestar Galactica </em>with the grimness, the desperation, and the constant need to keep moving.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlestar-galactica-shattered-hopes.jpg?itok=uj5_HDa1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlestar-galactica-shattered-hopes.jpg?itok=PLiZG6kb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p>It’s not the highest production tie-in, nor are its battles incredibly complicated, but they are tense, short, and designed to press you to make decisions and accept tradeoffs before you are able to jump away.</p><h3><em>Fading Echo</em></h3><p>This is a fast-paced action-adventure RPG game where you find yourself in control of elements and able to reshape the world around you with it. Turn into a ball of water like Samus’ morph ball and use that to put out fires or bounce around and through the water.&nbsp;</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fading-echo.jpg?itok=mdxtIuij 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1061">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fading-echo.jpg?itok=xsKkxWgF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="663">
                  

  </picture><p>Add in some cheek, and other elements to play with and <em>Fading Echo </em>is a lot of fun to move around, to explore, to solve puzzles, and fight in.</p><h3><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2704090/Celestial_Return/" rel="nofollow"><em>Celestial Return</em></a></h3><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/celestial-return.jpg?itok=sblx-iZI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="810">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/celestial-return.jpg?itok=Y6vi61jc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="506">
                  

  </picture><p>A story-driven RPG experience, <em>Celestial Return </em>posits a dark, and intriguing world where you play as a burnt-out detective who decides to care one last time. <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/disco-elysium" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="989e82b0-e77a-495c-9583-e4576fdec8c0" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Disco Elysium </em></a>meets <em>Blade Runner </em>with an intriguing way of handling luck by treating dice as a resource used for just about everything, and they come in a variety of forms. Combine that with a unique aesthetic and this is a must-play game.</p><h3><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4356650/Darkhaven_Demo/" rel="nofollow"><em>Darkhaven</em></a></h3><p>Like many of my generation, I grew up with <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/diablo-2-resurrected" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e6b5f480-dae1-474d-b3b6-92fd42fb08ac" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Diablo 2</em></a>, and that game is still shaping things with its new expansion and everything else. Somewhere along the way though, the ARPG genre kinda decided that it had already reached peak and just began doing small tweaks on the same format. Don’t get me wrong, I love games like <em>Torchlight </em>too, but I also wonder if anyone was going to ever move the line.</p><p>Well, some of the <em>Diablo </em>and <em>Torchlight </em>crew are back with <em>Darkhaven </em>and their big idea is essentially to mix the ARPG with survival games. Take the items and quests and mix that with the building and destructible world of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/minecraft" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f896d9a3-1981-402e-9f6e-c0b67ed170cd" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Minecraft</em></a>, and you know what it? It works. The whole part of the world being so changeable creates significant differences in how the game plays, and new exploration options. Building here is kept simple so you aren’t tracking 30 things, and it gives the game a distinct feel.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/darkhaven.jpg?itok=nIuHOwds 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="810">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/darkhaven.jpg?itok=NeOZvf44 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="506">
                  

  </picture><p><em>Darkhaven</em>’s demo here is rawer than others, as the game is also <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/moonbeastproductions/darkhaven-an-action-rpg-with-dynamic-worlds/" rel="nofollow">currently on Kickstarter </a>seeking funding for another year of development. Right now what you have is a pre-alpha where you can see a lot of the seams and raw edges showing, but there’s a lot of promise here and room for something that is very different from what came before.</p><h3><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4210280/Titanium_Court_Demo/" rel="nofollow"><em>Titanium Court</em></a></h3><p>The most surreal game I experienced throughout Next Fest, <em>Titanium Court </em>is out there and it is weird in many many ways. The fourth wall gets leaned on, the world in it is odd, and its got weird-as-hell characters and interface interactions at times that delight in their surreal absurdism.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/titanium-court.jpg?itok=xgKpB8kJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="810">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/titanium-court.jpg?itok=Itwh8yBa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="506">
                  

  </picture><p>While that might be enough to get interest, what you’ll find underneath is a deep strategy matching game that is unique in how it plays. The closest in someways is something like <em>Drop Dutchy</em>, but this focuses on match-3 type mechanics, and how different types of blocks and your subjects all interact as you try to maximize returns, minimize invasions, and find your way through a bizarre and compelling narrative.</p><h3><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4291770/Windrose_Demo/" rel="nofollow"><em>Windrose</em></a></h3><p>One of the interesting things you can watch at times on Steam is the population of survival-craft players. They emerge from one and will seemingly migrate en masse to another game. Sometimes you can even predict what the next one will be – and <em>Windrose </em>looks like it.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/windrose.jpg?itok=GsRTaaV_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="810">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/windrose.jpg?itok=dQvXCM1N 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="506">
                  

  </picture><p>And I mean, why not? It looks good, it's a golden age of piracy themed survival game, and it plays pretty well too. It has a bit more combat depth then many of these games, but features all the same tracks you would expect while having a few different things and a focus on sailing and finding treasure that you don’t see elsewhere necessarily in the genre. Arr Matey, hoist the jolly roger and prepare to battle as we seek revenge on Blackbeard himself!</p><h3><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2537470/Vultures__Scavengers_of_Death/" rel="nofollow"><em>Vultures - Scavengers of Death</em></a></h3><p>Have you ever wondered, what would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/resident-evil-20-years-later" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="cbe64463-3b9a-42c5-9a0c-c274b905de74" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Resident Evil </em></a>be like if it was turn based? Well you don’t need to really wonder any more, as <em>Vultures – Scavengers of Death </em>here presents a pitch-perfect take on the '90s horror styling turned into a tactics type experience. Seek what is causing the infected mutants (totally not zombies) to cause problems while managing your scarce resources and gathering more.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vultures.jpg?itok=SgWv3yMQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1061">

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's apparently been confirmed that <em>Pokemon FireRed and LeafGreen </em>on Switch have a quality-of-life feature that will make catching certain legendary Pokemon much, much easier.</p><p>As spotted by <a href="https://x.com/RexProfessor/status/2027432141357781395" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Professor Rex on X</a> (and isn't that pleasing to say?), a Japanese <a href="https://x.com/_Gon_z" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">speedrunner</a> has uncovered a neat change in the Switch versions of the GBA classics, and it pertains to the Aurora Ticket and Mystic Ticket items.</p><p>In the original Game Boy Advance games, obtaining these tickets was only possible through Mystery Gift events, so if you wanted to catch the legendary Pokemon Deoxys, Ho-Oh, and Lugia, you'd need to have been around during those events. Now, that's no longer the case.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Pokemon FireRed and LeafGreen </em>on Switch<em> </em>now simply hand you two very hard-to-find tickets from the original.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In the Switch version, however, both of those tickets are simply automatically handed to you upon beating the Elite Four, at least according to the aforementioned Japanese speedrunner's playthrough of the game.</p><p>This means that you'll have the chance to confront Deoxys, Ho-Oh, and Lugia over the course of a normal playthrough rather than needing to be in the right place at the right time, which is great news for those of us who chronically miss these kinds of events.</p><p>Just in case you missed the news, <em>Pokemon FireRed and LeafGreen </em>were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-firered-leafgreen-switch" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="057d121c-d519-4dfa-af54-03ce59fa9f52" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">re-released on Switch today</a> as part of the franchise's 30th anniversary. Nintendo has also promised that the games will feature <em>Pokemon Home </em>compatibility at some point in the future.</p><p>These anniversary celebrations also saw the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-winds-and-waves-2027" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5a4357a0-4d69-4440-91bf-2d036a750be0" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">long-awaited announcement</a> of <em>Pokemon</em>'s tenth generation earlier today, with <em>Pokemon Winds and Waves </em>due to launch exclusively on Switch 2 sometime next year.</p>
