            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Eagle-eyed&nbsp;<em>The Alters&nbsp;</em>players reckon they've spotted some undisclosed generative AI work hiding in one of the game's background screens, which would technically contravene Steam's guidelines if it's true.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fans-slam-the-alters-after-discovering-evidence-of-undisclosed-gen-ai-in-images-text-and-translation" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>, Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheAlters/comments/1lhbpox/did_the_alters_captain_use_a_little_bit_of_ai/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">EarthlingKira</a> noted that text shown on a screen in the game's Command Center area displays the line "Sure, here's a revised version focusing purely on scientific and astronomical data", which sounds an awful lot like the kind of thing ChatGPT or a similar AI chatbot might spit out.</p>

<p>Later in the same thread, another user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheAlters/comments/1lhbpox/comment/mz9sx70/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">points out</a> that the subtitles for the Brazilian Portuguese version of&nbsp;<em>The Alters&nbsp;</em>appear to have been created using AI as well, as it seems to include part of a prompt given to a chatbot to translate phrases into Portuguese.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-alters-generative-ai-text-anomaly.jpg?itok=69mt4Kru 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-alters-generative-ai-text-anomaly.jpg?itok=A_JWvtMy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sure! Here's a screenshot of&nbsp;<em>The Alters</em>. (No AI was used in the retrieval of this screenshot, or, indeed, in the writing of this story.)</figcaption></figure><p>If the text and Brazilian Portuguese subtitles in question were indeed generated by AI, then this would seem to contravene Steam's guidelines on the technology.</p>

<p>While Valve does allow generative AI content in games on Steam (although this <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valve-explains-its-rules-on-ai-content-in-steam-games" rel="nofollow">wasn't always quite so straightforward</a>), it requires developers using gen-AI to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steam-changes-rules-on-ai-to-allow-vast-majority-of-games-that-use-it" rel="nofollow">disclose that they're doing so</a> when the game is submitted.</p>

<p>As you've probably guessed already,&nbsp;<em>The Alters</em>' Steam page doesn't contain any such disclosure, so if AI was used, it was either done without developer 11 bit studios' knowledge or ignored during the submission process.</p>

<p>With that said, a PR representative for 11 bit studios has <a href="https://x.com/callmeshawnp/status/1935830483214254450" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">publicly stated</a> on social media that generative AI was not used during the creation of&nbsp;<em>The Alters</em>. I've reached out to 11 bit for clarification on this and will update this story as soon as I hear anything.</p>




<p>Some players have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheAlters/comments/1lhbpox/comment/mz4l9e5/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">questioned</a> whether or not&nbsp;<em>The Alters</em>' supposed use of generative AI is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheAlters/comments/1lhbpox/comment/mz4nwe9/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">even a particularly big deal</a> or not in this case. Their argument is that the asset in question would probably consist of "lorem ipsum"-style placeholder text if it wasn't AI-generated, and that this isn't a particularly taxing creative task.</p>

<p>The counterarguments, of course, are the usual ones when it comes to generative AI; it's <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ai-search-wrong-a-lot-inacurracy-study" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">often wrong or nonsensical</a>, it's <a href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/ai-has-environmental-problem-heres-what-world-can-do-about" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">environmentally damaging</a>, and it could be <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/26/openai-cto-mira-murati-ai-may-cause-some-creative-jobs-to-disappear.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">taking away opportunities</a> for creatives to flex their muscles, even for background assets.</p>

<p>If you've been sitting here throughout all of this wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>The Alters&nbsp;</em>is, it's the latest game from&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>This War of Mine&nbsp;</em>developer 11 bit studios.</p>

<p>The game revolves around Jan, an astronaut who's left stranded on a hostile planet. Jan is forced to clone himself in order to keep his space station running, but each of his clones is quite literally his own man, and Jan must balance the needs of his "alters" with his mission.</p>
