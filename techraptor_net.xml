It's still set in the capitalist dystopia that is Night City, but in The Time of the Red, the literal nuclear fallout of a terrorist attack that devastated Arasaka Tower. Everyone still needs to deal with corpo scum, cyberpsychos, and brutal cops, but they also need to navigate dangerous storms and suffocating radiation.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time that <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> recognized its tabletop foundations. The Bonus Content in the game includes a PDF of the Cyberpunk 2020 Core Rulebook.</p>

<p>This is the second edition of the foundational TTRPG released in 1990. It contains crucial elements of lore such as the aftermath of the Fourth Corporate War, and is a snapshot of the game's design ethos of the era..</p>
