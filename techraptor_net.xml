            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new skirmish wargame is coming courtesy of Osprey Games. <em>Warriors of Athena</em>, the newest project by Joseph McCullough, brings quests and nail-biting fights set during the time of Greek myth.</p>

<h2>The <em>Warriors of Athena</em> Announcement</h2>

<p><em>Warriors of Athena </em>will release in two books. Those books will feature illustrations by Hazem Ameen, whose work has been featured in Minos: Dawn of the Bronze Age and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/pathfinder-adventure-card-game-review-co-op-excellence" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</em></a>.</p>

<p>These titular heroes are demigods, larger-than-life human beings blessed with the divine power of the Greek gods. These scenarios can be played solo, two-player co-op, or with an Oracle scripting and presenting scenarios for players to overcome.</p>

<p><em>Warriors of Athena: Quest</em> is a book packed with how to craft these scenarios. It contains four prewritten campaigns, advice on how to make your own, and a bestiary full of gods, monsters, and foes ready to challenge heroes.</p>

His body of work includes many beloved narrative-rich skirmish games such as <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/frostgrave-limited-deluxe-edition-celebrates-10-years-of-skirmish-mayhem" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Frostgrave</em></a>, and <em>Rangers of Shadow Deep</em>. But this game may be his biggest release yet. McCullough stated from the official press release the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Warriors of Athena</em> has allowed me to indulge in my childhood love of Greek myth while building upon my previous games to push tabletop miniature gaming into new narrative spaces. It’s also an excuse to paint some cool Greek heroes, centaurs, minotaurs, and maybe even a god or two!</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Warriors of Athena</em> will be supported by a new line of miniatures by Osprey Games and North Star Military Figures. Both books are available for pre-order on Osprey's website in both hardcover and PDF format. They are expected to ship February 24, 2026 in the US and February 26, 2026 in the UK.</p>
