            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has revealed the development team behind&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>in a rare moment of transparency, and one of the studio's biggest successes on the original Switch was created by the same team.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-donkey-kong-bananza-is-being-made-by-the-mario-odyssey-team" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer report</a>,&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>was created by the same team who worked on&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, which, at <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250508_4e.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">last count</a>, had sold over 29 million units. It's safe to say, then, that&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>is in safe hands, opposable gorilla thumbs and all.</p>

<p>If you need a reminder of what we thought of&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Odyssey&nbsp;</em>back in 2017, it's one of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/every-game-techraptor-scored-10-10" rel="nofollow">few games</a> to which we awarded a full 10 out of 10 score, with our very own Andrew <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/super-mario-odyssey-review-pure-joy" rel="nofollow">calling it</a> "one of the best&nbsp;<em>Mario&nbsp;</em>games ever made". It's hard to disagree with him on that score, quite literally.</p>

<p>The game will see Donkey Kong setting out to recover the "Banandium Gems" from the evil VoidCo., which seeks to exploit them in order to reach the planet's core, which is said to grant wishes.</p>

<p>He'll have assistance from a younger version of Pauline, who can sing in order to assist DK in various ways. She's also part of&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>'s two-player mode; she can throw out damaging explosions if a second player is controlling her.</p>

<p>You'll also be able to destroy much of&nbsp;<em>Bananza</em>'s scenery, which you'll need to do in order to uncover secrets and defeat enemies, as well as to open up your options for exploration.</p>




<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>when it launches exclusively on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/Donkey-Kong-Bananza-2785804.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch 2</a> on July 17th.</p>
