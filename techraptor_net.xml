            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sales analysis firm Circana has released its gaming industry sales data for May 2025, and FromSoftware and Bandai Namco will have cause to celebrate this month.</p>

<p>According to Circana's <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ltjuov7li22j" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Mat Piscatella</a>,&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>was the best-selling game across all formats in May, and it topped the individual PlayStation and Xbox charts as well. As a reminder, I <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/elden-ring-nightreign-review-fort-night" rel="nofollow">awarded the game an 8 out of 10 score</a>, so I'm pretty pleased it managed to sell as well as it did.</p>

<p>Of course, given that sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-confirmed-sales" rel="nofollow">topped 3.5 million</a> just a few days after the game was released, it's not surprising that&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>performed as well as it did. Still, since the game is an experiment on FromSoftware and Bandai Namco's behalf, it will no doubt come as a pleasant surprise for both studios.</p>

As a reminder, Bethesda <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bethesda.net/post/3lpmvjo7noz2c" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> shortly after launch that&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>had hit three million players, although since that number includes Game Pass players, it's perhaps not quite as valuable as the studio thinks.</p>

<p>Neither of these games have managed to topple&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-10m" rel="nofollow">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered&nbsp;</em>as the best-selling games of 2025 year-to-date. Incidentally,&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 5&nbsp;</em>is in third place, largely because of its release on PS5 in late April.</p>

<p>As ever, Nintendo's chart is off in its own little world, since many of the aforementioned games weren't released for the Switch. That platform's best-selling game for May was&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart 8</em>, because of course it was, followed by&nbsp;<em>Capcom Fighting Collection 2</em>.</p>

It's got plenty of stats on things like hardware sales and the mobile market as well, so be sure to give it a glance if you're into your numbers.</p>
