            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-soul-aside-delayed-august<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Ultizero Games and publisher PlayStation have announced that China Hero Project game&nbsp;<em>Lost Soul Aside&nbsp;</em>has been delayed until summer.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Lost_Soul_Aside/status/1917433911195353572" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Ultizero says that in order to deliver "a high-quality game experience", the game, which was originally due to be released on May 30th, will now be launching on PC and PS5 on August 29th. That, incidentally, means the game has moved from the&nbsp;release date of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nighreign-release-date" rel="nofollow">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>&nbsp;</em>to just one day before&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-release-date-leak-playstation" rel="nofollow"><em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em></a>.</p>

<p>Ultizero goes on to say that in order to meet the "standards" it's set for itself when it comes to&nbsp;<em>Lost Soul Aside</em>, it needs "some additional time to polish the game".</p>

It's been in development for some time, but in December last year, it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-soul-aside-release-window-2025" rel="nofollow">finally given a 2025 release window</a>, before a release date of May 30th was subsequently revealed (although it won't be making that date now, it seems).</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Lost Soul Aside</em>, it's an action RPG in which you'll embark on a journey to save your younger sister, and humanity as a whole, from "mysterious dimensional invaders from beyond the starlit skies".</p>

<p>As part of that quest, you can expect a "gauntlet of formidable enemies and colossal bosses" to take on, as well as lots of exciting combat abilities to upgrade and skills to try out.</p>

<p>Of course, the PC version of the game will also boast a host of graphical options, including 4K resolution, ray tracing, and HDR, but if you want to use your DualSense controller on the Steam version, you'll be able to do that as well.</p>




<p><em>Lost Soul Aside&nbsp;</em>will launch on August 29th for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3378960/Lost_Soul_Aside/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/lost-soul-aside/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>.</p>
