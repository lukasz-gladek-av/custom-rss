            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/lumines-arise-is-going-to-be-your-chill-out-game-of-year<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As soon as I saw <em>Lumines Arise by Enhance</em> make its debut at the State of Play, I was excited. While I haven't played Lumines titles in the past, I was one of the millions to get hooked into the gameplay-audio-visual experience that was <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="afa641fb-5d53-43f0-b390-fc3bc40fea45" href="https://techraptor.net/games/tetris-effect" rel="nofollow"><em>Tetris Effect</em></a>. Lucky for me <em>Lumines Arise</em> was also at Summer Game Fest where I was able to check out the first three levels of the game.</p>

<p><em>Lumines Arise</em> is a block-dropping game where your aim is to destroy enough blocks to be able to complete a level.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In <em>Lumines Arise,</em> you're always dropping a 2x2 cube made up of two different types of shapes. Much like in <em>Tetris Effect,&nbsp;</em>as you progress through different levels and songs what you're dropping will pretty much always be changing. Even across the few levels I played I saw the blocks include coins, spherical wind effects, a nut (as in 'nut and bolt'), and what seemed to be AC Compressors.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lumines-arise-seahorses.jpg?itok=BZknXJxz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lumines-arise-seahorses.jpg?itok=7r1738qj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As you're dropping your 2x2 cube of differing units, your goal is to create squares out of the pieces that have already been dropped. When you have a 2x2 cube of a single shape that's easy enough, but sometimes they'll be one shape on the left and one on the right, or opposite corners from one another. Create a 2x2 cube, 4x4 or even larger cubes to earn points.</p>

<p>A major difference to a title like <em>Tetris Effect</em>, where when you achieve a line it disappears, the squares you make in <em>Lumines Arise</em> only disappear once the line that is continuously moving from left to right passes over it. This opens up fast gameplay to creating combos, and even setting up additional cubes for when one set disappears.</p>

<p>The further you progress the faster the game plays, you'll need to work even harder to ensure you're spinning boxes appropriately, making quick matches, and giving the line enough time to clear out the groupings you've made.</p>

<h2>The Audio-Visual Feast Of <em>Lumines Arise</em></h2>

<p>At time-limited gameplay appointments it's key to be able to talk about a game while playing it, maximizing your chance to not only experience the game but hear from an expert near you about what the game will entail and why excited gamers will want to play it. That was not the case for me at <em>Lumines Arise</em>.</p>

<p>Sitting there with headphones on, watching the colorful blocks spin, strange chameleons dance, and the score rising I took 15 minutes to get through the provided levels and it was one of the most relaxing and focused experiences of the show for me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>A Game For Many Experience Levels</strong><br>
After my completion I was advised that what took me 15 minutes took some returning players 7 minutes, and others 22.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Much like Tetris Effect, each level of the game has a unique soundtrack, effects, and symbols. Each of these isn't just a repetition, a song on loop, but also speeds up, and slows down with the game pairing together all elements of the game to be in sync in an incredibly satisfying way.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lumines-arise-chameleons.jpg?itok=KQxRqQz_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lumines-arise-chameleons.jpg?itok=XgCloVOj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>There will also be playlist options so while you're playing, you can jam out to your favorite tracks.</p>

<h2><em>Lumines Arise</em> Confirms Multiplayer And Campaign</h2>

<p>In talking with CJ, Product Manager at Enhance, about the gameplay options when <em>Lumines Arise</em> releases on Steam and PS5 later this year he indicated that it would come with a full Journey mode, taking players through keenly curated levels, but that it would also have an Endless mode to zone out and try for your highest score.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"At it's core it's about forming two by two squares, but the skill ceiling is so huge" - CJ, Product Manager at Enhance</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Additionally, <em>Lumines Arise</em> will have multiplayer modes, though he wasn't able to tell me more about those at this time. Whatever those multiplayer modes are though will be enjoyable in the Summer Demo that will be coming along before too long.</p>

<p>One gameplay mode that CJ advised a lot of effort was being put into was the training mode. This is being developed so that while the game is completable by simple clearing each level when you want to challenge others online or go for the longest streak possible in Endless mode that you'll have all of the tools at your disposal.</p>

<p>If you're not a fan of loud music, pulsing and shifting icons, and technicolor images moving up, down, around, and through your screen then worry not. <em>Lumines Arise</em> features a wide variety of accessibility options to make sure as many players as possible can experience the game.</p>

<p>Some of the accessibility features mentioned were that you can change any of the screen effects, make the play field static, can normalize the look of the blocks for easier recognition, and <em>Lumines Arise</em> will also include colorblind settings.</p>

<p>The game also has three different difficulty modes, and an additional setting that the blocks are the top of the screen won't start dropping automatically.</p>

<p>You can control nearly even level of the single player experience.</p>

<p><em>Lumines Arise</em> is doing for <em>Lumines </em>for <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fea07652-3892-4b73-b789-13e6a4c5b930" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/tetris-effect-review-full-of-stars" rel="nofollow"><em>Tetris Effect</em></a> did for <em>Tetris</em>. It's bringing a curated story experience, perfect to zone out to, and a fun new level of play for fans of the dropping blocks genre.</p>

<p>It's a game where you'll be able to continuously challenge your speed and wit while getting to enjoy beautiful visuals and engaging music.</p>

<p>That being said, at it's core it is still a game about dropping blocks to solve puzzles and moving on. If you're not a fan of this genre then it's not likely Lumines Arise will be what convinces you to enjoy it, but if you do at least enjoy good atmospheric EDM tracks then it's probably at least worth a few rounds.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/pathfinder-abomination-vaults-preview-focused-on-teamwork</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pathfinder-abomination-vaults-preview-%E2%80%93-focused-on-teamwork.1216125/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/pathfinder-abomination-vaults-preview-focused-on-teamwork<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Surprisingly enough, <em>Pathfinder </em>hasn’t had a ton of video game adaptations, though the team at BKOM Studios is here to change that. They’re taking one of Pathfinder’s most popular Adventure Paths, Abominations Vaults, and turning into a hack and slash RPG.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>A Classic Hack and Slash</h2>

<p>What I played at SGF Play Days was a vertical slice of the game that is not quite finished. If you’re familiar with isometric hack and slash games like<em> Baldur’s Gate: Dark Alliance</em>, the old <em>Gauntlet </em>games, or the <em>Marvel: Ultimate Alliance</em> games, you know what I’m getting at.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When you play, there are always four characters (an AI will control those not played by someone) that work together on the field. They have complementary abilities, like healing each other or setting up combos.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One unique aspect was that each had an AoE they could throw on the ground that then buffs the heavy attack of your friends with a unique effect while they stand in it. Those sort of interactions are exactly what they want to happen throughout the game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When talking to Creative Director Wyatt Gray, he described the design philosophy of the game and what he envisions certain elements of the game to be like.</p>

<h2>Focusing on Teamwork</h2>

<p>For one, he wasn’t looking for a mindless hack and slash but something that really emphasized cooperation and the party working together to accomplish some task. That can come in the form of combat, navigating the level, solving puzzles, and more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, we all worked together to push large boulders out of the way to get further in the level. In another area, there was a noxious gas slowly killing us that could be relieved by a healing mist from some nearby mushrooms two party members could then activate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a more advanced way, Gray mentioned scenarios where two people in the party may be rowing and controlling a raft while the other two defend them from enemies attacking. They want to get creative in the scenarios they put players in to have to overcome together.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To that end, even if you’re playing solo, <em>Abomination Vaults</em> will always feature four heroes running around with you. You have the option of swapping through them at any time while playing as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gray noted that for a solo player, it is a slightly different game. You can fine tune characters to be a singular killing machine that sets up combos the way you want, where multiplayer lets you and some friends play each character the way they want.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>A Pathfinder Adventure Classic</h2>

<p>The four characters you play are likely well-known to Pathfinder players: Amiri the Barbarian, Harsk the Ranger, Kyra the Cleric, and Ezren the Wizard. Fans of Owlcat Games may remember Amiri the Barbarian, too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Each character will have three different subclasses you can choose, which vastly change up their gameplay style. And of course there’s a ton of gear that will let you build them as you please.</p>



<p>Moreover, if you’ve played through the Adventure Path of <em>Abomination Vaults</em> of the pen and paper variety of <em>Pathfinder</em>, most of this game is going to be very familiar to you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gray said that their game is essentially an adaptation of the 1 – 10 experience of <em>Abomination Vaults</em>, so the characters, settings, and story beats will remain the same. Obviously there will be some minor changes to make it work for a game, but by and large it’s the same thing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the end, <em>Pathfinder: Abomination Vaults</em> looks like it will be a good time, particularly with friends. It has a let’s grab some food and drinks, chill for a bit, and just go on an adventure vibe"... sort of like the tabletop version of the game.&nbsp;</p>

            <title><![CDATA[LEGO Party Preview - A More Interactive Party Game]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/lego-party-preview-more-interactive-party-game</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lego-party-preview-a-more-interactive-party-game.1216119/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/lego-party-preview-more-interactive-party-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>LEGO </em>games always have a certain charm and humor to them that always makes for a good time. That same wit, whacky, and unserious atmosphere permeates <em>LEGO Party</em>. Is it <em>Mario Party</em>? Well, yes but also no.</p>

<h2>Is LEGO Party Just Mario Party?</h2>

<p>It’s impossible not to compare <em>LEGO Party</em> to <em>Mario Party</em>, and it’s set up in a similar way. The main game is set up on a board with spaces, minigames in between, and you're collecting gold bricks instead of stars. Though, there are some change ups and nice quality of life features that <em>Party </em>fans will be happy to hear about.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As for changes, <em>LEGO Party</em> doesn’t have a set turn order. That is determined by the order of where everyone placed in the minigame prior. Each new game is kicked off with that initial minigame before you start moving on the board.</p>



<p>Whoever wins the first minigame not only has the first turn of the game, but they also have a huge advantage. Everyone starts with enough bits to buy a gold brick, and the first gold brick is always just a few spaces from the start. A quick way to get an early lead.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One big change is just how much more interactive and just plain active the game is while you’re playing.<em> LEGO Party </em>tries to have very little downtime where even the screen showing minigame winners is a little box you can run around and slap each other in. Where something like <em>Mario Party</em> can have great theming in one of the boards,<em> LEGO Party</em> enlivens it with an announcer that helps really sell the competition you’re in on top of all the board's quirks.</p>

<h2>LEGO Party Is Full of Charm and Jokes</h2>

<p>There are over 13,000 unique lines of dialogue for that announcer written by the writer of <em>LEGO City Undercover</em>. Some of that is set up for what is happening on screen, and there is a lot of reactivity to what just happened, like a drastic change in who is winning.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>LEGO Party </em>is set up as though you’re participating in a game show, so the announcer plays a big role and that’s why he always has something to say. It is all laced with the classic <em>LEGO </em>humor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The contestants of said game show, you and your friends, can make the minifigure of your dreams if you want as well. They are fully customizable, from the head, torso, legs, hats, and all other accoutrements that you may desire. We didn’t get to play with it much, as we all know how easy it is to get lost in character customization.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At launch, there will be four different boards that all play quite differently. We played the smaller pirate themed board, which was full of interesting hazards and unique board elements that fit the theme. For example, you would get picked up and thrown to a different part of the board by a giant tentacle or could rebuild a pirate ship to bury treasure (gold bricks) around the map.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The other maps were larger, with one based on <em>Ninjago</em>, another in space, and the last was a theme park-like in that there were four distinct areas that each acted very differently from the other. They’re each designed for a certain play length, and we found that six turns is about 30 minutes of gameplay.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Minigames are Flash Games Inspired</h2>

<p>Minigames are a pretty big step up from what you might see in something like <em>Mario Party</em>. Developer SMG Studio said that a couple of their designers have a deep history with making classic flash games, hundreds of them in fact, which you can really see in the minigame design.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In one, it was a downhill snowboarding game that seemed ripped from my childhood, another was a <em>Splatoon</em>-like where we had to run over sections of the map to paint them our brick color, and another was pretty much just straight up <em>Trials </em>and whoever got furthest in the time would win.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the board itself, there are quite a few opportunities to level the playing field. For example, someone landed on a dueling space that pitted us 2v2 (there is no 1v1, everyone is always involved in everything) where the winning team would get a golden brick. High stakes and it made the minigame that much more fun.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are also things like hidden bricks that may net you a golden brick just by luck and a lot of shenanigans built into the boards to knock people off the top so they don't get too far ahead.</p>

<p>We played a condensed version, but it felt that every turn who was up top was changing. There is a lot of “rubberbanding” to keep everyone in a similar playing field. By that, I also mean that there is a lot of random shenanigans with seemingly no explanation like <em>Mario Party </em>as well.</p>

<h2>LEGO Party Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><em>LEGO Party</em> was a good time that I think anyone who likes party games will absolutely love. There is a lot of charm, the boards are fun to engage with and look at, and a lot of attention was given to making sure there isn’t a ton of down time.&nbsp;</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Possessor(s) Preview - A Deal with the Devil That's Worth It]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/possessors-preview-deal-with-devil-thats-worth-it</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/possessor-s-preview-a-deal-with-the-devil-thats-worth-it.1216116/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/possessors-preview-deal-with-devil-thats-worth-it<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Often, I bounce off metroidvanias due to their rather slow and deliberate combat as you move around their sprawling maps. <em>Possessor(s)</em> is quick, brutal, and full of cool combos powered by an arsenal you can make your own.</p>

<h2>Quick Customizable Combat</h2>

<p>I like the fast-paced weapons, but <em>Possessor(s)</em> will give you an arsenal of weapons and abilities to customize as you like. Pair that with its quick movement and dodge, and you’ve got all you need to be effective.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You'll have your main attack determined by the weapons you equip and up to three different secondary abilities you can throw out there. The one I had access to was a computer mouse that you whipped forward to hit enemies with a combo, which was really reminiscent of Ness's yo-yo attacks in <em>Smash Bros</em>.</p>



<p>Obviously, movement and getting around the map is pretty key in the game. I was introduced to wall jumping and given a grappling hook to swing on certain points – as well as use it in combat to pull enemies towards me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are some soulslike elements to <em>Possessor(s)</em>, as well. The save points you reach are akin to bonfires, and you collect a currency for defeating enemies along the way. They respawn if you heal up and you leave behind something to collect if you die to retrieve that lost currency.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>A Big, Visually Interesting Setting</h2>

<p>I didn’t have enough time to really dig into the exploration of the game, as in getting a sense of the scale or just how interconnected it is, but I did get to see vast swaths of empty map for objectives I had to get to. Plus, there are a ton of hidden secrets if you’re keeping an eye out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every area I went into was visually interesting and had engaging level design for moving/fighting through the level. None were simply just go left to right to get to the next area. Lots of verticality and visual cues for things to check out.</p>

<p>As much as I love to speed through some platforming quickly dealing damage, taking in the sights is worth it.</p>

<h2>Story with a Great Hook</h2>

<p>As someone who can’t get enough of a good story, <em>Possessor(s)</em> has a great setting and hook. Something has led to demons attacking, seemingly related to some big corporation go figure, that has left the main character, Luca, extremely injured with both her legs missing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The game starts with you literally crawling along legless, trailing blood behind you, before you reach an injured demon. Of course, Luca has no choice and makes a deal with the demon who promises he can restore her legs. He didn’t tell her that three years would pass in that time, however.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Luca awakes three years later in the world wracked by demons, now intimately connected with on of her own, Rehm. He grants her some abilities and they have a tenuous truce as they both realize that they need one another to survive.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I can’t wait to see where the story goes, as it has a lot of potential for great character moments and big setpiece moments as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you like metroidvanias, <em>Possessor(s)</em> is an obvious one to keep your eye on. Combat is great, story is intriguing, and it is genuinely fun to move around the map. Not much more you can ask for.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/crimson-desert-preview-jaw-droppingly-detailed-gameplay-depth</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/crimson-desert-preview-%E2%80%93-jaw-droppingly-detailed-gameplay-depth.1216080/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/crimson-desert-preview-jaw-droppingly-detailed-gameplay-depth<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I had a chance to play <em>Crimson Desert</em> for about an hour at Summer Game Fest Play Days, and I’m finding it hard to put into words just what I played. That’s not because it’s bad or anything, just that my mind was constantly being blown with just how ridiculously detailed and how incredibly deep the gameplay systems are.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To get it out of the way, I didn’t see anything about progression, open world, questing, whether there is some faction reputation stuff – nothing like that. The entirety of my time was spent on the combat and the traversal mechanics.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Crimson Desert Gives You a lot of Tools to Get Around</h2>

<p>The demo took place 20 something hours into the game, so I had a lot of tools at my disposal. It was like learning to drive but someone stuck me in the cockpit of a plane. Can I drive it like a car? Sure. Does it do a whole hell of a lot more, like fly? Of course.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For getting around, you can obviously run around and have a trusty steed, but there’s a lot lurking under the hood. Your character, Kliff, has access to a lot of abilities that let him do things like launch himself into the sky and transform into shade-like figure to glide across the land.</p>



<p>Kliff can also launch himself in a straight line to a point far in front of or above him. Point to the roof of a building and Kliff will go flying that way in a straight line. You can even choose the tops of trees to use that as a launching point to glide. I was terrible at it but comboing that grappling hook-like function with the glide makes traversal really quick.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the end of my demo, the developer helping me showed me a whole lot more mechanics that we didn’t have time for. In one, he showed me that you could use that grappling hook mechanic as an anchor point to swing around something sort of like Spider-Man.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Combat in Crimson Desert Is Vast, Versatile, and Very Satisfying</h2>

<p>I’m going to be honest when I talk about the combat. I definitely don’t remember everything I was shown, as it was so dense, so many systems working together, so many choices for how to approach any given combat situation that it was truly mindboggling.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can string together combos with the shoulder buttons, use a special ability to slash out to do some more damage, then animation cancel that to swap to the second weapon you have selected to get the combo going more. You can also charge up your sword with an elemental attack and unleash a series of strikes.</p>

<p>Also, suffice to say that each weapon plays very different and combos with it are wildly different as well. Each one suits a certain playstyle and will operate a little differently. It’s pretty standard stuff, like a sword and shield, two-handed mace, etc. For example, I could spin around and cause all sorts of devastation with the two-handed mace.</p>



<p>Once I learned the many ways to combo enemies, the developer asked me if I liked wrestling.<em> Crimson Desert</em> has a robust grappling system that will let you throw people any direction, grab them by the head and shoulder drop them to the ground, and throw them into other enemies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can combo a launching attack that sees Kliff leap forward, kick your enemy, grapple them quickly, and then swing them around like Mario does to Bowser in<em> Mario 64.</em>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There’s even a wheel you can use to change the elemental affinity of your weapon at any time. It has a cooldown and a bar it uses, but that can set up some nice combos in the environment as well. For example, I was warned of standing in a puddle when using an electric weapon.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the end of my demo I had a pretty intense boss fight in the keep of a castle with a heavily armored knight. Quickly, it was obviously that my basic attacks were doing no damage to him and I had to figure out another way to defeat him.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We had knocked over some pillars and they laid on the ground. I was reminded that earlier in the demo I had done a sequence where I had to pick up a large beam to then slot it in a stand to re-fly a banner at a location. Just as I picked up that large beam, I could pick up a pillar.</p>



<p>Kliff has some sort of telekenetic powers that let him pick up large objects, so I went through a sort-of complicated sequence of activating powers with L3 + R3, selecting the beam, mashing X to lift it up, grabbing it with triangle, turning towards the boss, and then swinging it down to crash on him.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fight the boss, stagger him, smash him with a pillar. Turns out that works really well against heavily armored dudes. &nbsp;</p>

<p>There was more I was shown that this game could do but I can’t remember it all. It felt like it was one of those games that you could try just about any button combo or multiple button press and it would do something for you. The team said as much while I was playing, letting me know there were a lot of hidden mechanics not necessarily described to the player but those that experiment would be rewarded.</p>

<h2>The Graphics Are Gorgeous, Physics Impressive</h2>

<p>The final thing I want to mention is the setting for this demo. It’s one of those settings I’ve dreamed of seeing done well in a game, just waiting for technology to allow us to experience it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kliff is tasked with rescuing a friend fighting in the middle of a war, with his side besieging a keep. So, you have to make your way through a battlefield, the encampment outside the keep, over the castle walls, and through the castle to find your friend and defeat their leader.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The excruciating detail of the large-scale fight was astounding. It was beautifully chaotic with friend and enemy soldiers fighting all over the place. I wasn't just funneled down some pathway with invisible walls of background fighters in the distance either.</p>



<p>I could go anywhere and everywhere to interact with the hundreds of soldiers all duking it out at once on screen if I wished. The visceral mayhem I waded through is not something I’ll soon forget. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The physics of watchtowers exploding in a satisfying way, seeing them crumble or their individual boards flying apart was amazing to see among all the fighting, fire, and so much more.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Crimson Desert Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Every look we’ve seen of <em>Crimson Desert</em> has been intriguing, and I can say that my hands-on time exceeded my expectations many times over. It was breathtakingly beautiful, animated perfectly, and had very dense, well-connected gameplay systems that can be engaged with satisfyingly for any level of player. It's a game with al ot of complex systems but you can choose what you want to engage with.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If they can nail the open world and story, <em>Crimson Desert</em> may be this year’s biggest hit. Look out <em>Clair Obscur</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<hr><p><em>Crimson Desert </em>was previewed at Summer Game Fest. It<em>&nbsp;</em>is set to release late this year for PC, Mac, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Seriex X|S.&nbsp;</p>
