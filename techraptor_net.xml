            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Paizo has announced two new supplements for their acclaimed fantasy TTRPG, Pathfinder. One continues to expand the layered and complex setting of Golarion. The other, <em>Pathfinder Impossible Magic</em>, introduces new and updated magic classes for its players.</p><p>In an official live stream, reported on by <a href="https://www.enworld.org/threads/pathfinder-announces-two-new-rulebooks.717153/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">EN World</a>, Paizo announced both <em>Pathfinder Impossible Magic</em> and the <em>Lost Omens: High Seas</em> supplements for <em>Pathfinder Second Edition</em>.</p><p>The first book is a new supplement of player options. According to its store page listing, the book contains new magical options, ranging from new cantrips to reality-bending spells. Among those options are four new dedicated spellcasting classes: Magus, Necromancer, Runesmith, and Summoner.</p><p>These classes are important since three out of the four are updates from <em>Pathfinder First Edition</em>. The Runesmith can transcribe and apply magical runes and glyphs. The Summoner can summon creatures to do their bidding. The Magus is a classic GISH; a combination of strong spellcasting and martial prowess. With this new supplement, players can see how these classes work in the latest edition of the game.</p><p>In addition, <em>Pathfinder Impossible Magic</em> introduces over 200 new spells to the game, new character archetypes, and new schools of magic derived from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/pathfinder-lost-omens-impossible-lands-review" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Impossible Lands</a>. If you are attending GenCon this year, you can pick up a copy of this book for yourself. The store page listing has it priced at an MSRP of $29.99.</p><p>The other supplement, <em>Lost Omens: High Seas,</em> is a continuation of Paizo's in-depth setting books in the vein of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/pathfinder-returns-to-tian-xia-this-october" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Tian Xia</a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/pathfinder-lost-omens-highhelm-review" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Highhelm</a>. As the name suggests, the book will cover the open waters of the Inner Sea. This will include the failed utopian island of Hermea, Mediogati Island, the mysterious Mordant Spire, the pirate-scoured isles of the Shackles, and the dangerous underwater depths.</p><p>The <em>Lost Omens: High Seas</em> supplement releases in July. The store page price listed is an MSRP of $44.99.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
