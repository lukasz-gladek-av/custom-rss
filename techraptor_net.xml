            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>developer and publisher Funcom has announced that the game has reached a major sales milestone since its release earlier this month, and the studio has also shared some fun stats to commemorate said milestone.</p>

<p>According to a press release,&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening</em>&nbsp;has sold a million copies since <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-delayed-june" rel="nofollow">its launch on June 10th</a>. This figure also makes the game the fastest-selling Funcom title; as the studio points out, it took&nbsp;<em>Conan Exiles</em>, which is&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening</em>'s spiritual predecessor, around a year to reach the same figure.</p>

<p>Additionally,&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening</em>'s peak player count of <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1172710/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">189,333</a> on Steam has easily outstripped&nbsp;<em>Conan Exiles</em>' <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/440900/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">53,402</a>, and&nbsp;the newer game also has a 24-hour player peak of 174,003, so there are still plenty of people interested in it almost two weeks after launch.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dune-awakening-sales-1m-table.jpg?itok=i-G76JQn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dune-awakening-sales-1m-table.jpg?itok=rbLfkYDP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>has hit a big sales milestone.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as the million-sales milestone, Funcom also shares that over 121 million building pieces have been used by players cumulatively, and that 66,883 deaths to sandstorms have occurred. Next time, you'll know to pack a sturdier umbrella.</p>

<p>Players have crafted 517,585 ornithopters between them, and over 6 billion grams of spice have been consumed across&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening</em>'s player base as well, proving the franchise's age-old adage true.</p>

<p>It's worth checking out the full infographic to see some other fun&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>numbers, so here it is in all its glory!</p>



<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>is, it's a survival game set on the desert planet of Arrakis, which is central to the plot and setting of Frank Herbert's influential&nbsp;<em>Dune&nbsp;</em>series (as well as director Denis Villeneuve's movies, of course).</p>

<p>The game takes place in an alternate timeline in which messiah figure Paul Atreides was never born and in which a civil war between the Atreides and Harkonnen factions rages. You play as a Bene Gesserit agent searching for the nomadic Fremen, who have disappeared in this timeline.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172710/Dune_Awakening/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>. The game is also due to come to consoles at some point in the future, although we don't know exactly when just yet.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Cyberpunk 2077 Update 2.3 Delayed Beyond This Week, No New Date Revealed]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-2077-update-23-delayed</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cyberpunk-2077-update-2-3-delayed-beyond-this-week-no-new-date-revealed.1225728/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>CD Projekt Red has announced that the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>Update 2.3 will be postponed, and no new release date for the update has been announced.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cyberpunk.net/post/3lsbnqkiohc2h" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Bluesky, the studio says that while the update was intended to be released on June 26th (that's this Thursday at time of writing), more time will be needed for the developer to "make sure we're happy with [the update]".</p>

<p>The extra time will be used to implement features that will bring Update 2.3 closer in scope to Update 2.2, the studio says. More information will be provided as soon as it's available, according to CDPR.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cyberpunk-2077-update-2.3-delayed-smoking.jpg?itok=OseBe83H 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cyberpunk-2077-update-2.3-delayed-smoking.jpg?itok=-sKiDTGW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>'s next update has been delayed indefinitely.</figcaption></figure><p>While we know what kind of level CDPR is aiming for when it comes to Update 2.3, we don't yet know exactly what will be in it. The patch was only announced <a href="https://x.com/PaweSasko/status/1930657862054707704" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">earlier this month</a>, and since then, speculation has been rife, but concrete information from CDPR hasn't been forthcoming.</p>

<p>CD Projekt Red community director&nbsp;Marcin Momot said at the time of the patch's release that the team would "start spilling the beans closer to the release of patch 2.3", so it sounds like we'll have a little longer to wait for more info.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk&nbsp;</em>news, CDPR revealed back in May that a sequel to the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cd-projekt-profits-cyberpunk-sequel-pre-production" rel="nofollow">has entered pre-production</a>, although that might be a little less exciting than you'd think; it essentially means the studio is currently prototyping the game's skeleton and creating its foundations.</p>

<p>Additionally, in November last year, the studio announced that&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>had managed to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-2077-sales-witcher-production" rel="nofollow">surpass 30 million sales</a> around the world, so if you're wondering why CDPR is so eager to get a sequel underway, now you know.</p>




<p><em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>is also one of the third-party games chosen to launch alongside the Nintendo Switch 2, and while <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-third-party-game-launch-sales-report" rel="nofollow">reports claim</a> that third-party launch numbers for Switch 2 games aren't looking so great, those reports also point to&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk&nbsp;</em>as the Switch 2's best-selling third-party title.</p>

<p>You can grab&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1091500/Cyberpunk_2077/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/cyberpunk-2077/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/cyberpunk-2077" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition-switch-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[Co-op Climbing Game Peak Hits 1m Sales in Less Than a Week]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/peak-1m-sales-first-week</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/co-op-climbing-game-peak-hits-1m-sales-in-less-than-a-week.1225662/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Peak</em>, a physics-based climbing sim created by Aggro Crab and&nbsp;<em>Totally Accurate Battle Simulator&nbsp;</em>developer Landfall, has reached a major sales milestone within just a week of its release.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://x.com/LandfallGames/status/1936734056089100646" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the official Landfall X account,&nbsp;<em>Peak&nbsp;</em>managed to sell a million copies within its first six days, which is particularly impressive given that the game isn't currently available anywhere outside of Steam.</p>

<p>On that note, in the replies to the post, a user asks Landfall whether&nbsp;<em>Peak&nbsp;</em>is coming to consoles as well. The studio says it's "too early to say", but that the game will "hopefully" be released on consoles. I'd imagine sales numbers like this won't hurt on that front.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/peak-sales-1m-climbing.jpg?itok=z8JP2tqJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/peak-sales-1m-climbing.jpg?itok=EKqsPnsy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Peak&nbsp;</em>has managed to sell a million copies in its first week.</figcaption></figure><p>As for the reason behind&nbsp;<em>Peak</em>'s success, it's likely tapping into the same streaming-friendly approach espoused by the likes of horror game&nbsp;<em>Lethal Company&nbsp;</em>or fellow climbing sim&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chained-together-steam-surprise-hit" rel="nofollow"><em>Chained Together</em></a>.</p>

<p>Per&nbsp;<em>Peak</em>'s Steam page, the game is one in which "the slightest mistake can spell your doom", and it should be fairly obvious how that translates to streaming appeal; watching streamers gleefully fail to climb a mountain time and time again is exactly the kind of entertainment many stream viewers are looking for.</p>

<p><em>Peak</em>'s map also rotates every day, which means that even if you manage to conquer today's mountain, you'll have another one waiting for you and your friends tomorrow, adding replay value.</p>

<p>All told, it looks like Landfall and Aggro Crab have a hit on their hands. It just remains to be seen whether&nbsp;<em>Peak&nbsp;</em>can remain at the top of its particular mountain, or whether it'll be shunted off by another flavor of the month soon.</p>




<p>If you want to check out&nbsp;<em>Peak&nbsp;</em>for yourself, you can do so <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527290/PEAK/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here on PC via Steam</a>. Hopefully, the game will come to consoles soon as well. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[MindsEye Developer Build a Rocket Boy Reportedly to Lay Off Over 100 Employees]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mindseye-build-a-rocket-boy-layoffs-report</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mindseye-developer-build-a-rocket-boy-reportedly-to-lay-off-over-100-employees.1225617/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>According to a new report,&nbsp;<em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>developer Build a Rocket Boy is about to be hit by a wave of layoffs that could see around a third of employees at the studio lose their jobs.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-developer-build-a-rocket-boy-begins-layoff-process-amid-disastrous-launch-studio-sources-say" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">IGN</a> (which cites "studio sources"), Build a Rocket Boy has begun the "standard 45-day consultation process" for layoffs. Under UK law, that process is triggered when employers propose to lay off 100 or more employees within 90 days, and according to IGN, that constitutes around a third of the studio's total headcount.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that Build a Rocket Boy hasn't confirmed these layoffs itself yet, and the studio hasn't provided any official comment on the IGN report either, so we don't know for certain that they're happening.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mindseye-build-a-rocket-boy-layoffs-report-shooting.jpg?itok=2Ytq0Xms 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mindseye-build-a-rocket-boy-layoffs-report-shooting.jpg?itok=frLwVMSV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>developer Build a Rocket Boy appears to be laying off many of its employees.</figcaption></figure><p>While it's true Build a Rocket Boy hasn't officially confirmed the layoffs, they wouldn't come as too much of a surprise.</p>

<p><em>MindsEye</em>, which is the studio's first game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mindseye-launch-messy" rel="nofollow">suffered a disastrous launch</a> earlier this month, which reportedly saw even PlayStation offering refunds to players over the broken and glitchy state of the game at release.</p>

<p>Steam reviews for the game are currently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3265250/MindsEye/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sitting at Mostly Negative</a> at time of writing, with players decrying not only abundant glitches and bugs, but also repetitive gameplay and a poorly-executed story. One player describes&nbsp;<em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>as "absolute garbage with extremely high and unwarranted production value". Ouch.</p>

<p>Shortly after the game's launch, Build a Rocket Boy <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3265250/view/520842118898385842" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">promised fixes</a> for some of its most egregious issues, including tech optimizations, reduced minigame difficulty, and other improvements.</p>




<p><em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>was originally intended to serve as the launch for an ambitious project spanning not only the single-player campaign, but also user-generated content and a stream of creations from the game's community. Given the state of its launch, though, it's very hard to see that happening.</p>

<p>If you really want to, you can check out&nbsp;<em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3265250/MindsEye/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/mindseye/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/mindseye/9pj9wxk3v9fn" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. Honestly, though, I'd recommend just <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/mindseye-review-mideye" rel="nofollow">reading our Sam's review</a> instead.</p>
