            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Devir Games has announced an <em>Ace of Spades</em> reboot. After pulling the game from sale after some controversial content, a revised version of the card game is coming this summer along with a new expansion.</p><h2>The <em>Ace of Spades</em> Reboot Announcement</h2><p>According to a report <a href="https://icv2.com/articles/news/view/61522/inappropriate-cards-removed-upcoming-reboot-ace-spades" rel="nofollow">by ICV2</a>, the <em>Ace of Spades</em> reboot will be hitting retail stores on May 2026. The game will be identical to its original release from Gen Con 2025, with some material removed.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>That removed material are several cards depicting the enslavement of African-Americans. Said cards depicted artwork of an enslaved African American and a slaver. According to the designers, the intention was to invoke the Quentin Tarentino western film <em>Django Unchained</em> with the cards. Instead, audiences saw the cards as trivializing the institution of slavery in the American Wild West.</p><p>Devir Games did issue an apology for these cards, stopped all sales of the game, had retail copies recalled, designed new cards to replace the controversial ones, and issued them free of charge.</p><p>Now with the <em>Ace of Spades</em> reboot, this revised version of the game is coming back. As our <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/ace-of-space-review-shuffle-deal-draw" rel="nofollow">original review</a> mentioned, the game is a fun, Wild West spin on poker where winning, much like a gun duel, depends on the draw. The new version of the game will be sold at an MSRP of $24.99.</p><p>But this reboot isn't just a formal relaunch. Devir Games has also announced a new expansion for the game, <em>Ace of Spades: Call of the Zombie</em>. This expansion adds 15 new cards to the game, including zombie enemies and four versions of a boss zombie, called Hellbilly. Considering Rockstar Games' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/look-back-at-red-dead-redemptions-timeless-tale-of-john-marston" rel="nofollow"><em>Red Dead Redemption</em></a> and the TTRPG <em>Deadlands</em> have done this mash-up, it fits here.</p><p><em>Ace of Spades: Call of the Zombie </em>is available for pre-order on Devir Games' website. It is set to release on May 31, 2026, and will be sold at an MSRP of $9.99.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
