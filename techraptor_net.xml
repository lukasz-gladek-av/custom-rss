The latest take on the iconic game, Monopoly App Banking, is a radical departure from prior versions. It replaces paper play money with a Play Bank card and a smartphone app.</p>

<h2>The <em>Monopoly App Banking</em> board game announcement</h2>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/623716/hasbro-monopoly-app-banking-board-game-availability" rel="nofollow">The Verge</a>, <em>Monopoly App Banking</em> attempts to simplify gameplay by replacing the cash and banker with a free mobile app that handles all in-game transactions. Each player gets a token and a matching bank card. This card and any associated property cards, are scanned by the mobile app to automate transactions.</p>

Valuable properties like Park Place and Boardwalk are replaced with chocolate factories, VR rollercoasters, and dinosaur parks. Lastly, the app will contain mini-games that can be played to earn perks. According to the report, this is to help "hold the attention of younger players."</p>

<p>On paper, <em>Monopoly App Banking</em> is an attempt to bring its gameplay in line with a modern audience. The original experience is getting <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hasbro-has-big-plans-for-monopoly-in-2025-including-new-box-and-official-expansions" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official expansions</a> after all. However, the game is getting pushback from parents. As the New York Post highlights, parents use Monopoly as a teaching tool for their kids. The play money helps them understand basic math and fiscal responsibility..</p>

<p>Furthermore, the locations on the board being changed from conventional real estate into more fanciful properties has drawn some ire. Not only will kids not learn math or simple banking lessons, it is in service of buying not real-world investments like property but indulgent distractions like chocolate or amusement parks.</p>

<p>Lastly, there is the issue of technology being implemented into the board game. Certain board games are treated as an alternate for screen time with children. This new version of <em>Monopoly</em> not only requires it for play, it contains additional distractions with mini-games.</p>

<p><em>Monopoly App Banking</em> will be available this August at an MSRP of $24.99. The associated mobile app is free to download.</p>
