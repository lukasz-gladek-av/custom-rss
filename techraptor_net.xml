            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-psn-account-requirement-incentives<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has announced that it's walking back the mandatory PSN requirement for certain PlayStation games on PC, and what's more, you'll get in-game incentives for those titles if you do decide to link a PlayStation account.</p>

<p>In a PlayStation Blog <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/29/new-in-game-content-incentives-coming-to-playstation-games-on-pc/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, Sony says that beginning with the PC release of&nbsp;<em>Marvel's Spider-Man 2</em>&nbsp;- which is due to launch tomorrow - you'll get "more benefits to playing with an account for PlayStation Network" on PC.</p>

<p><em>Spider-Man 2</em>, as well as&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-system-requirements" rel="nofollow"><em>God of War Ragnarok</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered</em>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-esrb" rel="nofollow"><em>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</em></a>, will all be getting "in-game content unlocks" for PSN account users, and you won't be required to sign up for a PlayStation account to play them on PC.</p>

<p>You'll also get extra points "to activate bonus features and unlock extras" in&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered</em>, as well as a jacket for Ellie themed around Naughty Dog's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/naughty-dog-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet" rel="nofollow">upcoming&nbsp;<em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</em></a>.</p>

<p>Finally, in&nbsp;<em>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</em>, you'll get access to the Nora Valiant outfit. Of course, you will need to own all of these games on PC if you want these rewards; they're not forthcoming on PlayStation 5, since you need a PSN account to play on that console anyway.</p>

Sign up for a PSN account.</figcaption></figure><p>There is, of course, no mention of any multiplayer games losing their PSN account requirement; games like&nbsp;<em>Lego Horizon Adventures&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima&nbsp;</em>will still require a PSN account for their multiplayer components.</p>

<p>Curiously, it's also worth noting that a couple of single-player Sony PC releases, like&nbsp;<em>Horizon Forbidden West&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn</em>, won't offer any goodies for signing up to a PSN account.</p>

<p>This will, however, likely set a precedent whereby single-player PlayStation games will no longer require PSN accounts to use on PC. We'll have to wait and see whether that's the case for future PC releases. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Marvel Snap Developer to Self-Publish, Mostly, Following Unplanned Outage]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-snap-developer-to-self-publish-mostly-following-unplanned-outage.1094931/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-snap-self-published-skystone<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Marvel Snap&nbsp;</em>developer Second Dinner has announced that it will move "almost all" publishing responsibilities for the game in-house, with support from an external publisher.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1884400415925817429" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Second Dinner says that in order to ensure there's no repeat of the unplanned outage that saw the game go down for several hours earlier this month, "almost all operational and publishing responsibilities" will now be handled by Second Dinner itself.</p>

<p>The studio won't be going it alone, though; it'll be receiving support from US-based publisher <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/skystone" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Skystone Games</a>, whose name you might recognize from indie titles like&nbsp;<em>It Lurks Below</em>,&nbsp;<em>Spacelines from the Far Out</em>, and <i>Tyrant's Realm</i>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-snap-publisher-in-house-gameplay.jpg?itok=FeA5oA7e 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-snap-publisher-in-house-gameplay.jpg?itok=wwPh_W5F 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Marvel Snap&nbsp;</em>will now be self-published...sort of.</figcaption></figure><p>In case you need a reminder,&nbsp;<em>Marvel Snap&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-snap-back-online-dev-says-new-publisher" rel="nofollow">went offline earlier this month</a> when it was caught in the crossfire of an impending TikTok ban (which later turned out to be temporary after President Trump issued a 90-day reprieve for the app).</p>

<p>Following that outage, which Second Dinner called "a surprise", the developer vowed to find a new publisher for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Snap&nbsp;</em>"in order to make sure this never happens again".</p>

<p>There's seemingly no animosity between Second Dinner and current publisher Nuverse, either. The developer says the transition is happening "with the help of" Nuverse, and that the switch is "a full-team effort between Second Dinner, Nuverse, Skystone, and Marvel".</p>

<p>It's unclear what the new publishing arrangement will mean for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Snap&nbsp;</em>itself, but for now, it's likely going to be business as usual; the game is available once again via mobile storefronts, and its servers are back online as well.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Marvel Snap</em>, it's a card battler in which you collect and battle cards themed around Marvel superheroes.</p>

<p>The game is available to play right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1997040/MARVEL_SNAP/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, as well as on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nvsgames.snap" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/marvel-snap/id1592081003" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">iOS</a>. Stay tuned for more.</p>
