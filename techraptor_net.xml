            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/oblivion-remaster-officially-revealed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bethesda has finally officially revealed the long-mooted&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remaster, and more information about the game is coming tomorrow, although it's not clear whether the much-discussed shadowdrop will be happening.</p>

<p>In a&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/bethesda/status/1914341006188712023" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the official Bethesda X account, the studio simply says "tomorrow, 11am EST", pointing to links to the official Bethesda and Twitch channels. The post is accompanied by an image that includes an "IV" logo and the outline of an armored face.</p>

<p>It's pretty clear the post refers to the&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remaster;&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>is, after all, the fourth&nbsp;<em>Elder Scrolls&nbsp;</em>game, and the "IV" in the image looks the same as the one included as part of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-oblivion-remake-images-seemingly-leaked" rel="nofollow">a set of leaked images</a> depicting scenes and artwork from the remaster last week.</p>

<p>Rumors of the remaster have been swirling for some time, and the existence of the project was essentially <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/oblivion-remake-reportedly-confirmed" rel="nofollow">confirmed back in January</a>, when reports pointed to a mistakenly-uploaded website that included information about the game, as well as screenshots.</p>

<p>Following that, new images appeared on the website of developer Virtuos, which is widely believed to be the studio handling the project. Those images included pretty conclusive proof that the&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remaster is happening, including the aforementioned artwork that matches Bethesda's latest announcement.</p>

<p>Further leaks appeared earlier today when the file size of the remaster was supposedly <a href="https://xboxera.com/2025/04/21/oblivion-remastered-file-size-on-steam-datamined/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">datamined</a>, with reports suggesting the&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remaster will come in at a hefty 120GB. Better clear up some space on that SSD.</p>

<p>Either way, it looks like Bethesda's&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remaster is definitely happening. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valorant-mobile-revealed-china<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Riot Games has finally revealed&nbsp;<em>Valorant Mobile</em>, which is, as you'd probably expect, a mobile version of the popular FPS&nbsp;<em>Valorant</em>, and you can pre-register for it right now...but only if you're in China.</p>

<p>After a series of teaser trailers, Riot finally unveiled&nbsp;<em>Valorant Mobile&nbsp;</em>with an official debut trailer, a gameplay snippet, and an <a href="https://x.com/VALORANT/status/1914144559594172591" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>, in which the studio also reveals the game is a co-development effort with Tencent's LightSpeed Studios (also the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideaki-itsuno-lightspeed-studios" rel="nofollow">home of&nbsp;<em>Dragon's Dogma 2</em>'s Hideaki Itsuno</a>).</p>

<p>Riot and Lightspeed say that although the goal is to bring&nbsp;<em>Valorant Mobile&nbsp;</em>"to as many players as possible", the two are "starting in China and taking it from there", with further updates coming "as [their] plans develop further".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/valorant-mobile-revealed-china-gameplay.jpg?itok=X3zuMeOZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/valorant-mobile-revealed-china-gameplay.jpg?itok=GZZeB2Ma 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Valorant Mobile&nbsp;</em>has been officially revealed, but only for China (so far).</figcaption></figure><p>A mobile version of&nbsp;<em>Valorant&nbsp;</em>was actually revealed all the way back <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valorant-mobile" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">in 2021</a>, but save for a few teaser trailers showing off some of the Agents coming to the mobile version of the game, things have been pretty quiet on the news front since then.</p>

<p>When&nbsp;<em>Valorant&nbsp;</em>does hit mobile, you can expect it to feature a number of the same weapons, maps, and Agents as the main game, including the likes of Sage, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valorant-killjoy-reveal-brings-bots-to-riots-shooter" rel="nofollow">Killjoy</a>, and Cypher, among others. Of course, it's likely new Agents and other stuff will be added to the game once it's out.</p>

<p>Sadly, there's no release date or window for&nbsp;<em>Valorant Mobile&nbsp;</em>yet, but if you want, you can pre-register for the game <a href="https://valm.qq.com/main.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">via its official website</a>. Be aware that it's in Chinese, since the game is only intended for Chinese players at the moment.</p>




<p><em>Valorant&nbsp;</em>is just one of a number of games getting mobile spinoffs, and many of them are similarly focused on the Chinese market. Others include the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-mobile-revealed" rel="nofollow"><em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-outlanders-mobile-rpg" rel="nofollow"><em>Monster Hunter</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/destiny-mobile-spinoff-destiny-rising" rel="nofollow"><em>Destiny</em></a>, to name but a few.</p>

<p><em>Valorant Mobile&nbsp;</em>is in development right now and will hit mobile devices in China when it's released. The game is also available on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S <a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-gb/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">worldwide</a>.</p>
