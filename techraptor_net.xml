Each Commander deck will act as adaptations of a specific iconic <em>Final Fantasy</em> games:<em> Final Fantasy VI</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/final-fantasy-vii" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Final Fantasy VII</em></a>, <em>Final Fantasy X</em>, and the <em>Shadowbringers</em> arc of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></a>.</p>

<p>The release will feature over 100 iconic <em>Final Fantasy</em> characters with over 55 in special booster fun versions. These will be showcasing the influential artwork of several artists in the series including Yoshitaka Amano and Tetsuya Nomura. Those characters will feature in Borderless Character Cards, Borderless Woodblock Cards inspired by Japanese woodblock paintings, and Borderless <em>Final Fantasy</em> Artist cards.</p>

They include the prodigal knight Cecil. the existential threat known as Sin, the goofy Cactuar, and the iconic Moogle merchant.</p>

Examples include <em>Yuriko, the Tiger's Shadow</em> as <em>Yuffie Kisaragi</em> and <em>Ancient Copper Dragon</em> as <em>Final Fantasy I's</em> <em>Dragon of Mount Gulg</em>. Both of these cards feature the acclaimed work of Final Fantasy series' artists Yoshitaka Amano and Tetsuya Nomura. The Final Fantasy Through the Ages is a bonus sheet, so will be included in boosters in some form or another that is not yet specified.&nbsp; We have previously seen it in only collector boosters (planeswalkers in collector's boosters for <em>Bloomburrow</em>), multiple types in each play/draft booster (<em>Wilds of Eldraine</em>, and <em>March of the Machine</em>) as examples, and more.</p>

First is the return of Double-Faced Cards. Pay the mana cost on the front to play the card, then flip it when the required conditions are met.</p>

They cost a bit of mana and leave the battlefield after a fixed number of turns, but the investment may be worth it with the right combo.</p>

<p>Lastly, Wizards of the Coast will be releasing three <em>Final Fantasy</em> Secret Lair drops alongside the release of these Commander Decks. As for what those Secret Lairs will include, that remains to be seen.</p>

<p><em>Magic: The Gathering - Final Fantasy</em> will release on June 13, with the pre-release happening a week earlier.</p>
