            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher IO Interactive has announced what kind of PC specs you're going to need if you want to run the upcoming <em>007 First Light</em>, but there's something pretty obvious missing from its rundown.</p><p>You can see the official PC specs <a href="https://ioi.dk/hitman/news?panel=https%3A%2F%2Fioi.dk%2F007firstlightgame%2Fnews%2F2026%2F007-first-light-unveils-pc-specs-and-nvidia-collaboration" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">over on IO's website</a>, where you'll find a measly two presets, namely Minimum and Recommended. Notably, both appear to be targeting 1080p as their resolution and don't feature any tips on what you might need to get stable performance at 1440p or 4K.</p><p>Naturally, that doesn't mean your rig won't be able to handle <em>007 First Light </em>at higher resolutions (or, indeed, higher frame rates than 60fps), but it is a little strange that IO Interactive wouldn't include this information in its infographic.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>007 First Light</em>'s PC specs don't mention 1440p or 4K, which is a bit odd.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Thankfully, it looks like if you do want to run <em>007 First Light </em>at 1080p and maintain a stable 60fps, you won't need too beefy a rig to do so. Here are the two presets IO has announced for the game. Both require 64-bit installations of either Windows 10 or 11.</p><h3>Minimum (1080p at 30fps)</h3><ul><li>CPU: Intel Core i5-9500K or AMD Ryzen 5 3500</li><li>GPU: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660, AMD Radeon RX 5700, or Intel equivalent</li><li>RAM: 16GB</li><li>VRAM: 8GB</li><li>Storage: 80GB minimum</li></ul><h3>Recommended (1080p at 60fps)</h3><ul><li>CPU: Intel Core i5-13500 or AMD Ryzen 5 7600</li><li>GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti, AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT, or Intel equivalent</li><li>RAM: 32GB</li><li>VRAM: 12GB</li><li>Storage: 80GB minimum</li></ul>
<p>If you're not familiar with <em>007 First Light</em>, it's a stealthy action-adventure game from IO Interactive, the folks behind the <em>Hitman </em>series, and you can expect a similar blend of sneaking and high-octane thrills from the game.</p><p>Originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/007-first-light-release-date" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2642ca01-5e15-44ba-9ed9-26d9d752f67a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">slated for a March launch</a>, <em>007 First Light </em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/007-first-light-delayed-may-2026" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e0d84f2a-3cf3-41a8-9a3a-eb43f66bc545" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">delayed to May</a> just before Christmas, possibly in response to Rockstar revealing that industry powerhouse <em>Grand Theft Auto 6 </em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-november-2026" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e57d7053-b3ca-42ed-afdb-4ef5c5958b99" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">would be moved from May to November</a>.</p><p>When it does arrive, <em>007 First Light </em>will be available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3768760/007_First_Light/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/007-first-light/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/007-first-light/9PN198B459VB" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/007-First-Light-2792136.html" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Amazon has revealed more cast members for the upcoming <em>Tomb Raider </em>TV show, and there are more than a few legendary faces joining the series, including celebrated British actors like Jason Isaacs and Bill Paterson.</p><p>As revealed <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/entertainment/tomb-raider-prime-video-phoebe-waller-bridge-sophie-turner" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">by Amazon</a>, the show will include iconic <em>Tomb Raider </em>characters like Lara Croft's butler Winston, her uncle Atlas DeMornay (who you can meet as part of the so-called <em>Survivor Trilogy</em>), and Zip, who made his debut as part of the <em>Legend </em>sub-series.</p><p>DeMornay will be portrayed by Jason Isaacs, best known for roles like Lucius Malfoy in the <em>Harry Potter </em>movies and General Zhukov in <em>The Death of Stalin</em>. Winston, meanwhile, will be played by Bill Paterson, who you may know as <em>House of the Dragon</em>'s Lyman Beesbury or the father in <em>Fleabag</em>.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>A plethora of famous faces will be joining Amazon's <em>Tomb Raider </em>TV show.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>They're joined by screen legend Sigourney Weaver, who will be portraying "mysterious, high-flying woman" Evelyn Wallis, ostensibly a new character created for the show. Since Weaver is playing her, though, you can expect her to be a major player, and I'd be shocked if she wasn't the main antagonist of the series.</p><p>Another British icon joining <em>Tomb Raider </em>is Celia Imrie, who will play the British Museum's "Head of Advancement" Francine. She, according to Amazon, is "focused solely on raising funds and glasses of champagne".</p><p>Sadly, we still don't have a release date for the <em>Tomb Raider </em>TV show, but we do know it'll be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tomb-raider-live-action-series" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e3656d82-1a10-44f8-b35b-c2f90b2993db" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">headed up by <em>Fleabag</em>'s Phoebe Waller-Bridge</a> and that <em>Game of Thrones </em>star Sophie Turner <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazon-tomb-raider-lara-croft" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="8353268c-a5b7-45ad-b3ba-18b83eaad069" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">will be portraying Lara Croft</a>. Production for the show will begin on January 19th.</p><p>It's been all go in the world of <em>Tomb Raider </em>recently; not only is the show moving ahead at full pelt, but two - yes, two - new <em>Tomb Raider </em>games were announced during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-game-awards-2025-recap" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7f71e644-2289-45c0-a1c9-dc56c3797e8a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">this year's Game Awards</a>. One's a remake of the original <em>Tomb Raider</em> and the other is an all-new title.</p>
<p>We'll likely get more information about the <em>Tomb Raider </em>TV show, including a release date, later this year, and more details about the two aforementioned games will probably be forthcoming as well. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
