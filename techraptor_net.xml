<p>Continuing down the top ten, Capcom's <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>is in fourth place for 2025, which demonstrates <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-10m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3047bd12-37c9-4b65-bd39-064968be79fa" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">just how strong initial sales were</a> (even if things did start to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-ps5-barrier-capcom" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a0c5ff11-5fb9-4929-804b-8a8d4f7adae0" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">peter out after a few months</a>).</p><p>Fifth place goes to <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>, which may be a little worryingly low for Activision and Microsoft, especially since the game's biggest rival is in the top spot.</p><p>In sixth, seventh, and eighth place are three EA sports titles, namely <em>Madden NFL 26</em>, <em>EA Sports College Football 26</em>, and <em>EA Sports FC 26 </em>respectively, with the final two spots in the top ten taken up by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/oblivion-remastered-sales-circana-april-2025" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="64e25692-338e-455e-b91a-4b1b51fbb682" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">the <em>Oblivion </em>remaster</a> and <em>Black Ops 6</em>.</p><p>Hardware-wise, it probably won't come as a surprise to learn that the Switch 2 led the year in both unit and dollar terms; it's a new piece of Nintendo kit, after all, so there was almost no chance it was going to be outperformed by two five-year-old consoles (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-sales-wii-u-vita-dreamcast" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="91ebec60-06fa-4b54-b925-a0fb963092d1" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">almost being the operative word</a>).</p><figure role="group">

<p>Bellabel Park, which gives the Switch 2 Edition of <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder </em>the second half of its name (<em>Meetup in Bellabel Park</em>), will play host to a range of new multiplayer attractions and activities, both co-op and competitive.</p><p>If that's not your speed, then you can enjoy the new Toad Brigade Training Camp, where you'll find a range of new challenges to try out across <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em>'s many courses.</p><p>You'll also find new Koopaling bosses scattered throughout some of the game's stages, and to help you take them on, Rosalina has become a playable character in the Switch 2 version of the game (and I'm sure it's no coincidence <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-first-trailer" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fdabb138-30ed-426d-ae89-f5cf557b56fc" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">she's appearing</a> in the upcoming <em>Super Mario Galaxy Movie </em>as well).</p><p>Other new features include the mouse-controlled Co-Star Luma and the new Assist Mode, which lessens some of <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em>'s challenge and makes your journey just a little less stressful.</p>
<p><em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder </em>is available right now for <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/Super-Mario-Bros-Wonder-2404150.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch</a>, and it comes to <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/Super-Mario-Bros-Wonder-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-Meetup-in-Bellabel-Park-2915162.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Switch 2</a> on March 26th.
