            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-2m-embracer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Warhorse Studios' parent company Embracer Group has announced that the developer's medieval RPG&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>has "significantly outperformed" its expectations with regards to sales.</p>

<p>In its latest financial report (which covers the period between October and December 2024, but also features a look ahead to the next quarter), Embracer reveals that <i>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</i>is "fast approaching" two million sales.</p>

<p>That means the game has picked up another million sales between now and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-1m" rel="nofollow">its first day on release</a>, which would explain why Embracer considers the game to have exceeded its sales estimates. Those are impressive numbers, especially for what is arguably a non-triple-A game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-near-2m-fight.jpg?itok=Qa7ojw9I 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-near-2m-fight.jpg?itok=Fh-avwum 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>has "outperformed" Embracer's expectations for it.</figcaption></figure><p>Embracer says that it has a "strong belief" the medieval RPG will "continue to generate substantial revenues over the coming years", pointing to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-roadmap" rel="nofollow">"robust roadmap"</a> Warhorse Studios has in place for the game's next twelve months.</p>

<p>All in all, Embracer says it expects to enjoy a stronger fourth quarter thanks to both&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>and the impending release of&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/killing-floor-3-release-date" rel="nofollow">set for launch in March</a>.</p>

<p>However, it sounds like Early Access roguelike&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>didn't sell quite as well as Embracer was hoping for, since the company says its Q4 will be "slightly negatively impacted" by the game.</p>

<p>As a reminder,&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>launched into Early Access in January and was quickly met with a negative reception, with players pointing to problems with the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hyper-light-breaker-fixes-coming" rel="nofollow">performance and accessibility features</a>, as well as what some perceive to be odd or poor design decisions.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hyper-light-breaker-embracer-group.jpg?itok=xl2m0kkV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hyper-light-breaker-embracer-group.jpg?itok=l-zf5x-y 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>doesn't seem to have achieved the sales numbers Embracer would have liked.</figcaption></figure><p>With regards to its future, Embracer says that it currently has "10 AAA games under development, of which eight are from internal studios and two from external studios".</p>

<p>The company says this number doesn't include anything being released in the current quarter, so it sounds like games like&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</em>aren't part of that figure. The games in question are set to release over the next three fiscal years.</p>

<p>Embracer also points to its "exciting mid-sized releases" schedule, which includes games like the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gothic-1-remake-2025-release-window" rel="nofollow">long-awaited&nbsp;<em>Gothic 1 Remake</em></a>, ARPG&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest 2</em>, and the console release for&nbsp;<em>Satisfactory</em>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Next Diablo 4 Expansion Not Due Until 2026, Blizzard Says]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/next-diablo-4-expansion-2026-blizzard</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/next-diablo-4-expansion-not-due-until-2026-blizzard-says.1108410/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/next-diablo-4-expansion-2026-blizzard<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Blizzard has revealed that the next&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4&nbsp;</em>expansion won't be arriving until next year, so if you were hoping to play the followup to last year's&nbsp;<em>Vessel of Hatred&nbsp;</em>in 2025, you'll be disappointed, unfortunately.</p>

<p>That's according to&nbsp;<em>Diablo&nbsp;</em>general manager Rod Fergusson, who delivered the news during yesterday's DICE summit (thanks, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/diablo-4s-next-expansion-after-vessel-of-hatred-wont-come-until-2026" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">IGN</a>).</p>

<p>According to Fergusson, plans are in place to deliver a&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4&nbsp;</em>roadmap before Season 8, which is expected to land sometime in spring. The game's second expansion won't be on that roadmap, Fergusson says, "because our second expansion is coming in 2026".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/diablo-4-next-expansion-2026-gameplay.jpg?itok=ZvDTTg9w 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/diablo-4-next-expansion-2026-gameplay.jpg?itok=bmdcF_0_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Diablo 4</em>'s next expansion won't launch until 2026.</figcaption></figure><p>As IGN points out, Fergusson previously suggested that&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4&nbsp;</em>would be getting an expansion a year, making reference to "annual expansions" and "quarterly seasons" in an <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/diablo/diablo-4-gm-confirms-annual-expansions-for-the-game-2279389/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">interview</a> with Dexerto back in September 2023.</p>

<p>The fact that no&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4&nbsp;</em>expansion will be released in 2026 suggests that there's been a policy shift in that regard at Blizzard, although since Fergusson's reference to the expansion is fairly throwaway, he doesn't provide a concrete reason for the delay.</p>

<p>He did, however, say at the DICE talk that&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/diablo-4-expansion-vessel-of-hatred-announced-itll-come-in-late-2024-itll-be-even" rel="nofollow"><em>Vessel of Hatred&nbsp;</em>launched later</a> than Blizzard expected it to, so that could well imply that the company's whole schedule for expansion launches has shifted to accommodate that late launch.</p>

<p>In any case, you're going to be waiting at least another year or so for the next major&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4&nbsp;</em>expansion. The company still appears to be intending to release seasons on a quarterly basis, though, which is encouraging.</p>




<p><em>Diablo 4&nbsp;</em>is, as you've probably guessed, the fourth major installment in the&nbsp;<em>Diablo&nbsp;</em>series (although it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/diablo-immortal-new-class-tempest" rel="nofollow">not the fourth overall</a>). The game returns to the grittier, darker aesthetic of earlier&nbsp;<em>Diablo&nbsp;</em>games after&nbsp;<em>Diablo 3</em>'s shift towards a relatively lighter and more stylized aesthetic.</p>

<p>Back in June, it was revealed that the&nbsp;<em>Diablo&nbsp;</em>franchise had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/diablo-player-count-gta-5-sales" rel="nofollow">hit 100 million players</a>, although it's worth noting that's not equivalent to sales since it seems to include player counts for the free-to-play&nbsp;<em>Diablo Immortal</em>, as well as&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4</em>, which is available on Game Pass.</p>

<p><em>Diablo 4&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2344520/Diablo_IV/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/diablo-iv/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/games/store/diablo-iv/9NQRCD3W41L3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-game-about-digging-a-hole-sales-reach-250k-inside-a-week.1108362/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/a-game-about-digging-a-hole-sales-250k<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Viral indie sensation&nbsp;<em>A Game About Digging a Hole&nbsp;</em>has passed a major sales milestone within its first week on Steam, developer Cyberwave and publisher rokaplay Bou-tique have announced.</p>

<p>Since being released on February 7th (which is less than a week ago at time of writing),&nbsp;<em>A Game About Digging a Hole&nbsp;</em>has hit 250,000 sales, which isn't bad at all for a title "developed by a solo artist from Cyberwave...as a fun side project".</p>

<p>The game's success probably won't come as a surprise if you spend any time watching content creators on Twitch and other platforms. The studios claim&nbsp;<em>A Game About Digging a Hole&nbsp;</em>racked up "over 5 million views on TikTok, 2.2 million views on YouTube shorts, and...14.5 million views on Instagram Reels".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/a-game-about-digging-a-hole-sales-garden.jpg?itok=2ULmhNzY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/a-game-about-digging-a-hole-sales-garden.jpg?itok=w8LYrPZA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>A Game About Digging a Hole&nbsp;</em>has proven a runaway success.</figcaption></figure><p>Players seem pretty enamored with&nbsp;<em>A Game About Digging a Hole</em>&nbsp;on the, er, whole, too, with the game garnering a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3244220/A_Game_About_Digging_A_Hole/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Very Positive rating</a> on Steam across over 3,700 reviews at time of writing.</p>

<p>Positive reviews highlight the game's simplicity, lack of pretension, and strong Steam Deck support, so if those are things you're looking for in your next snack-size indie game, then this could well be one for you to try out.</p>

<p>Be aware, though, that some negative reviews point to&nbsp;<em>A Game About Digging a Hole</em>'s short length, and for some, the very simplicity praised by its adherents is enough to put them off. Caveat emptor, as they say.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>A Game About Digging a Hole</em>, it's probably one of the most self-descriptive games available on Steam right now. It is, in a very real sense, a game about digging a hole.</p>




<p>Bearing similarities to games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/minecraft" rel="nofollow"><em>Minecraft</em></a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<em>SteamWorld&nbsp;</em>series,&nbsp;<em>A Game About Digging a Hole&nbsp;</em>is simplicity itself: you must dig a hole. That's pretty much all there is to it!</p>

<p>As you dig, you can gather resources from the underground, using the money you get from selling them to upgrade your gear. There's also a story to discover, one that revolves around a "mysterious secret" you'll uncover as you dig deeper (literally).</p>

<p><em>A Game About Digging a Hole&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3244220/A_Game_About_Digging_A_Hole/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>. It's also set to come to consoles at some point in the future.</p>
