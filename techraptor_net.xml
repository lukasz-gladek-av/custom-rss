            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has announced the&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares III&nbsp;</em>release date, with the third installment in the spooky cinematic platformer series set to arrive in the most appropriate month for its release.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://x.com/LittleNights/status/1937588067579101399" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X,&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares III&nbsp;</em>will be arriving across PC and consoles on October 10th. Alongside news of the release date, the publisher also revealed that a Nintendo Switch 2 version of the game is on the way as well.</p>

<p>This third installment in the&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares&nbsp;</em>series was originally slated to launch in 2024, but <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/little-nightmares-3-delayed" rel="nofollow">in May last year</a>, Bandai Namco and developer Supermassive Games delayed the game to 2025 in order to give it "the care and love it deserves".</p>

<p>It's coming on the same day as&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares III</em>, but unlike that game, this one's not coming to the PS4 or the Xbox One, nor is it heading to the original Switch. You'll have to play it on current-gen machines.</p>

<p>For your trouble, though, you'll get enhanced visuals and performance, as well as "additional helpers" that have been added to give you an "overall better experience". Otherwise, though, it'll be the same&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares&nbsp;</em>you may already know and love, and if you don't, this seems like the perfect way to experience it.</p>




<p><em>Little Nightmares III&nbsp;</em>will revolve around two new characters, Low and Alone, who must work together with one another in order to escape a nightmarish realm known as the Nowhere.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check the game out when it launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1392860/Little_Nightmares_III/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/little-nightmares-3/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/little-nightmares-iii/9PMWB693ZK7X" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and both Nintendo Switch consoles on October 10th. That's also when the enhanced version of&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares&nbsp;</em>will launch.</p>
