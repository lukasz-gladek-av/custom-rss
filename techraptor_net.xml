            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/legend-in-mist-is-2025s-most-anticipated-tabletop-roleplaying-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Fans of TTRPGs have announced what they are looking forward to in 2025. The new year is rife with exciting TTRPG projects. Some are from beloved studios, and some are based on acclaimed properties. However, according to one survey, the most anticipated RPG is Son of Oak's <em>Legend in the Mist</em>.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.enworld.org/threads/here-are-2025s-most-anticipated-ttrpgs-as-voted-by-you.709410/" rel="nofollow">EN World's annual survey</a>, dedicated TTRPG fans gave the spotlight to 10 games they were most looking forward to in 2025.</p>

Son of Oak's successfully crowdfunded fantasy RPG made a splash on Kickstarter. The game, which uses the same underlying system as the urban fantasy TTRPG <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/off-shelf-city-of-mist-rpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>City of Mist</em></a>, made more than sixteen times its funding goal, concluding with over $855,000 raised.</p>

<p>This is an impressive accomplishment in popularity given the game's competition. <em>Legend in the Mist</em> beat out Darrington Press' highly anticipated <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/daggerheart-darrington-press-hotly-anticipated-ttrpg-is-now-available-for-pre-order" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Daggerheart</em></a>, Modiphius' adaptation of an acclaimed British author Terry Pratchett's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/discworld-board-games-coming-courtesy-of-modiphius-entertainment" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Discworld: Adventures in Ankh-Morpork</em></a>, and fantasy novelist Brandon Sanderson's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/brandon-sandersons-cosmere-rpg-kickstarter-raised-5-million-in-one-day" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Cosmere RPG</em></a>.</p>

<p>In addition, the other entries in the Most Anticipated TTRPG have established quality names. MCDM Productions' <em>Draw Steel</em>, their <a href="https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/mcdm-productions/mcdm-rpg" rel="nofollow">successfully crowdfunded</a> response to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/tabletop-developers-prepare-for-ogl-less-future" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">D&amp;D OGL</a> debacle. Free League Publishing's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/coriolis-great-dark-fully-funded-in-7-minutes-on-kickstarter" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Coriolis: The Great Dark</em></a> and <em>Alien: Evolved Edition</em>. Pelgrane Press' <em>13th Age Second Edition</em> and Necrotic Gnome's <em>Dolmenwood</em>. Even Paizo Inc's own <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/starfinder-second-edition-playtest-bundle-announced-by-paizo-and-humble-bundle" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/starfinder"><em>Starfinder: Second Edition</em></a> appears on this list.</p>

Characters don't have attributes but keywords, allowing background details and character traits to have in-game impacts on spells and weapons. In addition to the built-in character motivation and story arc system, the game can support tactical play, journeying, exploration, and just about any magic system,</p>

<p>Legend in the Mist is set to release digitally in Spring of 2025 with a physical release in Summer 2025.</p>
