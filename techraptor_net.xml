<p>As revealed in a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2246340/view/534345486851637348" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> earlier today, Capcom will unveil Title Update 1, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-1-april-announced" rel="nofollow">due to arrive sometime in April</a>, on March 25th. You can catch it at around 7am Pacific (that's about 10am Eastern and around 2pm GMT).</p>

<p>The showcase will see&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>producer Ryozo Tsujimoto revealing more about what's coming as part of Title Update 1, including returning monster Mizutsune, as well as "a host of other new additions", according to Capcom.</p>

<p>Just in case you're not familiar with it,&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>is the latest game in Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>series of action RPGs. The game features a more direct narrative focus than its predecessors, but at its core, it's still built around slaying monsters and using their parts to upgrade your gear.</p>

<p>The game has proven phenomenally popular since launch, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-8m" rel="nofollow">racking up eight million sales</a> in its first three days and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-steam-player-record" rel="nofollow">breaking records</a> for both the series and Capcom as a whole on Steam.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that it was released on the very last day of February,&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>instantly topped the month's chart for best-selling games <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/circana-us-sales-data-february-2025-monster-hunter-wilds" rel="nofollow">according to analyst firm Circana</a>, so it's safe to say Capcom has a hit on its hands (talons?) with this one.</p>




<p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' first Title Update showcase airs on March 25th at 7am Pacific (10am Eastern, 2pm GMT). You can buy the game right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/monster-hunter-wilds/9NMT6XFN0LVD" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and you can read <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/monster-hunter-wilds-review-new-frontier" rel="nofollow">our Tyler's review right here</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Split Fiction Movie Reportedly In the Works, Bidding War Underway]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/split-fiction-movie-reportedly-in-the-works-bidding-war-underway.1141371/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-movie-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report has emerged which claims that a&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>movie is in the works, and that several major Hollywood studios are already engaged in a bidding war over the rights to said movie.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/split-fiction-movie-video-game-adaptation-1236344367/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Variety</a>, media company Story Kitchen is currently scouting writers and directors, as well as cast members, for the project. You might also recognize Story Kitchen's name from the likes of the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/live-action-dredge-movie" rel="nofollow"><em>Dredge&nbsp;</em>movie</a>, which was announced last year, as well as the upcoming&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/it-takes-two-movie-and-tv-adaptations-in-works" rel="nofollow"><em>It Takes Two&nbsp;</em>movie adaptation</a>.</p>

<p>Citing "sources at the Game Developers Conference (GDC) in San Francisco", Variety says that a number of "top Hollywood studios" are currently making offers for the rights to the&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>movie, although it sounds like nothing has been decided yet.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/split-fiction-movie-report-barriers.jpg?itok=9mK7HXCQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/split-fiction-movie-report-barriers.jpg?itok=72JyqCAo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>movie adaptation is apparently in the works.</figcaption></figure><p>Given&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>'s close focus on gameplay, I'm having a bit of a hard time imagining how a movie would work; I can only imagine some of the game's uniqueness will be lost in the transition. Still, it's testament to&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>'s popularity that a movie adaptation is already underway.</p>

<p>Of course, the movie makes a lot of sense from a financial perspective, too. After all,&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>managed to reach <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">two million sales in a single week</a>, so creating more media based around the IP is sound logic.</p>

<p>It's the same logic that drove Story Kitchen to create the&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two&nbsp;</em>adaptation, and that game recently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hazelight-josef-fares-new-ip-it-takes-two-sales" rel="nofollow">passed the 20 million sales mark</a>. It just remains to be seen whether&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>'s gaming audience would also be interested in a non-interactive version of the story.</p>




<p>In case you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>, it's the latest co-op adventure from&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>A Way Out&nbsp;</em>developer Hazelight, led by Josef Fares.</p>

<p>The game casts you and your co-op buddy as Mio and Zoe, two writers who must learn to work together when they're thrust into a diabolical machine that threatens to steal all of their ideas.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2001120/Split_Fiction/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/split-fiction/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/games/store/split-fiction/9n1wxxd1rl8d" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.
