The tabletop giant has signed global rights for official Ticket to Ride movie and TV shows to the streaming platform, bringing even more potential cinematic board game adaptations.</p><p>According to an official press release, this Ticket to Ride movie and TV deal secures exclusive global rights to adapt the board game series into scripted and unscripted projects across film, TV, and additional formats.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>This deal is similar to another one struck by Asmodee and Netflix in October of 2025. That deal secured similar rights to another beloved Asmodee board game franchise, the resource-gathering social game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/netflix-catan-movie-and-tv-rights-secured-bringing-scavenging-and-diplomacy-to" rel="nofollow"><em>Catan</em></a>.</p><p>The press release confirms the first project under this deal will be an official <em>Ticket to Ride</em> movie. The film will be written by Ben Mekler (<em>Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts)</em> and Chris Amick (<em>Final Space</em>), and producers will include Asmodee's own Darren Kyman, Eric and Kim Tannenbaum, and Jonathan Levine and Gillian Bohrer.&nbsp;</p><p>This deal is another step in Netflix's more recent push for creating content out of recognizable board game IP. It aligns with deals to make streaming material out of the board game <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/clue-tv-show-has-been-greenlit-by-netflix" rel="nofollow"><em>Clue</em></a> and <em>Catan</em>. It's also consistent with already produced tabletop game movies and shows such as <em>Exploding Kittens</em> and <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/family_pack_2024" rel="nofollow"><em>Family Pack</em></a>, an adaptation of T<em>he Werewolves of Miller's Hollow</em>.</p><p>The Ticket to Ride movie deal with Netflix does raise the question: how would you adapt it. <em>Ticket to Ride</em> is a game where players compete to collect and connect various train routes through major cities, scoring points for completing routes. It's essentially a top-down competitive management experience, which is difficult to express in film which tends to err on human scale struggles.</p><p>There's also the fact that the importance of train routes and railways is very cultural and historical. Do you make it a period piece about the rise of the rail? If so, which country do you center on? Is the tone wondrous, in keeping with the board game's kid friendliness, or a more cynical take? Those are the challenges the screenwriters will need to address one way or another.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/riftbound-origins-review-tcg-with-movement-strategy-im-in" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="70845ca1-ba9b-48fd-ae51-be30d1b4ed06" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>League of Legends</em> TCG</a> has now released its second set, expanding the number of Legends from <em>LoL</em> that you can let lead your deck alongside additional new mechanics. In our review of <em>Riftbound Spiritforged</em>, we'll take a look at some of the new mechanics and how they'll power a deck along with the new <em>Spiritforged </em>keywords and how they shift the battlefield.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><em>Spiritforged </em>Equipment</h2><p dir="ltr">Equipment is a new type of gear card that has been added to <em>Spiritforged</em>. This Gear has a cost to be played, but then an additional cost to be equipped to your units.</p><p dir="ltr">Equipment opens up a whole new level of augmentation in <em>Riftbound </em>letting you take fighters that might have not quite been viable, but give them a chance to have their Might boosted or alter other elements of the card.</p><p dir="ltr">Equipment can give a Unit a few more Might to help them on the battlefield, additionally you can have equipment that will turn a Unit into a different type such as a mech. This kind of augmentation is extremely important for decks like the Rumble Champion Deck.</p><picture>

              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riftbound-spiritforged-set-review-equipment.jpg?itok=AQSwl3us 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p dir="ltr">I've gotten lost early on in a number of TCG because of how quickly new elements are added, and how quickly it invalidates any of the older cards. With equipment, not only are all cards getting an upgrade, but the changes that equipment can have on a card also open up a variety of possibilities where cards that wouldn't be viable before are now able to be played.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><em>Spiritforged </em>New Keywords</h2><p dir="ltr">Five different Keywords have been added with <em>Spiritforged</em>. These expand the kinds of effects that cards will have as you play them, by keywording them they're faster to understand and respond to.</p><p dir="ltr">The first new Keyword is Echo, you'll see these appear on spell cards. The effect of Echo is that you can repeat the effect of a spell by paying an additional cost that's listed on the card. This is an easy way to let a spell have a standard level of effect in the early game, but as you build up more Runes, you're able to unleash more havoc with them as the game goes on.</p><p dir="ltr">In my few games playing with the effect, I loved the versatility of these cards and that by using them at different scales, you could do more or less with your turn. It wasn't a spell that was useful at the beginning of the game, but not impactful by the end of the game, and it also wasn't a card that felt useless in my hand if drawn too early.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riftbound-spiritforged-set-review-unique.jpg?itok=YVkI-bjN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p dir="ltr">The second new Keyword is an interesting one, Unique. This card effect means that you can only have a single copy of the card in your deck. This effectively moved what other TCG might call a Restricted list into the Keywording on the card itself. It has the dual effect of meaning a player won't need to know the ins and outs of a ban-list to know if they've built their deck legally, alternatively a card with Unique as a Keyword is certain to immediately catch a player's eye, as they might come up with a strategy to unleash this powerful card.</p><p dir="ltr">The final three new Keywords that were introduced in <em>Riftbound Spiritforged</em> have to do with the new Equipment type; Quick-Draw, Equip, and Weaponmaster.</p><p dir="ltr">Equip has you simply paying the listed cost to attach a piece of equipment to a Unit, Quick-Draw lets that equipment as a reaction, attaching it to a unit you control immediately. These are keywords that define how to activate and equip your equipment.</p><p dir="ltr">The Weaponmaster Keyword is one that you'll find on Units. This lets you summon a unit and then attach equipment to it immediately, whether it's in your base or attached to a different unit for one recycle less than the cost listed on the card.</p><picture>

  </picture><p dir="ltr">I am a big fan of the equipment mechanic, but also the different speeds you can implement for getting Equipment on the field, and in the hands of your Units. It was also incredibly helpful that, outside of playing and equipping these cards normally, you could either have it react faster with an ability of the equipment or an ability of a Unit. This gives a healthy level of flexibility when building your deck around equipment and how to best get it onto your field.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How Has <em>Riftbound </em>Evolved?</h2><p dir="ltr">The aspect of Spiritforged that I think I'm most excited about is that elements have been added to the game, adding powerful but Unique cards and involving equipment to augment your current cards, but overall it hasn't invalidated the <em>Riftbound </em>cards from the initial set.</p><p dir="ltr">So often I watch new TCG sets release where a new set means everything prior is out sped or overpowered by new cards coming out.<em> Riftbound Spiritforged</em> feels like it has instead elevated the whole game, meaning you can take your old deck and make slight changes and bring it into competition with the latest cards instead of having to completely remix your approach to the game.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2 dir="ltr"><em>Riftbound Spiritforged</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2><p dir="ltr"><em>Riftbound Spiritforged</em> is an evolution of the formula. There are more Legends, and more permutations on how you can approach building a deck with new mechanics, but nothing you previously had is left in the dust.</p><p dir="ltr">If you want to continue to play your favorite deck and Legend, you can use this set to introduce Equipment to have them hit harder, or substitute cards in with new abilities without invalidating all of the cards you already own.</p><p dir="ltr">The flip side of this is that there really are so many different Legends with different abilities that if there wasn't a strategy that was previously speaking to you, there probably is now.</p><p dir="ltr">The biggest issue I still have with pulling booster packs of Riftbound is how few Runes you receive, and how many Battlegrounds you get instead. Especially when trying to start your initial Rune collection it can be rough to see so few come out of packs.</p><hr><p><em><strong>Riftbound Spritforged was reviewed with cards provided by the publisher</strong></em></p></div><div><p><span><div>
