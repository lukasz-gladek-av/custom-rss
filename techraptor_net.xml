            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has announced a new PlayStation State of Play showcase, which will bring over half an hour of new info about upcoming PlayStation titles.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/23/state-of-play-returns-this-wednesday-september-24/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation Blog post</a>, the next State of Play will air tomorrow at 5pm Eastern (that's 2pm Pacific and around 10pm GMT). Sony is promising "more than 35 minutes of reveals and news from developers around the world".</p>

<p>In particular, Sony says the State of Play will spotlight Housemarque's mysterious&nbsp;<em>Saros</em>, which was first revealed during a State of Play event <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-state-of-play-recap-february-2025" rel="nofollow">back in February</a>. Sony is promising an "extended look" at&nbsp;<em>Saros</em>, including "nearly five minutes of gameplay".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/state-of-play-september-2025-saros.jpg?itok=JseT5F5Q 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/state-of-play-september-2025-saros.jpg?itok=hVLyLvF1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>We'll hopefully learn what the heck is going on in this shot during tomorrow's State of Play.</figcaption></figure><p>Sony is remaining tight-lipped about what else we can expect from the State of Play tomorrow, but if I were a betting man, I'd put my money on <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/marvels-wolverine" rel="nofollow">Insomniac's&nbsp;<em>Wolverine</em>&nbsp;game</a>, from which we have not heard in many a year.</p>

<p>The game was originally announced back in 2021, but since then, Insomniac and Sony have been very quiet about it, save for confirming that it'll be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/insomniacs-wolverine-confirmed-to-be-set-in-same-earth-1048-universe-as-marvels-spider" rel="nofollow">set in the same universe</a> as&nbsp;<em>Spider-Man 2</em>&nbsp;(the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/marvels-spider-man-2" rel="nofollow">more recent one</a>, not the PS2 classic).</p>

<p>Of course, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/insomniac-games-ransomware-attack-report" rel="nofollow">major cyberattack</a> back in December 2023 probably didn't help Insomniac's development process, although the studio did <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/insomniac-games-officially-reacts-to-criminal-cyberattack-marvels-wolverine-will" rel="nofollow">subsequently reveal</a> that its game will "greatly evolve" from the development build that was leaked during that attack.</p>

<p>As for what else we might see from the State of Play show, we may well get a new&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>release date following that game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shocking-no-one-bungies-marathon-delayed" rel="nofollow">delay back in June</a>, and Naughty Dog might reveal more about its upcoming title&nbsp;<em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</em>, although I wouldn't hold my breath for that.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[HoYoverse Reveals First Teaser for Mysterious New Game Petit Planet]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hoyoverse-petit-planet-teaser</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hoyoverse-reveals-first-teaser-for-mysterious-new-game-petit-planet.1305354/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>developer HoYoverse has revealed a teaser for another new game, and this one looks to have a decidedly more cozy bent to it than the studio's previous efforts.</p>

<p>Just a few weeks after unveiling <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hoyoverse-honkai-nexus-anima" rel="nofollow">creature-collecting autochess game&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Nexus Anima</em></a>, HoYoverse has updated the <a href="https://x.com/petitplanetgame" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">social media account</a> for something by the name of&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet</em>, and while details are sparse, the art style and general vibe feels very&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing</em>-esque.</p>

<p>For one thing, the new artwork depicts two extremely cuddly-looking creatures with massive smiles on their faces, which means <i>Petit Planet&nbsp;</i>is probably either a cozy game or a deeply disturbing horror experience masquerading as cozy. My money's on the former, but my heart hopes for the latter.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hoyoverse-petit-planet-critter.jpg?itok=zmBv3wvb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hoyoverse-petit-planet-critter.jpg?itok=fy4VIS_g 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This little guy heralds the announcement of&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet</em>, it seems.</figcaption></figure><p>In the new teaser trailer, we can see the cute little fluffball from the new&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet&nbsp;</em>artwork hopping around a grove that looks extremely reminiscent of&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing</em>, complete with rounded trees and a tiered waterfall.</p>

<p>Honestly, that's pretty much all there is right now, but it's likely that HoYoverse is gearing up for a big&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet&nbsp;</em>announcement, so perhaps we'll get more info about the game in the coming weeks. We can certainly hope so.</p>

<p>If&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet&nbsp;</em>is indeed a cozy life sim-style game, then it will mark a further branching out from HoYoverse's typical RPG slant; its three main exports, namely&nbsp;<em>Zelda</em>-esque&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/genshin-impact" rel="nofollow"><em>Genshin Impact</em></a>, turn-based battler&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/honkai-star-rail" rel="nofollow"><em>Honkai: Star Rail</em></a>, and character action extravaganza&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/zenless-zone-zero" rel="nofollow"><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em></a>, are all various flavors of gacha RPG.</p>

<p>Of course, there's nothing to say&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet&nbsp;</em>won't have gacha mechanics as well, and if I know HoYoverse, it almost certainly will. Still, it looks like it'll offer a completely different gameplay style to prior studio titles, so that's something to look forward to.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hoyoverse-petit-planet-genshin-impact.jpg?itok=Xjhk9ijo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hoyoverse-petit-planet-genshin-impact.jpg?itok=0HR981aE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Petit Planet&nbsp;</em>could mark a big departure from HoYoverse's usual style.</figcaption></figure><p>We'll have to wait a little while to learn more about&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet</em>, but for now, it looks like it's safe to get excited if you were hoping for a HoYoverse cozy game. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sony's New Franchise Rewards Program Isn't Quite What It Sounds Like]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-franchise-rewards-program</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sonys-new-franchise-rewards-program-isnt-quite-what-it-sounds-like.1305300/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has announced a brand new rewards program by the name of Franchise Rewards, and while it pledges to reward you for your in-game achievements with real goodies, things are a little more complicated than that.</p>

<p>The new program was revealed in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/23/ghost-of-tsushima-players-can-now-unlock-special-ghost-rewards-merchandise-for-purchase/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation Blog post</a>, in which director Katie Lennox describes it as "a new merchandise program that celebrates your in-game achievements with special collectibles". Franchise Rewards kicks off with the&nbsp;<em>Ghost&nbsp;</em>games, starting with&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>.</p>

<p>To qualify for the program, you'll need to have earned one or both of two trophies: the Gold trophy Mono no Aware and the Platinum trophy Living Legend. Having these trophies gets you "access to a selection of limited-edition merchandise".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ghost-of-tsushima-franchise-rewards-t-shirt.jpg?itok=XyNHrTBY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ghost-of-tsushima-franchise-rewards-t-shirt.jpg?itok=1aXcua6i 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>How would you like the opportunity to buy exclusive Sony merchandise?</figcaption></figure><p>A quiet alarm bell might be ringing in your head as you read those words, and you're right to heed it: this program only allows you the right to buy certain new merchandise, not to get it for free if you earn these trophies.</p>

<p>Obtaining the Mono no Aware trophy, which you can get just for completing&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>'s main story, will get you "access" to the corresponding Mono no Aware T-shirt, for which you'll have to cough up an additional $30, plus shipping.</p>

<p>Achieving the Living Legend trophy, meanwhile, which requires you to have obtained all other&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima&nbsp;</em>trophies (and that's no mean feat), will allow you to buy a special commemorative pin for $25. Again, that's without shipping factored in.</p>

<p>Of course, if you have both trophies, then Sony will gracefully allow you to give the company more of your money for both pieces of merchandise. Hey, don't say Sony never does anything nice for you.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ghost-of-tsushima-franchise-rewards-pin.jpg?itok=CWk1Gi2X 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ghost-of-tsushima-franchise-rewards-pin.jpg?itok=17V4Oyqs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Want to earn the right to buy this pin? You'll have to spend a heck of a lot of time with&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>If you do want to grab either of these items, you'll need to earn their corresponding trophies by December 31st this year. If you're playing on PC, you'll need to have linked your PlayStation account for Sony to recognize your achievements.</p>

<p>Sony says that these&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima&nbsp;</em>goodies are "just the start", which sounds vaguely threatening. The Franchise Rewards program will continue with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ghost-of-yotei-release-date" rel="nofollow">October's&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yotei</em></a>, for which more "unique merchandise" will apparently be released.</p>

<p>The announcement of Sony's Franchise Rewards initiative comes after the company announced it would shut down the PlayStation Stars loyalty program <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-shutting-down-playstation-stars" rel="nofollow">back in May</a>, although I'm not sure too many people will see this as a worthy replacement. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/trails-in-sky-1st-chapter-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-review-a-brilliant-return-to-form-for-legendary-jrpg-series.1305270/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>All great and epic adventures begin with a magical yet compelling story that captivates audiences for years to come. This narrative is certainly applicable to Falcom's epic fantasy JRPG,&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Heroes VI: Trails in the Sky</em>, which, after a 21-year-long wait, fans and new players alike can experience in this game's remake,&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</em>.</p>

<p><em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</em> has been remade from scratch on its more advanced game engine for modern audiences and hardware, but it never loses its fantastic story with a few new additions and optimizations for a more complete experience. Suffice to say, revisiting its original game and playing the remake demo before delving into the full game made reviewing&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</em>&nbsp;a more rewarding and worthwhile experience long after the credits roll.</p>

<h2><em>Trails In The Sky 1st Chapter</em> Review - Starting At The Beginning Again</h2>

<p>Video game remakes and remasters have become quite prominent in recent years as they attract both returning players for yet another magical in-game experience, while welcoming new audiences to their world. While at times, most of the game's remake remains the same from its story, intriguing characters, and gameplay systems, much of its upgrades boil down to updated modern graphics, introducing new quality-of-life improvements to enhance our gaming experiences, fix mistakes that weren't possible, and implement a few new tweaks for a more complete offering.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/trails_in_the_sky_1st_chapter_screenshot_461_young_joshua.jpg?itok=tVa9PHuA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/trails_in_the_sky_1st_chapter_screenshot_461_young_joshua.jpg?itok=HWJsURqB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>As much as there's plenty of mystery surrounding future events, what do we know about Joshua and his past? (Picture: Falcom / Ashleigh Klein)</em></figcaption></figure><p>This sentiment is quite true for developer Falcom, as they've finally brought a more polished and complete offering of&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</em>, a remake of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/how-to-get-into-trails-series-nihon-falcom" rel="nofollow">the Trails series</a>' first entry,&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Heroes VI: Trails in the Sky</em>, 21 years after its initial release. Admittedly, not having the pleasure nor distinction of being introduced to this legendary JRPG series, the journey and moments experienced with its remake became more profound after first experiencing the original release on PC and then the remake's demo before immersing oneself in what can be viewed as one of the most faithful remakes in quite some time.</p>

<p>Granted, time was not on one's side when experiencing both&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Heroes VI: Trails in the Sky</em> and&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</em>, but this little side adventure exploring its original release before revisiting the kingdom&nbsp;of Liberl became a good choice to make consciously. The story of&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</em> remains the same as its original release, albeit with a few new quality-of-life improvements, balance changes, and other new content reimagined for modern hardware.</p>

<h2>Welcome Back Home, Bracers!</h2>

<p>As with all great stories, we start at the beginning with one of our protagonists, Estelle Bright, a doting yet energetic young girl awaiting the arrival of her father, Cassius, and following his return, her father introduced her to a young, injured boy of the same age as Estelle. The game's events officially begin with its Prologue Chapter, now set five years later, and both Estelle and the&nbsp;young, injured boy named Joshua are now 16 years old and training to become bracers, a "peacekeeping guild" tasked with serving all the people across its world by assisting with various jobs, much like their father.</p>

<p>However, Cassius had some news to share with his children as he got called out to a pressing matter to attend to, departing Rolent aboard an orbal ship which mysteriously goes missing along with its passengers some time later. This stressful news prompted Estelle, Joshua, and&nbsp;Scherazard to begin and lead a separate investigation into its disappearance in a neighboring city, where the strings slowly start to unravel.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/trails_in_the_sky_1st_chapter_screenshot_536_estelle_shocked_face.jpg?itok=WvuhBOZA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/trails_in_the_sky_1st_chapter_screenshot_536_estelle_shocked_face.jpg?itok=5aCAxIF9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>We're thinking the exact same thing, Estelle! (Picture: Falcom / Ashleigh Klein)</em></figcaption></figure><p>The siblings learns of a&nbsp;conspiracy that threatens the peace of this kingdom, and the discoveries Estelle and Joshua uncover could ultimately change their lives forever. Through game progression, Estelle and Joshua will have opportunities to explore the remaining regions, and as such, meet new acquaintances, accept more jobs, gain more in-field experience as bracers, acquire recommendations, and unravel mysteries surrounding their father.</p>

<p>New improvements, balance changes, and optimizations were included in&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</em>; however, one new improvement made was to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xseed-explains-trails-in-sky-localization-changes" rel="nofollow">the localization</a>, an issue many players had with the original game leading up to the remake's release. However, having played through the game with English voiceovers, they will be happy to learn that this isn't an issue, especially having played&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Heroes VI: Trails in the Sky</em> before jumping into the remake and boasting a talented voice cast that provides incredible performances and yes, evoke a myriad of emotions or make you even more annoyed with them.</p>

<p>The game's mini-map also saw some notable tweaks that make it easier for players to track quest markers, pinpoint Treasure Chests, and indicate enemies within their vicinity. The world map also received much-needed changes by adding more Points of Interest, such as city locales, quest events, and side quests, which are clearly displayed in both the mini-map and world map changes, improving navigation as a whole, and not making it an annoyance to bear.</p>

<h2>Combat Is An Orbment Of Time (And Fun)</h2>

<p><em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</em> offers players a more seamless approach to combat as they can opt between&nbsp;turn-based and real-time combat, and can be finetuned by choosing their preferred difficulty on how they wish to engage with the story and combat. Real-time combat&nbsp;is best utilized against single&nbsp;and common enemies, especially while traveling in the overworld, without ever entering into&nbsp;turn-based combat, and regarding the latter, this is more prevalent during the main story and side quests or against larger and imposing enemies.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/trails_in_the_sky_1st_chapter_screenshot_574_orbment_setup.jpg?itok=lRCsm79W 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/trails_in_the_sky_1st_chapter_screenshot_574_orbment_setup.jpg?itok=79Y9GXru 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Orbment system menu where players can slot Sepith and Quartz to empty slots to enhance their character's stats, passive effects and more. (Picture: Falcom / Ashleigh Klein)</em></figcaption></figure><p>As with most turn-based games, once entering the turn-based combat mode, a timeline will appear on-screen which gives information on the turns of each party member and enemy, which can be altered thanks to a myriad of abilities, buffs, and debuffs inflicted. For example, specific attacks that apply the Delay effect prevent enemies from attacking on their turn, which is present in tactical abilities, S-Crafts, and Quartz equipped for certain characters like Joshua and his Flicker ability, thus manipulating the timeline and giving the party an advantage over their enemies.</p>

<p>Now, one key component to the remake's combat is the Orbment system, which was introduced when playing the original game and was somewhat confusing to understand at first, despite the original game doing its best to explain Orbments. Nevertheless, an Orbment is a mechanical device that allows players to equip Sepith and later Quartz to empty slots and imbue them with orbal energy, and once activated, it grants the particular character to utilize unique orbal abilities, acquire bonus stats, and passive effects that can be useful in combat.</p>

<p>As every party member will get their base level increase through progression and gain increased stats, equipment pieces like armor and accessory items also provide this, like increased defense and arts defense. Similarly, weapons and their upgrades increase the equipped character's strength and arts strength stats to deal more physical and non-physical/magical damage, which can contribute to building their party members.</p>

<p>For example, Agate can be built to deal more physical damage and can absorb incoming enemy attacks, so building him with the best synergistic orbments to provide increased physical damage, and adding some defense to make him a tanky character. In comparison, Joshua is very agile in combat, so he'll require orbments and equipment pieces to buff his speed to inflict damage and debuffs onto enemies very quickly.</p>

<h2><em>Trails In The Sky 1st Chapter</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/trails_in_the_sky_1st_chapter_screenshot_563_drunk_schera_olivier.jpg?itok=cRqVpEgd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/trails_in_the_sky_1st_chapter_screenshot_563_drunk_schera_olivier.jpg?itok=OmF5_IzA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Over two decades is certainly a wait for developer Falcom to finally reimagine one of their most legendary entries in the Trails series. (Picture: Falcom / Ashleigh Klein)</em></figcaption></figure><p>21 years is quite certainly a wait for the first entry in the Trails series to receive a massive update, and&nbsp;during the review process, there was very little to nitpick about&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</em> aside from the occasional latency bugs in cutscenes, which one that occured was in Chapter 1 before speaking with General Morgan and again in another cutscene when Olivier sang his tune both at the&nbsp;at Haken Gate location. Likewise, as faithfully recreated as&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</em> is, and adding new voicelines, gameplay improvements, and balance changes, it doesn't add new quests for returning players to explore, which is rather unfortunate.</p>

<p>But regardless of a few things to nitpick about,&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</em> is significantly longer than the original game, according to <a href="https://www.gamer.ne.jp/news/202508090001/" rel="nofollow">a report from Japanese publication Gamer</a>. In fact, this is due to the addition of more exploration, as players will spend more time exploring areas, completing all the main story, event, and side quests, as well as paying attention to the voiceover lines, which helped eliminate some text bloating from the original game.</p>

<p>However, the time spent with both the original game and its remake was a worthwhile experience, as the remake was well-executed in being a more polished and enjoyable entry in the Trails series and a great choice to introduce new players. It's obvious just how much love went into developing&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</em>, as there's something for everyone to enjoy, and the end product is a brilliant remake that wears its heart on its sleeve and is truly earnest in its origins in the best way possible.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>developer Pocketpair has announced&nbsp;<em>Palfarm</em>, a cozy spinoff of the creature-collecting survival game that promises to offer a more relaxing and cozy spin on the original game's premise.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/4031890/view/539991294395549848" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam announcement</a>,&nbsp;<em>Palfarm</em>, or something very much like it, was something that "many players requested" following the initial release of <i>Palworld</i>. That game's fans told Pocketpair they wanted "a more relaxing and cozy adventure" in the&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>...erm, world.</p>

<p>Pocketpair says that after "thinking it over for a few months", the idea for&nbsp;<em>Palfarm&nbsp;</em>was born. It won't be developed by the core&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>team; instead, a new team of developers will be working on the game, although it'll still be a Pocketpair project rather than a third-party endeavor.</p>

It promises to show a "more peaceful" side of the game's world, so hopefully, no Pals will be forced into slavery or killed for meat here.</p>

<p>You'll be moving to an idyllic island populated by Pals, and alongside your new friends, you'll till fields, cook delicious recipes, and craft new items, all to "build the farm of your dreams", according to Pocketpair.</p>

<p>Pals all have unique abilities, each of which can help you on your farm in different ways; some Pals might be able to help you with crop harvesting, for instance, while others are dab hands (or flippers, or paws) at watering.</p>

<p>Of course, this being a cozy game, you can also meet up with the local residents and give them gifts to build your relationship with them, and Pocketpair says you "may discover unexpected, special stories unfolding".</p>




<p>It's not all peace and love, though; you will also be called upon to "defend your farm from some nasty Pals that come to wreak havoc", so it seems Pocketpair hasn't completely shaken its bloodlust with&nbsp;<em>Palfarm</em>.</p>

<p><em>Palfarm&nbsp;</em>might not even be the only&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>spinoff currently in development; there's also&nbsp;<em>Palworld: More than Just Pals</em>, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-dating-sim-announced-again" rel="nofollow">dating sim that might be an elaborate April Fools' joke</a>. I'm not sure if I'd rather it was or it wasn't.</p>

<p>The announcement of&nbsp;<em>Palfarm&nbsp;</em>also comes just a week or so after Pocketpair announced that&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>'s 1.0 update <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-10-2026-surprises-2025" rel="nofollow">will launch in 2026</a>, bringing lots of new goodies with it.</p>

<p>We don't have a release date for&nbsp;<em>Palfarm&nbsp;</em>yet, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4031890/Palworld_Palfarm/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wishlist the game on Steam right here</a> if you want to. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>-related.</p>
