            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Digixart, the studio behind <em>Road 96</em>, has announced that its upcoming adventure game <em>Tides of Tomorrow</em> has been delayed until April in order to afford the studio some extra development time.</p><p>Announcing the news in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2678080/view/493840283288472148" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a post on Steam</a>, Digixart says it wants to "take a little extra time before launch" alongside publisher THQ Nordic, suggesting (with tongue firmly in cheek) that the delay caused them to consider renaming the game to <em>Tides of the Day After Tomorrow</em>.</p><p>The studio doesn't provide any more in-depth reason for the delay than that, but it's likely that, just like other game delays, things aren't quite where they need to be with <em>Tides of Tomorrow </em>right now, hence the need for some extra time to polish and finish off the game.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Tides of Tomorrow </em>won't make its February release date.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The delay won't affect <em>Tides of Tomorrow</em>'s playable demo, however, so it's unlikely that anything will be significantly changing in terms of direction between now and the new release date of April 22nd.</p><p>If you're not familiar with <em>Tides of Tomorrow</em>, it's the next game from Digixart, the studio responsible for road trip adventure <em>Road 96</em>, which our very own Will <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/road-96-review" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="24ceeade-3c31-41f5-9bd2-d997ce525392" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">wasn't too impressed with</a> when it launched back in 2021.</p><p>This time around, Digixart has opted for an adventure that takes place in a world devastated by an event known as the Great Flood. You'll need to explore that world and deal with its denizens in order to combat a "deadly plastification" that threatens to end the world as you know it.</p><p><em>Tides of Tomorrow</em>'s unique gimmick is the ability to follow your friends (and, apparently, your favorite streamers) on their own adventures throughout the world of Elynd, watching what they do and having your story shaped by their actions.</p>
<p>You'll be able to check out <em>Tides of Tomorrow </em>when it launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2678080/Tides_of_Tomorrow/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a> (where a demo is currently available), <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10015068" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PS5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/tides-of-tomorrow/9nvsc8dxskrs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a> on April 22nd.

Suffice it to say that <em>RuneScape </em>at the end of 2026 should look a lot different to how it looks today.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>RuneScape</em>'s 25th anniversary is shaping up to be special.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In April, player character avatars will be completely updated, with features like models, animations, and hairstyles getting an overhaul. More updates will be introduced "based on community feedback" as well.</p><p>You'll gain more control over your house this year, too, allowing you to build a space that "feels personal, welcoming, and worth visiting", according to Jagex. The Construction skill will increase to 120, and you'll get a new recipe system that lets you unlock and build new furniture.</p><p>It's not all tweaks to existing systems and features, though. <em>RuneScape </em>is also getting "the largest area expansion" in its history in the form of Havenhythe, which will be arriving "in multiple parts throughout the year".</p><p>Havenhythe is a "progressively vampiric" area that brings new quests, new early-game bosses, and a new level cap for your Hunter skill, with new story and boss content also arriving later in the year.</p>
<p>News of <em>RuneScape</em>'s overhaul comes after Jagex <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/jagex-layoffs" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="611f0a88-3fdc-4d5c-a015-22d2ff230293" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">laid off a number of employees</a> back in June in order to "increase agility", although the studio clarified that the "vast majority" of those layoffs were in "non-game development and non-player-facing functions".</p><p>You can check out <em>RuneScape </em>for free right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1343400/RuneScape/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC via Steam</a>, as well as on mobile devices.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Scottish police and fire crews have been called to Rockstar North's Edinburgh HQ to respond to reports of an explosion, an incident that police describe as "ongoing".</p><p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/explosion-reported-at-rockstar-north-studio-as-police-cordon-off-gta-development-building-3306152/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dexerto</a>, the explosion was reported at around 5am local time today, with a spokesperson confirming that the call resulted in the mobilization of "three pumps and four of our specialist appliances".</p><p>At time of writing, the incident hasn't been closed yet; Edinburgh fire and police services are still on the scene "with other agencies", although specialist fire crews departed around four hours after the fire began. Additionally, there have been "no reported casualties", so thankfully, it sounds like nobody's been hurt.</p><figure role="group">

<p>At present, it's thought that the explosion was caused by some kind of boiler issue; Dexerto says that "reports from the area" point to a boiler room as the source of the blast, so it sounds as though the damage was accidental, although it's hard to say this early on.</p><p>Just in case you need a reminder, Rockstar North is the studio responsible for <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, which is currently scheduled to be released <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-november-2026" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e57d7053-b3ca-42ed-afdb-4ef5c5958b99" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">in November this year</a> after two <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-vi-release-date-delay" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fbc88268-1772-45bc-9881-7e2e1cd1ca6d" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">delays</a> pushed it back from its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-released-early-following-leak-coming-in-2025" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6fad3f9b-bebd-4488-8603-3fe30fd9ffe3" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">original 2025 release window</a>.</p><p>The game is one of the most hotly-anticipated releases on the calendar this year. It'll follow two protagonists, Jason and Lucia, and it'll be set in the fictional state of Leonida, which is based on Florida (which means you'll be able to visit Vice City once again).</p><p>It's unclear whether the explosion will hamper <em>GTA 6</em>'s development any further. Let's hope that operations resume as normal and that employees are able to return to work safely.</p>
<p>This explosion also comes just a couple of months after Rockstar <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rockstar-union-busting-accusation-gta-6" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2fb963bf-6dd1-47b3-bfbd-3f16511b3076" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">fired a number of employees</a> who were involved in union activity, a move that parent company Take-Two insists wasn't motivated by union-busting.</p><p>Following that decision, hundreds of Rockstar employees <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rockstar-employees-letter" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="419ae453-4f41-4d14-ac9c-25d978963601" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">banded together to write an open letter</a> demanding the terminated employees' reinstatement, although it doesn't sound as though Take-Two acceded to that demand.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
