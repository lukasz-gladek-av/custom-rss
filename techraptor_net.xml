            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/circana-us-sales-data-2024-top-selling-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>US sales analysis group Circana has released its gaming industry sales data for 2024 as a whole, and you'll never guess which of the year's biggest releases topped the charts.</p>

<p>As ever, this data comes from Circana's Mat Piscatella on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lgg2dhbzzk2n" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>, and it crowns none other than&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>as the year's best-selling title.</p>

<p>That's not surprising given that Microsoft has called&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6</em>'s launch <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-series-sales-black-ops-6-launch" rel="nofollow">the franchise's biggest yet</a>, but it will probably come as something of a relief given that the game was also made available <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-will-be-on-game-pass-day-1" rel="nofollow">on Game Pass on day one</a>. Looks like that decision didn't do much to dampen its sales.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-selling-game-us-sales-data-circana.jpg?itok=dA1uCHGo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-selling-game-us-sales-data-circana.jpg?itok=f442NDfx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>has, perhaps unsurprisingly, taken the crown of 2024's best-selling game in the US.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Black Ops 6</em>'s performance will also doubtless come as a relief to Microsoft and Activision given how much the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ballooning-call-of-duty-budgets" rel="nofollow">series' budgets appear to have ballooned</a> in recent years;&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>really is too big to fail, so it'll be reassuring that this one didn't.</p>

<p>In second place on the all-format sales chart, it's&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25</em>, which, again, won't come as much of a surprise given that the game recently swiped the crown of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-sports-college-football-25-best-selling-sports-game" rel="nofollow">best-selling sports game in US history</a>.</p>

<p><em>Helldivers 2</em>, which was sitting at <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-financials-helldivers-2-sales" rel="nofollow">12 million sales at last count</a>, takes third place, while the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-sales-3m" rel="nofollow">hugely successful</a>&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>takes fourth place.&nbsp;<em>NBA 2K25&nbsp;</em>is in fifth.</p>

<p>In terms of platform-specific charts, it's a tussle between&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25&nbsp;</em>for PlayStation and Xbox, with&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>topping <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lgg2djbuyk2n" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Sony's chart</a> and&nbsp;<em>College Football&nbsp;</em>reaching number one on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lgg2dkxnp22n" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Microsoft's</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ea-sports-college-football-25-circana-us-sales-data.jpg?itok=Bn96CzFP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ea-sports-college-football-25-circana-us-sales-data.jpg?itok=DUTTzKXX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>EA Sports College Football 25&nbsp;</em>has sold remarkably well.</figcaption></figure><p>Since neither game was released on the Nintendo Switch, it probably won't come as a surprise to learn that both&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>College Football 25&nbsp;</em>are completely absent from Nintendo's table.</p>

<p>Instead, it's topped by&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em>, with&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&nbsp;</em>taking up second place and&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>in third.&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart&nbsp;</em>really is unstoppable, eh?</p>

<p>You can check out Piscatella's full Bluesky thread, which begins with data specific to December 2024 then widens up to encapsulate the whole year, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lgg2ddgpqc2n" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>. As always, it's worth a look if you're a numbers nerd!</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-records-bloom-rage-part-2-delayed</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dont-nods-lost-records-bloom-rage-part-2-delayed-by-a-month.1089879/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-records-bloom-rage-part-2-delayed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Don't Nod has delayed the second part of upcoming adventure game <i>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</i>. The game's second chapter is now set to launch around a month later than its originally-intended release date.</p>

<p>In an FAQ answering questions about&nbsp;<em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</em>, Don't Nod says the delay was put into effect in order to give the devs time to "refine the experience, address more bugs, and enhance the storytelling". It sounds like the usual delay reasoning, by and large.</p>

<p>The studio says that it's "confident" the delay will allow it to "provide you with a richer experience", and that it has "a little something up [its sleeve] on social media to keep you entertained in the time between the two Tapes" (i.e. chapters).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dont-nod-lost-records-bloom-rage-second-part-delayed.jpg?itok=MXcUjlpo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dont-nod-lost-records-bloom-rage-second-part-delayed.jpg?itok=v_Hv5wXx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</em>'s second part will be delayed by around a month.</figcaption></figure><p>The second part of&nbsp;<em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</em>, which is also known as "Rage",&nbsp;is now set to arrive on April 15th. This delay won't affect the first part (also known, surprisingly enough, as "Bloom"), which is still set to launch on February 18th.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage&nbsp;</em>is, Don't Nod's FAQ explains it pretty succinctly: it's a "single-player experience focused on narrative exploration" that revolves around four friends confronting the dark secrets of something that happened to them 27 years ago.</p>

<p>You'll be able to navigate between the 1995 and 2022 timelines and "shape both narratives" as you go, uncovering the truth of the sleepy Michigan town of Velvet Cove and what may or may not lie beneath its surface (spoilers, though: something definitely does).</p>




<p>This isn't the first time the game has been delayed in some form or another. <em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage&nbsp;</em>was originally set for release in 2024, but back in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-records-bloom-and-rage-delay" rel="nofollow">June last year</a>, Don't Nod pushed its launch back to 2025.</p>

<p>The studio will no doubt be banking on&nbsp;<em>Lost Records</em>' success for two reasons: to offset the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-nod-financials-first-half-2024" rel="nofollow">recent underperformance</a> of some of its games and to launch what is supposed to be a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-records-bloom-and-rage-by-life-is-strange-devs-is-first-game-in-much-larger" rel="nofollow">wider universe of interconnected media</a>.</p>

<p><em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage&nbsp;</em>will launch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1902960/Lost_Records_Bloom__Rage/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/lost-records-bloom-and-rage/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/lost-records-bloom-rage/9n3f1lw9hc6c" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. The first part is due to arrive on February 18th, and the second will be released on April 15th.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/earthblade-canceled-celeste-devs</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/celeste-devs-cancel-next-game-earthblade-due-to-studio-disagreement.1089843/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/earthblade-canceled-celeste-devs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Celeste&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Towerfall&nbsp;</em>studio Extremely OK Games has revealed that its ambitious Metroidvania platformer&nbsp;<em>Earthblade&nbsp;</em>has been canceled owing to an internal studio dispute.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://exok.com/posts/2025-01-22-earthblade-final-update/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the official EXOK website titled "Final&nbsp;<em>Earthblade&nbsp;</em>Update" (just in case you weren't absolutely sure the game was done), the studio describes the cancellation as "a huge, heartbreaking, and yet relieving failure". EXOK head Maddy Thorson says the decision to cancel was actually made in December.</p>

<p>According to Thorson, a "fracture" began forming in 2024, with her and coworker Noel Berry on one side and art director Pedro Medeiros on another. Specifically, the dispute revolved around "the IP rights of&nbsp;<em>Celeste</em>", and it's a dispute Thorson says she "won't be detailing publicly".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/earthblade-canceled-celeste-developers-platforming.jpg?itok=VVIxJQhI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/earthblade-canceled-celeste-developers-platforming.jpg?itok=MB3WBn6G 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ambitious-looking Metroidvania&nbsp;<em>Earthblade&nbsp;</em>has been canceled.</figcaption></figure><p>The dispute, which Thorson calls "a very difficult and heartbreaking process", was eventually resolved, but she and Berry eventually agreed to go their separate ways with Medeiros, who originally announced his departure from EXOK <a href="https://x.com/saint11/status/1857481536335131092" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">back in November</a>.</p>

<p>Thorson says that the dispute with Medeiros caused her and Berry to take a look at&nbsp;<em>Earthblade&nbsp;</em>and ask themselves whether continuing its development would be "worth the pain". Together, they concluded that working on the game had become "exhausting", leading them to "admit defeat".</p>

<p>She also goes on to say that fans shouldn't blame Medeiros, and that he and the team on his game&nbsp;<em>Neverway&nbsp;</em>"aren't the enemy". Treating them as such will make you unwelcome "in any EXOK community", she says.</p>




<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Earthblade&nbsp;</em>is (or was), it was an exploration-based action platformer that would have offered "seamless exploration, challenging combat, and countless mysteries to pick apart".</p>

<p>Originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/earthblade-revealed-as-new-game-from-celeste-developers" rel="nofollow">revealed in 2021</a>, EXOK announced in early 2024 that&nbsp;<em>Earthblade&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/celeste-creator-earthblade-delayed" rel="nofollow">wouldn't be coming out that year</a>. It's very likely the studio had already begun to grapple with the problems that would cause the game's cancellation even then.</p>

<p>As for what's next for EXOK, Thorson says the goal now is to "wipe the slate clean" and to "refocus...back to smaller-scale projects". We'll have to wait and see where that goes in future.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-developer-to-publish-horror-game-by-tales-of-kenzera-zau-devs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>developer Pocketpair has revealed that it's opened a publishing wing, and that its first game will be a horror project by&nbsp;<em>Tales of Kenzera: Zau&nbsp;</em>developer Surgent Studios.</p>

<p>The partnership was announced earlier today in a <a href="https://x.com/PocketpairPBLSH/status/1882352824731980211" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on social media platform X, wherein Pocketpair describes Surgent as "a studio with an original approach" and pledges to support the studio "to the fullest extent".</p>

<p>While this is Pocketpair's first publishing signing, it won't be the studio's last; the&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>dev tells fans to "look forward to future announcements for details of specific projects", so we're going to be seeing more Pocketpair-published games in future.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pocketpair-palworld-tales-of-kenzera-zau-publishing-next-game.jpg?itok=BnWEcCFq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pocketpair-palworld-tales-of-kenzera-zau-publishing-next-game.jpg?itok=MjE3-mJ- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>studio Pocketpair is stepping up to publish&nbsp;<em>Tales of Kenzera: Zau&nbsp;</em>developer Surgent's next game.</figcaption></figure><p>Over on the new Pocketpair Publishing <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/publishing" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, the studio says its mission is "simple": to "find fun games" and then "help make those fun games a reality".</p>

<p>Pocketpair pledges not to tell indie developers "what to do", not to "take control" from them during the making of their games, and not to "change [their] dream or push [them] to make a certain type of game".</p>

<p>Instead, the studio simply wants to "give [developers] money" and "help [them] make a fun game". That sounds nice and simple to me, although it's notable that Pocketpair doesn't disclose the share it'll take of developers' revenue or other terms along those lines.</p>

<p>As for the next Surgent project, studio head Abubakar Salim says that it won't be set in the&nbsp;<em>Tales of Kenzera: Zau&nbsp;</em>universe and that it will be based around "a pattern in the entertainment industry". It'll also be "short and weird", according to Salim.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-developer-publishing-surgent-horror-game-rocket-launcher.jpg?itok=IG_TiTGZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-developer-publishing-surgent-horror-game-rocket-launcher.jpg?itok=U7WO8bcb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>We'll likely see more Pocketpair Publishing projects in the future.</figcaption></figure><p>This is a nice redemption story for Surgent Studios; back in October, the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-of-kenzera-zau-developer-redundancy-notice" rel="nofollow">put its team "on notice for redundancy"</a>&nbsp;following the underperformance of the game (although we now know it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-ea-sports-fc-25-underperformed" rel="nofollow">not the only EA-published game</a> to have underperformed in recent months).</p>

<p>We'll likely have to wait a little while to see what Surgent's next project looks like, and we don't know whether Pocketpair will indeed be publishing more games in the&nbsp;<em>Tales of Kenzera&nbsp;</em>universe, but for now, it looks like Surgent has been granted a reprieve. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-update-new-expansion-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The long-awaited&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>trading update finally has a release date, and it's coming just a day before the game's next major expansion set arrives.</p>

<p>Per a press release, the trading update, which will allow you to trade cards with your friends (albeit with some <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-details" rel="nofollow">pretty hefty caveats</a>), will arrive on January 29th, which is next Wednesday at time of writing.</p>

<p>As a reminder, the trading update will only let you trade with friends, and only certain cards will be supported to begin with. Additionally, you'll only be able to trade cards of certain rarity levels, and new items will need to be used in order to facilitate trades.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-update-space-time-smackdown.jpg?itok=EqhDLw6a 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-update-space-time-smackdown.jpg?itok=Ls5PaGcb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The new&nbsp;<em>Space-Time Smackdown&nbsp;</em>expansion will bring plenty of new cards for you to collect.</figcaption></figure><p>At first, you'll only be able to trade cards from the first two sets as well, those being Genetic Apex and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mythical-island-expansion" rel="nofollow">Mythical Island</a>. Plans are in place to introduce trading for other sets at a later date, apparently.</p>

<p>As for the new expansion, it's called&nbsp;<em>Space-Time Smackdown</em>, and as the name suggests, it'll largely revolve around two of the Sinnoh region's pivotal legendary Pokemon, namely Dialga and Palkia. The new booster packs will be themed around those Pokemon as well.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to new Pokemon from Sinnoh that haven't appeared in&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>before; The Pokemon Company is teasing Lucario and the three Sinnoh starters (Turtwig, Chimchar, and Piplup), but there will likely be others, too.</p>

<p>The trailer for the new set also teases a Pachirisu ex card that includes attack text referring to Pokemon Tools, a mechanic from the main&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG&nbsp;</em>game that can augment certain 'mon attacks. Sounds like they'll be making their debut with this set as well.</p>




<p>The&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>trading update launches on January 29th, and the&nbsp;<em>Space-Time Smackdown&nbsp;</em>expansion set launches a day later on January 30th. Make sure you're ready for both!</p>
