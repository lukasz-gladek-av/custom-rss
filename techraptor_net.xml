            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-2077-sales-witcher-production<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>CD Projekt has revealed that open-world action RPG&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>has hit another major sales milestone, and there's some good news if you're waiting on tenterhooks for the next&nbsp;<em>Witcher&nbsp;</em>game as well.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/CDPROJEKTRED_IR/status/1861447302260363516" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a</a><a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2024/11/cd-projekt-group-presentation-q3-2024.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">&nbsp;new financial presentation</a>, CD Projekt reveals that&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>sales have hit 30 million as of today, with that number including both sales of the base game and the Ultimate Edition bundle.</p>

<p>What's more,&nbsp;<em>Phantom Liberty</em>, the DLC expansion for&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>that launched last year, has managed to sell eight million copies, which is around the same number as the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-8m" rel="nofollow">lifetime sales of the&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em>remake</a>. That's pretty impressive considering&nbsp;<em>Phantom Liberty&nbsp;</em>isn't a full game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cyberpunk-2077-sales-phantom-liberty.jpg?itok=-ila7YeQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cyberpunk-2077-sales-phantom-liberty.jpg?itok=kn5dC9H3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Phantom Liberty&nbsp;</em>expansion has done pretty well for itself sales-wise.</figcaption></figure><p>In that same presentation, CD Projekt revealed that&nbsp;<em>Project Polaris</em>, which is the codename for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-witcher-game-in-development-cdpr-says" rel="nofollow">next major game in the&nbsp;<em>Witcher&nbsp;</em>franchise</a>, has entered full production.</p>

<p>Essentially, this means that the next&nbsp;<em>Witcher&nbsp;</em>game has left its planning stages and that staff are now working on creating the game in earnest, bringing it one step closer to completion. Of course, we're still a long, long way away from that point.</p>

<p>It's worth noting, too, that&nbsp;<em>Polaris&nbsp;</em>is an entirely new game in the&nbsp;<em>Witcher&nbsp;</em>series, and as such, it's distinct from the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/witcher-remake-announced-by-cd-projekt-red" rel="nofollow"><em>Witcher&nbsp;</em>remake that was announced by CD Projekt Red</a> back in 2022.</p>

<p>According to the financial presentation, as of October 31st, 400 staff members were working on&nbsp;<em>Polaris</em>, with 64 devoted to&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/project-orion-new-hires" rel="nofollow">sequel&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/project-orion-new-hires" rel="nofollow">Orion</a>&nbsp;</em>and 42 working on&nbsp;<em>Witcher&nbsp;</em>spinoff&nbsp;<em>Sirius</em>.</p>

Revenue is significantly down, as is gross profit, but the company still hasn't posted a loss despite releasing no major projects this year.</p>

<p>When it comes to year-to-date financials, CD Projekt's sales are slightly down over the same period last year, although sales of the&nbsp;<em>Witcher&nbsp;</em>series remain steady, and the company's net profitability has actually slightly increased.</p>
