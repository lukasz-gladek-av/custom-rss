            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Major hardware player 8BitDo has announced a brand new device ahead of this month's CES showcase, which begins tomorrow, and if you've ever wanted to play games on your phone vertically rather than horizontally, the FlipPad is for you.</p><p>As spotted by the appropriately-named <a href="https://retrohandhelds.gg/8bitdo-announces-controller-built-for-vertical-mobile-gaming/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Retro Handhelds</a>, the FlipPad was revealed by 8BitDo over on <a href="https://x.com/8BitDo/status/2007844470444933384" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">social media</a>. The company describes the controller as "a flip-style gamepad designed for mobile gaming", and it'll be compatible with both iOS and Android phones.</p><p>8BitDo has earmarked the FlipPad for a summer release, but if you're lucky enough to be attending CES 2026, then you'll be able to experience the controller at 8BitDo's booth. Be sure to put it through its paces if that's you!</p><figure role="group">

<p>As shown in the video clip accompanying the FlipPad's design, the controller connects to the USB-C port of your phone and can be flipped upwards to cover the bottom part of your screen. You can then swivel the FlipPad downwards when it's not in use.</p><p>Aesthetic-wise, as Retro Handhelds notes, the FlipPad bears more than a passing resemblance to one of the most iconic color schemes sported by the Nintendo Game Boy, which I can't imagine is an accidental choice.</p><p>Of course, since the FlipPad connects via your phone's charging port, you'll likely be able to use it just as you would any other regular controller, although you should bear in mind that it doesn't feature analog sticks, so this is very much a retro-focused device.</p><p>The FlipPad joins a mobile controller market that also includes heavyweights like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/backbone-pro-announcement" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="15935167-00e8-49bb-b367-3dba4b827098" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">the Backbone Pro</a> and offerings from companies <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/gamevice-is-smartphone-controller-worth-looking-into" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3002d824-ec13-462e-a34c-e7a6d3d44724" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">like Gamevice</a>, although it's fair to say 8BitDo's new offering is trying to serve a different niche than those venerable devices.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>The mobile controller field is very competitive indeed.</figcaption>

<p>Perhaps of greater interest to 8BitDo in this case are handhelds like GameSir's <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/843605/gamesir-pocket-1-smartphone-android-wireless-bluetooth-controller" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">recently-announced Pocket 1</a>, which I'm sure the company will be keeping an eye on.
