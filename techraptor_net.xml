            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Steamforged has announced a new <em>Warmachine</em> starter set for pre-order. The aptly named <em>Warmachine Frozen and Forgotten</em> set introduces two new forces from western Immoren. One alive; the other long dead.</p>

<h2>The <em>Warmachine Frozen and Forgotten</em> Starter Set Announcement</h2>

<p>According to its store page, the <em>Warmachine Frozen and Forgotten</em>&nbsp;starter set contains two Command Cadres, both of which are solid starting points for a brand-new <em>Warmachine</em> army. The box provides a narrative-ready battle of steel, sorcery, and bone, giving players a small taste of the <em>Warmachine</em> experience.</p>

The once ruthless, silent killers of the Shard Spires now fight to preserve their dying culture. They are led by a lesser warlock, Lanyssa Ryssyl, and are bonded to lethal warbeasts. Sasha and Benkei.</p>

<p>The second Command Cadre in the <em>Warmachine Frozen and Forgotten</em> starter set is the Orgoth Graveborn. These immortal horrors are led by a deathless warlord called Anathia, the Imperishable Desolation. These terrors continue on the warpath, fighting to reclaim the glories of their first conquest.</p>

<p>The starter set contains the following units:</p>

<ul><li>Lanyssa Ryssyl (Dusk Lesser Warlock)</li>
	<li>Cylena Raefyll (Dusk Character Solo)</li>
	<li>Benkei (Dusk Character Warbeast)</li>
	<li>Sasha (Dusk Character Warbeast)</li>
	<li>Last Watch (Dusk 3-Model Character Unit)</li>
	<li>Anathia, The Imperishable Desolation (Orgoth Character Solo)</li>
