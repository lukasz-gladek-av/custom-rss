            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Andrew Hulshult: For many boomer shooter fans, he's known as <em>THE </em>guy for soundtracks in that genre. When his name flashed on the screen during the opening credits of <em>Iron Lung</em>, I was surprised to learn one of my favorite composers was involved with this project. As the credits rolled at the end of the film, the gears started whirring in my head: I really want to talk to him about this film's soundtrack.</p><p>As it turns out, going from strictly video game OSTs to film was as unexpected for Hulshult as it was for me finding out he composed for <em>Iron Long. </em>And so, after asking around, I was able to talk to the man himself and learn more about his process of composing for film versus video games, the challenges he faced, and the fun he had while on <em>Iron Lung</em>'s set.&nbsp;</p><h2>On the Set of <em>Iron Lung</em></h2><p>Unless you're deep into the boomer shooter space, you might not know of Hulshult's connection to <em>Iron Lung </em>game creator <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/david-szymanski" rel="nofollow">David Szymanski</a>. The film wasn't their first creative endeavor together -- Hulshult composed the soundtrack for the gritty, dark, retro-style shooter <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/dusk-review-dawn-of-old-era" rel="nofollow"><em>Dusk</em></a>, the very game that put Szymanski on the map.&nbsp;</p><p>Around 2018 or 2019, after <em>Dusk</em>'s development, Hulshult would often casually tell Szymanski that it would be cool to do a score for a film, if the chance ever arose. While we don't have a movie for <em>Dusk </em>(at least, not yet), around 2022, Hulshult got a call from Szymanski about a <em>different </em>project.</p><p>"He called me and was like, 'hey, you remember how you said you wanted to work on a film?' He's like, 'so what if I told you you could and that I think that you'd be perfect for it?' And I was like, I'm thinking [it's a] small thing, 'I'm like... yeah, what do you got.' He's like, well, Markiplier."</p><picture>

  </picture><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7_YxT-KID8kRbqZo7MyscQ" rel="nofollow">Markiplier</a> is a massive presence on YouTube and beyond. With nearly 40 million subscribers on YouTube alone, anything with his name behind it pulls a lot of weight. Even while writing this article, he's streaming a horror game and pulling a staggering 90,000 viewers. So, for him to be involved, Hulshult knew it was a big deal, and was eager to jump into this project, that being <em>Iron Lung.</em></p><p>"It was sick, man, like it was so much fun," said Hulshult. "That guy is a constant creative, is always looking for something to better the project without going too crazy into it, is always open to ideas, is always looking for suggestions, and it's just been awesome."</p><p>Hulshult later had a chance to visit the set of <em>Iron Lung, </em>where he was able to get inspiration and ideas for the music. For about a minute, he felt like an outsider on set, but almost immediately, he grew comfortable with the professionalism and friendliness of the crew.&nbsp;</p><picture>

  </picture><p>Not to mention, Hulshult was blown away by the dynamic set -- a sub rigged into a machine that could create the feeling of underwater turbulence -- and seeing it all in action over the course of a week served as incredible inspiration for his music.</p><p>"It was awesome to be asked to come on the set just to write demos. And I will tell you that about half the demos I wrote under that, I never touched again, and they just made it into the film. We just liked them. I was just catching vibes off of Mark's acting that I was like, I genuinely did not think that I would catch. I was connecting with that dude's performances on a different level."</p><p>Aspects from the set made it into Hulshult's music, as well. Giant vats of artificial blood, latex, metal, and even Markiplier's own voice contributed to the score. By sampling these sounds, Hulshult worked some dark magic and created the ominous, brooding sounds we hear in the <em>Iron Lung</em> OST.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>I was just catching vibes off of Mark's acting that I was like, I genuinely did not think that I would I would catch I was I was connecting with that dude's performances on a different level.</p></blockquote><p>"And I would feed in all of those sounds into granular synthesis," said Hulshult, "and just mess with them until I found something that sounded like a note that I enjoyed, but still sounded like, you know, metal or a sub or Mark's voice. And then I would just use it, and it kind of became like a little bit of a meme where I was like, I'm going to go home and write music with this metallic shitty orchestra for this film, is what we always say."</p><figure role="group">

<h2>Composing for Video Games vs. Film</h2><p>At various points during our talk, we touched on the differences between composing for video game music versus film. Hulshult has credits for over a dozen games, including the aforementioned <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/dusk-review-dawn-of-old-era" rel="nofollow"><em>Dusk</em></a>, but also the recent <em>Heretic + Hexen</em> Remaster by <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/nightdive-studios" rel="nofollow">Nightdive</a>, and even <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/doom-eternal" rel="nofollow"><em>Doom Eternal</em>'s</a> <em>The Ancient Gods </em>DLC.</p><p>"You can't operate this the exact same way," said Hulshult. "You can't come to it the exact same way. You have to come to it and talk about the vision, like what this guy's vision is, and understand it to a point where you don't even need him in the room, which I feel like I got to that. And every time that I would have a piece of music, I just sent it over to him, and he loved almost all of it all the way through, which I was like, thank god, it's my first time. This could have gone so sideways."</p><p>Because of Hulshult's experience in the industry, he mentions there is an established trust between him and the video game producers he works with. Of course, video games and film are completely different forms of entertainment, which was one hurdle he had to get around.&nbsp;</p><figure role="group">

<p>"...so like films, it is a lot more static, but the the issue with films is that they can change, so you can get cuts, right? Like something can completely change in a week, and you've got to rethink it. And with games, it's not so much that. It's like, this is the level, this is how we want to do stuff. So you can kind of write what's in your head front to back, almost all in one go."</p><p>One distinct aspect about <em>Iron Lung</em> is that it takes place completely within one self-contained submarine, whereas Hulshult is normally composing for video games with sprawling levels and dynamic themes. This was intimidating, especially given the fact that music was critical in creating the atmosphere for the film.&nbsp;</p><p>"It's been a while since I had like a really good challenge," said Hulshult. "<em>Eternal </em>felt like a really good challenge, those DLC felt like a really good challenge, and I think I was ready for another big challenge and that's what excited me about this."</p><blockquote><p>I think I was ready for another big challenge and that's what excited me about this.</p></blockquote><p>Hulshult commends the cinematography and editing of the film, making use of such a small space to constantly innovate and thus keep the audience engaged. In addition to the excellent work by Markiplier as director and his team, <em>Iron Lung</em> game creator David Szymanski served a pivotal role in the process as well.&nbsp;</p><figure role="group">

<p>Szymanski not only developed the gameplay for <em>Iron Lung</em>, he also created the music as well. For research, Hulshult went back and listened to Szymanski's work, which he calls "weird, interesting and really dreadful."&nbsp;</p><p>There was a particular motif from the theme song of <em>Iron Lung </em>that stuck with him, and curious about how Szymanski created a certain whirring sound, Hulshult was shocked to learn it was sampled by an old fan.&nbsp;</p><figure role="group">

<p>"And that changed how I perceived everything with the soundtrack," said Hulshult, "that little tiny interaction with David Szymanski, because I was sitting back here going, 'I'm about to write like music for a movie -- I gotta go find all these crazy string libraries and we gotta go find the coolest synths that we can, we're going to go spend some money.</p><p>And immediately was like, nope: We're going to work on sound design, is what we're going to do. We're going to find weird sounds that are related to either the set or the sub, and we're going to write with that."</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>The Unprecedented Reception of <em>Iron Lung</em></h2><p><em>Iron Lung</em>'s film adaptation has been nothing short of a rousing success. With a smaller budget of $3 million and created by a YouTuber -- not an established director -- <em>Iron Lung's </em>accrued nearly $50 million in revenue. In a heartfelt, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcJWymZ1x9o" rel="nofollow">tear-filled video</a> by Markiplier, he reflects on the film's monumental performance. By extension, Hulshult's been blown away by it all as well, calling it the "biggest reception" he's ever had with his music.&nbsp;</p><p>"A bunch of people didn't know that I was going to be writing the music for this," said Hulshult, "and they're like tagging me like, 'oh my God, you wrote for this? ' And they're in the theater. And I'm just, I really wanted to write back: 'Please just watch the movie, send it to me afterwards.'"</p><p><span title="Play starting at 26:47" data-start="1607410" data-end="1611950">"Anytime I can be a part of something cool with cool people and people want to talk </span><span title="Play starting at 26:52" data-start="1611950" data-end="1616270">about it for a few years down the road, I'm all for it, t</span><span title="Play starting at 26:56" data-start="1616310" data-end="1618590">hat's what it is for me.
