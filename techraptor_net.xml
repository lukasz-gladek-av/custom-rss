            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The TTRPG community has lost one of its pioneers. Tim Kask, a man who would shape the earliest version of the iconic TTRPG <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> and the first full-time employee of TSR Inc., has passed away.</p><h2>The Passing of Tim Kask</h2><p>The influence Tim Kask had on the tabletop industry is substantial. He was an avid wargamer, playing many tactical war games in the 1970s. Eventually, he had a chance to play <em>Chainmail</em>, designed by Gary Gygax.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>This experience led to the two men corresponding about miniature game rules, which led to Kask being invited to Gen Con to playtest Gygax's next game: <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. Kask was the first playtester outside of Gygax's family to play this version, originally called "The Fantasy Game."&nbsp;</p><p>This relationship deepened when Tim Kask was hired full-time by Gygax's company, TSR Inc., in 1975. He edited and contributed to various <em>D&amp;D</em> supplements, such as the influential and genre-blending <em>Blackmoor</em> setting and <em>Eldritch Wizardry</em>, which introduced <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dungeons-dragons-2024-psion-ua-update-refines-new-psychic-casting-class" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">psionics</a> and Mind Flayers to the game. There is even a device in the game named after a character he made: the Apparatus of Kwalish.</p><p>Kask was also known for periodical work. One of his biggest contributions was as editor for the TSR magazine, <em>The Strategic Review</em>, which would eventually split into two different books: <em>Dragon Magazine</em> and <em>Little Wars</em>. <em>Dragon Magazine</em> is vital since it introduced ideas, spells, and magic items that would appear in official <em>D&amp;D</em> products.&nbsp;</p><p>One of those ideas is the now iconic Forgotten Realms setting. The same setting that has hosted many epic and beloved D&amp;D adventures, such as <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/baldurs-gate-3" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a>.</p><p>Tim Kask would depart from TSR in 1980. The reason for his departure was creative disagreement around the creation of <em>Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. According to <a href="https://gamerant.com/tim-kask-dungeons-and-dragons-editor-death/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Game Rant's</a> findings, Kask thought original <em>D&amp;D</em> should stay, "a free-wheeling game" and didn't like the new rules-focused approach.</p><p>But Kask didn't completely vanish from the tabletop community. He would appear at conventions and continue writing and developing in the industry. His most recent work was the founding of Eldritch Enterprises in 2010.&nbsp;</p><p>Tim Kask passed away on December 30, 2026, after a sudden illness. He passed peacefully in his sleep, surrounded by friends and family.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix is teasing some announcements for the <em>Dragon Quest </em>franchise this year as part of the celebrated JRPG series' 40th anniversary, and yes, it really has been that long since the first game was released.</p><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/DragonQuest/status/2006757310673395980" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">message on X</a> (which is admittedly rather brief), Square Enix notes <em>Dragon Quest</em>'s anniversary and promises "various announcements in celebration" of the occasion, although we don't get much more than that, unfortunately.</p><p>The publisher stops short of revealing when we can expect the first of these announcements, so unlike <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-30th-anniversary-website" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c0ca7ca1-f73b-49cf-aa12-186077080c21" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Atlus' recent <em>Persona </em>anniversary website</a>, there's no countdown or concrete date to look forward to, sadly.</p><figure role="group">

</figure>
<p>Of course, the one question on your mind right now if you're a <em>Dragon Quest </em>fan is probably whether Square Enix is planning to reveal more information about the long-awaited next installment in the series, <em>Dragon Quest XII</em>.</p><p>The game was originally announced all the way back in 2021, at which point it had been four years since <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dragon-quest-xi-echoes-of-elusive-age" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c5650383-7871-4d7a-8a57-bdc9e6ca76fa" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">the previous mainline entry</a>. Since then, almost five more years have gone by, so <em>Dragon Quest </em>fans have been waiting a very long time indeed for news of the series' future.</p><p>Naturally, <em>Dragon Quest </em>hasn't been dormant in the intervening time. A plethora of spinoffs have been released, as well as a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-sales-2m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="479f5a9f-55ff-465f-b449-c352aa8c3839" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">number of remakes</a> of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake-switch-2-upgrade-path" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7d0dabe5-f32a-49c5-9804-b2d6bd5aac52" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">previous games in the series</a>. Another remake, <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em>, is scheduled to arrive next month.</p><p>If you're somehow not familiar with <em>Dragon Quest</em>, it's a series of rather cozy JRPGs that revolve around traditional turn-based gameplay, overworld exploration, and dungeon-delving. It's very much the comfort food of the JRPG world (and I say that as a compliment).</p>
<p>Despite that reputation, series producer Yuji Horii has <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2021/05/dragon-quest-xii-the-flames-of-fate-announced" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">promised</a> an overhaul for the twelfth installment, pledging to shake up <em>Dragon Quest</em>'s combat and introduce "dark, mature content" to the franchise. We'll have to wait and see if he and Square Enix make good on these promises.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

<p>In the video, AdHoc says that players have completed a total of 52.5 million shifts across their total play time, and that 727 million calls have been answered.</p><p>You can see other info showing things like <em>Dispatch</em>'s most popular romance choices, as well as what decisions players made at certain crux points, but I won't be sharing those here just in case you've scrolled this far without having played the game.</p><p>If you're not familiar with <em>Dispatch</em>, it's a workplace-themed superhero comedy adventure game (that's a whole lot of descriptors) <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-telltale-employees-go-on-to-form-adhoc-studio" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ebf6f25a-7f8d-4c5f-bcf6-4525c284b84e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">created by ex-Telltale staffers</a>, so you can probably guess roughly what to expect from that description.</p><p>The game is an episodic release that casts you as Robert Robertson III, also known as Mecha Man, a former superhero who must take a desk job following an incident that leaves him unable to don his costume.</p>
<p>If you want to get in on the hype, you can check out <em>Dispatch </em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2592160/Dispatch/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/dispatch/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a>, and the game is also coming to the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/Dispatch-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2991427.html" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Switch 2</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Dispatch-2991429.html" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Switch</a> later this month.
