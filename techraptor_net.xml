            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Evil Hat Productions has announced it will be launching a crowdfunding campaign for Designers &amp; Dragons: Origins. This is not a reprint of the original documentary-style books, but rather a new collection of volumes that delve into the early years of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> and its numerous supplements.</p>

<h2>The <em>Designers &amp; Dragons: Origins</em> Backerkit Campaign Announcement</h2>

<p>According to its official <a href="https://www.backerkit.com/call_to_action/0477a26f-723e-4d2f-8f11-74cdc007daf1/landing" rel="nofollow">landing page</a>, <em>Designers &amp; Dragons: Origins</em> is a 4-volume set that covers the history of each and every product released by TSR for original <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, <em>AD&amp;D</em>, and <em>Basic D&amp;D</em>. This will include all Unearthed Arcana, the legendary orange-covered B3, and the rare 1986 <em>Up The Garden Path</em> prewritten adventure.</p>

She delves deeply into the artwork, design, and origins, as well as other iconic books released during the world's most popular fantasy TTRPG's formative years. Everything from the start of the TTRPG genre, to the discovery of the Forgotten Realms, to the fall of Mystara will be covered in these books.</p>

<p>Designers &amp; Dragons: Origins is a more comprehensive look at one of <em>D&amp;D's</em> eras by Appelcline. This is in comparison to past <em>Designers &amp; Dragons</em> books, which focused more on the broader history of the TTRPG industry. The origin of TSR and the influence of wargaming in the 1970s. The rise of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/fighting-fantasy-solo-adventure-rpg-series-returns-to-us-through-steve-jackson-games" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steve Jackson</a> and West End Games in the 80s. The growth of independent publishers in the 2000s. The list goes on.</p>

<p>Evil Hat Productions is the publisher of many beloved TTRPGs throughout the years. Their work includes the electropunk dark fantasy heist game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/blades-in-dark-review-next-level-roleplaying" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Blades in the Dark</em></a>, the <em>Dresden Files</em> RPG, <em>Thirsty Sword Lesbians</em>, <em>Apocalypse Keys</em>, and <em>Monster of the Week</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the landing page, the Backerkit campaign for <em>Designers &amp; Dragons: Origins</em> will go live near the end of October.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you've been wondering what's happened to&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 2</em>, then wonder no more, because Konami has an update for you on how development is going.</p>

<p>As spotted by social media user <a href="https://x.com/Kuwabara357/status/1971126048017322123" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Outsider Snake</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-2-is-still-moving-forward-properly-konami-says/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">VGC</a>),&nbsp;<em>Master Collection&nbsp;</em>producer Noriaki Okamura provided more information about the second volume of the collection during this week's Konami Tokyo Game Show spot.</p>

<p>According to Okamura (via Outsider Snake's translation), development on the second volume is "moving forward properly", and the collection as a whole is "shaping up to be something enjoyable", but fans should "wait just a little longer" for more information about the project.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol.-2-snake-eater.jpg?itok=Jkvw5vd8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol.-2-snake-eater.jpg?itok=A7d8P9Lc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1&nbsp;</em>was released back in 2023, and a second volume is expected.</figcaption></figure><p>Okamura goes on to say that it's "hard to say" exactly how much longer we'll have to wait for more&nbsp;<em>Master Collection Vol. 2&nbsp;</em>news, but that Konami is still working on the compilation, which feels like good news in and of itself.</p>

<p>Of course, we still know very little about what&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 2&nbsp;</em>will feature. Presumably, since the last collection left off at&nbsp;<em>Snake Eater</em>, the new volume will offer a remastered version of&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots</em>, but beyond that, it's tough to say.</p>

<p>If I had to guess, I'd say <i>Vol. 2&nbsp;</i>will remaster&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid 4</em>,&nbsp;<em>Portable Ops</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Peace Walker</em>, and that bonus versions of&nbsp;PSP card battlers&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Ac!d&nbsp;</em>and its sequel will be offered as well, although that might just be wishful thinking on my part.</p>




<p>In any case, if you want to play more&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear</em>, you'll have to content yourself with the recently-released (and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-1m-sales" rel="nofollow">rather successful</a>)&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater&nbsp;</em>for now. Hopefully, we'll get more info about&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 2&nbsp;</em>sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>Back in 2021, Konami <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-1m-sales" rel="nofollow">pledged to revive</a>&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear&nbsp;</em>with new titles, as well as&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Castlevania</em>. Since then, we've seen the release of the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Snake Eater&nbsp;</em>remake, as well as&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-f-officially-revealed-konami" rel="nofollow"><em>Silent Hill f</em></a>, so perhaps&nbsp;<em>Castlevania&nbsp;</em>will get its turn in the sun next (although that would probably turn it to dust).</p>
