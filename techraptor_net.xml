            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has announced the release date for the next major&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>update, and since it'll arrive not long before the spookiest day of the year, you can expect lots of creepy treats to enjoy.</p>

<p>Per a press release, Version 2.3, which will, naturally, follow on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-version-22-release-date" rel="nofollow">September's Version 2.2</a>, will be arriving on October 15th, bringing three brand new Agents for your team, a new map to explore, and more.</p>

<p>First and foremost, you'll be exploring the brand new Timesworn Hills area, which, as HoYoverse says, is a place where "ghost stories echo through abandoned ruins". You'll be investigating the disappearance of miners in the region, which will lead to the discovery of "unsettling truths".</p>

<p>She's joined by Yidhari, an S-Rank Ice Rupture Agent whose damage is boosted as her HP falls. You'll need to strike a balance between risk and safety if you want to maximize her damage potential.</p>

<p>Your final new Agent in&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 2.3 is Komano Manato, an A-Rank Fire Rupture Agent who gains damage as his HP scales. S-Rank Agents Vivian and Ju Fufu will also be available during this update as rerun banners.</p>

<p>You can also expect a new powered-up version of Soldier 0 - Anby, who first debuted during&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-version-16-march" rel="nofollow">Version 1.6</a>, as well as a new turn-based combat challenge and the return of the Snap! Shining Strike photography event.</p>




<p>News of this latest&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>update comes shortly after HoYoverse announced two brand new free-to-play games being added to its lineup, namely <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hoyoverse-honkai-nexus-anima" rel="nofollow">autochess creature-collector&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hoyoverse-honkai-nexus-anima" rel="nofollow">Honkai: Nexus Anima</a>&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hoyoverse-petit-planet-cozy-life-sim" rel="nofollow">cozy life sim&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet</em></a>.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em><a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/en-us/main" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">for free right now</a> on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, as well as mobile devices. Version 2.3 launches on October 15th across all platforms.</p>
