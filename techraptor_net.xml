            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher vedinad has announced that their 3D&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em>-esque roguelite game&nbsp;<em>Megabonk</em>&nbsp;has managed to hit a major sales milestone within its first two weeks on sale.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://x.com/MegabonkGame/status/1973773917040111965" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">revealed</a> on social media,&nbsp;<em>Megabonk&nbsp;</em>has crossed a million sales since it was released on September 18th. Humorously, vedinad says they'll be "eating spaghetti with EXTRA sauce tonight" as a result of the sales milestone.</p>

<p>The developer also says they "really appreciate" the feedback fans have provided for&nbsp;<em>Megabonk&nbsp;</em>since its launch, and that there are "definitely a lot of things [they] wanna fix and change". A roadmap could be on the way, but vedinad says they're taking a few days off due to being "a bit overwhelmed and tired", so don't expect it imminently.</p>

<p>In indie terms,&nbsp;<em>Megabonk</em>&nbsp;is now on the same page as hits like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sultans-game-sales-1m" rel="nofollow">card-based RPG&nbsp;<em>Sultan's Game</em></a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pacific-drive-sales-1m" rel="nofollow">driving roguelite&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive</em></a>, so however you slice it, vedinad's game is in some pretty good company.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Megabonk</em>, it's an action roguelite that combines the wave-based combat of games like&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors&nbsp;</em>with full 3D movement and traversal, adding another layer to the formula's strategy element.</p>

<p>Just like in&nbsp;<em>Survivors</em>-esque games, you'll have to survive against infinite waves of enemies in procedurally-generated maps, but you'll now have to worry about things like verticality and positioning yourself in a 3D space.</p>




<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Megabonk&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3405340/Megabonk/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, where it'll set you back $10 or your regional equivalent. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Payday 3 Offline Mode Officially Canceled, Starbreeze Announces]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/payday-3-offline-mode-canceled</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/payday-3-offline-mode-officially-canceled-starbreeze-announces.1315528/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Payday 3&nbsp;</em>developer Starbreeze has announced it's canceling one of the heist shooter's most-requested features, namely the ability to play the game without an online connection.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/payday-3-celebrates-2nd-anniversary-by-canceling-promised-offline-mode.1314967/#post-145945057" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ResetEra user Santar</a>, Starbreeze revealed the cancellation of&nbsp;<em>Payday 3</em>'s offline mode during a second-anniversary livestream yesterday. The studio claims that the offline mode is "not feasible" for the "direction" in which it's heading with&nbsp;<em>Payday 3</em>.</p>

<p>The announcement that you won't be able to play&nbsp;<em>Payday 3&nbsp;</em>offline comes after Starbreeze <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-project-baxter-canceled-layoffs" rel="nofollow">announced a major company policy shift</a> yesterday, resulting in the cancellation of its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-dnd-game-2026" rel="nofollow">live-service&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;</em>game</a> and a pivot towards the&nbsp;<em>Payday&nbsp;</em>franchise as the studio's primary focus.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/payday-3-offline-mode-canceled-lasers.jpg?itok=sr0k3jYw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/payday-3-offline-mode-canceled-lasers.jpg?itok=yTqIpvvI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Payday 3</em>'s offline mode has officially been canceled.</figcaption></figure><p>That shift will also seemingly mean more games in the&nbsp;<em>Payday&nbsp;</em>franchise, as well as a sharper focus on the heist genre in general, so we may be about to see a slew of new&nbsp;<em>Payday&nbsp;</em>spinoffs and sequels in the future.</p>

<p>Of course, that's assuming that Starbreeze can turn&nbsp;<em>Payday 3</em>'s fortunes around. The game has had a pretty hard time of things since launching back in 2023; just a few months after its launch, Starbreeze <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-payday-3-performance" rel="nofollow">admitted it was operating at "significantly lower levels"</a> than the studio was hoping for.</p>

<p>Following that, in March 2024, then-CEO&nbsp;Tobias Sjögren <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-studios-ceo-steps-down" rel="nofollow">stepped down from the company</a>, and in September last year, game director&nbsp;Miodrag Kovačević followed suit, although he's still working on&nbsp;<em>Payday 3</em> as a designer.</p>

<p>Starbreeze's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-financials-2024-payday-3" rel="nofollow">financial results in February this year</a> showed that sales dropped significantly when compared to the same period a year prior, but the studio still called the year as a whole "successful".</p>




<p>The dropping of&nbsp;<em>Payday 3</em>'s offline mode also comes just a few days after Starbreeze <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/payday-2-dev-adds-dlc-subscription-to-its-12-year-old-game-as-a-cost-effective-alternative-after-price-hike-admits-we-messed-up-as-players-torch-its-steam-reviews/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ran into controversy</a> following the introduction of a subscription model for predecessor&nbsp;<em>Payday 2</em>'s DLC, which itself followed on from a price hike for the premium one-off purchase for said DLC.</p>

<p>Starbreeze has insisted that the timing of the subscription service's introduction was coincidental, but whether that's the case or not, I'd imagine that what the studio needs now is quick and easy wins, not to upset its fanbase further. We'll see whether it can achieve that in the coming months, I suppose.</p>
