            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/koei-tecmo-new-ceo<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Ninja Gaiden</em> and <em>Dynasty Warriors</em> studio Koei Tecmo has announced that it has appointed a new CEO, who's due to take office in April. He'll replace one of the company's co-founders in the position.</p>

<p>According to an <a href="https://www.koeitecmo.co.jp/e/news/docs/ir6_20250210_EN.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on the official Koei Tecmo site (via <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/koei-tecmo-names-new-ceo-as-co-founders-yoichi-and-keiko-erikawa-step-back" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Game Developer</a>), Hisashi Koinuma will become Koei Tecmo's new CEO on April 1st. He's currently serving as a representative director and executive VP for Koei Tecmo Games.</p>

<p>Koinuma will replace outgoing CEO Yoichi Erikawa, who's also one of the company's co-founders alongside his wife Keiko. Yoichi will become the representative director for Koei Tecmo Games, as well as its chairman, while Keiko will become the representative director and president of a new corporate finance division.</p>

<p>As Game Developer points out, it's currently understood that Koei Tecmo won't be altering its strategy significantly as a result of this change, so it's unlikely that Koinuma's appointment will have any impact on upcoming games like <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with Koei Tecmo's work, the studio is best known for franchises like historical hack-and-slash series <em>Dynasty Warriors</em> and, uh, ninja-themed hack-and-slash series <em>Ninja Gaiden</em>.</p>

<p>Other major Koei Tecmo efforts include&nbsp;<em>Dead or Alive</em>, the&nbsp;<em>Atelier&nbsp;</em>series of JRPGs, and strategy sims like&nbsp;<em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Nobunaga's Ambition</em>, as well as work on games in franchises like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/fire-emblem-warriors-three-hopes" rel="nofollow">Fire Emblem</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/stranger-of-paradise-final-fantasy-origin" rel="nofollow"><em>Final Fantasy</em></a>.</p>




<p>Right now, the studio is hard at work on&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>, which subsidiary Team Ninja is co-developing alongside&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Wonderful 101</em>'s PlatinumGames.</p>

<p>Koei Tecmo is also gearing up for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rise-of-ronin-pc-release-march" rel="nofollow">PC release of&nbsp;<em>Rise of the Ronin</em></a>, its historical open-world actioner set during the turbulent Bakumatsu period of Japanese history.</p>
