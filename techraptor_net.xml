            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>According to a new report, streaming giant Netflix is working on an animated adaptation of Naughty Dog's legendary platforming series&nbsp;<em>Crash Bandicoot</em>, and one of its stalwart animation partners is reported to be developing the show.</p>

<p>Per a report from Netflix-focused news platform <a href="https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/crash-bandicoot-animated-series-in-the-works-at-netflix/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">What's On Netflix</a>, the streaming company has been "quietly developing" the&nbsp;<em>Crash Bandicoot&nbsp;</em>series, and it's being worked on by none other than&nbsp;<em>Sonic Prime</em>'s&nbsp;WildBrain Studios.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, no further details regarding the potential&nbsp;<em>Crash Bandicoot&nbsp;</em>series are forthcoming, and since Netflix has a habit of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-netflix-series-is-officially-canceled" rel="nofollow">canceling shows</a> (as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/boss-fight-entertainment-netflix-shutdown" rel="nofollow">shutting down subsidiaries</a>&nbsp;in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-team-blue-shut-down-report" rel="nofollow">gaming space</a>), the show may never actually see the light of day.</p>

That show also featured a cameo from Crash's sister Coco.</p>

<p>This potential Netflix series would, however, mark the marsupial's first starring role, assuming it goes ahead. Presumably, we'll also be seeing some of Crash's most iconic allies, including Coco, the wise mask Aku Aku, and Tawna, whose design was revised for 2020's&nbsp;<em>Crash Bandicoot 4</em>.</p>

<p>As for what's happening elsewhere in the world of&nbsp;<em>Crash Bandicoot</em>, the&nbsp;<em>N. Sane Trilogy&nbsp;</em>remaster package crossed the 20 million sales mark <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crash-bandicoot-n-sane-trilogy-sales" rel="nofollow">back in June last year</a>, while 2019's&nbsp;<em>Crash Team Racing&nbsp;</em>remaster <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crash-team-racing-nitro-fueled-10m-sales" rel="nofollow">passed 10 million sales this year</a>.</p>

<p>Technically speaking, the bandicoot's latest video game outing is 2023's&nbsp;<em>Crash Team Rumble</em>, a multiplayer spinoff for which updates concluded less than a year after its initial release.</p>




<p>It remains to be seen whether Netflix's&nbsp;<em>Crash Bandicoot&nbsp;</em>series materializes, but if it does, it'll join a host of other video game adaptations on the platform, including the likes of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-live-action-series-netflix-soon" rel="nofollow">upcoming live-action&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>series</a>, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-devil-may-cry-renewed-second-season" rel="nofollow">animated&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>show</a>, and a series <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/minecraft-animated-series-netflix" rel="nofollow">based on&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em></a>.</p>
