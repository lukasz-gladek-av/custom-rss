            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/shadowveil-legend-of-five-rings-preview-thematic-magic<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Legend of the Five Rings</em> (<em>L5R</em>) has been a popular feudal Japanese tabletop setting since the mid-90s as a collectible card game and roleplaying game. Both have seen several iterations and the license has changed ownership from the original developer. Both the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/legend-of-five-rings-lcg-review-new-dynasty" rel="nofollow">CCG</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/legend-of-five-rings-rpg-review-l5r-rpg-core-rulebook-and-games-masters-kit" rel="nofollow">RPG</a> were unique in that they didn't purely focus on combat, and the social elements played a huge thematic part of the games. They also featured an ongoing narrative, with tournament winners choosing how the story developed.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-18.jpg?itok=bMYiZ_ZI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-18.jpg?itok=v6UWts6i 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>My retainers brought the chop to the Goblins.</figcaption></figure><p>When I heard that the first <em>L5R</em> video game was being developed, I stepped away from the tabletop, picked up my controller, and stood ready to judge <em>Shadowveil:</em> <em>Legend of the Five Rings</em> as only a tabletop gamer could. It must be noted that I've been playing both the <em>L5R</em> card game and roleplaying game since 1995. I've played through all versions (reviewing the latest versions of both here on TechRaptor), and I've read all the published <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/swords-and-spirits-preview-legend-of-five-rings-fiction" rel="nofollow">tie-in fiction</a>, as well as being a huge samurai and ninja nerd (and Japan in general). So I was going to be a tough audience for this.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-4.jpg?itok=eG9ZykLS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-4.jpg?itok=sYOshyZb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Our demo brief for the first 2 levels of&nbsp;<em>Shadowveil: Legend of the Five Rings</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>As with all my tabletop reviews, I judge theme pretty harshly. If you're going to throw a setting in your title, you better live up to it, rather than it being a paper-thin layer on top. So I was always going to judge it on theme before how good it actually was. If it lived up to the setting, I could forgive poor gameplay, but never the other way around. I got to test <em>Shadowveil</em> with a preview code, so not all elements of the game were available, and some things may change by the time the game releases fully on Mar 04.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-7.jpg?itok=kyroIged 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-7.jpg?itok=WN-VyIAa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Kuni Yori is abolsultey as sketchy as he looks.</figcaption></figure><p>My concerns about theme were immediately alleviated, as soon as the first dialogue box opened. The <em>L5R</em> setting features several clans, all vying for power with different strengths and goals. The Crab clan, who are the focus of <em>Shadowveil</em>, guard the rest of the empire against the Shadowlands, a corrupted realm filled with demons, evil spirits, goblins, and other creatures, are unique in their outlook in that they don't care for honor or social politics. Victory is simply everything, and the methods are immaterial.</p>

<p>This stoic realism was captured immediately, and also told me that I wouldn't need to worry about how <em>Shadowveil</em> would deal with the social politics of the different clans, this was going to be war, the part of the empire that didn't care for etiquette or courtly virtues. But that element wasn't written out, as it could easily have been. It's obvious that not all is as it seems as the lead pair of characters, a brother and sister pair of Crab clan samurai reach a walled outpost in need of repair, and some internal politics are obvious from the off.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-8.jpg?itok=4QZwt1UG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-8.jpg?itok=eyTnTtxt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I was very pleased to see named characters I recognised from the <em>L5R</em> setting.</figcaption></figure><p>In the full game, you will be able to choose between 2 famous characters from the setting, Hida O-Ushi, a berserker warrior, and her bother Hida Sukune, a more thoughtful and tactical samurai. Our build saw us taking O-Ushi, and leading our warriors to war. The first few dialogue boxes take you through the setting introduction, not drawing it out, but giving those new to it enough to go on, and then you're off on your first outing, beyond the wall, and into the shadowlands.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-11.jpg?itok=MToQK16X 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-11.jpg?itok=0ooK3cnw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Your choice of deck focuses on a specific class and the berserker choice is about smashing heads.</figcaption></figure><p>After going through the gate, you're into the game, which&nbsp;features roguelike runs, with you choosing the path of progression. You can select cards for abilities and items for your fighters and choose their placement in combat, but the battles happen automatically, with your fighters attacking as per their class. You start off with your main character and 2 basic samurai, but you can unlock other classes like the scout and witch hunter on subsequent runs, along with upgrading your basic samurai into formidable fighters themselves.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-10.jpg?itok=Hq4XR-FD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-10.jpg?itok=L8wGsjQG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The roguelike journey begins with the first step.</figcaption></figure><p>During the run you collect cards, which unlock abilities. These are either generic or class-locked, and duplicate copies can be combined into a more powerful version. You can also collect items and other resources to unlock further elements as you progress. Some only benefit you during that run, like jade, which is used when you rest to heal and gain temporary boosts, others you take back with you, unlocking character classes and items. Side quests are also available, with some key unlocks early in the game's story. throughout it all, your characters gain experience, which levels them up for subsequent run attempts, and later levels.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-3.jpg?itok=cpbK406d 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-3.jpg?itok=XqwmJf2j 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>In a true RPG feel, everything here is your choice of upgrade.</figcaption></figure><p>The leveling-up screen gives you a whole host of options, from core stats, specific masteries and traits, unlocking more item and ability slots for cards you collect on the way, and also upgrading the core ability itself. When you upgrade stats, you get several stat package options that allow you to focus the character the way you want. The upgrade package was a lot more detailed than I thought, and really gave me a roleplaying feel that captures the the <em>L5R</em> RPG.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-16.jpg?itok=xIh6G1Ea 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-16.jpg?itok=7LEPwxrd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Enemy numbers mean nothing when you've invested everything in a run on a single berserker.</figcaption></figure><p>The&nbsp;roguelike runs are handled very well, with branching level selects with the side quests highlighted further down the route. Each failed attempt isn't death, but a withdrawal to recuperate and rearm, before heading out again, with some friendly banter from your sibling after your failed run. It took me 4 runs on my first go to finish to defeat the first boss, and I'd unlocked 2 other classes, taking 5 fighters total to battle in the last mission. I focused on gaining command points, which lets you deploy extra fighters, rather than upgrading abilities, but it looks like either option is viable, either taking a small force of starting-level abilities or a couple of super-samurai.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The second level was a lot harder, and I hit several walls early on and had to upgrade a couple of times to even make it halfway. Tactical resting became key, and positioning choices at the start of each battle really started to matter.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-14.jpg?itok=QybwHeAH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-14.jpg?itok=PEfHKgn3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Rest Timing and option selection is as key as to everything else you chose in completing a run.</figcaption></figure><h2>Shadowveil: Legend of the Five Rings Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Thematically, <em>Shadowveil</em> nails it. It captures the setting very well, even with the limited single-clan view, which allows them to focus the gameplay on the combat side of <em>L5R</em> without feeling like it's missing the social side. Yet it still captures the politics, even the internal politics of the very unpolitical Crab clan. The RPG elements had surprising depth, and the blend of permanent development you can control, to the random party development in the runs works very well. As a tabletop gamer of all genres, I love turn-based strategy, but honestly, the auto-battler is doing pretty much what I would be doing only faster, which lets you focus on the overall strategy of the run.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>L5R</em> fans would obviously love to see all of the clans represented, across the full setting with all facets of what we love about the CCG and RPG, but the depth of that game would be huge, and probably not for the mainstream market. What <em>Shadowveil</em> does is capture what's important for <em>L5R</em>, in a perfect mix of theme and gameplay, that while might not be for everyone, looks and plays great and may introduce more players to a deep and incredible setting that tabletop gamers already love.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-ui-problems-fixes-coming<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>developer Firaxis has promised it will implement fixes for some of the most common criticisms being aimed at the game, including its UI, missing gameplay features, and more.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/en-GB/civ-vii/news/message-from-firaxis-games/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Civilization&nbsp;</em>website, the studio says it's been "poring over" player feedback, including Steam reviews the game has received during the first couple of days of its early access (as opposed to Early Access) period.</p>

<p>As a reminder,&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-early-access-mixed-reviews-50k-players" rel="nofollow">picked up a lot of negative reviews</a> from players on Steam since it launched in advanced access yesterday. Players have criticized the game's user interface, as well as what they perceive to be a paucity of features compared to&nbsp;<em>Civilization 6</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/civilization-7-ui-fix-firaxis-tanks.jpg?itok=cGM0YO8k 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/civilization-7-ui-fix-firaxis-tanks.jpg?itok=qBCp5QLz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Firaxis says fixes are coming for some of&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7</em>'s issues.</figcaption></figure><p>Firaxis goes on to say that it's identified three core areas in which&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>needs improvement, and yes, the game's UI is one of them.</p>

<p>The studio says the UI is its "top priority", and that fixes will include making the interface "more intuitive", improving readability, and improving polish, among other things. More information will be shared "as soon as [the studio] can".</p>

<p>According to the post, Firaxis' next major area of improvement is implementing community-requested features into&nbsp;<em>Civ 7</em>, including adding teams to multiplayer games, increasing map variety, and enabling the customization of city and religion names. These things will, of course, be included in upcoming patches for free.</p>

<p>The third major area of improvement for&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>focuses on quality-of-life improvements, with the first of such features rolling out as part of Patch 1.1.0 in March. That's where you'll find improvements and tweaks to the game's AI, as well as UI adjustments and more.</p>




<p>Firaxis says it will share a development roadmap for&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>as soon as it's able, but for now, it wants you to know that fixes are coming for some of the problems you might have been having with the game.</p>

<p><em>Civilization 7</em>'s full launch is scheduled for February 11th, but you can play it now if you picked up the Deluxe or Founders Editions of the game. It's available for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1295660/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_VII/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/sid-meier-s-civilization-vii/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-for-xbox-series-xs/9N23HJHSC6BL" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>
