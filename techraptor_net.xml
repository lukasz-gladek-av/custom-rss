            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Paradox has released its financial statement for 2025, as well as for the fourth quarter of the year specifically, and it looks like <em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 </em>wasn't exactly the success the studio hoped for.</p><p>In a press release summarizing the studio's year, Paradox reports a fall in profits of 162% for the fourth quarter when compared to the previous year, as well as an 80% drop for the year as a whole.</p><p>Paradox doesn't specifically blame <em>Bloodlines 2</em> for the year's disappointing figure, but it does point to "amortization and write-downs of [the game]" for the fourth quarter, so it's not a big stretch to imagine that <em>Bloodlines 2</em>'s poor performance had a knock-on effect for 2025 as a whole, too.</p><figure role="group">

<p>Revenues for the quarter technically increased, driven largely by Paradox's strategy-focused back catalog (as well as the newly-released <em>Europa Universalis V</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paradox-europa-universalis-v-project-caesar-maybe" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="94d6591e-5da9-4df4-85db-66063c38e046" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">first teased in May last year</a>), but sales for the year as a whole remained static when compared to last year.</p><p>Paradox CEO Fredrik Wester admits that <em>Bloodlines 2 </em>"did not meet [the company's] commercial expectations", but he says his studio is now reassessing its resource allocation to ensure it focuses on the right projects in future.</p><p><em>Bloodlines 2 </em>was released in October following a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-indefinitely" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="14f47468-9696-4619-adfe-4a904a94f05a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">very lengthy</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-back-developed-by-chinese-room" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="424a86e4-db05-4ea2-9339-418c1fb748b3" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">troubled development cycle</a>. The game was met with criticism for its perceived lack of similarities to Troika's original <em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines</em>, as well as shallow gameplay and a lack of meaningful RPG elements.</p><p>The game's poor reception led Dan Pinchbeck, co-founder of developer The Chinese Room, to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloodlines-2-name-chinese-room" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ec744b99-1543-4387-b78c-dd265b6df66b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">suggest that the project's name was ill-fitting</a>, and that he and another former <em>Bloodlines 2 </em>producer attempted to convince execs "to not call it <em>Bloodlines 2</em>". Evidently, those efforts fell on deaf ears.</p>
