            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new beginner-friendly role-playing game has gone live on Kickstarter. David Marron's first major campaign on the platform is <em>Wizard Community College</em>, an RPG that revolves around learning magic at a magic school. The twist is that magic can easily get out of control if you're not careful.</p>



<p>According to the campaign page, <em>Wizard Community College</em> is a role-playing card game designed for 3-8 players. Each game is meant to last about twenty minutes. As the name implies, the players are newly inducted student wizards, solving problems with spells that go horribly wrong. The promo material is light-hearted and comedic, invoking works like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/strixhaven-curriculum-of-chaos-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Strixhaven</em></a>&nbsp;and the TV show,&nbsp;<em>Community</em>.</p>

The rules can easily be taught in about two minutes. The game is GM-less, allowing all players to contribute to the fiction. Lastly, it is designed to contain the best elements of a one-shot adventure. If you have been looking for a way to bring players into the hobby that isn't <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> or Monster of the Week, this may be the answer.</p>

<p>Setting up a game of <em>Wizard Community College</em> is simple. The scene is established by drawing an Event Card. This will give players objectives to complete. From there, players take turns in clockwise order, casting spells to solve the problem. Those spells are represented by spell cards.</p>

<p>Whenever a spell is cast, a disk is drawn at random from a bag. The symbol of the disk determines how the spell acts up. The color determines which player gets to explain how the spell messes up. The next player then reacts to the complication. This repeats until the main objectives are completed.</p>

<p>There is only pledge tier <em>Wizard Community College</em>: a physical copy of the game at an MSRP of $20 not including shipping. No add-ons or stretch goals are planned. This was an intentional choice by Marron to keep the project affordable and straightforward. A copy of the game contains the following:</p>

<ul><li>45 Spell Cards</li>
	<li>27 Magic Item Cards</li>
	<li>36 Major Event Cards</li>
	<li>18 Minor Event Cards</li>
	<li>8 Double-Sided Character Cards</li>
	<li>9 Player Aid Cards</li>
	<li>32 Colored Wooden Disks</li>
	<li>1 Drawstring Bag</li>
</ul><p>At the time of writing, Wizard Community College has raised&nbsp;<span><span>$3,380, which is just shy of its funding goal of $4,000. The campaign ends on October 31.</span></span></p>
