            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Atlus has announced that <em>Persona 3 Reload</em>, a full ground-up remake of the original 2006 JRPG, has reached a brand new sales milestone.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://x.com/Atlus_West/status/1951080103439413554" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on social media,&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload&nbsp;</em>has hit two million sales since <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-persona-3-reload-trailer" rel="nofollow">launching last February</a>. The new sales figure means the game has picked up an additional million sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-3-reload-sells-over-1-million-copies-fastest-in-atlus-history" rel="nofollow">since its launch week</a>, during which it cemented itself as Atlus' fastest-selling game (until being <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metaphor-refantazio-sales-1m-already" rel="nofollow">overtaken by&nbsp;<em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em></a>, that is).</p>

<p>News of&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload</em>'s new sales milestone also comes just a handful of hours after the game was announced to be coming to Nintendo Switch 2 during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">yesterday's Partner Showcase Direct presentation</a>. It'll land on Nintendo's newest console on October 23rd.</p>

<p>The game focuses on an unnamed teenage protagonist who must battle through the mysterious tower of Tartarus at night while building relationships with his school friends and other acquaintances during the day.</p>

<p><i>Persona 3 Reload&nbsp;</i>lacks some of the features introduced by 2009's&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Portable</em>, including the playable female protagonist and associated social links. It also technically lacks much of the "Answer" storyline introduced in expanded re-release&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 FES</em>, although a version of that story was later sold as an additional DLC pack for&nbsp;<em>Reload</em>.</p>




<p><em>Persona 3 Reload</em>'s success has spurred Atlus on to create another&nbsp;remake in the form of the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Persona 4 Revival</em>, which was revealed during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">this year's Xbox summer showcase</a>. We don't yet know when that one's arriving, unfortunately.</p>

<p>In the meantime, you can check out&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2161700/Persona_3_Reload/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/persona-3-reload/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/persona-3-reload/9nkk6z0k3rh2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and it's coming to Switch 2 in October.&nbsp;</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Switch 2 Sales Hit 6m Worldwide as Nintendo Revenue Soars]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-financials-q1-2026</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/switch-2-sales-hit-6m-worldwide-as-nintendo-revenue-soars.1259541/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has released its financial statement for the first quarter of the fiscal year, and shockingly enough, the company's revenue is up when compared to the previous year, while Switch 2 sales are looking pretty solid overall.</p>

<p>As revealed in its accompanying financial <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250801_2e.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">presentation</a>, Nintendo's sales jumped by 132% between April and June when compared to the same period a year prior. This is, of course, largely down to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">the release</a> of the Switch 2 in early June.</p>

<p>Net profits rose by around 18.6% when compared to last year, but as Nintendo points out, the Switch 2 has a smaller profit margin than the original Switch, which accounts for what might be a smaller number than you expected to see, given the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-fastest-selling-nintendo-console" rel="nofollow">console's success</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-sales-q1-financials-bowser.jpg?itok=ARCic_pX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-sales-q1-financials-bowser.jpg?itok=YTIKsAO_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Looks like Bowser and his son bought themselves a Switch 2. Aww.</figcaption></figure><p>It's fair to say the Switch 2 has been a success, too. According to Nintendo, the console managed to sell over six million units within its first seven weeks, and since we're nowhere near the holiday season yet, those numbers are only likely to increase by the end of the year.</p>

<p><em>Mario Kart World</em>, which was the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">main launch title</a> for the Switch 2 where Nintendo is concerned, managed to sell 5.62 million units in the weeks leading up to June 30th as well. Technically, though, that figure refers to "sell-in" rather than "sell-through", which includes both copies Nintendo sent to business partners and those bought by customers either directly through the Nintendo site or as downloadable software.</p>

<p>As Nintendo points out, it's also got more than a few games in the pipeline for the Switch 2. This month will see the release of wheelchair basketball sim&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/drag-x-drive-release-date" rel="nofollow"><em>Drag x Drive</em></a>, and hotly-anticipated games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-release-date-pokemon-presents" rel="nofollow">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a>&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metroid-prime-4-beyond-2025" rel="nofollow">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>&nbsp;</i>(both also coming to the original Switch) will arrive later in the year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-financials-q1-2026.jpg?itok=8k2241Sr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-financials-q1-2026.jpg?itok=rNRuUP-_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond&nbsp;</em>is just one of Nintendo's holiday titles (we assume).</figcaption></figure><p>In any case, things are looking up for Nintendo right now, although whether the Switch 2 can replicate the original console's long-term success remains to be seen.</p>

<p>Nintendo's financial statement for the first quarter follows <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">yesterday's Partner Showcase Direct</a>, during which we learned about new releases like Square Enix's HD-2D action RPG&nbsp;<em>The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales&nbsp;</em>and Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Stories 3</em>.</p>
