            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-rumble-global-release-delayed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega has announced that upcoming free-to-play battle royale-style party game&nbsp;<em>Sonic Rumble&nbsp;</em>has been delayed, and the studio hasn't announced a new release date for the game either.</p>

<p>The game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-rumble-release-date" rel="nofollow">originally due to launch</a> on May 8th, but in <a href="https://x.com/Sonic_Rumble/status/1917453885326688412" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post on X</a>, Sega says it's made the "difficult decision" to delay the game's release indefinitely. The studio says it wants to "build the kind of high-quality, long-lasting&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>game" its players deserve.</p>

<p>Sega says it knows the news of <i>Sonic Rumble</i>'s delay will be "disappointing" to fans, but that it thinks taking the extra time to work on the game is the "right choice for the future of&nbsp;<em>Sonic Rumble</em>".</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Sonic Rumble</em>, it's a&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys</em>-esque free-to-play battle royale party game coming to PC and mobile...well, at some point in the near future, apparently.</p>

<p>The game comes with a range of modes, including a classic-style Run mode, which sees players racing against one another, as well as Ring Battle and more.</p>

<p>Sega says the game has been designed with shorter games in mind, ensuring that anyone can pick up and play&nbsp;<em>Sonic Rumble&nbsp;</em>"in their spare time".</p>




<p>As you'd probably expect, a range of&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>characters will be available for you to play as, including Sonic himself (naturally), as well as Shadow, Tails, Amy, and many more.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Sonic Rumble&nbsp;</em>when it launches at some point in the future on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2951690/Sonic_Rumble/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sega.sonicrumble&amp;hl=en_GB" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Android</a>, and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ph/app/sonic-rumble/id6511215584" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">iOS</a>. Hopefully, Sega will announce a new&nbsp;<em>Sonic Rumble&nbsp;</em>release date sometime soon, so stay tuned for more.</p>
