            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bubble-ghost-remake-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Nakama Game Studio and publisher SelectaPlay have announced a release date for&nbsp;<em>Bubble Ghost Remake</em>, a reimagined version of the cult classic 1987 platformer.</p>

<p>Launching on March 27th,&nbsp;<em>Bubble Ghost Remake&nbsp;</em>offers a "reimagined, visually captivating gameplay experience" largely based on the 1987 original, although it'll also boast a host of new features to bring it up to speed with modern gaming standards.</p>

<p>These features include new game modes, boss battles, and collectibles, as well as "many more surprises". It sounds like you'll have to play&nbsp;<em>Bubble Ghost Remake&nbsp;</em>yourself if you want to find out what those surprises are.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bubble-ghost-remake-release-date-level.jpg?itok=ILBGCzH0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bubble-ghost-remake-release-date-level.jpg?itok=yLkhiMU1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Bubble Ghost Remake&nbsp;</em>offers a fresh take on a classic platformer.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Bubble Ghost Remake</em>'s Story mode will offer over 40 levels to play through, each of which promise "hours of entertainment and challenge", according to the developers.</p>

<p>If you don't fancy playing through the game with its narrative trappings intact, you can instead opt for the Arcade mode, and Challenge and Speedrun modes are available if you're the kind of person who likes to test themselves to their limits.</p>

<p>These aren't the aforementioned surprises, though; Nakama Game Studio promises further game modes you can unlock "for an even more thrilling gameplay experience".</p>

<p>Naturally, the game will feature revamped graphics and sound when compared to its bleepy-bloopy 80s counterpart, and you can also look forward to in-game achievements, so if you're playing the Switch version, you don't have to miss out on that sweet dopamine hit.</p>




<p>As well as the digital versions, <i>Bubble Ghost Remake&nbsp;</i>will also be available as a physical release. In North America, you'll be able to get the standard version, but there's also an EU-exclusive Collector's Edition for Switch that packs in some extra goodies.</p>

<p>These include the game itself (of course), as well as a prequel comic, a soundtrack CD, a "selection of stickers", and a special standee. If you love yourself some&nbsp;<em>Bubble Ghost</em>, you'll want to plump for that.</p>

<p><em>Bubble Ghost Remake&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2412240/Bubble_Ghost_Remake/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Bubble-Ghost-Remake-2702820.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> on March 27th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dawn-of-war-and-company-of-heroes-developer-relic-shares-future-plans.1104912/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/relic-entertainment-future-plans<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Relic Entertainment, the studio behind games like&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Dawn of War&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Company of Heroes</em>, has announced its plans for the future, and while they're rather vague on the whole, there are some interesting tidbits to pore over.</p>

<p>In a press release, Relic, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sega-relic-entertainment-layoffs" rel="nofollow">became independent</a> after being sold off by Sega in March last year (sustaining a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/relic-entertainment-layoffs" rel="nofollow">number of layoffs</a> into the bargain), says it's identified three key pillars for its strategy when it comes to the studio's future.</p>

<p>Pillar one involves "deepening commitment to existing titles", which means providing updates and continuing support for Relic's existing games. At the moment, the company is actively supporting strategy titles&nbsp;<em>Company of Heroes 3&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Age of Empires 4</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/relic-entertainment-future-plans-company-of-heroes-3-battle.jpg?itok=UzEe6FaP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/relic-entertainment-future-plans-company-of-heroes-3-battle.jpg?itok=eAMsoasP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Relic will continue supporting&nbsp;<em>Company of Heroes 3</em>, but it has plans for new games too.</figcaption></figure><p>Relic's second major new pillar is titled "independent development, creative experiences", and it involves the developer branching out into "smaller-scope, in-house games", as well as "continuing to develop the larger, complex strategy titles" for which it's known.</p>

<p>Finally - and perhaps most interestingly - Relic says it wants to "reimagin[e] classics", finding ways to "bring [its] classic titles to modern audiences". This could entail "re-releases, remasters, or brand-new franchise experiences" that capture the originals' "spirit" while appealing to new players as well.</p>

<p>Relic CEO Justin Dowdeswell says the studio's new direction marks "a significant milestone", and that he's "confident" Relic will be able to deliver "innovative, high-quality games that resonate with players around the world".</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Relic doesn't commit to announcing exactly what any of the aforementioned games might be, so we don't know just how far away from that tantalizing&nbsp;<em>Dawn of War&nbsp;</em>remaster we might be. Let's hope it's just around the corner, eh?</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-dawn-of-war-relic.jpg?itok=Z7ptPWPo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-dawn-of-war-relic.jpg?itok=DC8CvpIq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Let's hope that&nbsp;<em>Dawn of War&nbsp;</em>remaster is just around the corner.</figcaption></figure><p>If you were worried that Relic's independence from Sega meant it wouldn't be able to create its large-scale RTS games anymore, then it looks like you won't need to worry about that. We'll just be getting some extra experiments on the side.</p>

<p>What this means for Relic in a broader sense remains to be seen, though. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things Relic-related.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Civilization 7 VR Version Announced for Meta Quest 3, Coming in Spring]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-vr-spring-meta-quest</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/civilization-7-vr-version-announced-for-meta-quest-3-coming-in-spring.1104849/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-vr-spring-meta-quest<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Firaxis and Meta have announced that&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>is coming to VR, with a version of the upcoming 4X grand strategy game heading to Meta Quest 3 and 3S devices in spring.</p>

<p>The game is available to wishlist in VR form right now, and it marks the first time the&nbsp;<em>Civilization&nbsp;</em>series has been available in VR. Naturally, the VR version of the game will feature a redesigned interface, too.</p>

<p><em>Civilization 7 - VR&nbsp;</em>revolves around something the developers are calling the Command Table, which is a sort of zoomed-out view of the action that makes everything look as though you're playing it as a tabletop game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/civilization-7-vr-command-table.jpg?itok=v9zRev6f 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/civilization-7-vr-command-table.jpg?itok=0XJKTp4q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>will look a little different in VR.</figcaption></figure><p>World leaders will stand around the Command Table, reacting when you make decisions like forging alliances with them or declaring war on their nations.</p>

<p>You'll also be able to "bring the Command Table into your surroundings with dynamic mixed reality", according to Meta, so it sounds like you'll be able to superimpose&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>into the real world if you so desire.</p>

<p>The VR version of the game will support solo play and multiplayer for you and up to three others, although they will need to be playing the Meta Quest version of the game; you won't be able to play this one with regular&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>players, unfortunately.</p>

<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7 - VR&nbsp;</em>right here. It's set for a spring 2025 release, although no more specific release date has been revealed yet.</p>




<p>Elsewhere in&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>news, the non-VR version of the game launched into its advanced access period last week and immediately <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-early-access-mixed-reviews-50k-players" rel="nofollow">met with criticism from players</a>, who highlighted its user interface and a perceived paucity of game features as particular sticking points.</p>

<p>Following those criticisms, Firaxis <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-ui-problems-fixes-coming" rel="nofollow">promised to fix players' problems</a> with&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7</em>, highlighting three areas to address (namely UI, community-requested features, and polish) without committing to specific timings.</p>

<p><em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>is due out on February 11th for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1295660/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_VII/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/sid-meier-s-civilization-vii/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-for-xbox-series-xs/9N23HJHSC6BL" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>. The VR version arrives in spring for <a href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-vr/5781689118524197/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Meta Quest 3 and 3S</a>.</p>
