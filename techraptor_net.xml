            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-56<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has revealed the release date for&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.6, and the main story chapter in this update will take you back to the land of Mondstadt for an "interlude chapter".</p>

<p>After the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-5-5-release-date" rel="nofollow">last update</a> took you to a lava-filled volcano and introduced you to the last tribe of Natlan, Version 5.6, also known as "Paralogism", takes things in a more nostalgic direction. It's launching across all platforms on May 7th.</p>

<p>In the new Archon Quest Interlude chapter, you'll travel back to Mondstadt in order to take part in an "unexpected trial" involving Albedo. You'll be investigating the crime associated with the trial, meeting figures from your past like Venti and the Knights of Favonius.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/genshin-impact-version-5.6-release-date-escoffier.jpg?itok=EjgsvBwf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/genshin-impact-version-5.6-release-date-escoffier.jpg?itok=ytNa1910 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>As ever,&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.6 will introduce new characters for your team.</figcaption></figure><p>Not only that, but you'll be defending Mondstadt from monsters (or perhaps that should be mondsters), as well as taking part in a "magical trial" to secure the support of powerful mage Lady Alice in the defense of the city.</p>

<p>Two new characters will also be joining&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>in Version 5.6. The first, Escoffier, is a spear-wielding Cryo user who "blends culinary flair with elemental power". She can deal pretty heavy damage and heal allies thanks to her Cooking Mek.</p>

<p>Joining Escoffier in this update is Ifa, a 4-star Anemo catalyst wielder who hails from Natlan. He can automatically heal active characters when their HP drops below a certain point, making him ideal for players who prefer to get stuck into the action.</p>

<p>Escoffier and Ifa will be available during Version 5.6's first half, along with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-celebrates-version-43s-release-with-navias-graceful-gunbrella-gameplay" rel="nofollow">Navia</a>. Following that, reruns of Kinich and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/genshin-impact-raiden-shogun-baal-build-guide" rel="nofollow">Raiden Shogun</a> will be available in the second half, and the Chronicled Wish is also coming back, this time with characters from Inazuma up for grabs.</p>




<p>As always, three codes are also available for you to grab some free stuff in&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact</em>, and here they are.</p>

<ul><li>GI56Paralogism - 100 Primogems, 10 Mystic Enhancement Ore</li>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/breath-of-fire-iv-gog</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cult-hit-jrpg-breath-of-fire-iv-returns-via-gog.1173705/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/breath-of-fire-iv-gog<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GOG has announced a re-release of the classic PS1-era JRPG&nbsp;<em>Breath of Fire IV</em>, which is now available via PC a quarter-century after its initial release on the PlayStation.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1915692579011649567" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, over 22,000 people voted for <i>Breath of Fire IV</i>'s inclusion as part of GOG's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gog-preservation-program" rel="nofollow">Preservation Program</a>, which aims to support games long after their publishers or developers cease doing so.</p>

<p>According to GOG, the new PC release of&nbsp;<em>Breath of Fire IV</em>, which appears to be based on the original 2003 PC version rather than the PS1 version, is "fully optimized" for modern machines, sporting Windows 10 and 11 support, English and Japanese localizations, and various new options.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/breath-of-fire-iv-gog-planks.jpg?itok=qe_nIIan 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/breath-of-fire-iv-gog-planks.jpg?itok=lhmfTILX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Breath of Fire IV&nbsp;</em>is now available on PC thanks to the folks at GOG.</figcaption></figure><p>Other than those improvements, though, this remains very much the same&nbsp;<em>Breath of Fire IV&nbsp;</em>you may already know and love from 2000, and if you don't (and you're a JRPG fan), then I'd recommend checking it out tout de suite.</p>

<p>It's not just&nbsp;<em>Breath of Fire IV</em>, either. Other games joining the GOG Preservation Program today include the likes of&nbsp;<em>Worms Armageddon</em>,&nbsp;<em>Realms of the Haunting</em>, and three&nbsp;<em>Ultima&nbsp;</em>games, thus "completing the&nbsp;<em>Ultima&nbsp;</em>series in the Program", according to GOG.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Breath of Fire IV</em>, it is, as the name suggests, the fourth game in Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Breath of Fire&nbsp;</em>series. Like previous games, this one also has you playing as Ryu, although it's not the same Ryu in each game.</p>

<p>This time around, your perspective is split between Ryu, who's found naked in a sand ditch by allies Nina and Cray, and Fou-Lu, a recently-reawoken emperor looking to regain the throne he lost hundreds of years ago.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/breath-of-fire-iv-gog-fou-lu.jpg?itok=pFM54y93 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/breath-of-fire-iv-gog-fou-lu.jpg?itok=3tlLjr-m 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll spend your time with both Ryu and Fou-Lu in&nbsp;<em>Breath of Fire IV</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Gameplay-wise, the game is a fairly straightforward turn-based JRPG, although it's got some tricks up its sleeve that make it stand out in what was a pretty crowded market at the time.</p>

<p><em>Breath of Fire IV&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/breath_of_fire_iv" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via GOG</a>. Here's hoping for a&nbsp;<em>Breath of Fire III&nbsp;</em>release sometime soon, as unlikely as that might be.</p>

      <div><p>Capcom has announced a new sales milestone for flagship survival horror games&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil Village</em>, as well as new figures for several other games in the series.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/dev1_official/status/1915685807085805921" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Capcom reveals that&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em>has hit ten million sales, which means the game has managed to pick up another million sales for itself <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-9m" rel="nofollow">between January and now</a>.</p>

<p><em>Resident Evil Village</em>, meanwhile, has crossed the eleven million mark. It <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-village-sales-10-million" rel="nofollow">crossed the ten million line</a> in June last year, so it's taking a little longer to pass those milestones than&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4</em>, but that's still a pretty impressive performance nonetheless. Capcom also shared this cool artwork to commemorate the occasion.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/resident-evil-4-sales-10m-artwork.jpg?itok=gUj5eoPl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/resident-evil-4-sales-10m-artwork.jpg?itok=a3LFXN3V 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Two of Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>games have reached big new sales milestones.</figcaption></figure><p>In addition to these two figures, Capcom also announced new milestones for&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>3</em>, although it's harder to tell whether these are sales figures or player counts, given that both games are available via Xbox Game Pass right now.</p>

<p><em>Resident Evil 7&nbsp;</em>has also passed the 15 million mark according to Capcom, but again, since that game has historically been available as part of Game Pass or PlayStation Plus, it's hard to say whether the figure refers to sales or simply player count.</p>

<p>In any case, the figures show that Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>franchise is still going strong, so hopefully, it won't be too long until the next installment of the franchise is revealed.</p>

<p>Roughly five years passed between the release of&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 6&nbsp;</em>and the semi-reboot&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</em>, and a further four years went by until&nbsp;<em>Village&nbsp;</em>arrived, so by that logic, we should be getting fairly close to a&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 9&nbsp;</em>reveal, at the very least.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/resident-evil-4-sales-scarecrows-village.jpg?itok=nJJvdwfR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/resident-evil-4-sales-scarecrows-village.jpg?itok=RxuF1k5X 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Surely, the successor to&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil Village&nbsp;</em>is coming soon.</figcaption></figure><p>Until then, however, the various&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>games are available across pretty much all platforms, so you can pick your poison when it comes to survival horror.</p>
