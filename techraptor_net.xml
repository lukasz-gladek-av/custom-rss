            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-major-baldurs-gate-3-update-patch-notes<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's the end of an era. Larian Studios has released the final major&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>update, and there's plenty in it to tide you over until the studio's next release, including crossplay, a photo mode, and more.</p>

<p>Patch 8 follows on from the last major numbered patch, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-patch-notes" rel="nofollow">September's Patch 7</a>. While it'll serve as the final major patch for the hugely popular CRPG, Larian does say it will continue to support&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>with "minor bug fixing".</p>

<p>Larian says that it has "told [its] stories the way [it] needed to tell them" with&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>, and that it's "time for the team to go back to our cave and hang the armor on the wall" in order to focus on the next Larian game.</p>

Cross-platform progression has also been added, so you can pick up where you left off on PC or console.</p>

<p>If you're looking to play with mods, then you and your fellow players must have the same version of the mods in question installed. Some mods aren't available across all platforms, so make sure you're using compatible mods.</p>

<p>A photo mode has also been added to&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>, allowing you to "position and pose your party, play around with camera settings, and whack a few stickers on there" in order to create your very own bespoke&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>screenshots.</p>

<p>In order to celebrate the release of Patch 8,&nbsp;Larian has created a new animated short in conjunction with Spud Gun Studios, and you can check that short out here. Just make sure to have a tissue handy to dry your tears.</p>
