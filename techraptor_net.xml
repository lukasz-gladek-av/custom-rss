            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ready-or-not-ps5-xbox-summer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher VOID Interactive has announced that tactical FPS&nbsp;<em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em>is coming to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S later this year, and it'll be accompanied by two brand new levels for everyone to try out.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em>will land on current-gen consoles in the summer, although it doesn't have a release date yet. The game will also be made available on the Epic Games Store and the Microsoft Store at the same time.</p>

<p>Along with the console release,&nbsp;<em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em>will also be getting a free DLC pack by the name of&nbsp;<em>Stories from Los Sueños</em>, which will add two new stages you can tackle either in single-player or alongside friends in online co-op.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ready-or-not-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-soldiers.jpg?itok=w-piyrbW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ready-or-not-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-soldiers.jpg?itok=ViUokash 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em>hits consoles in summer.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're playing on PC and you're worried you'll miss out on these extra levels, you needn't be. VOID says PC players will get the two extra stages "day-and-date" with the console release. That is, of course, in addition to levels and features that have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/huge-ready-or-not-november-update-adds-new-maps-and-more" rel="nofollow">already been added</a> to the game via <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ready-or-not-update-includes-new-maps-and-physics" rel="nofollow">updates</a>.</p>

<p>Pre-ordering&nbsp;<em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em>on either PS5 or Xbox Series X|S will also get you three special weapons, but if you're a PC player, you'll get these items for free.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Ready or Not</em>, VOID Interactive describes it as an "intense, tactical first-person shooter" in which you and your co-op partners (or just you, if you're in single-player mode) are SWAT officers sent in to defuse potentially volatile situations.</p>

<p>You may, for example, be sent in to negotiate the release of hostages, or you might be taking care of bomb disposal or dealing with suspects who've barricaded themselves inside a location. Suffice it to say this isn't one for the faint of heart.</p>




<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1144200/Ready_or_Not/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>. It's launching for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S sometime this summer.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-us-canada-april-24th</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-us-and-canada-pre-orders-set-for-next-week-after-delay.1167828/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-us-canada-april-24th<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced that Switch 2 pre-orders in the US will open next week, and the price of the console won't be changing as a result of previously-announced tariffs, although accessories are a different story.</p>

<p>In a post on its official website, the Japanese gaming giant says Switch 2 US pre-orders will open on April 24th. As previously announced as part of the console's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">reveal</a>, the base machine will cost $449.99, and a bundle with&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>will set you back $499.99.</p>

<p>Pre-orders were originally due to begin earlier this month, but they were delayed due to sweeping economic tariffs imposed on countries and regions around the world by President Donald Trump. Some of those regions, like Vietnam and China, are critical to Nintendo's hardware manufacturing and production process.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-april-24th-console.jpg?itok=89Gnm850 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-april-24th-console.jpg?itok=Vi2fEMl7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Switch 2 pre-orders are back on in the US.</figcaption></figure><p>Since the pre-order delay, Trump's stance on his tariffs has been...confusing, to say the least. Suffice it to say that for now, at least, tariffs on all countries except China have been paused for a 90-day period, and several electronic devices <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c20xn626y81o" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">have been exempted</a> from the China tariffs (although not gaming consoles, unfortunately).</p>

<p>As well as the Switch 2's price remaining the same, Nintendo has also confirmed that both&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">Mario Kart World</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2" rel="nofollow">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>&nbsp;</em>won't be getting price changes. They'll stay at $80 and $70, respectively.</p>

<p>However, a number of Switch 2 accessories will see their prices increased "due to changes in market conditions", according to Nintendo. They include the Joy-Con 2 controllers, the Pro Controller, and the Camera. You can read a full list of accessory price changes via Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/nintendo-maintains-nintendo-switch-2-pricing-retail-pre-orders-to-begin-april-24-in-u-s/" rel="nofollow">original post</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mario-kart-world-switch-2-pre-orders.jpg?itok=oxkFaC8m 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mario-kart-world-switch-2-pre-orders.jpg?itok=CvAPNPrG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Mario Kart World</em>'s price isn't going anywhere, sadly.</figcaption></figure><p>It's not just the US, either. Canadian pre-orders will also go live on April 24th, following a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-pre-orders-delayed-canada" rel="nofollow">similar delay</a> in that country. There's still no news on the Switch 2's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-delayed-in-china-thanks-to-government-regulations-and-demand" rel="nofollow">release in China</a>, however.</p>

<p>You'll be able to pre-order a Switch 2 in the US and Canada starting from April 24th. The console itself is set to launch on June 5th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lords-of-fallen-20-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>CI Games has released&nbsp;the&nbsp;<em>Lords of the Fallen&nbsp;</em>2.0 update, representing what the developer and publisher calls the "definitive edition" of its game. As you'd expect, it's packing plenty of improvements.</p>

<p>The release of&nbsp;<em>Lords of the Fallen&nbsp;</em>2.0, along with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lords-of-fallen-update-15-modifiers" rel="nofollow">many updates</a> the game has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lords-of-fallen-update" rel="nofollow">received</a> since its launch back in October 2023, mean that CI Games has "aligned the game with our original vision", the developer says.</p>

<p>Changes include shared progression co-op, which allows players to play together across a shared campaign, as well as a free friend's pass. Much like the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-friends-pass-crossplay" rel="nofollow">friend's pass offered by Hazelight's&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em></a>, this pass allows a friend to experience the game alongside you for free, even if they don't own&nbsp;<em>Lords of the Fallen</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lords-of-the-fallen-2.0-hands.jpg?itok=6fe0ztDG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lords-of-the-fallen-2.0-hands.jpg?itok=4xp8gQ-Q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Lords of the Fallen</em>'s 2.0 update brings some big changes with it.</figcaption></figure><p>CI Games also says&nbsp;<em>Lords of the Fallen&nbsp;</em>2.0 features the Soulslike's "most responsive combat and movement yet", with weapon responsiveness, evasion, and lock-on all getting improvements.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to changes like a new lamp guidance mechanic, which allows you to find the nearest Vestige so you can get some respite from your adventure, as well as a dedicated jump button, an overhauled character creator, and much more.</p>

<p>More info on&nbsp;<em>Lords of the Fallen</em>'s 2.0 update, including other changes we haven't covered in our brief highlights, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1501750/view/527592442371768508" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">can be found here</a>, and you can check out a trailer spotlighting some of the game's new features below.</p>




<p>Despite its name,&nbsp;<em>Lords of the Fallen&nbsp;</em>2.0 isn't actually a sequel to <i>Lords of the Fallen</i>. You'll <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lords-of-fallen-2-2026-epic-exclusive" rel="nofollow">have to wait until 2026 for that</a>, assuming it doesn't get delayed or canceled.</p>

<p>Until then,&nbsp;<em>Lords of the Fallen&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1501750/Lords_of_the_Fallen/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/lords-of-the-fallen/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/lords-of-the-fallen/9N3CJZ3HFHTF" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-release-date-dlc-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has announced the release date for&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>on Nintendo Switch 2, and the game's major second DLC pack,&nbsp;<em>A Pirate's Fortune</em>, has also been revealed.</p>

<p>As revealed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-release-date-revealed-at-star-wars-celebration" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">during a livestream</a>,&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>will land on Nintendo's console on September 4th. The console itself is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">due for launch on June 5th</a>, so you won't have to wait too long between buying your Switch 2 and picking up Ubisoft's open-world&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>adventure.</p>

<p>If you already own&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>and you're waiting for news of the next DLC adventure, Ubisoft has you covered on that front as well.&nbsp;<em>A Pirate's Fortune&nbsp;</em>is the name of the game's second story pack, and it's coming in May.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-outlaws-dlc-2-a-pirates-fortune.jpg?itok=JcFN7WgX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-outlaws-dlc-2-a-pirates-fortune.jpg?itok=jLHc3OZv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>' second DLC,&nbsp;<em>A Pirate's Fortune</em>, is due out in May.</figcaption></figure><p>Arriving on May 15th,&nbsp;<em>A Pirate's Fortune&nbsp;</em>takes Kay Vess to the Khepi system, where she'll be teaming up with legendary pirate Hondo Ohnaka in order to take on Stinger Tash and her mean-sounding Rokana Raiders.</p>

<p>In true pirate fashion, you'll also be raiding a tomb; the Khepi Tomb will offer "secrets and hidden treasures" for you to discover. What's more, a whole new faction, the Miyuki Trade League, will offer up new Trailblazer rewards, and all you have to do in return is smuggle dangerous goods across the galaxy. What's new, right?</p>

<p>Along with the paid DLC,&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>will also be getting some free&nbsp;<em>Skeleton Crew</em>-inspired cosmetics on May 15th, including an outfit for Nix. Be sure to check that out if you want to dress up your cute little friend.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, it's an open-world action-adventure game developed by Ubisoft. Taking place between&nbsp;<em>The Empire Strikes Back&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Return of the Jedi</em>, the game follows scoundrel Kay Vess as she tries to pull off the heist of a lifetime.</p>

<p>Originally released last year, the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-february" rel="nofollow">underperformed compared to Ubisoft's expectations</a>, becoming one of the cornerstones of a change in strategy that involves day-one Steam releases and the adoption of an altered season pass model.</p>

<p>Our <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/star-wars-outlaws-review" rel="nofollow">Erren liked it</a>, though, and if you want to find out whether you do, there's a free demo for the game you can check out across all platforms.</p>

<p><em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>is available now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2842040/Star_Wars_Outlaws/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/star-wars-outlaws/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/star-wars-outlaws/9P87S3NP6SR2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. The Switch 2 version launches on September 4th.</p>
