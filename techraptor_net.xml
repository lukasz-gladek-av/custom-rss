            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has announced a new PS5 system software update beta, and if you like to use your DualSense controller across other devices besides your console, then you're in luck.</p>

<p>As revealed in a new PlayStation Blog <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/23/new-ps5-system-update-beta-previews-dualsense-wireless-controller-pairing-across-multiple-devices/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, the beta will start rolling out tomorrow. The main feature being introduced in this update is the ability to pair your DualSense with multiple devices, making it easier to switch between them whenever you like.</p>

<p>At the moment, if you want to switch from using your DualSense on your PS5 to using it on a PC, for instance, you need to pair the controller with the new machine every time you want to swap, but when the new update lands, that won't be the case anymore.</p>

<p>Once you've assigned a device to one of the face buttons, switching to that device will show a different number of player indicator lights on your controller, corresponding to the device you have connected. It's that simple!</p>

<p>Of course, you can also continue to use your DualSense via wired USB connection if your device supports it as well, but it's nice to know that switching between wireless connections will get easier.</p>

<p>As well as the new DualSense switching feature, Sony has also revealed a new Power Saver feature as part of its Road to Zero <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/csr/eco/RoadToZero/gm_en.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">environmental plan</a>. It won't be live in this update, but when it does arrive, you'll be able to cut performance in certain PS5 games in order to reduce power consumption.</p>

<p>In any case, the new PS5 system software beta begins rolling out in certain territories tomorrow. We don't know when the full release is coming yet, so stay tuned for more.</p>
