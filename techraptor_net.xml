            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Directive 8020</em>, the latest game from <em>Until Dawn </em>and <em>The Quarry </em>developer Supermassive Games, now has a release date, and it won't be too long until you can check this one out.</p><p>As announced in a new trailer, <em>Directive 8020 </em>is now set to launch across PC and current-gen consoles (although not the Switch 2) on May 12th. Pre-orders are open now if you're so inclined.</p><p>The announcement of the game's release date comes after Supermassive was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/supermassive-games-layoffs-directive-8020-delayed" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4db18d67-941e-4b12-935b-7652cefa5397" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">hit by layoffs back in July</a>, which also resulted in the game being delayed beyond its originally-intended 2025 release window. Evidently, the studio has now arrived at a point at which it feels comfortable releasing <em>Directive 8020</em>.</p><figure role="group">

<p>As for the game itself, Supermassive is promising "immersive cinematic storytelling and edge-of-your-seat horror" in <em>Directive 8020</em>, and it sounds as though Supermassive has put some work into the gameplay so things are a little more interactive this time around.</p><p>With that said, if you've played a Supermassive game (think <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/quarry" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9c41b165-ee61-4a44-9922-2f8e10b4b214" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>The Quarry</em></a>, the <em>Dark Pictures </em>games, or the original <em>Until Dawn</em>), then you'll probably know roughly what to expect from this one; it'll be a choice-focused horror adventure with plenty of tough decisions to make.</p><p>Story-wise, the game takes a lot of influence from movies like John Carpenter's iconic <em>The Thing</em>. The crew of the colony ship Cassiopeia crash-lands on the planet Tau Ceti f, and before long, they're being hunted by an alien capable of mimicking humans.</p><p>You'll have to "overcome your enemies using improvised weapons, lightning reflexes, and stealth", according to Supermassive, but you'll also need to make decisions about who might be hiding in plain sight as your alien enemy.</p>
<p><em>Directive 8020 </em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2255370/Directive_8020/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/directive-8020/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a>, and Xbox Series X|S on May 12th.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hazelight Studios, the company responsible for co-op adventures <em>Split Fiction </em>and <em>It Takes Two</em>, has revealed that it's already hard at work on its next game.</p><p>As revealed by studio head Josef Fares <a href="https://x.com/josef_fares/status/2021163743036486041" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">on social media platform X</a>, Hazelight's "next game [is] in the making". Fares revealed the news alongside a photo of himself in a motion-capture studio, with actors wearing mo-cap suits in the background.</p><p>Fares' arm artfully obscures the faces of the actors in question, however, so we don't know who's going to be in the game, nor do we know what the scene is that the group is working on. Still, it's nice to know Hazelight isn't resting on its laurels.</p><figure role="group">

<p>Unfortunately, Hazelight and Fares haven't revealed any further details about what they might be working on, so we don't know exactly what we can expect from the studio next.</p><p>However, given the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/it-takes-two-sales-almost-27m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="584c9873-b01a-4f97-88c9-bc5b2b3ddb0b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">overwhelming success</a> of all of Hazelight's previous co-op titles (namely <em>Split Fiction</em>, <em>It Takes Two</em>, and <em>A Way Out</em>), it's probably pretty safe to assume that Hazelight's next game will be a co-op adventure along similar lines to its previous three titles.</p><p>Hazelight's last game, <em>Split Fiction</em>, has proven so popular among players that it's already <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-movie-report" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="249fa328-8f25-4975-b468-c4dc37526434" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">netted itself a movie adaptation</a>, with actress Sydney Sweeney <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-movie-sydney-sweeney" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="105b35be-df6f-4f5c-8f24-3e9c7adc0b61" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">already attached to the project</a> alongside <em>Deadpool and Wolverine </em>writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick.</p><p>Indeed, movie and TV adaptations of Hazelight's previous adventure <em>It Takes Two </em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/it-takes-two-movie-and-tv-adaptations-in-works" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e533eb5a-c393-43f4-836a-16e1dbdf765e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">were announced back in 2022</a> as well, although we're yet to hear further details about those projects.</p>
<p>While you wait for whatever Hazelight's next game turns out to be, you can check out its latest, <em>Split Fiction</em>, on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2001120/Split_Fiction/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/split-fiction/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/split-fiction/9n1wxxd1rl8d" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/SPLIT-FICTION-2792072.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch 2</a> right now, and you can read our very own <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/split-fiction-review-everything-everywhere" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="97535e5a-e23e-4679-b20b-f4071ecead93" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Erren's review of the game right here</a>.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
