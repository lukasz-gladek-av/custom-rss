            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/killing-floor-3-delayed-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Tripwire Interactive has announced that upcoming multiplayer-focused zombie shooter&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</em>has been delayed, and the game has no new specific release date.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1430190/view/499441143215293470" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message</a> on Steam, Tripwire says the decision to delay the game was made following feedback it received from&nbsp;a recent closed beta period. That feedback made Tripwire realize it had "missed the mark" with regards to&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3</em>.</p>

<p>According to Tripwire, the delay will afford the development team time to address some of the most pressing issues raised during the closed beta, including "performance/stability, UI/UX, lighting, and weapon feel". Those are some pretty fundamental issues.</p>

<p>The developer says it doesn't know which of these issues will be fixed by the time of&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3</em>'s launch, but that an update which will let you select your perk class and character independently "is planned for post-release".</p>

<p>The studio closes by saying that it intends to show "a more polished version of&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3</em>" later down the line, and that more information is coming "when [Tripwire is] ready to share more details".</p>

<p>This is where I'd normally trot out that misattributed Miyamoto quote about a rushed game being bad and a delayed game being good, but given that Tripwire doesn't seem to be able to promise all of the aforementioned issues will be fixed by launch, I'm not sure it's appropriate here.</p>




<p>In case you need a reminder,&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</em>is the third major installment in the&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor&nbsp;</em>series of zombie-slaying shooters.</p>

<p>The game was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/killing-floor-3-release-date" rel="nofollow">slated for release this month</a>, but it now seems we'll have to wait a while before we learn exactly when it's coming. When it eventually does arrive,&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</em>will launch for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1430190/Killing_Floor_3/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/killing-floor-3/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/killing-floor-3/9pfzlckhc1vm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.&nbsp;</p>
