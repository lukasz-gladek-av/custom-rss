<p>When it comes to Nexon's other franchises, the popular <em>Dungeon&amp;Fighter </em>franchise grew in both China and Korea on PC, although <em>Dungeon&amp;Fighter Mobile </em>is struggling somewhat. The <em>MapleStory </em>franchise, meanwhile, seems to be going from strength to strength across all of its iterations.</p><p><em>The First Descendant</em>, meanwhile, served as Nexon's third best-selling franchise in North America and Europe, coming in behind the aforementioned <em>MapleStory </em>and <em>Arc Raiders</em>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>BlazBlue Entropy Effect X</em> is an odd release this year. It is an updated version of a roguelike spin-off of Arc System Works' <em>BlazBlue</em> fighting game series. A series that's been mostly dead since 2016. This new update does add some new elements tying the game to the greater series, but these additions are minor, doing little to distract from the core game's lack of identity.</p><h2>Navigating The Possibilities</h2><p>The setup of <em>BlazBlue Entropy Effect X</em> is relatively unchanged from the original PC and mobile release. You are a dowhoctor that is part of a think tank, performing experiments on a phenomenon known as the Sea of Possibility, a vast ocean of data displaying infinite branching timelines, alternate histories, and collapsed realities.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>It's all very simple, first we have to talk about parallel universes....</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>These experiments involve exploring this huge landscape and searching for Shards of Possibility. These Shards may hold secrets to the think tank's ultimate goal of stopping the end of the world.</p><p>The connection is that the Shards of Possibility contain fragments of events from the <em>BlazBlue</em> series, and the avatars you use to explore are <em>BlazBlue</em> characters. In essence, the cast in this game are trying to make sense of arguably the most convoluted lore ever conceived for a fighting game franchise and to make sense of it.</p><p>I don't make that above statement likely. I played the <em>BlazBlue</em> games as they were coming out and tried to analyze them back when I had more free time than good sense. Even in comparison to another ArcSys franchise, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/guilty-gear-strive-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Guilty Gear</em></a>, &nbsp;this series is way too complex for its own good. Centuries of war, reality-warping machine gods, a ton of overlapping time travel plots, time loops, branching timelines happening all at once, time ghosts, apocalyptic doomsday events, mad science, the list goes on.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Oh hey, it's that moment from that game from like twenty years ago.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There is a reason even dedicated <em>BlazBlue</em> fans can't understand half of what happens. Which, in a way, makes the cast of <em>BlazBlue Entropy Effect X</em> a sort of stand-in for its target audience.</p><p>Unfortunately, this framework leads to some pacing and narrative issues overall. The supporting cast of scientists are barely above stock anime stereotypes. The “revelations” offered by the Shards of Possibility are chosen at random and add little to the main plot. A few lightly touch on major elements like The Black Beast, the Cauldron, and the Boundary, but others will just reiterate various plot points like Ragna's death loop, or Iron Tager and Kokonoe's relationship. The plot states that these Shards will reveal some hidden secret, but the events amount to a scattered blast of references.</p><p>Because of this, the story of <em>BlazBlue Entropy Effect X</em> lacked any forward momentum or personal drive. I wasn't playing to get the next piece of the mystery; I was playing to see the next nostalgic callback and for someone else to deliver exposition. By the time the credits rolled, I was mostly checked out among a sea of technobabble.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Yes, that's the Prisoner from Dead Cells. Yes, he's fighting ninjas.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>The Wheel of Fate is Turning</h2><p>Despite my gripes with the plot of <em>BlazBlue Entropy Effect X</em>, the core gameplay shines. &nbsp;Each run has you play through a series of levels and boss fights as a <em>BlazBlue</em> character. Keep going until you die or until you reach the final boss and win.</p><p>On paper, the shift from a 2D fighting game to a hack-and-slash platformer may seem horrendous, especially given <em>BlazBlue's</em> very technical, deliberate approach to fighting game mechanics. But it's a change that works relatively well. Character attacks are reduced to simple combo strings and one special attack tied to a mana bar. But as you progress from room to room, one of the items you can pick up, called Potential, slowly opens up that character's suite of moves and modifies their skills. This includes extra special attacks, multiple jumps, alternate attacks, and even more technical bonuses like jump cancels.</p><p>It's a change many <em>BlazBlue</em> fans may scoff at. Boiling down characters' movesets into something as complex as <em>Super Smash Bros</em> can be a step too far. But as someone who has put a lot of time into <em>Dead Cells</em>, this gameplay transition works great.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Joke's on you, I live for this input reading nonsense!</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Thankfully, this simplification doesn't change any of the characters' gameplay quirks. Ragna the Bloodedge is still a risk-reward character with his special attacks sapping his HP, but restores it upon getting a kill. Hakumen is slower, but has devastating block and parry effects. Noel still has her balletic aerial gun kata combos. Taokaka can still air juggle like a boss with her directional air dashes.</p><p>Sadly, these more technical details are the most interesting part of <em>BlazBlue Entropy Effect X's</em> core gameplay. Rewards you get from room to room are a suite of elemental effects, buffs, and risky trade-offs. Nothing spectacular if you're familiar with the genre, but do help add spice to each subsequent run.</p><figure role="group">

<p>Which is good because the enemy variety is lacking. Ninjas, samurai, bugs, mad science experiments. Outside of a few challenge rooms, you'll get tired of fighting these minions pretty quickly.</p><p>The boss fights are only marginally better. The game even has two different boss rush challenge arenas that put these fights front and center. But they also suffer from derivative visual designs and predictable behaviors.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Yeah, I do not want to lose i-Frames for any reason at all.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Crumbling Entropy</h2><p><em>BlazBlue Entropy Effect X's</em> meta progression does mitigate some of these issues. It features an Entropy and Extreme difficulty toggle, similar to the Heat system from the Hades games. You can adjust different elements of the game, like enemy numbers, aggression levels, or even putting time limits on finishing each fight.&nbsp;</p><p>When enough of these modifiers are active, you'll get certain benefits for that run, like extra health or earning extra upgrade points. &nbsp;In addition, completing runs grants you points that you can spend on your Mind Level, which increases your maximum health, and Mind Crystals, which are equippable buffs that can give you an edge. It's a solid system that helps mitigate some of the underbaked parts of the core combat.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Hey Arakune, how does this fire build feel?</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Sadly, the pacing issues I mentioned above grate against this core loop. As you play, you'll be given an objective to complete, which will unlock a Shard of Possibility. Unfortunately, you can only get one Shard per run. This means, depending on your skill level, you can end up doing several runs that are utterly pedestrian just to move the plot along.</p><p>A personal example is that I was completing runs at Extreme difficulty. But I wasn't getting a Shard to progress because I wasn't playing on Entropy difficulty. It is annoying pedantic padding.</p><p>Which brings me to another critique I do have with <em>BlazBlue Entropy Effect X</em>. If you played the original PC/ Mobile release and were looking forward to new material, there isn't much here to justify another purchase. Aside from the new Extreme mode and its new boss fights, there is only one new playable character added to the roster: Naoto Kurogane from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/blazblue-central-fiction-review-burning-blue-soul" rel="nofollow"><em>BlazBlue Central Fiction</em></a>. He is a welcome addition, but he only highlights the lack of other characters on the roster. No Iron Tager. No Platinum. No Bang Shishigami.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2><em>BlazBlue Entropy Effect X</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2><p>I didn't hate my time with <em>BlazBlue Entropy Effect X</em>. The visuals are appealing. I enjoyed figuring out different combos and builds with each character. I loved seeing certain characters again in a new genre. I even enjoyed the replayability of the Entropy and Extreme modifiers.</p><p>But when that gameplay is wrapped around a meandering plot awkwardly gesturing at nostalgia and clashes with the core progression, it results in an experience wrapped in a <em>BlazBlue</em> skin rather than a meaningful spin-off.</p><hr><p><em><strong>BlazBlue Entropy Effect X</strong> was reviewed on PlayStation 5 with a code provided by the publisher.
