            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/blizzcon-returns-september-2026<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Blizzard has announced the return of its BlizzCon gaming show, but there's a catch: the show isn't coming back until September 2026, which means it will have skipped two years in a row for the first time in its history.</p>

<p>In an announcement <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24178650/blizzcon-returns-in-2026" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, Blizzard reveals that the convention will be returning to Anaheim, CA on September 12th and 13th next year. Naturally, tickets aren't on sale yet, but you can already sign up for updates via the <a href="https://blizzcon.com/en-us" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official website</a>.</p>

<p>Blizzard doesn't reveal what will be appearing at 2026's BlizzCon, but the studio does say the event is "one of [its] favorite traditions" and that it's planning to build the next BlizzCon "with a deep commitment to [its] players".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/diablo-4-blizzcon-2026-announcement.jpg?itok=aNU0eqj9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/diablo-4-blizzcon-2026-announcement.jpg?itok=Wlhf4HpD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Blizzard has announced BlizzCon's return...for next year.</figcaption></figure><p>While no specifics are revealed, Blizzard does say you can expect the return of "BlizzCon staples like Opening Ceremony, in-depth panels, the Darkmoon Faire, friendly competition, hands-on gameplay, and more".</p>

<p>If I had to guess, I'd say we'll probably get a reveal for the next&nbsp;<em>World of Warcraft&nbsp;</em>expansion that will constitute the second chapter of creative lead Chris Metzen's&nbsp;<em>Worldsoul Saga&nbsp;</em>trilogy, after <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/world-of-warcraft-war-within-reveals-tons-of-details-on-delves-warband-hero-talents" rel="nofollow">2024's&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/world-of-warcraft-war-within-reveals-tons-of-details-on-delves-warband-hero-talents" rel="nofollow">The War Within</a>&nbsp;</em>kicked things off in that regard.</p>

<p>Assuming it hasn't already been revealed, we may also get some more information about the next&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4&nbsp;</em>expansion, which Blizzard has already confirmed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/next-diablo-4-expansion-2026-blizzard" rel="nofollow">won't be coming until 2026</a>, making BlizzCon the perfect place to reveal it.</p>

<p>Of course, I can't predict what else Blizzard will announce during the event, but I think those two guesses are safe bets. You can see the announcement trailer for BlizzCon 2026, which isn't particularly long or informative, here.</p>




<p>Given that tickets aren't yet on sale for BlizzCon 2026, we don't know much they'll cost, but you can probably expect to pay a few hundred dollars for the privilege of attending. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[First New Katamari Damacy Game in Almost Eight Years Announced for Apple Arcade]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/katamari-damacy-rolling-live-apple-arcade</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/first-new-katamari-damacy-game-in-almost-eight-years-announced-for-apple-arcade.1131321/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/katamari-damacy-rolling-live-apple-arcade<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Apple and Bandai Namco have announced that the first&nbsp;<em>Katamari Damacy&nbsp;</em>game in almost eight years is heading to Apple Arcade next month, along with five other new titles.</p>

<p><em>Katamari Damacy Rolling Live&nbsp;</em>is, as Apple puts it in its <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/03/apple-arcade-launches-new-katamari-and-space-invaders-games-in-april/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement post</a>, "the&nbsp;<em>Katamari&nbsp;</em>franchise's first original game in nearly eight years", following the release of remasters&nbsp;<em>Katamari Damacy Reroll&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>We Love Katamari Reroll+ Royal Reverie</em>. It's launching on April 3rd.</p>

<p>Just like other&nbsp;<em>Katamari&nbsp;</em>games,&nbsp;<em>Rolling Live&nbsp;</em>will see you taking control of the Prince as he completes a series of Katamari-based tasks given to him by the quirky King of All Cosmos. Apple says the series' core gameplay idea of "roll, stick, and grow" is intact in&nbsp;<em>Rolling Live</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/apple-arcade-katamari-damacy-rolling-live-phone.jpg?itok=uaOigroC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/apple-arcade-katamari-damacy-rolling-live-phone.jpg?itok=vzc61j4e 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Katamari Damacy Rolling Live&nbsp;</em>is the series' first original game in nearly eight years, and it's coming to Apple Arcade.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that while Apple and Bandai Namco haven't confirmed this,&nbsp;<em>Katamari Damacy Rolling Live&nbsp;</em>is unlikely to boast the involvement of original&nbsp;<em>Katamari&nbsp;</em>creator Keita Takahashi.</p>

<p>Having left Bandai Namco in 2010, Takahashi hasn't worked on a&nbsp;<em>Katamari&nbsp;</em>game since 2005's&nbsp;<em>We Love Katamari</em>. Instead, he's hard at work on the rather&nbsp;<em>Katamari</em>-esque adventure game&nbsp;<em>To a T</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/to-a-t-release-date-katamari-creator" rel="nofollow">launching in May</a>.</p>

<p>As well as&nbsp;<em>Katamari Damacy Rolling Live</em>, Apple also announced five other games making their way to the Apple Arcade service. The first of these is Taito's&nbsp;<em>Space Invaders Infinity Gene Evolve</em>, an honest-to-goodness new entry in the&nbsp;<em>Space Invaders&nbsp;</em>series.</p>

<p>It's joined by <i>Puffies</i>, a game by&nbsp;<em>Lumen&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Stitch&nbsp;</em>developer Lykke Studios, as well as the Atari remaster&nbsp;<em>RollerCoaster Tycoon Classic+</em>, which Apple says has been "enhanced for iPhone and iPad".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rollercoaster-tycoon-classic-apple-arcade.jpg?itok=7t9Rf0cY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rollercoaster-tycoon-classic-apple-arcade.jpg?itok=vdzcJ77u 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>RollerCoaster Tycoon Classic+&nbsp;</em>is also on its way to Apple Arcade.</figcaption></figure><p>Rounding out the new Apple Arcade collection are Marmalade Game Studio's&nbsp;<em>The Game of Life 2+&nbsp;</em>and STEM educational game&nbsp;<em>Sesame Street Mecha Builders+</em>, which, contrary to its name, probably isn't about Big Bird wrecking puppets with a giant mech.</p>

<p>All of these games join the Apple Arcade service, which is available on iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV, on April 3rd.&nbsp;</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dead-by-daylight-tokyo-ghoul-crossover-coming-in-april.1131252/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-tokyo-ghoul-crossover<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Behaviour Interactive has announced&nbsp;a&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight Tokyo Ghoul&nbsp;</em>crossover, bringing the main character of the iconic anime and manga into the world of the asymmetrical horror game.</p>

<p>The crossover arrives on April 2nd and will bring protagonist Ken Kaneki into&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>, although unlike the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-castlevania-crossover-release-date" rel="nofollow">main characters</a> from other <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-tomb-raider-crossover" rel="nofollow">beloved IPs</a>, Kaneki won't be joining as a survivor but as a killer.</p>

<p>Technically speaking, Kaneki is&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>'s first anime crossover in terms of playable characters, although Behaviour did team up with acclaimed horror writer Junji Ito for a cosmetic collection <a href="https://deadbydaylight.com/news/junji-ito-collection-brings-his-chilling-creations/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">back in January</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dead-by-daylight-tokyo-ghoul-crossover-gameplay.jpg?itok=pi3S6-hw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dead-by-daylight-tokyo-ghoul-crossover-gameplay.jpg?itok=Eu4pomiB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The worlds of&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Tokyo Ghoul&nbsp;</em>are crossing over.</figcaption></figure><p>As you might expect if you've read or watched&nbsp;<em>Tokyo Ghoul</em>, Kaneki will be using his Kagune tentacles to propel him around&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>'s maps and to both intimidate and attack survivors.</p>

<p>With each successful attack, Kaneki will enter Enraged Mode, which will amplify his "strength, brutality, and movements", according to Behaviour Interactive. It sounds like you'll need to stay on the offensive if you're playing as Kaneki.</p>

<p>The developer is also promising a set of perks "designed to apply pressure", as well as "gloriously graphic" effects when survivors succumb to Kaneki's Mori.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to a set of "iconic looks and characters" from&nbsp;<em>Tokyo Ghoul&nbsp;</em>as part of&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>'s accompanying DLC collection, with various characters and outfits from&nbsp;<em>Tokyo Ghoul&nbsp;</em>making an appearance.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dead-by-daylight-tokyo-ghoul-crossover-kaneki-face.jpg?itok=xWCwGVDJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dead-by-daylight-tokyo-ghoul-crossover-kaneki-face.jpg?itok=rtOaaap0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ken Kaneki looks pretty intimidating in&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Tokyo Ghoul&nbsp;</em>joins a raft of other properties to get a&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>crossover, including the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-dungeons-dragons-crossover" rel="nofollow"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>, Remedy's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-alan-wake-crossover" rel="nofollow"><em>Alan Wake</em></a>, and the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-chucky" rel="nofollow"><em>Child's Play&nbsp;</em>movies</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, more crossovers are planned for the future, with a&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-five-nights-at-freddys-crossover" rel="nofollow"><em>Five Nights at Freddy's&nbsp;</em>collaboration</a> due for sometime this summer. It's worth noting, too, that crossovers are <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-hellraiser-chapter-leaving" rel="nofollow">sometimes removed</a> from&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>'s roster, so if there's one you've got your eye on, make sure to snap it up quickly.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight Tokyo Ghoul&nbsp;</em>crossover arrives on April 2nd, but you can check it out right now if you play on&nbsp;the game's public test server.</p>
