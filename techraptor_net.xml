            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Team17 and developer Sassy Chap Games have announced that their dating sim<i>&nbsp;Date Everything!&nbsp;</i>has managed to hit a major sales milestone in the weeks since its release.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-date-everything-release-date-summer" rel="nofollow">finally released back in June</a>, has sold 500,000 copies across all the platforms on which it's currently available. The game isn't playable as part of any major subscription services, either, so this figure does refer exclusively to sales and not just "players".</p>

<p>As part of celebrations for reaching this sales milestone, Team17 and Sassy Chap Games are giving away a washing machine (yes, you read that right), because, well, as the studios say, "people need washing machines [and] some people clearly like dating washing machines". Can't argue with that.</p>

You can read more about how to enter <a href="https://www.team17.com/competition/date-everything-washing-machine-competition" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>is, well, it's a dating sim that allows you to date...okay, not quite everything, but certainly a lot of things you can't date anywhere else. That includes your washing machine, but also a candelabra, a piano, and even the concept of existential dread.</p>

<p>Originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/date-everything-dating-sim" rel="nofollow">announced in July last year</a>, it was due for release in 2024, but was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/date-everything-delayed-valentines-day" rel="nofollow">delayed to Valentine's Day this year</a>, which would have been the best possible release date for it. Unfortunately, it was then <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/date-everything-delayed-again" rel="nofollow">pushed back again</a>, eventually finding its permanent launch day in June.</p>
