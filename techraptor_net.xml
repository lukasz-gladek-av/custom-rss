            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-500k<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Sandfall Interactive and publisher Kepler Interactive have revealed that turn-based RPG&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>has hit a major sales milestone within its first 24 hours on sale.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/expedition33/status/1915777375834452273" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Sandfall reveals that the game has hit 500,000 sales, despite only being available for less than a day. That's a pretty impressive milestone by itself, but the game is also available on Game Pass, so it's managed to hit that figure despite being part of a subscription service (for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-price-hike-new-tier" rel="nofollow">certain tiers</a>, at any rate).</p>

<p>Rather humbly, Sandfall and Kepler say the sales figure is "a milestone for us, reached sooner than we'd ever imagined", thanking those who've bought&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>.</p>

<p>The game is set in a world in which a figure known as the Paintress paints a number each year, and everyone of that age dies. Every year, the number gets lower, meaning more and more people are dying each time a number is painted.</p>

<p>As the name suggests, you're part of the titular Expedition 33, which refers to the number the Paintress will paint on the day following the outset of the game. It's up to you to stop her before she can claim more lives.</p>

<p>To do so, you'll engage in turn-based battles with real-time elements; you'll need to dodge and parry attacks with good timing, and some attacks also have&nbsp;<em>Shadow Hearts</em>-style quick-time events to increase damage.</p>




<p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>is available now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1903340/Clair_Obscur_Expedition_33/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/clair-obscur--expedition-33/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/clair-obscur-expedition-33/9ppt8k6gqhrz" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and it's also part of Game Pass if you're subscribed to the Ultimate or PC tiers.
