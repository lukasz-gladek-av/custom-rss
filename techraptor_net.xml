            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-32-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has announced the&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.2 release date, with the new update set to bring two new 5-star characters, a perilous new foe to take down, and more in April.</p>

<p>Following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-31-release-date" rel="nofollow">February's Version 3.1</a>,&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.2, also known as "Through the Petals in the Land of Repose", is set to launch across all platforms on April 9th. HoYoverse is promising "trials of survival and political intrigue" as part of the update's main story.</p>

<p>You'll be traveling to the "forgotten city-state of Styxia" in this update, and while you're there, you'll take on Pollux, a leviathan who slumbers in the River of Souls. Pollux has some pretty nasty HP manipulation attacks, so you'll have to be on your A-game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/honkai-star-rail-version-3.2-release-date-styxia.jpg?itok=_-i4deVf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/honkai-star-rail-version-3.2-release-date-styxia.jpg?itok=So3A03E3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.2 brings the fallen city-state of Styxia and more next month.</figcaption></figure><p>Two 5-star characters are coming your way in&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.2. The first, Castorice, is a Remembrance-path character who can sync up with her Netherwing dragon for big damage, although the dragon sacrifices its own HP to use its ultimate attack.</p>

<p>Your second 5-star character in Version 3.2 is Anaxa, an Erudition character who can apply Weaknesses to enemies and boost his damage using his Qualitative Disclosure ability.</p>

<p>The first half of Version 3.2 will also see the return of Fugue, Jiaoqiu, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-acheron-raiden-shogun" rel="nofollow">Acheron</a> as rerun banners, while the second half will give you another chance to obtain the wonderfully-named <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-dr-ratio-trailer" rel="nofollow">Dr. Ratio</a> for your team.</p>

<p><em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.2 isn't all about gloomy city-states and frantic combat, though; you can also kick back and enjoy the new Seal Slammers minigame, which allows you to compete against your allies "in chaotic seal-based collisions". Finally.</p>




<p><em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>is available to play for free right now on <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC, PS5, and mobile devices</a>. Version 3.2, also known as "Through the Petals in the Land of Repose", arrives on April 9th.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/live-action-zelda-movie-gets-march-2027-release-date.1147827/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/live-action-zelda-movie-march-2027<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced the release date for the upcoming live-action&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda&nbsp;</em>movie, but don't get too excited; its release is a couple of years away yet.</p>

<p>Per an announcement on the new Nintendo Today! app, which was announced (and released) as part of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-march-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">yesterday's Nintendo Direct show</a>, the&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>movie will launch around the world on March 26th, 2027.</p>

<p>That date puts the movie's release in the same month as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-hedgehog-4-movie-march-2027" rel="nofollow">Paramount's&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog 4</em></a>; March is a pretty common month for blockbuster-style movies to be released in, so these two tentpole video game adaptations releasing then makes a lot of sense.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zelda-movie-release-date-link-horse.jpg?itok=2i6awzrx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zelda-movie-release-date-link-horse.jpg?itok=ETg0uIP1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The upcoming live-action&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>movie has an official release date.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, just because Nintendo has announced a date for the movie, that doesn't mean it won't be delayed or changed later down the line. Still, now you know when you should be clearing your schedule if you're eagerly awaiting the film.</p>

<p>While we don't have a cast or a story outline for the&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>movie yet, we do know that it'll be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-announces-live-action-legend-of-zelda-movie-distributed-and-co-financed-by" rel="nofollow">co-produced by Nintendo legend Shigeru Miyamoto</a>, alongside Hollywood blockbuster producer Avi Arad, whose name you'll find on movies like&nbsp;Sam Raimi's&nbsp;<em>Spider-Man&nbsp;</em>films.</p>

<p>Additionally, attached to direct the project is&nbsp;<em>The Maze Runner</em>'s Wes Ball, who also directed and produced 2024's&nbsp;<em>Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes</em>.</p>

<p>It's likely that we'll hear more about what's coming for the&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>movie in the months ahead, but Nintendo no doubt won't feel the need to rush; after all, it's got a major console launch to take care of in the next few months.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-zelda-movie.jpg?itok=WxqjCGIm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-zelda-movie.jpg?itok=D0J14GfS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nintendo will likely take care of the Switch 2's launch before more&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>movie details are revealed.</figcaption></figure><p>In case you're unaware, Nintendo is gearing up to release the Switch 2, which will probably be launching sometime in summer. A Nintendo Direct dedicated to the console is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">due to air next week</a>.</p>

<p>It's likely the company will be looking to focus on that launch before more&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>movie details are revealed, but it looks like if more info is released soon, it'll probably be via the Nintendo Today! app. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atelier-yumia-sales-300k-fastest-selling</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/atelier-yumia-sales-top-300-000-making-it-the-series-fastest-selling-game.1147785/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atelier-yumia-sales-300k-fastest-selling<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Koei Tecmo and Gust have revealed that JRPG&nbsp;<em>Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land&nbsp;</em>has hit a new sales milestone, as well as setting a new record for the series.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://x.com/gustatelierpr/status/1905531185713086693" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X (which is in Japanese, so we're using machine translation),&nbsp;<em>Atelier Yumia&nbsp;</em>has sold over 300,000 copies worldwide, which makes it the fastest-selling game in the franchise.</p>

<p>That's not bad given that the game has only been on sale for a week, and since it was released in Japan and around the world simultaneously, that figure doesn't include any long-tail Japanese sales either.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/atelier-yumia-sales-300k-combat.jpg?itok=hoCEiSGa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/atelier-yumia-sales-300k-combat.jpg?itok=TdqAE6aT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Atelier Yumia&nbsp;</em>has hit 300,000 sales since launching last week.</figcaption></figure><p>By way of comparison, it took&nbsp;<em>Atelier Ryza 3&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atelier-ryza-3-crosses-300k-sales-to-become-fastest-selling-secret-game" rel="nofollow">around a month</a> to achieve the same figure, and while that game is still the fastest-selling&nbsp;<em>Ryza&nbsp;</em>sub-series game, it can't lay claim to being the series' fastest-selling title.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Atelier Yumia</em>, it's the latest game in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Atelier&nbsp;</em>series of JRPGs, which also includes the likes of the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Atelier Ryza&nbsp;</em>sub-series, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atelier-resleriana-global-release-date" rel="nofollow">free-to-play RPG</a>&nbsp;<em>Atelier Resleriana&nbsp;</em>and its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atelier-resleriana-red-alchemist-and-white-guardian" rel="nofollow">upcoming sequel</a>.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, the games combine typical JRPG exploration and combat with a focus on item synthesis using ingredients gathered in the world, and&nbsp;<em>Atelier Yumia&nbsp;</em>is no different on that front.</p>

<p>Unlike previous games in the series, however,&nbsp;<em>Atelier Yumia&nbsp;</em>is fully open-world; rather than the open-zone environments of prior entries,&nbsp;<em>Yumia&nbsp;</em>allows you to fully and freely explore its map without any loading times to get in your way.</p>




<p><em>Yumia</em>'s success shows that there's still a significant audience out there eager for more&nbsp;<em>Atelier&nbsp;</em>games, so you can expect to see more from this series in the future.</p>

<p><em>Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3123410/Atelier_Yumia_The_Alchemist_of_Memories__the_Envisioned_Land/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012240" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/atelier-yumia-the-alchemist-of-memories-the-envisioned-land/9mzzjj7kgl7q" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/atelier-yumia-the-alchemist-of-memories-and-the-envisioned-land-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[Atomfall Review - The British Invasion]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/atomfall-review-british-invasion</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/atomfall-review-the-british-invasion.1147746/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/atomfall-review-british-invasion<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If <em>Atomfall</em> is anything, it’s a good case study on why the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/fallout-4-review-catch-that-uranium-fever" rel="nofollow"><em>Fallout</em></a>-style of game design should be used more often outside of its typical American formula. Rebellion has done just that by putting together an all-new survival game with plenty of British flair and hard-earned difficulty that feels both familiar and has been allowed to stand on its own.</p>

<p>There’s quite a lot in <em>Atomfall</em> that leads me to that conclusion, so let’s get to the meat of what we’re working with.</p>

<p><em>Atomfall</em> begins with a dramatic, potentially world-ending event, which is to say that a nuclear disaster in a place called Windscale in Northern England happened, and there’s a time skip with all the consequences. Fast-forward five years, and the area’s been walled off into a quarantine zone with those within left to their fate.</p>

<p>The protagonist in <em>Atomfall</em> is out of sorts and suffering from amnesia. The whole story will hinge on finding out how they got there and what’s really going on in this now isolated world.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/atomfall-05.jpg?itok=Sub-ujVQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/atomfall-05.jpg?itok=XPp_f6ej 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Most of the story takes place in this quarantine zone, and it’s here that many perils and unsavory locals and factions who don’t take kindly to strangers are found. <em>Atomfall</em> leans a lot on the mystery created from these foundations, and a lot of that progression relies on discovering the unknown.</p>

<p>It’s not cinematic, but it gets the job done, and I did enjoy being able to pick at the investigation into what was going on a highlight of the nearly 30-hour experience. A lot of <em>Atomfall</em>’s narrative value is in the bits and pieces you find along the way such as notes and the like, along with a colorful cast of characters who aren’t always as trustworthy as they may seem and have plenty to say.</p>

<p>The British flavor helps a lot too, I felt. There’s something cheeky about sneaking up to a bright red phone booth in the woods as it rings especially for you.</p>

<p>Outside of its story, <em>Atomfall</em> pushes its mystery through gameplay in a lot of ways. You’ve got the standard melee and ranged attacks, and the protagonist can make use of a lot of weapons. Like any survival game, you’ll have to find whatever you want to use. There’s no handholding here, which is something I feel can be frustrating or a benefit, it all depends on your perspective.</p>

<p>With limited inventory space, I found it better to go with an even spread because there’s a good chance that the protagonist can die at any moment. Guns are around, but finding ammo isn’t always a safe bet. There are bows and arrows, too, which I found more useful since there’s at least a chance of recovery once you fire one.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/atomfall-06.jpg?itok=_gc82vwD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/atomfall-06.jpg?itok=hw3kuBBP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Other useful ranged weapons include throwables like the Molotov cocktail. Melee weapons are useful too to deal heavier damage, although I found the wind-up time on some of them, like the cricket bat, to be a bit too long for my liking. If the protagonist is in a pinch, they can kick out at enemies to stagger them a bit and it does go a long way to get into the habit of using all the abilities at your disposal.</p>

<p>Having to keep an eye on the protagonist’s heart rate during such fights is a bit of a challenge, too, and it’s easy to slip too far and slow down as a consequence, especially when encountering some of the tougher enemies like the infected Ferals.</p>

<p>And again, <em>Atomfall</em> isn’t out here holding your hand. I died, a lot, and much of it ended up being a learning experience on how I could approach enemies, some of which won’t even bother you if they don’t perceive you as a threat. Sometimes the best strategy is to just sneak around and get away, especially because combat can sometimes be unwieldy and difficulty can spike up for no real reason.</p>

<p><em>Atomfall</em> isn’t always on a knife's edge like that, however. The other core part of gameplay lies in its quests, picking up leads and tracking them, and building up conversations with NPCs through dialogue options. Leads net things like hints on where to go, but it’s important to be mindful because again, it’s hard to trust anyone.</p>

<p>This opens up a lot of <em>Atomfall</em>’s sandbox nature as well. I was really floored just how much freedom you have to explore at your own pace, there’s nothing pressing, and you’re not moving between pre-determined quests.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/atomfall-07.jpg?itok=FB_Y6iiH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/atomfall-07.jpg?itok=_IoU4V8m 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>While <em>Atomfall</em> is the most technically impressive game out there, it does well with the sheer number of assets on display. There’s a lot of greenery and the different locations from the village to the forest, and even a detention center is filled with plenty of interesting things to look at.</p>

<p><em>Atomfall</em> runs smoothly on PC for the most part, though I did encounter some issues with janky animation and an NPC that got killed by accident and couldn’t respawn without restarting a save.</p>

<p>Overall, though, <em>Atomfall</em> has plenty to keep you busy. If you’re keen on survival games with a bit of mystery, and maybe if you liked the sort of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/elden-ring-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>-flavor of gameplay difficulty wrapped up in it, this one’s for you.</p>

<p>While some of the gameplay can be unwieldy, and difficulty can ramp up without reason, <em>Atomfall</em> has enough to keep you going, especially for those who like to seek out multiple endings. It’s clear Rebellion put a lot of love into this game, and the mystery that binds it altogether into a compelling experience worth trying out.</p>

<hr><p><em>Atomfall </em>was reviewed on PC with a code provided by the publisher. All screenshots were taken during the course of review over 30 hours of gameplay.</p>
