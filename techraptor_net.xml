            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you're hankering for a new tactical RTS that will give you a meaty intellectual challenge to chew on, then look no further than developer and publisher Tactical Boar's <em>Veterans: Napoleonic Wars</em>, which is coming to PC sometime soon.</p><p>In a press release, Tactical Boar says you'll be "mastering formations, maintaining morale, and making tactical decisions across recreated battlefields" in its game, all while taking command of "historical armies".</p><p>You'll need to pay attention to unit experience and morale as you play, as well as common 1790s battlefield formations like the line, the column, and the square. As you progress through campaigns, your units will gain veterancy, giving you greater control over shaping and customizing your armies.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Veterans: Napoleonic Wars </em>is all about formation and unit tactics.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As "increasingly complex tactical scenarios" play out, <em>Veterans: Napoleonic Wars </em>will throw new challenges at you, including the use of artillery, which Tactical Board says "emphasizes the importance of troop maneuvering" as well as "reinforcing the importance of positioning and timing" in battle.</p><p>Despite this strategic depth, the studio says <em>Veterans: Napoleonic Wars </em>will offer "accessible, fast-paced gameplay", so if you're not a real-time strategy genius, then you should still find something to enjoy here.</p><p>Unlike many other RTS games, this one won't offer any multiplayer features, either; Tactical Boar says the game will be "a focused single-player experience", so don't expect to be taking on your friends here anytime soon.</p><p>You can check out the debut trailer for <em>Veterans: Napoleonic Wars</em>, which should be red meat for you if you're a <em>Total War </em>fan (and you're <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/total-war-pharaoh-review-this-is-not-it" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7067fdbf-b9ab-4e47-903f-e0733b54d97a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">disappointed with more recent releases</a>), right here.</p>
<p>There is, admittedly, not a ton of information in said trailer, but <em>Veterans: Napoleonic Wars </em>doesn't have a release date yet, so that's probably fair enough. If you want to keep up with this one's progress, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4202430/Veterans_Napoleonic_Wars/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow">wishlist it on Steam here</a>.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You'll soon be able to take advantage of cross-progression in IO Interactive's <em>Hitman: World of Assassination</em>, allowing you to carry on where you left off on other devices, the developer and publisher has announced.</p><p>In a <a href="https://ioi.dk/hitman/blogs/2026/cross-progression-coming-to-hitman-woa-and-new-look-to-ioi-account" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">news post on its website</a>, IO says cross-progression for the trilogy is coming on February 3rd, and that it won't matter which platform you're playing on, since none of them are exempt from the feature.</p><p>As a result of introducing this new feature, however, IO says that the <em>Hitman 2 </em>to <em>Hitman 3 </em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hitman-3s-access-pass-system-is-confusing-mess" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="28d05924-dbd1-47fc-af86-c6d958c80809" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">data carryover system</a> introduced back in 2021 needs to be closed, so if you've yet to take advantage of that (should you wish to), now's the time to do so.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Hitman: World of Assassination </em>will soon get cross-progression.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Although features like overall game progress, experience, and player level will carry over, along with story progress, there are some things that won't be shared between platforms.</p><p>If you've bought <em>Hitman: World of Assassination </em>DLC on one platform, for instance, that doesn't entitle you to that DLC on another platform, and features like in-mission save games, game licenses, and leaderboard scores won't carry over either.</p><p>On the subject of save games, IO says that any saves created across connected accounts prior to cross-progression activation will be temporarily disabled, and you'll need to turn the feature off to access them again.</p><p>If it's all sounding rather confusing, you can check out the official <em>Hitman: World of Assassination </em>cross-progression <a href="https://ioisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/32645592211229-HITMAN-World-of-Assassination-Cross-Progression-Guide" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">FAQ right here</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you thought you'd completely rinsed October's excellent <em>Ball x Pit</em>, think again. The game is getting a brand new content drop next week in the form of the Regal Update, and it'll bring new characters, new balls, and more.</p><p>As revealed in a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2062430/view/99775316462930481" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">news post</a>, the <em>Ball x Pit </em>Regal Update launches on January 26th, and its main addition to the game comes in the form of two new treasure seekers: the Carouser and the Falconer.</p><p>The Carouser's thrown balls will orbit around him when they return, while the Falconer will be flanked by two falcons who will aid her in throwing balls towards her enemies. They should add a fun new tactical dimension to <em>Ball x Pit</em>.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Ball x Pit </em>is getting two new characters and more next week.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Developer Kenny Sun is also promising eight new balls as part of the Regal Update, as well as new passive abilities and "some new features many [players] have been crying out for since launch".</p><p>He's also teasing a "nice surprise" that he and his fellow <em>Ball x Pit </em>devs "don't want to spoil just yet". I suppose we'll find out what that surprise is when the update arrives next week.</p><p>If you're not familiar with <em>Ball x Pit</em>, it's a roguelite that takes inspiration from the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/vampire-survivors" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7938a993-0699-46f6-b76d-06acb4234348" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Vampire Survivors</em></a><em> </em>for its gameplay, as well as arcade classics like <em>Breakout</em> (and, arguably, <em>Space Invaders</em>).</p><p>Each level sees you hurling balls at columns of enemies, and since this is effectively a bullet heaven game, you can apply all kinds of absurd modifiers to your balls (ahem), including flame, poison, and bleed effects, plus more.</p>
<p>The game has done very well for itself since launching in mid-October, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ball-x-pit-sales-300k" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c66e79de-ad49-448b-a480-58a8aeff462c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">racking up 300,000 sales within its first week</a>. That number is likely to be higher by now, too.</p><p>You can check out <em>Ball x Pit </em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2062430/BALL_x_PIT/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/ball-x-pit/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/ball-x-pit/9MWXF3SRD7QN" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/BALL-x-PIT-2931076.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/BALL-x-PIT-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2949433.html" rel="nofollow">Switch 2</a>, and you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/ball-x-pit-review-bubble-bobble-toil-and-trouble" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bc62caf3-6a98-45be-907e-22ef807517ec" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">read my review here</a>.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

<p>As a result of these features being disabled, there are also a number of trophies you won't be able to unlock in the game after April.
