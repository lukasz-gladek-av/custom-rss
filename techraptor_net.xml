            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Chinese Room co-founder and former creative director Dan Pinchbeck has expressed his regret that&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>wasn't called something different, suggesting that his studio felt the game wouldn't serve as a true sequel to the 2004 cult classic.</p>

<p>In an interview with The Goth Boss Podcast's Cat Burton (via <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/dan-pinchbeck-ex-the-chinese-room-was-aware-they-couldnt-make-the-vtmb2-that-fans-wanted-in-time-and-wanted-paradox-to-call-it-something-else.1362589/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ResetEra user doops</a>), Pinchbeck says that he and a former producer at&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>studio Paradox would hold planning sessions for how to get the producers "to not call it&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines 2</em>".</p>

<p>He says that trying to recreate the "magic" of the original&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines&nbsp;</em>is "wrongheaded" in the modern environment, because the finished product wouldn't make anyone happy; fans of the original would be disappointed, and new players would get a "flawed game that was built too fast and with not enough money".</p>

<p>The result of that was, according to Pinchbeck, something that wasn't&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines 2</em>, nor was it an open-world RPG like&nbsp;<em>Skyrim</em>. Instead, it was something closer to&nbsp;<em>Dishonored</em>, a "tightly focused and true to the mythos" game that, nonetheless, wasn't a&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines&nbsp;</em>sequel.</p>

<p>Judging by the <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/19138/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">critical</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/532790/Vampire_The_Masquerade__Bloodlines_2/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">fan</a> reception to&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines 2</em>, Pinchbeck is right; most people don't really seem to view it as a proper successor to Troika's flawed-but-fun 2004 RPG. Perhaps a change of name might have been a good idea on that front.</p>

<p>Still, even if&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>isn't what it should be, it's perhaps a miracle that the game was released at all, given its lengthy history of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-indefinitely" rel="nofollow">delays</a>, developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-back-developed-by-chinese-room" rel="nofollow">changes</a>, and slightly sketchy <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloodlines-2-toreador-lasombra-paywall-removed" rel="nofollow">monetization practices</a>.</p>
