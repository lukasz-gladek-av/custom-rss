            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tango-gameworks-new-site-unannounced-action-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Hi-Fi Rush&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Ghostwire: Tokyo&nbsp;</em>developer Tango Gameworks has reopened its office, and it's now hiring for a brand new, as-yet-unannounced "action game" as well.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://tangogameworks.com/2025/06/02/tango-is-hiring-for-its-unannounced-action-game/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on its new website, Tango says it's not "ready to reveal much yet" about the project, but that it's looking for workers in "almost every department" in order to bring a new "handcrafted game" to life.</p>

<p>Many of Tango's staffers, including creative director John Johanas, programmer Yuji Nakamura, and UI designer Ayana Muraoka, have remained with Tango, but it's also boasting new hires like&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts III&nbsp;</em>animator Yuriko Takata.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hi-fi-rush-tango-gameworks-reopened.jpg?itok=PlgxBZoz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hi-fi-rush-tango-gameworks-reopened.jpg?itok=e0fd7mo8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Tango Gameworks is perhaps best known for 2023's&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>The studio's new <a href="https://tangogameworks.com/#about" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">About section</a>&nbsp;on its website says that while Tango "has a penchant for action games", the developer's scope "won't stop there", and that the goal is to eventually create "new and innovative experiences, unencumbered by genre labels".</p>

<p>For now, though, it sounds like Tango is focused on making the aforementioned action game, which may or may not be the sequel to&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush&nbsp;</em>that was confirmed by parent company Krafton <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hi-fi-rush-2-krafton-ceo" rel="nofollow">back in September last year</a>.</p>

<p>If you need a refresher, Tango Gameworks was founded by&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>God Hand</em>'s Shinji Mikami in 2010. Mikami would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shinji-mikami-leaving-tango-gameworks-in-coming-months-bethesda-confirms" rel="nofollow">go on to depart the studio in 2023</a>, founding a new company by the name of Kamuy.</p>

<p>Whilst with Tango, however, Mikami oversaw development on 2014's survival horror game&nbsp;<em>The Evil Within</em>, although he was much more hands-off with subsequent games like&nbsp;<em>The Evil Within 2&nbsp;</em>and 2022's&nbsp;<em>Ghostwire: Tokyo</em>.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see whether the unannounced game is indeed&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush 2</em>, but for now, it looks like Tango Gameworks is back in force. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Elden Ring Nightreign Now Lets You Revive During Solo Play]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-update-solo-revival</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-nightreign-now-lets-you-revive-during-solo-play.1204398/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-update-solo-revival<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>update has been released, and if you feel like you've been dying too often during solo play, then this one's for you.</p>

<p>Per the official patch notes, one of the biggest additions in today's update is the ability to revive yourself once per night boss battle, which was previously impossible during solo expeditions (and was one of the biggest problems with solo play in the game, if you ask me).</p>

<p>Additionally, you'll now gain more runes during solo expeditions, so if you felt like you were having trouble leveling yourself up and keeping up with the increasing difficulty of enemies and minibosses, that should have been addressed too.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-update-solo-revival-wylder-executor.jpg?itok=wmp6aV0v 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-update-solo-revival-wylder-executor.jpg?itok=l2QWkHKr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Solo play in&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>should now be a viable option alongside multiplayer.</figcaption></figure><p>Other changes in this update include an increase in the number of high-rarity Relics available as rewards during the third day of expeditions, and you should also now receive more high-rarity Relics from the Small Jar Bazaar's gacha boxes (don't worry, they don't take real money).</p>

<p>Of course, you'll also find an absolute ton of bug fixes and other minor changes in this update, so I'd recommend that you check out the full&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>update 1.01.1 <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-version-1011" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">patch notes right here</a> if you want to see everything that's new.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, it's a multiplayer-focused (although perhaps less so now, thanks to today's update) spinoff of FromSoftware's <em>Elden Ring</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-30m" rel="nofollow">topped 30 million sales back in April</a>, thus probably explaining why a spinoff has been made.</p>

<p>The game is essentially a sort of roguelike run-based take on&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s core combat; across three days, you must scour a procedurally-generated map for items, weapons, and other loot, taking down minibosses before facing off against a more powerful boss at the end of each day.</p>




<p><em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>is a hit in its own right, too; it managed to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">pick up two million sales</a> within its first day on release, despite a mixed reaction from players calling for features like duo play and built-in voice chat.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/people-can-fly-layoffs-projects-canceled</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/people-can-fly-lays-off-staff-and-cancels-two-projects.1204395/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/people-can-fly-layoffs-projects-canceled<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Bulletstorm&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>developer People Can Fly has announced an unknown number of layoffs, as well as the cancellation of two unannounced projects.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://x.com/PCFPeopleCanFly/status/1929140540697727466" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">update</a> on X, studio CEO Sebastian Wojciechowski says that the "very difficult decision" to cancel Projects Gemini and Bifrost has led to a need to "significantly regroup as a studio and scale down our teams".</p>

<p>According to Wojciechowski, Project Gemini, which was to be a collaboration with publisher Square Enix, was canceled due to the latter's "lack of communication...as to its willingness to continue or terminate" development on the project.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/people-can-fly-layoffs-projects-canceled-outriders.jpg?itok=jFcgIXbq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/people-can-fly-layoffs-projects-canceled-outriders.jpg?itok=ezlqlasP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>People Can Fly is the studio responsible for games like 2021's looter-shooter&nbsp;<em>Outriders</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>People Can Fly's falling-out with Square Enix is also a factor in the cancellation of Project Bifrost, although Wojciechowski also admits that his studio had a "lack of prospects for securing organizational resources and funds" needed to continue development on Bifrost.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Wojciechowski doesn't reveal how many employees have been let go from People Can Fly, nor does he say which departments were most affected.</p>

<p>As far as we know, however, these two cancellations won't affect the studio's work on the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Gears of War: E-Day</em>, on which it is currently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gears-of-war-e-day-people-can-fly" rel="nofollow">serving as a co-developer</a> alongside longtime&nbsp;<em>Gears&nbsp;</em>steward The Coalition. People Can Fly's other projects, including PvPvE FPS&nbsp;<em>Lost Rift</em>, also appear to be unaffected.</p>

<p>It's also worth noting that while People Can Fly is responsible for the original&nbsp;<em>Painkiller</em>, it's not working on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/painkiller-revival-fall-2025" rel="nofollow">the upcoming revival</a>. Development on that game is instead being handled by&nbsp;<em>Gamedec&nbsp;</em>outfit Anshar Studios.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/people-can-fly-layoffs-projects-canceled-lost-rift.jpg?itok=89B0YiNb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/people-can-fly-layoffs-projects-canceled-lost-rift.jpg?itok=dP5K-wEl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Upcoming PvPvE FPS&nbsp;<em>Lost Rift&nbsp;</em>doesn't appear to have been affected by People Can Fly's recent layoffs.</figcaption></figure><p>In any case, People Can Fly is far from the only studio to have been affected by layoffs and project cancellations in recent months. Others include&nbsp;<em>Yooka-Laylee&nbsp;</em>studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playtonic-layoffs-yooka-laylee" rel="nofollow">Playtonic</a>,&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends&nbsp;</em>developer and EA subsidiary <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/respawn-layoffs-ea-cuts-titanfall-game" rel="nofollow">Respawn</a>, and even tech giant <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-layoffs-january-2025" rel="nofollow">Microsoft</a>.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen how these layoffs will affect People Can Fly's remaining pipeline, but Projects Gemini and Bifrost won't be seeing the light of day, at any rate. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fantasy-life-i-sales-reach-another-big-milestone-more-free-gifts-revealed.1204365/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-sales-800k<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em>has reached another big sales milestone, developer and publisher Level-5 has revealed, and there are more free gifts coming your way to celebrate.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/FANTASYLIFE_EN/status/1929463460858855881" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Level-5 announces that&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</em>has reached the 800,000 sales mark across all platforms, and that the game "might even hit a million copies by the end of June" as a result of "everyone's support".</p>

<p>The new milestone means that&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</em>has picked up <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-switch-2-500k-sales" rel="nofollow">another 300,000 sales for itself</a> in the last week or so. It's not hard to see how the game might reach a million sales by the end of June; in fact, I'd be surprised if it didn't achieve that figure much sooner.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fantasy-life-i-sales-800k-napdragon.jpg?itok=-_rpkIlG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fantasy-life-i-sales-800k-napdragon.jpg?itok=onzzeg1n 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Wake up, Napdragon. Your game has sold 800,000 copies.</figcaption></figure><p>Level-5 is also <a href="https://x.com/FANTASYLIFE_EN/status/1929485787814662537" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">giving away some new goodies</a> to celebrate 800,000 sales, so if you want some extra items to help you out on your adventure, make sure to put the new code into the Gift Code Entry window in-game.</p>

<p>As a quick reminder,&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em>isn't available on any kind of subscription service, so this isn't a&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/bethesda/status/1924921261253075244" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Doom</em>-style</a> "most players" boast; this is all sales. Hopefully, Level-5's latest goes on to even bigger and better things.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</em>, it's the followup to the 2014 (2012 in Japan) 3DS life sim-slash-RPG&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life</em>. Although it's a sequel, you won't need to have played the original to enjoy the new game.</p>

<p>Like its predecessor,&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</em>allows you to choose from a number of "lives", which are essentially jobs. They're not just combat-oriented, either; lives help you not only to fight monsters, but also to gather ingredients for crafting and then to turn those ingredients into helpful items for your adventure.</p>




<p>It's fair to say it's been a long road for&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i</em>; the game has been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-girl-who-steals-time-delayed" rel="nofollow">delayed</a> numerous <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-girl-who-steals-time-delayed-indefinitely" rel="nofollow">times</a>, and its original producer Keiji Inafune <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/keiji-inafune-level-5-departure" rel="nofollow">departed Level-5 in 2024</a>, leaving studio CEO Akihiko Hino to step up to the plate as&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i</em>'s new producer.</p>

<p><em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em>is available now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2993780/FANTASY_LIFE_i_The_Girl_Who_Steals_Time/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time/9pp7tdrdzghd" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/FANTASY-LIFE-i-The-Girl-Who-Steals-Time-2339978.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>. A Nintendo Switch 2 version is set to launch on June 5th.</p>
