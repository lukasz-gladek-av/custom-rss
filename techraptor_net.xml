            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has revealed the development team behind&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>in a rare moment of transparency, and one of the studio's biggest successes on the original Switch was created by the same team.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-donkey-kong-bananza-is-being-made-by-the-mario-odyssey-team" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer report</a>,&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>was created by the same team who worked on&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, which, at <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250508_4e.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">last count</a>, had sold over 29 million units. It's safe to say, then, that&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>is in safe hands, opposable gorilla thumbs and all.</p>

<p>If you need a reminder of what we thought of&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Odyssey&nbsp;</em>back in 2017, it's one of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/every-game-techraptor-scored-10-10" rel="nofollow">few games</a> to which we awarded a full 10 out of 10 score, with our very own Andrew <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/super-mario-odyssey-review-pure-joy" rel="nofollow">calling it</a> "one of the best&nbsp;<em>Mario&nbsp;</em>games ever made". It's hard to disagree with him on that score, quite literally.</p>

<p>The game will see Donkey Kong setting out to recover the "Banandium Gems" from the evil VoidCo., which seeks to exploit them in order to reach the planet's core, which is said to grant wishes.</p>

<p>He'll have assistance from a younger version of Pauline, who can sing in order to assist DK in various ways. She's also part of&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>'s two-player mode; she can throw out damaging explosions if a second player is controlling her.</p>

<p>You'll also be able to destroy much of&nbsp;<em>Bananza</em>'s scenery, which you'll need to do in order to uncover secrets and defeat enemies, as well as to open up your options for exploration.</p>




<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>when it launches exclusively on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/Donkey-Kong-Bananza-2785804.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch 2</a> on July 17th.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[EA CEO's Pay Rises Yet Again After Disappointing Year]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-ceo-payrise-andrew-wilson</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-ceos-pay-rises-yet-again-after-disappointing-year.1232811/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA CEO Andrew Wilson's pay rose yet again this year, despite the fact that two of the studio's biggest releases were flops and despite overall median employee pay falling.</p>

<p>According to an EA proxy filing (as spotted by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ea-ceo-andrew-wilson-pay-ai-target" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Game File</a>), Wilson raked in $31 million last year, including "cash and stock awards", as Game File puts it. Wilson's pay this year <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-ceo-25-million-income-layoffs" rel="nofollow">marks a major increase</a> over last year's, so clearly, EA thinks he's doing something right.</p>

<p>That's despite the fact that&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;EA Sports FC 25</i>, two of EA's tentpole releases last year, were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-ea-sports-fc-25-underperformed" rel="nofollow">financial disappointments</a> for the company, although in fairness, March's&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>was a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-sales-4m-battlefield-skate" rel="nofollow">pretty unqualified success</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-ea-ceo-andrew-wilson-payrise.jpg?itok=S9QddC2E 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-ea-ceo-andrew-wilson-payrise.jpg?itok=cIBknmsV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>EA CEO Andrew Wilson's pay went up this year, despite major flops like&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>As Game File's Stephen Totilo points out, Wilson's payrise also happened in direct contrast to median pay for EA employees, which fell last year, because of course it did. In 2023, median employee pay was $149,000 per annum, but the year after, that figure had fallen to $117,000.</p>

<p>However, as Totilo says, EA's metrics for employee pay are somewhat obfuscated, which makes their reporting a little imprecise.</p>

<p>The figure refers to "the same median employee" as the company used in previous years to report the aforementioned figure, which is slightly confusing phrasing, and the total also includes bonuses and stock grants, as Wilson's does.</p>

<p>Still, it's a little galling that in an industry where employees' jobs seem <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-layoffs-next-week-report" rel="nofollow">constantly on the line</a> (and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/electronic-arts-to-lay-off-5-of-its-workforce-amid-refocus-on-owned-ip-and-sports-games" rel="nofollow">nowhere</a> does that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/respawn-layoffs-ea-cuts-titanfall-game" rel="nofollow">appear more true</a> than at EA), Wilson can still be making money hand over fist in this way.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ea-sports-fc-25-andrew-wilson-ceo.jpg?itok=XLqtuIWE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ea-sports-fc-25-andrew-wilson-ceo.jpg?itok=atc5q7g_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>EA employees' median pay has fallen in the last couple of years.</figcaption></figure><p>Game File's chart demonstrating just how much higher Wilson's pay is than the median employee figure is pretty alarming, and it's worth looking at if you want to feel angry (and why wouldn't you?).</p>

<p>News of Wilson's payrise also comes just a few weeks after <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-and-closes-studio-making-it" rel="nofollow">the cancellation</a> of EA's&nbsp;<em>Black Panther&nbsp;</em>game, as well as the shutdown of the studio making said game. One rather wonders if some of the money allocated to Wilson's bonus couldn't have gone towards saving that project and the jobs associated with it, but I guess I'm not a corporate exec.</p>
