            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bendy-lone-wolf-roguelike-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Joey Drew Studios has announced a new&nbsp;<em>Bendy&nbsp;</em>game in the form of&nbsp;<em>Bendy: Lone Wolf</em>, but it looks like this one will be taking a slightly different tack with regards to genre.</p>

<p>Where previous&nbsp;<em>Bendy&nbsp;</em>games were (by and large) first-person horror affairs,&nbsp;<em>Bendy: Lone Wolf&nbsp;</em>is a roguelike that pits its titular canine Boris against "endlessly generated corridors" and "ever increasing odds".</p>

<p>Exploring the twisting hallways of the <em>Bendy&nbsp;</em>series' fictional Joey Drew Studios (for which the developer is also named), Boris will need his wits about him as "monsters and obstacles emerge from every direction".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bendy-lone-wolf-announced-boris.jpg?itok=U1Bd5DSa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bendy-lone-wolf-announced-boris.jpg?itok=6YeGBlx2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Bendy: Lone Wolf&nbsp;</em>pits Boris against the ever-shifting corridors of Joey Drew Studios.</figcaption></figure><p>As Boris explores, he'll come up against the "cartoon creeps of the Dark Puddles", and it's up to you to use the weapons and resources you've gathered, as well as "the clever use of dangerous traps", to get rid of them.</p>

<p>Additionally, you'll be chased by a truly terrifying foe known only as the Ink Demon, and it sounds like you won't be able to fight him. Instead, you'll have to "run and hide" when you hear the "beating of his ink heart".</p>

<p>It's a shift away from&nbsp;<em>Bendy</em>'s traditional first-person horror puzzling, but it looks like the game still retains the signature atmosphere of the&nbsp;<em>Bendy&nbsp;</em>series. You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Bendy: Lone Wolf&nbsp;</em>right here.</p>




<p>Action roguelikes (or roguelites) based on popular franchises are becoming increasingly prevalent. In the last couple of years alone, we've seen the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/rogue-prince-of-persia-is-another-stellar-aa-addition-to-prince-of-persia-franchise" rel="nofollow"><em>The Rogue Prince of Persia</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Callisto Protocol&nbsp;</em>spinoff&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/redacted-callisto-protocol-spinoff-release-date" rel="nofollow"><em>Redacted</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-in-random-eternal-die-roguelike-announced" rel="nofollow"><em>Lost in Random: The Eternal Die</em></a>&nbsp;carrying that particular torch.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Bendy: Lone Wolf&nbsp;</em>will be released sometime next year for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3232610/Bendy_Lone_Wolf/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch, and it'll also be available on mobile devices. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things&nbsp;<em>Bendy</em>-related.</p>
