            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco and FromSoftware have announced when you can expect the&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>duos update to land, and it's not too far away at all, so get ready to revisit Limveld with your buddy.</p>

<p><i>Elden Ring Nightreign</i>'s duos mode was first <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-confirmed-sales" rel="nofollow">revealed in early June</a>, but now, the two studios have <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1948745061984014727" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">unveiled</a> the date on which you'll be able to tackle Limveld's dangers with just one other person: July 30th.</p>

<p>The ability to play in a duo will be added as part of patch 1.02, which will also bring new ways to sort relics, hopefully making organizing your favorite loadouts a little easier.</p>

At launch, the game only supported solo play or squads of three, and players quickly began requesting a duo mode, which FromSoftware was evidently happy to implement.</p>

<p>After release,&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>received a number of updates, adding features like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-adel-upgraded-update" rel="nofollow">new superpowered versions</a> of the Nightlord bosses to take on, plus new quality-of-life improvements and more.</p>

<p>News of the duos update's release date comes shortly after&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-nightreign-sales" rel="nofollow">reached five million sales</a>&nbsp;earlier this week, with&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>DLC currently sitting at ten million. Those are some pretty encouraging numbers for Bandai Namco, I'm sure.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, it's a multiplayer-focused spinoff of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>that sees players descending on a randomly-generated map in order to kill minibosses, loot gear, and get strong enough to take on a boss at the end of each run.</p>




<p>The game is one of two major multiplayer-oriented titles in FromSoftware's slate for the next couple of years; the other is&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods</em>, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-duskbloods-fromsoftware-nintendo-switch-2" rel="nofollow">Switch 2-exclusive PvPvE game</a> set to launch sometime next year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher tinyBuild and developer Hypnohead have announced that their roguelite kingdom-builder&nbsp;<em>The King Is Watching&nbsp;</em>has hit a major sales milestone within its first four days on release.</p>

<p><em>The King Is Watching&nbsp;</em>was released <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-king-is-watching-release-date" rel="nofollow">on Monday this week</a>, and according to a <a href="https://x.com/TKIWGame/status/1948672902137811139" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the game's official X (formerly Twitter) account, it's already hit the 100,000 sales mark. That puts it in good company, alongside the likes of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pioneers-of-pagonia-100k-sales" rel="nofollow">Pioneers of Pagonia</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/timberborn-sales-surpass-100k-copies-in-first-week" rel="nofollow">beaver colony sim&nbsp;<em>Timberborn</em></a>.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Hypnohead and tinyBuild <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2753900/view/542237641778661281" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">confirmed</a> that free content updates are in the works for&nbsp;<em>The King Is Watching</em>, with features like mid-run saves being "actively work[ed] on", according to the two studios.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-king-is-watching-sales-100k-colony.jpg?itok=9k9uY5oa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-king-is-watching-sales-100k-colony.jpg?itok=D-9_d71p 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The King Is Watching&nbsp;</em>has reached an impressive sales figure in just four days.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>The King Is Watching</em>, it's a roguelite kingdom-builder in which you must construct and maintain your kingdom, but with a unique twist (which the title has probably already given away).</p>

<p>As the king, you must actively watch areas of your kingdom you want to progress; if you don't, they will fall to "laziness" and "chaos", as the Steam page says, but watching them will result in progress "thriv[ing]".</p>

<p>You'll have to balance which parts of your kingdom you most want to succeed. Do you want to emphasize resource production, for instance, or defense to make sure your kingdom won't be caught unawares?</p>

<p>As you play, you'll gain upgrades that will allow you to watch more of your kingdom at once, and you'll also need to make decisions about where you want to invest the resources you've gathered in order to make your kingdom the best it can be.</p>




<p>Since this is a roguelite, you'll also have to deal with unique events that can significantly change the outcome of a run. Each run will allow you to unlock new abilities to help your kingdom thrive in future.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>The King Is Watching&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2753900/The_King_is_Watching/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, where it's currently on sale for $13.49 or your local equivalent (although that's with a 10% discount).</p>
