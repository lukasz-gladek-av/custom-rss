Even better, the sheer variety in genre, style, and intention of music can be hugely different in just one game.

<hr><h2>Third Place -&nbsp;Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</h2>



<p>Developer: MachineGames | Release Date: December 9th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Andrew Stretch</p>

<p>There's something so magical about a John Williams score. His style is what made things like the <em>Indiana Jones</em> and<em> Star Wars</em> theme so memorable to this day. I was so excited to hear that theme when loading up <em>Indiana Jones</em>, but what was even more impressive was the way composer Gordy Haab was able to capture that epicness throughout the whole score.</p>

<p>It wasn't just the loud moments, filled with the sounds of horns and strings as Indy ran from traps or fought Nazis, but also the soft chimes of solving a puzzle. The music constantly enhanced the experience while keeping the player grounded in the world as Indiana Jones.</p>

<h2>Second Place - Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</h2>



<p>Developer: Square Enix | Release Date: February 29th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Austin Suther</p>

<p>Within the past few years I started a collection of some of my favorite video game soundtracks. After playing<em> Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>, I knew what my next addition to the collection would be. With dozens upon dozens of tracks, there’s a unique song to accompany almost every occasion in <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>.</p>

<p>The expansive overworld has its own themes outside of combat, and once you initiate combat, a more “amped up” version of that song plays. Mini-games have their own music, characters have their own themes too, and so much more. Quantity does not always equal quality, but in <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>’s case, every song is a banger.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Winner - Metaphor: ReFantazio</h2>



<p>Developer: Atlus | Release Date: October 11th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Robert Scarpinito</p>

<p>As expected with veteran composer Shoji Meguro, the music in <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> works overtime to claim your attention. The biggest, and most notable, earworm is of course <em>Warriors in Valour</em>, the main battle theme.</p>

<p>Because of the game's structure, you're less likely to get fatigued over it because battles won't happen as often, thanks to the overworld mechanics. But when they do happen? You've got the most energetic monk in your corner, chanting for your victory.</p>

<p>You've surely noticed it if you played the game—it's a triumphant mood shift from a decent battle theme to a rousing cheer toward triumph. To call it "epic" doesn't begin to describe how it gets the blood pumping.</p>

<p>Another song worth shouting out is the final boss theme. Without spoiling anything of course, it masterfully blends themes that you've heard throughout the the long, 80+ hour journey. While taking down the final boss, the music reflects back on every step you've taken to get to there.</p>

<p>When the music tells its own story on top of the main narrative, it absolutely earns your attention--and our praise.</p>
