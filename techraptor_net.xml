            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bad news if you were looking forward to Koei Tecmo's upcoming <em>Dynasty Warriors 3 </em>remaster: the game has been delayed indefinitely in order to give Koei Tecmo more time to "fully satisfy" franchise fans.</p><p>As revealed by the publisher <a href="https://x.com/KoeiTecmoUS/status/2015726489149276652" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">on social media</a>, <em>Dynasty Warriors 3: Complete Edition Remastered</em>, which was originally set to launch across PC and consoles in March, no longer has a release date. The extra time will be used to "further improve the quality of the game", Koei Tecmo says.</p><p>Although no new release date was announced, the studio does say that a new date will be revealed "at a later date", so hopefully, you won't have to wait too much longer to find out when you'll get to play this nostalgic trip into the past.</p><figure role="group">

<p><em>Dynasty Warriors 3: Complete Edition Remastered </em>was technically first revealed alongside <em>Dynasty Warriors Origins</em>' first DLC <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dynasty-warriors-origins-dlc-remaster" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="8865ca2f-1071-4d07-a044-3a5661b38db2" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">back in August</a>, although at the time, Koei Tecmo was fairly cagey about which game was getting the remaster treatment.</p><p>Of course, since <em>Dynasty Warriors 3 </em>is a firm fan favorite, it was always one of the frontrunners, and so when <em>Dynasty Warriors 3</em>'s remaster was finally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-state-of-play-september-2025" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="cd5b7ba9-4473-41df-8d3c-8a1ff1c52f90" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">unveiled in September</a>, it didn't come as much of a surprise to fans.</p><p>The remaster will boast new visuals courtesy of Unreal Engine 5, as well as a host of other gameplay and performance improvements and tweaks. It'll also pack in the extra content included as part of the game's expanded <em>Xtreme Legends </em>release.</p><p>Other than those tweaks, however, Koei Tecmo seems to be aiming to make <em>Dynasty Warriors 3: Complete Edition Remastered </em>as close to the original as you remember, so if you're nostalgic for its signature 1-versus-1000 action, you're in luck.</p>
<p><em>Dynasty Warriors 3: Complete Edition Remastered </em>is now set to release sometime this year for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3841510/DYNASTY_WARRIORS_3_Complete_Edition_Remastered/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10016743" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/dynasty-warriors-3-complete-edition-remastered/9pnhw2mssq80" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and both Switch 2 and Switch.
