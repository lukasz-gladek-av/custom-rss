            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Team Ninja and Koei Tecmo have revealed that their Soulslike action RPG <em>Nioh 3 </em>has crossed a major sales barrier, thus also breaking a franchise record in the process.</p><p>In a <a href="https://teamninja-studio.com/nioh3/uk/news/20260220.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">news post</a> on the game's official website, Koei Tecmo announces that <em>Nioh 3 </em>sales have passed one million since the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nioh-3-release-date-leak-amazon-japan-listing" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="0c70bc4b-8dd4-4d3c-bc44-0520542282b8" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">launched at the start of the month</a>, which makes this third installment the "fastest-selling entry in the series' history".</p><p>Not only that, but the <em>Nioh </em>series as a whole has now passed 10 million sales, which presumably means that the first two games in the franchise clocked up 9 million sales between them. That's not too shabby, and we can probably expect <em>Nioh 3 </em>to compete with its forebears on this front, at the very least.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Nioh 3 </em>is putting the series on the map in terms of sales speed.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In general, it seems that <em>Nioh 3 </em>is part of an upward trend for Koei Tecmo when it comes to initial sales; back in 2024, the studio also revealed that its Bakumatsu-era RPG <em>Rise of the Ronin </em>had surpassed the first two <em>Nioh </em>games <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rise-of-ronin-sales-koei-tecmo-financials" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="67f991d6-0e1a-4301-9f20-4cef49c020a1" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">in terms of launch sales</a>.</p><p>If you're not familiar with <em>Nioh 3</em>, it is, believe it or not, the third game in the <em>Nioh </em>series, which blends <em>Souls</em>-esque combat and exploration with a focus on loot gathering and fast-paced combat.</p><p>In contrast to its predecessors, <em>Nioh 3 </em>allows you to travel between various eras in Japanese history, including the aforementioned Bakumatsu era, as well as the Edo, Sengoku, and Heian periods.</p><p>Much like in Team Ninja's other Soulslike RPG <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/wo-long-fallen-dynasty" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ded52dd9-4edb-4dd7-b4c6-09ff708bab63" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty</em></a>, you'll meet and interact with historical figures from throughout these periods, including the likes of Hattori Hanzo, Minamoto no Yoshitsune, and Himiko.</p>
<p>You can check out <em>Nioh 3 </em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3681010/Nioh_3/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/nioh-3/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a>. There's been no mention of ports to other systems yet, but given that <em>Nioh </em>has historically been exclusive to PlayStation (and PC), it's unlikely. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Omega Strikers </em>developer Odyssey Interactive has become the latest studio to be hit by layoffs, with around 50% of the studio's workforce apparently affected.</p><p>That's according to <a href="https://x.com/TotoroIsMyHomie/status/2024579265283706938" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a post</a> by (now-former) Odyssey Interactive artist Jordan Ewing, who says that he, along with "roughly 50% of the team", has been let go. Odyssey itself doesn't appear to have officially confirmed the layoffs anywhere.</p><p>You might recognize Odyssey Interactive's name from "footbrawler" <em>Omega Strikers</em>, which was released in September 2022. Just eight months or so after its launch, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/omega-strikers-will-cease-content-development-8-months-after-release-as-studio-moves-on" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1dfc6fb0-f5c9-4964-89dd-62b8efda69aa" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">active content development on <em>Omega Strikers </em>was halted</a>, and the studio pivoted to other projects instead.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Odyssey Interactive is best known for <em>Omega Strikers</em>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Upon the cessation of regular updates for <em>Omega Strikers</em>, Odyssey pledged to keep the game's servers open so players could continue to play. A quick look at the game's <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1869590/charts/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Steam charts</a> shows a 24-hour peak of just over 200 players.</p><p>To date, <em>Omega Strikers </em>remains Odyssey Interactive's only released game. In September 2024, the developer revealed a platform fighter called <em>Byte Breakers</em>, holding playtesting on Steam despite the admission that the studio "might not even make this game".</p><p>At time of writing, the announcement of <em>Byte Breakers</em>' playtest remains the last video uploaded to the Odyssey YouTube channel, and the status of the project is unknown, although these layoffs don't exactly instil confidence.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Odyssey is just the latest in an increasingly long string of developers and publishers to be hit by layoffs. In recent months alone, others include <em>Splinter Cell </em>remake developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-toronto-layoffs-splinter-cell-remake" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="62d2788d-7dd8-425b-8a67-fe5154e140d9" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Ubisoft Toronto</a>, Riot Games' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/2xko-layoffs-riot" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="156c400e-add5-4e40-ad10-9f36c14e77e9" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>2XKO </em>team</a>, and <em>Ashes of Creation</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ashes-of-creation-layoffs-canceled-report" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1b59358e-2c0a-4543-a759-154075e27078" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Intrepid Studios</a>.</p><p>The market for competitive live-service games is growing increasingly fierce and cutthroat, and it's becoming more and more common for smaller studios like Odyssey (or, indeed, like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/highguard-developer-wildlight-reportedly-lays-off-most-staff" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="662d78d2-0c4f-4bac-903f-7998daba8b76" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Highguard </em>developer Wildlight</a>) to slip through the cracks.</p><p>For now, it seems like Odyssey Interactive remains a going concern, although I sadly can't imagine that the studio has too bright a future ahead of it without a major success under its belt.

<figcaption><em>Burbank </em>was an attempt to reinvent the life sim courtesy of <em>XCOM</em>'s Jake Solomon.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Solomon describes <em>Burbank </em>as "life sims + <em>The Truman Show</em>", but he also says the project was "more than that", allowing players to "share whatever stories and characters they can dream up".</p><p>He also confirms that the studio was using generative AI for characters' "memory, reasoning, and speech", which would have been central to <em>Burbank</em>'s systems. However, Solomon says Midsummer "had no interest in replacing <em>any</em> (that's Solomon's stress) developers with AI".</p><p>Alongside Solomon, Midsummer also included luminaries like <em>The Sims </em>producer Grant Rodiek and <em>Marvel's Midnight Suns </em>lead engineer Will Miller. The studio had <a href="https://www.midsummerstudios.com/news/studio-announcement" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">already secured funding</a> for <em>Burbank</em>, so it's not entirely clear why Midsummer has shut down.</p><p>Sadly, Solomon's studio is far from the only one to close without releasing anything. Others include BioWare veteran <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rich-vogel-t-minus-zero-entertainment-netease-shut-down" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ceba73e9-0d31-4194-b075-665cc4485263" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Rich Vogel's T-Minus Zero Entertainment</a>, <em>Black Panther </em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-and-closes-studio-making-it" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9f4cbdba-9454-498e-94c7-4431b417dcf3" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Cliffhanger Games</a>, and (technically) <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/midnight-society-shutdown-dr-disrespect" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="051a9886-fd8d-4af3-b1b4-c8250927f5a1" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Midnight Society, the studio behind <em>Deadrop</em></a>.</p><figure role="group">

<p><em>Burbank</em>'s attempt to redefine the life sim genre also isn't the only one that's failed; while it's much less high-profile than <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/life-by-you-paradoxs-sims-competitor-has-been-cancelled" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c822c0ba-3847-4141-97dd-732cffafcf52" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Paradox's <em>Life by You</em></a>, it's another name to join that ill-fated project in the life sim graveyard.</p><p>Whether or not Jake Solomon re-emerges with another studio (or as a designer elsewhere) remains to be seen, but at the very least, <em>Burbank </em>is no more, unfortunately.

We don't know what else might be revealed during that show yet.</p><p><em>Pokemon FireRed and LeafGreen </em>are remakes of the original two <em>Pokemon </em>games; while you may remember <em>Pokemon Red and Blue </em>kicking off the franchise, the Japanese versions of the game were actually <em>Red and Green</em>, so the remake stays faithful to those releases.</p><figure role="group">

<p>Nintendo says you'll be able to trade and battle with your friends using local communication, too, so you'll still be able to collect the Pokemon that can only evolve via this method.</p><p>Whether or not <em>Pokemon FireRed and LeafGreen</em>'s Switch releases will support <em>Pokemon Home </em>remains to be seen, although I think it'd be a huge misstep if that wasn't the case. Let's hope you can transfer your friends to <em>Home </em>when the games launch.</p><p><em>Pokemon FireRed and LeafGreen</em>'s Switch releases come amid a flurry of activity for the franchise; yesterday, a brand new <em>Pokemon TCG Pocket </em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-paldean-wonders-set" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ee463c7f-df01-4445-8c97-75dc31184111" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">set was announced</a>, and a range of Lego <em>Pokemon </em>products were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lego-pokemon-fan-favorites-revealed" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="20154363-2140-41d8-aed8-9ac66d983fc8" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">also revealed last month</a>.</p><p>Of course, there's also the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-pokopia-release-date-leak" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3eeb790b-1baf-43d8-afe2-99182049c947" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">impending release</a> of the life sim <em>Pokemon Pokopia</em>, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-leak-2025-gen-10-more" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c5a709d9-d361-46d9-823d-aa0957eba8ed" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">mounting speculation</a> revolving around the tenth mainline <em>Pokemon </em>generation, which may or may not be revealed during the Presents showcase next week.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see what else gets revealed during that Presents show, but for the meantime, <em>Pokemon FireRed and LeafGreen </em>launch on Switch on February 27th. It sounds like they'll be standalone releases rather than Switch Online goodies, too.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
