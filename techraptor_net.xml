            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dragon Quest</em> has been having a renaissance with the recent releases of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/dragon-quest-1-2-hd-2d-remake-preview-pax-east-2025" rel="nofollow"><em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-review-all-that-glitters-are-pixels" rel="nofollow"><em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em></a>. These remakes garnered high praise among the masses for revitalizing three iconic classics for the modern era, and make no mistake—Square Enix has every intention of continuing to deliver amazing, creative remakes of timeless classics with the upcoming release of <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em>. This game is sure to stun audiences with its beautiful hand-crafted 3D art style, modern gameplay features, and heartwarming story.</p>

<p><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em> is based on the original PlayStation title released in 2000 in Japan, then remade for the Nintendo 3DS in 2013, and focuses on the adventures of a group of childhood friends who leave their home of Estard Island to embark on a high-stakes adventure across the seas and through time itself to battle against unknown, evil forces and discover the mysteries of their world.</p>

<p>My one-hour hands-on experience with <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em>&nbsp;showed off a delightful game full of charm and mystique while also embodying the same fun, lighthearted spirit that made the original <em>Dragon Quest VII</em> such a well-revered title among fans of the franchise.&nbsp;</p>

When I entered the village, Old Man Riffer was entertaining the villagers with his torban before quickly trying to leave despite the villagers' protests. At night, while staying in the inn, a haunting melody began to play, opening portals that spirit away the villagers into the unknown, prompting the party to investigate the strange disappearances.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When traversing the continent in search of answers, I found myself stumbling across Spliton-on-Sea, an abandoned fishing village that exhibited signs of being plagued by the same mystery as Wetlock. While exploring the map and interacting with important locations, the playable characters would trigger opportunities to talk to certain characters to get their thoughts on current events and helpful hints on where to go next.</p>

<p>Eventually, I found my way to Highendreigh Tower and began uncovering the truth behind the disappearances in Wetlock and Spliton-on-Sea, which led to the sudden appearance of Gracos the Demon King, who submerged the entire small island continent in water.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you’ve ever played a <em>Dragon Quest</em> game before or if you’re new to the franchise, the mechanics are easy to catch on to. Players get four basic commands: Attack, which launches a basic attack with your equipped weapon; Skills, which allows players to chose from a variety of abilities and spells that can be used by each character based on their growth and class; Items that can be used to to heal and buff players or attack and debuff enemies; and Defend to reduce damage from incoming enemy attacks.</p>

<p><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em> also introduces the brand-new feature called Moonlighting, where the player can assign an additional class to each playable character to gain special abilities and skills to the playable characters. These additional classes can be changed at-will while playing without having to go anywhere special, like a church, inn, or checkpoint to change that additional vocation, and I found it really fun to be able to switch them whenever to create different strategic combinations before heading into battle.</p>

<p>One of my favorite characters to utilize was Aishe, who had Destiny’s Dancer as one of her vocations, giving her access to M-Pathy, a powerful healing spell.</p>

<p>I also had her as a Troubadour, which allowed her to cast Divine Intervention to prevent the party from experiencing instant death from an attack. This combination made her a powerhouse healer while still being effective at offensive attacks with her sword. Ruff, Maribel, and the protagonist also had their own combination of unique spells and abilities in the demo, and being able to mix and match to address any combat situation helped to keep the game refreshing and engaging.</p>

<p>The second location available in the demo was Emberdale at an earlier part of the game, which allowed me the chance to play as Kiefer, the Prince of Estard, alongside Maribel and the protagonist. When the party arrived in Emberdale, the town had been experiencing strange tremors from the volcano near their town, so they started preparations for the Flaming Festival to give fire back to the volcano as a tribute in hopes of stopping it from erupting.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dq7r_wetlock_11.jpg?itok=kLZZdfU6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dq7r_wetlock_11.jpg?itok=Fl2uWDb2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Meanwhile, Palmela, the town clairvoyant, had been trying to prevent the townspeople from doing that because she was certain the volcano would erupt because of it. At night, the townsfolk go to the volcano and begin feeding it their flames, but it slowly awakens the Glowering Inferno, a fire-based monster that had been living inside the volcano with plans to destroy the continent Emberdale sits on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The battle against the Glowering Inferno felt tense due to the limited abilities the party had access to in this demo, but it may also have to do with the fact that I sped down to the bottom of the volcano without fighting many enemies along the way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite the difficulties of the battle, various vocational abilities aided in making the battle easier to progress through. The protagonist had the Fledgling Fisherman vocation, which allowed him to use Ocean’s Devotion, an ability that made it so each ally would neutralize the next attack that targeted them.</p>

<p>Maribel, as a Mini Mayoress, could use Shewrd Operator, which allowed her to see through enemy resistances to make elemental attacks more effective. Keifer with the Heir Apparent vocation would cast Royal Flush, which reduced his defense stats while significantly increasing his attack power and critical hit chances.&nbsp;</p>

The beautiful diorama-esque style makes it feel like the player is looking down on a miniature world while moving around living-breathing maquettes rather than just simple 3D models.</p>

<p>It makes sense given Square Enix scanned in hand-crafted, super-detailed dolls of all of the main playable characters to give the game its unique, distinct art style, differentiating it from other Dragon Quest games while still embodying the charm of the character designs illustrated by the late Akira Toriyama.</p>

<p>As I finished my time with <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em>, I couldn’t help but wish I could have played even more because of how much fun I was having. There were also plenty of hidden mysteries within the demo that I wished I had the chance to find and experience, but that just means I have plenty to look forward to when the game comes out next year, and fans of the franchise or newcomers looking for a new turn-based RPG will also have plenty to enjoy and explore, too.</p>
