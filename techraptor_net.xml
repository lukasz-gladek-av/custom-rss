            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-mod-support<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Warhorse Studios has announced that&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>mod support is on the way, although it doesn't look like console players will be able to take advantage of the feature (for now, at least).</p>

<p>Per an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1771300/view/514075305730637907" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on the game's Steam page, mod support is on its way to&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>via Steamworks, which means that you'll be able to download and play mods via Steam.</p>

<p>Of course, that also means PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S players are being left out in the cold to some degree, so unless Warhorse announces a separate modding solution for console players, it looks like PC is the way to go for modders. Twas ever thus, eh?</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>, it's a medieval RPG set in 15th-century Bohemia. Like its <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/kingdom-come-deliverance" rel="nofollow">predecessor</a>,&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>emphasizes historical realism and accuracy over fantasy, so you'll be fighting lots of regular ol' people and not so many dragons or wizards.</p>

<p>The game once again picks up the story of Henry of Skalitz, a blacksmith's son who's out to get revenge for his murdered parents. Along the way, he'll get dragged into exactly the kind of political intrigue you'd expect from such a volatile historical setting.</p>




<p>If you're in the market for a hefty, beefy RPG, this will almost certainly fit the bill; Warhorse says&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>'s script <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-script-words" rel="nofollow">has more than two million words</a>, so you can expect plenty of content to keep you entertained.</p>

<p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>is available now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1771300/Kingdom_Come_Deliverance_II/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/9n4w31hsmvvd" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ninja-gaiden-2-black-update-new-game-plus<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Koei Tecmo has released an update for hack-and-slash action game&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</em>, and it's bringing a New Game Plus mode, adjustments to some of the game's enemy encounters, and more.</p>

<p>The first big addition in this update is New Game Plus, which allows you to replay a difficulty level you've already finished with all of your weapons and Ninpo intact. Their levels will, however, be reset, so bear that in mind.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to a photo mode that allows you to pause&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</em>'s action and take snapshots, although bear in mind that this isn't&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider I-III Remastered</em>'s photo mode, so you can't essentially just wander around the level with it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ninja-gaiden-2-black-update-new-game-plus-dragon.jpg?itok=Mc5to8mu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ninja-gaiden-2-black-update-new-game-plus-dragon.jpg?itok=iUNrszjF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A new&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black&nbsp;</em>update is available, and it's got plenty of stuff for you to check out.</figcaption></figure><p>Other smaller adjustments include the ability to hide Ryu's current projectile weapon, as well as a host of changes to enemy encounters across various chapters. Some enemies have had their HP lowered, while other encounters have had their enemy density increased.</p>

<p>Of course, the update also brings a handful of bug fixes and technical improvements. You can check out the full patch notes for this&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black&nbsp;</em>update <a href="https://teamninja-studio.com/ng2black/us/update/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>.</p>

<p>If you're wondering what&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black&nbsp;</em>is, it's a remastered version of the 2008 action game&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 2</em>, as well as its 2009 re-release&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2</em>.</p>

<p>Koei Tecmo's intention was to create a definitive version of the&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 2&nbsp;</em>experience, and so as well as a full visual revamp using Unreal Engine 5, the game also blends <i>Sigma 2</i>'s additional content with various systems and gameplay features in the original&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 2</em>.</p>




<p>It's all go for the&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden&nbsp;</em>franchise right now. As well as <i>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</i>, you can also look forward to&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>, which is currently in the works as a co-development project between Team Ninja and PlatinumGames.</p>

<p><em>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3287520/NINJA_GAIDEN_2_Black/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012997" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/ninja-gaiden-2-black/9N51FH42VQDS" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. Stay tuned for more.</p>
