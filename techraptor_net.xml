<h2>The Avalon Hill Essen Spiel 2025 Announcements</h2>

<p>As part of the first day of the iconic board game convention, Avalon Hill announced two new board games: <em>Market Fresh</em>, and <em>HeroQuest Wizards of Morcar</em>.</p>

Players gain points for every crate they add, and score higher for every crate they stack. However, space will run out as competition intensifies, so who can hold out the longest? The game was created by award-winning German designers Michael Kiesling (<em>Azul</em>, <em>Vikings</em>) and Wolfgang Kramer (<em>Take 5</em>, <em>Coliseum</em>).</p>

<p><em>Market Fresh</em> will be available in January 2026 at local game stores. It will be sold at an MSRP of $44.99.</p>

<p>The second game, <em>HeroQuest Wizards of Morcar</em>, is an updated version of the 1991 original quest pack. At its core, it is the same fantasy story. A dark alliance of wizards has come together to do Zargon's dark bidding. What is he after? The power of 1,000 Dread sorcerers locked away in the High Alter of the Northern Dread Wastes.</p>

The box will include 27 detailed miniatures, 64 game cards, and a cardboard tile sheet. You will need <em>HeroQuest Game System</em> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/hero-quest-first-light-review-your-favorite-ttrpgs-favorite-gateway-ttrpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>HeroQuest First Light</em></a> to play this expansion.</p>
