            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A few short days ago, Epictellers launched a Kickstarter campaign for <em>Starfinder: Afterlight</em>. The campaign promises an in-depth cRPG videogame adaptation of Paizo's spacefaring TTRPG, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/starfinder" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Starfinder</em></a>. A project that is off to a strong start, raising over $400,000.</p>



<p>According to the official <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/epictellers/starfinder-afterlight/description" rel="nofollow">campaign page</a>, <em>Starfinder: Afterlight</em> is an exciting turn-based, narrative-rich, RPG set in the world of Starfinder. The game will center on your custom character and the crew of your own spaceship as you explore the Pact Worlds. The game will feature branching narratives based on your choices, romanceable crew members, and a 40+ hour main story experience.</p>

But, the campaign prefaces this by stating the game has been in development for a while. It has already spent a year in pre-production, onboarding developers and voice-actors. Additionally, a development pipeline is in place, with the game set to release in Early Access at the start of 2026, followed by a full release in 2027.</p>

<p>As for the voice-actors confirmed for <em>Starfinder: Afterlight</em>, they contain some fantastic industry staples. Big names like Fred Tatasciore, Carolina Ravassa, and Imel Tomlinson are confirmed as major crewmates. But the biggest head turner is the inclusion of voice-actor and voice director of the game is Neil Newbon, most well known for the roguish vampire Astarion in <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/baldurs-gate-3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A second major selling point for the game is on the gameplay side. The game would not just be a turn-based RPG, but one built on the ruleset and mechanics of <em>Starfinder: Second Edition</em>.</p>

While other games like Owlcat's <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/pathfinder-wrath-of-righteous" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous</em></a> have done well, this is the first time a game has tried to adapt Paizo's system into a videogame.</p>

<p>The pledge tiers for <em>Starfinder: Afterlight</em> are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Akitonian Merchant for $41:</strong> A digital PC copy of the game (Steam), special Akitonian in-game dice, and Kickstarter-exclusive digital wallpaper</li>
	<li><strong>Member of the Starfinder Society for $70:</strong> A digital PC copy of the game (Steam), special in-game Starfinder Society items, a digital art book and soundtrack</li>
	<li><strong>Khali's Crew for $105:</strong> Everything in the Member of the Starfinder Society tier, and Khali's Dawn in-game items, and closed beta access</li>
	<li><strong>Complete Edition for $175:</strong> Everything in the Khali's Crew tier, STL files for companions and villains, sacred larva in-game dice, and PDFs of Starfinder Second Edition&nbsp;</li>
</ul><p>At the time of writing, <em>Starfinder: Afterlight</em> has raised&nbsp;$444,016, more than five times its initial funding goal of $<span><span><span>87,336. This has unlocked several stretch goals for the project, which include new playable ancestries like the Skittermander and Pahtras, as well as full voice-acting for all sidequests. The campaign ends on November 8.</span></span></span></p>
