            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Japanese company Hitachi has announced a new voice command software protocol for the Switch 2, and I, for one, am daring to hope it could be used to finally bring old DS games to the system.</p><p>As spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/hitachi-launches-multilingual-intuitive-voice-command-recognition-software-for-nintendo-switch-2-game-devs/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Automaton Media</a>, the Ruby Spotter software allows developers to incorporate voice command features beyond simply using the microphone for communication. It's actually already available in a number of other places, including "car navigation systems" and "industrial equipment", according to Automaton.</p><p>Hitachi's decision to bring the software to the Switch 2 is driven by a desire to create an environment for developers to include "highly flexible operations" for the microphone in their games, including menu selections and issuing in-game commands.</p><figure role="group">

<p>The possibilities are endless; developers could use Hitachi's Ruby Spotter software to allow you to issue commands to troops in a strategy game, for instance, or to communicate with an in-game character, <em>Nintendogs</em>-style.</p><p>That might as well bring us onto what I really hope this software can be used for: porting DS games to the Switch 2. Since there's already a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-klonoa-mr-driller" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="201c59bf-eb51-4121-bbf8-ae2b52eff44c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">robust library</a> of Game Boy Advance <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-starfy-gba" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="40d7514b-1ab5-4518-bcb1-2874c7dd70bf" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">games</a> on the Switch Online service, I think the debut of DS titles is way past due.</p><p>Games like <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Phantom Hourglass </em>and the aforementioned <em>Nintendogs </em>used the Nintendo DS' microphone as part of their gameplay, and Hitachi's Ruby Spotter could allow Nintendo to bring those games (which are otherwise unavailable) to the Switch 2.</p><p>As it stands, there are tons of DS games, including the ones I've mentioned, that you'll need to turn to the second-hand market to enjoy, and so this would seem like the perfect opportunity to port them to modern systems. Come on, Nintendo. You know it makes sense.</p><figure role="group">

<p>We'll hopefully see developers starting to use this software in games before long. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
