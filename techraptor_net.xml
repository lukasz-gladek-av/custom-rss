            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sega-new-virtua-fighter-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega has officially announced that a new&nbsp;<em>Virtua Fighter&nbsp;</em>game is in the works as part of the company's drive to revive some of its classic franchises.</p>

<p>Speaking <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/why-sega-is-reviving-classics-like-shinobi-and-jet-set-radio-across-games-film-and-tv/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">to VGC</a>, Sega transmedia head Justin Scarpone revealed that alongside revivals of franchises like&nbsp;<em>Jet Set Radio</em>,&nbsp;<em>Golden Axe</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Shinobi</em>,&nbsp;which were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/game-awards-2023-recap-check-out-all-news-trailers-and-reveals">announced during last year's Game Awards</a>, a new&nbsp;<em>Virtua Fighter&nbsp;</em>game is also in development, although Scarpone stopped short of revealing further details.</p>

<p>Scarpone also says that "in certain instances", Sega has transmedia projects in development alongside its games, pointing to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shinobi-movie-announced">recently-revealed&nbsp;<em>Shinobi&nbsp;</em>movie</a> as an example, although it's not clear whether&nbsp;<em>Virtua Fighter&nbsp;</em>is also part of that initiative.</p>

<p>These projects include a reboot of&nbsp;<em>Crazy Taxi</em>, which Sega says <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crazy-taxi-reboot-open-world-mmo">will be an open-world MMO</a> in contrast to the original game's classic arcade approach to gameplay, as well as reworks of <i>Golden Axe</i>,&nbsp;<em>Shinobi</em>, <i>Jet Set Radio</i>, and&nbsp;<em>Streets of Rage&nbsp;</em>(in the latter case, a reboot distinct from <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/streets-of-rage-4">2020's&nbsp;<em>Streets of Rage 4</em></a>).</p>

<p>We don't have any kind of inclination regarding what exactly Sega is planning to do with these franchises (beyond the&nbsp;<em>Crazy Taxi&nbsp;</em>reboot, of course), but we'll likely learn more in the coming months.</p>

The game managed to sell a million copies within its first few hours on sale.</p>

<p>The gaming giant has also enjoyed recent success thanks to the release of&nbsp;3D platformer&nbsp;<em>Sonic x Shadow Generations</em>, which, much like the aforementioned JRPG, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-x-shadow-generations-sales-million">sold very strongly indeed on its launch day</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-sales-30m</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hogwarts-legacy-sales-top-30m-as-sequel-work-continues.1028853/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-sales-30m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Warner Bros has revealed that&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>sales have topped yet another huge sales milestone, further cementing the game's importance as a cornerstone of the studio's gaming strategy.</p>

<p>As noted in <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/harry-potter-franchise-future-tv-series-video-games-1236201249/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a Variety article</a>,&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>has now reached 30 million sales "as of last month" (that's Variety's wording), which means it's picked up another 15 million sales between <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-sales-smash-through-15-million-barrier">May 2023</a> and now. That's pretty impressive, even given the game's high profile.</p>

<p>Variety also notes that&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>was the top-selling game across the board in 2023, meaning it beat huge releases like&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom&nbsp;</em>and the&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em>remake (not to mention being the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/google-year-end-search-list-gaming-2023">most-Googled game of that year</a> as well).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hogwarts-legacy-sales-dragon.jpg?itok=fKlBqvwN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hogwarts-legacy-sales-dragon.jpg?itok=cDdurZF6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>is, surprise surprise, a big seller for Warner Bros.</figcaption></figure><p>Warner Bros. Interactive president David Haddad says the company is currently thinking hard about the sequel to <i>Hogwarts Legacy</i>, acknowledging that fans of the franchise are "looking for more things in this world" and that his studio is "spending a lot of time" considering how to give them what they want.</p>

<p>If you're someone who disagrees with&nbsp;<em>Harry Potter&nbsp;</em>writer J.K. Rowling's political stances, you might be dismayed to learn that while Rowling doesn't directly manage the franchise, Warner Bros is keeping her updated "via her literary agent" (again, that's Variety's wording, not WB's).</p>

<p>This news comes after it was reported that&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&nbsp;</em>developer Rocksteady is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-directors-cut-report">currently working on a Director's Cut version</a> of&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, although no official announcement on Rocksteady or Warner Bros' part has been made on that front.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hogwarts-legacy-sales-characters.jpg?itok=55pVpkNN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hogwarts-legacy-sales-characters.jpg?itok=Lw_DdnvS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A Director's Cut version of&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>is reportedly in the works.</figcaption></figure><p>Indeed,&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>'s financial success will no doubt come as a relief for Warner Bros given the fairly spectacular failure of the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em>, which cost Warner Bros $200 million after achieving <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-kill-justice-leagues-sales-disappointed-hogwarts-legacy-is-big-win">disappointing sales</a>.</p>

<p>It may even have been&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em>'s failure that led to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rocksteady-layoffs-suicide-squad">layoffs at the studio</a>&nbsp;in September, although the studio is reportedly in the midst of pitching a new single-player game that would return it to its&nbsp;<em>Batman: Arkham</em>-style roots (although it's not necessarily part of that franchise).</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Don't Nod Employees to Strike This Week Following Layoff Announcement]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-nod-employees-strike</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dont-nod-employees-to-strike-this-week-following-layoff-announcement.1028790/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-nod-employees-strike<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Employees at&nbsp;<em>Life Is Strange&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden&nbsp;</em>developer Don't Nod will go on strike this week, following an announcement of sweeping layoffs at the studio.</p>

<p>Last month, Don't Nod announced that up to 69 employees' jobs could be at risk after a period of underperformance for the company. French union STJV then <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-nod-strike-stjv-union">called on employees to strike</a>, describing Don't Nod's redundancy plan as "the climax of a series of catastrophic decisions".</p>

<p>Now, according to a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/dont-nod-workers-to-strike-on-november-8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GamesIndustry.biz report</a>, it seems that strike is indeed going ahead on Friday. The strike's picket line will apparently be next to the studio's Paris HQ, and employees are due to gather at 2pm local time.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden-dont-nod-strike.jpg?itok=DR_SA-Nm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden-dont-nod-strike.jpg?itok=O5JdCP8e 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Employees from Don't Nod will go on strike on Friday.</figcaption></figure><p>According to the GI.biz report, employee demands include management abandoning the aforementioned redundancy plan, giving employees greater decision-making power at the studio, and CEO Oskar Guilbert attending the negotiations.</p>

<p>An open letter from Don't Nod employees also highlights what they call "delusions of grandeur" and "short-term thinking" at the studio, leading to what they describe as "a succession of negligent acts and bad decisions" on management's part.</p>

<p>The employees conclude by saying they want to save their studio, but "not at the price of unjustified redundancies or a deteriorated working environment".</p>

<p>This situation is occurring after what has been a trying period for Don't Nod, with several of the studio's recent projects, including climbing sim&nbsp;<em>Jusant&nbsp;</em>and action-RPG&nbsp;<em>Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-nod-financials-first-half-2024">underperforming compared to expectations</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dont-nod-strike-jusant.jpg?itok=OMmrod-D 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dont-nod-strike-jusant.jpg?itok=eZCR9WV- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Don't Nod's games have been underperforming recently.</figcaption></figure><p>Don't Nod isn't the only studio going on strike in recent months.&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>studio Ubisoft, for instance, also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-strike-investor-letter">faced employee strike action</a> last month following <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activist-ubisoft-investor-open-letter-change">criticisms from investors</a> regarding decisions made by management.</p>

<p>The potential layoffs at the studio also come as part of a wider wave that's sweeping across the industry, catching big companies like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-ceo-payrise-layoffs">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-layoffs">Sony</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-interactive-layoffs">Take-Two</a>, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/disco-elysium-developer-zaum-confirms-game-cancellation-and-layoffs">smaller studios</a>, in its wake.</p>
