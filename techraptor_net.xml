            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, The Pokemon Company held a Pokemon Presents showcase to highlight what's happening in the world of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>in the coming months. Here's everything that was announced during the show!</p>

<hr><h2>Pokemon World Championships 2025 artwork revealed</h2>

The Championship Sunday event will be held in an arena for the first time this year, and more than 20,000 attendees are expected to celebrate the event.</p>

<h2><em>Pokemon Concierge</em>'s second season is coming in September</h2>

<p>Next, we got a look at the new season of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Concierge</em>, which begins airing on Netflix on September 4th. Cute Pokemon like Psyduck, the Pan trio of monkeys, and Shiinotic will be appearing in the hand-crafted stop-motion animated series.</p>

<h2><em>Pokemon Tales: The Misadventures of Sirfetch'd &amp; Pichu&nbsp;</em>is coming in 2027</h2>

<h2>PokePark Kanto is opening in 2026</h2>

<p>PokePark Kanto, the first "permanent outdoor&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>attraction", will be opening in 2026 in Japan's Yomiuriland amusement park. It looks like the perfect holiday destination if you want to immerse yourself in a world of real-life Pokemon (well, as close as you're going to get, anyhow).</p>



<p>Next, we got a series of announcements regarding ongoing&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>mobile games.&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Go&nbsp;</em>Fest Max Finale 2025 was first up, and it'll see Max Pokemon appearing, with Eternatus making its debut in the game as well.</p>

<p>Over in&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Masters EX</em>, you can look forward to battling Carmine and Sinistcha, and you can log in now to get a 3,000-gem gift.&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Cafe Remix</em>, meanwhile, is getting a very cute Lapras sea captain outfit, which is coming tomorrow.</p>

<p>In&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Sleep</em>, the legendary dog trio from Gen II will be added to the game, so you can look forward to researching Raikou, Entei, and Suicune in September. A new area is also coming to the game in November.</p>

<p><em>Pokemon Unite</em>'s fourth anniversary is bringing Latios and Latias into the fray, and Pawmi, Pawmo, and Pawmot are also set to make an appearance in the game soon.</p>

<h2><em>Pokemon Friends&nbsp;</em>is a cute mobile puzzler</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-presents-july-2025-pikachu-bulb-puzzler.jpg?itok=IqDtd3AD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-presents-july-2025-pikachu-bulb-puzzler.jpg?itok=cF1WxK6d 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pokemon Friends&nbsp;</em>looks like a cute little puzzler.</figcaption></figure><p>If you've always wanted to solve cute little mobile puzzles with your Pokemon friends, then&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Friends&nbsp;</em>is for you. It's a puzzle game that sees you connecting various things, like tracks, bulbs, or ice paths, to help little critters reach their goals.</p>

<p>You'll gain plushes for solving puzzles, and you can use them to decorate in-game plush rooms. The game is coming to Switch, Android, and iOS later today.</p>

<h2><em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>are getting new Tera Raid Battle Events</h2>

<p>Shiny versions of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet</em>'s Ruinous Quartet are coming starting from tomorrow. You can add them to your team, but each Pokemon will need to be defeated a million times (in total, not just by you) to get them.</p>

<h2><em>Pokemon Champions&nbsp;</em>gets more info</h2>

<p>Next up, we got to learn more about&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Champions</em>, an upcoming battler that was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-presents-february-2025-all-reveals-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">revealed back in February</a>. The game is planned for release in 2026 on Switch and mobile devices, and it looks like a fun way to enjoy&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>battling.</p>

<h2>New&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>info revealed</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-legends-z-a-dragonite-pokemon-presents-july-2025.jpg?itok=lKEupujN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-legends-z-a-dragonite-pokemon-presents-july-2025.jpg?itok=IONpUK-a 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Look at its little wings! D'awww.</figcaption></figure><p>The last thing we got to see as part of today's presentation was a new look at&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-release-date-pokemon-presents" rel="nofollow">planned for release in October</a>. Sorry, hopeful&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>fans; doesn't look like you're getting a Gen 10 reveal today.</p>

<p>The new trailer revealed Team MZ, an organization devoted to protecting Lumiose, where the game takes place. The game's day-night cycle was also revealed; you'll explore and catch Pokemon by day, then take part in the Z-A Royale tournament event by night.</p>

<p>This game's villainous team is the Rust Syndicate, headed up by the rather sinister-looking Corbeau. He's got "some kind of business with the members of Team MZ", but you'll have to play the game to find out what that is.</p>

<p>We got a look at a Mega Evolution for Dragonite as well, which is pretty cute. It's got Dragonair-like adornments on its head and tail, and it was shown off as part of a new storyline in the game that involves Pokemon Mega Evolving by themselves.</p>

<hr><p>That's all for today! Join us again whenever the next Pokemon Presents airs, and we'll do it all again!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Single-Player Horror Game Hellraiser: Revival Announced by Saber Interactive]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hellraiser-revival-announced</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/single-player-horror-game-hellraiser-revival-announced-by-saber-interactive.1249563/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Saber Interactive and Boss Team Games have announced&nbsp;<em>Hellraiser: Revival</em>, the first ever dedicated video game based on Clive Barker's immensely popular horror franchise.</p>

<p>As revealed in a new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Hellraiser: Revival&nbsp;</em>will take the form of a first-person, single-player survival horror game. You'll play as a new protagonist by the name of Aidan, who must rescue his girlfriend from Hell. Now that's a nostalgic plot setup, eh?</p>

<p>Saber's Tim Willits reveals more in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/22/announcing-clive-barkers-hellraiser-revival-horror-that-doesnt-hold-back/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation Blog post</a>&nbsp;accompanying the new trailer. In the post, Willits confirms that both melee and ranged weaponry will be available in&nbsp;<em>Hellraiser: Revival</em>, and that the development team consulted with Clive Barker himself to make sure the game is "authentic" to the original<em>&nbsp;</em>novels and movies.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hellraiser-revival-club.jpg?itok=1AVTLOIt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hellraiser-revival-club.jpg?itok=CGqRC_M5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hellraiser: Revival&nbsp;</em>is the property's first dedicated video game.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, Aidan will also have access to "the dark powers of the Genesis Configuration" to help him navigate Hell and save his girlfriend. You'll be harnessing the box's "infernal abilities" to avoid the wrath of the iconic Pinhead.</p>

<p>Said character will be played by original actor Doug Bradley, who Saber says is "returning to the role for the first time in nearly two decades". I don't think that's accurate, though; Bradley provided his voice for&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-hellraiser-update-arrives-on-test-servers" rel="nofollow"><em>Dead by Daylight</em>'s Pinhead Killer</a> back in 2022.</p>

<p>In any case, as revealed by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/first-ever-hellraiser-game-announced-with-doug-bradley-returning-as-pinhead" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>, Barker himself seems enthusiastic about&nbsp;<em>Hellraiser: Revival</em>. He says the game captures the "essence" of the property, namely "the seductive pull of suffering" and "the beauty within the grotesque", so if you're a&nbsp;<em>Hellraiser&nbsp;</em>fan, it sounds like you'll be well-served by the game.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Hellraiser: Revival</em>, which shows off a little bit of gameplay as well as the aesthetic of the game, right here.</p>




<p>We don't yet have a release window for&nbsp;<em>Hellraiser: Revival</em>, but when it launches, it's coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1551980/Clive_Barkers_Hellraiser_Revival/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10012313/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/Clive-Barkers-Hellraiser-Revival/9NSWRGZBQ2MC" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. More info will be revealed later this year.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[GreedFall II Studio Spiders Hit by Layoffs]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/spiders-layoffs</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/greedfall-ii-studio-spiders-hit-by-layoffs.1249476/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>GreedFall II&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Steelrising&nbsp;</em>developer Spiders has apparently become the latest studio to be swept up in the ongoing wave of industry layoffs.</p>

<p>According to a LinkedIn <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7353013917415079936/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> by lead animator Erwan Perrin (spotted by ResetEra user <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/spiders-greedfall-series-hit-by-layoffs.1249359/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Maxime</a>), Spiders will soon "proceed [with] a layoff plan" which will affect "most of the animation and rig team" at the studio. That's the team that creates character animations and frameworks.</p>

<p>It's not clear exactly how many employees will be hit by the layoffs, but it's not a great sign for Spiders if "most" of an entire team at the studio is being let go.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/greedfall-ii-spiders-layoffs.jpg?itok=VxqRZ1xB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/greedfall-ii-spiders-layoffs.jpg?itok=J_yPZl5h 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>GreedFall II&nbsp;</em>developer Spiders is being hit by layoffs.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with Spiders, it's a French studio responsible for developing games like the aforementioned&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/greedfall-2-dying-world" rel="nofollow">GreedFall II</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/steelrising" rel="nofollow"><em>Steelrising</em></a>, as well as&nbsp;<em>The Technomancer</em>,&nbsp;<em>Bound by Flame</em>, and other Eurojank-style RPG-adjacent titles.</p>

<p>In many ways, the studio is similar to&nbsp;<em>Gothic&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Elex&nbsp;</em>developer Piranha Bytes, which should probably come as more cause for alarm; that studio, which was based in Germany, was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/piranha-bytes-shut-down-report" rel="nofollow">shut down in 2024</a> by parent company THQ Nordic.</p>

<p>Given that&nbsp;<em>GreedFall II&nbsp;</em>is currently in Early Access, it's not entirely clear what these Spiders layoffs mean for the future of the game. According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1997660/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, however,&nbsp;<em>GreedFall II&nbsp;</em>has a 24-hour peak player count of just 13, so things aren't looking great for the studio.</p>

<p>These layoffs at Spiders are part of a wider industry pattern that has seen multiple studios lay off employees, cancel projects, or shut down entirely, and the phenomenon isn't just limited to smaller studios either.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/perfect-dark-spiders-layoffs.jpg?itok=21VVRPs5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/perfect-dark-spiders-layoffs.jpg?itok=kDuEuM7e 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Studios like Xbox subsidiary The Initiative have also been hit by the ongoing layoff wave.</figcaption></figure><p>Earlier this month, for instance, Microsoft <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" rel="nofollow">laid off around 9,000</a> of its employees (yes, you read that number right), and as part of that employee cull, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">Rare's&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">Everwild</a>&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">The Initiative's&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">Perfect Dark</a>&nbsp;</em>were canceled, with the latter closing its doors for good as well.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what these layoffs might mean for Spiders, but I'm concerned about the studio's future. Stay tuned for more.</p>
