            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-godzilla-hatsune-miku<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega has revealed two new DLC characters for chaotic party platformer&nbsp;<em>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble</em>, and you couldn't hope to find two more contrasting pop culture icons.</p>

<p>Both characters are being added on November 26th, and they'll join the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-sonic-dlc" rel="nofollow">the&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog&nbsp;</em>crew</a>,&nbsp;<em>Crazy Taxi</em>'s Axel, and&nbsp;<em>Jet Set Radio</em>'s Beat&nbsp;as downloadable, er, "monkeys" for the game.</p>

<p>First up, nuclear monster Godzilla is joining the&nbsp;<em>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble&nbsp;</em>roster. Of course, this is a cutesy chibi-fied version of Godzilla rather than the fully-sized creature you might see in the likes of&nbsp;<em>Godzilla Minus One</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/godzilla-super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble.jpg?itok=S8Ei2Gqe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/godzilla-super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble.jpg?itok=4_YKO6l- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Yep, that really is Godzilla himself in&nbsp;<em>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>This is far from Godzilla's first video game appearance, and it's not even his first foray into the realms of DLC or update crossovers; he's also appeared in games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dave-diver-godzilla-dlc-coming-next-week" rel="nofollow">Dave the Diver</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/king-kong-and-godzilla-will-take-up-fight-in-world-of-warships" rel="nofollow"><em>World of Warships</em></a>, battling his old archnemesis King Kong in the latter.</p>

<p>Your second new DLC character for&nbsp;<em>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble&nbsp;</em>is none other than Vocaloid star Hatsune Miku, who seems a little better-suited to the adorable world of&nbsp;<em>Monkey Ball</em>.</p>

<p>Much like Godzilla, Miku has also made appearances in other properties alongside starring in her own games; memorably, she was part of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/mtg-secret-lair-summer-superdrop-2024-brings-assassins-creed-and-hatsune-miku" rel="nofollow">major&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering&nbsp;</em>collaboration</a> earlier this year.</p>

<p>First, here's the trailer for Godzilla, which shows off what he'll look like in&nbsp;<em>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble</em>.</p>




<p>Now that you've had your fill of kaiju antics, you can check out the altogether more anime-style trailer for Hatsune Miku.</p>




<p>Both of these characters will arrive alongside&nbsp;<em>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble</em>'s 2.0 update, which brungs a number of new adventure challenges, battle stages, and modes. It's all launching on November 26th.</p>

<p><em>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble&nbsp;</em>is available right now, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">exclusively for Nintendo Switch</a>. Stay tuned for more on this.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/binding-of-isaac-repentance-plus-update-co-op<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nicalis has released the long-awaited&nbsp;<em>The Binding of Isaac&nbsp;</em>Repentance+ update, finally bringing online co-op to the dungeon-crawling roguelike, as well as a host of other new stuff.</p>

<p>As noted in a Steam post announcing the update's launch, you're going to need all of the game's previous DLC in order to enjoy this update, and you're also going to need to be playing&nbsp;<em>The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth&nbsp;</em>rather than the original base game.</p>

<p>Assuming you tick all of those boxes, the Repentance+ update brings four-player online co-op to&nbsp;<em>The Binding of Isaac</em>, and it works across the game's Normal, Hard, Greed, Greedier, and Challenge modes, as well as daily runs and seeded runs.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-binding-of-isaac-repentance-update-online-co-op.jpg?itok=3uTgmAGx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-binding-of-isaac-repentance-update-online-co-op.jpg?itok=dfBgGw8J 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Binding of Isaac&nbsp;</em>now supports four-player co-op, assuming you're playing&nbsp;<em>Rebirth</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>There are a few differences to watch out for in online play. Bosses will drop items for all players, and if you join a run in progress, you'll be given items to catch you up "based on how far along the run is".</p>

<p>You can also spend coins at a revive machine to bring back dead players, but the cost will increase every time you do so, so make sure you consider carefully whether or not it's worth bringing back your friends.</p>

<p>Mods will be disabled online, and you also won't be able to unlock achievements in online play if you join mid-run (although joining at the very start of a run will be fine).</p>

<p>Pay no mind to the "beta" tag attached to this update; Nicalis says it's a "full-featured release", but that the beta tag has been attached because the studio is "still looking to refine things and squash any remaining bugs".</p>




<p>As well as online co-op, this update also brings a veritable treasure trove of item buffs and reworks for solo players, as well as a number of fixes that should make your&nbsp;<em>Binding of Isaac&nbsp;</em>experience a bit smoother. You can read <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/250900/view/7119722540407193807" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the full patch notes here</a> if you want to.</p>

<p>The Repentance+ update is available right now, but you'll need all of the game's previous DLC to run it. That includes&nbsp;<em>Rebirth</em>, as well as its&nbsp;<em>Afterbirth&nbsp;</em>DLC and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/binding-of-isaac-rebirth-repentance-update-is-its-biggest-yet" rel="nofollow">original Repentance update</a>.</p>
