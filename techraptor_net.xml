            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dead Space&nbsp;</em>creator Glen Schofield has revealed that he pitched a new game in the series to EA "recently", and that while the studio rejected his pitch, he's optimistic that the series may have a future.</p>

<p>That's according to an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-can-save-you-30-40-million-on-the-idea-i-have-dead-space-creator-glen-schofield-already-making-calls-about-dead-space-4-now-ea-has-new-owners" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">IGN</a>, in which Schofield says he "went to [EA] recently" and that they told him they were "not interested anymore" when it came to&nbsp;<em>Dead Space</em>, despite his assertions that he could "save [the company] $30 to $40 million on the idea that [he has]".</p>

<p>Schofield then says that he's got "quite a few ideas", presumably for several different games, but that "one of them is&nbsp;<em>Dead Space 4</em>". He points to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-could-go-private-powered-by-saudi-and-private-equity-money" rel="nofollow">EA's recent purchase by a consortium of investors</a> as an "opportunity" and says he's "already making calls".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dead-space-glen-schofield-isaac.jpg?itok=JC4SEM4c 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dead-space-glen-schofield-isaac.jpg?itok=0qJX5Pzu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Glen Schofield wants a new&nbsp;<em>Dead Space&nbsp;</em>to happen.</figcaption></figure><p>It's not just EA Schofield wants to revive&nbsp;<em>Dead Space</em>, though; he also reckons that with the studio's purchase, "somebody new could buy [the IP]", so it might not even be EA that releases the eventual&nbsp;<em>Dead Space 4</em>.</p>

<p>He also says he wants the franchise to branch out into "different mediums", suggesting that movies or a TV series based on&nbsp;<em>Dead Space&nbsp;</em>could be "great".</p>

<p>Still, Schofield says he doesn't think EA made a profit from the 2023&nbsp;<em>Dead Space&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dead-space" rel="nofollow">remake</a>, which is presumably why the company is so reticent to do anything new with the IP. Here's hoping it finds its way into the hands of someone who wants to use it for good.</p>

<p>The aforementioned remake is the last major project to be released in the&nbsp;<em>Dead Space&nbsp;</em>series. It's a ground-up rework of the 2008 original, adding new story scenes and gameplay mechanics to the first game's tale of spindly Necromorphs and sinister Markers.</p>




<p>Schofield himself wasn't involved in that remake, though; while it was in development, he was working on&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/callisto-protocol" rel="nofollow">The Callisto Protocol</a>&nbsp;</em>alongside Striking Distance Studios, although he <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-space-co-creator-pursuing-new-opportunities-less-than-year-after-callisto" rel="nofollow">departed the developer</a> less than a year after that game's release.</p>

<p>Subsequently, back in February, it was revealed that Striking Distance had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/striking-distance-layoffs-callisto-protocol" rel="nofollow">laid off "most" of its employees</a>, so it sounds as though Schofield may have been right to make his exit when he did.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see whether Glen Schofield's&nbsp;<em>Dead Space&nbsp;</em>pitch manages to get anywhere in the future, but for now, you can (and should) grab the&nbsp;<em>Dead Space&nbsp;</em>remake on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1693980/Dead_Space/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/dead-space/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/dead-space/9nlb6v0gnc9p" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Silent Hill 2 Remake Sales Reach 2.5m Worldwide]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-2-5m-worldwide</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Konami has revealed that its survival horror remake&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2</em>, which was developed by Bloober Team, has hit another big sales milestone.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/silent-hill-2-remake-shipments-and-digital-sales-top-2-5-million" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gematsu</a>,&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>has now sold 2.5 million copies worldwide (inclusive of both digital and physical shipments), which means the game has picked up another half a million sales for itself <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">since January this year</a>. That's pretty good going for what is, in the end, a fairly niche title.</p>

<p>Although&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>is still selling steadily for Konami, it wasn't able to hold a candle to recent release&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f&nbsp;</em>in the initial sales stakes; the latter outpaced the remake significantly, racking up <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-f-sales-1m" rel="nofollow">a million sales in a single day</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/silent-hill-2-sales-2.5m-typewriter.jpg?itok=wOiAtzo5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/silent-hill-2-sales-2.5m-typewriter.jpg?itok=4ffEDVmj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>is going strong for Konami.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as the milestone for&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2</em>, Konami also announced that the series as a whole has reached ten million cumulative sales, and since 2.5 million of those are&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2</em>&nbsp;(and a further million belong to&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f</em>), the franchise can reasonably call itself resurgent.</p>

<p>These numbers will bode well for Konami's future franchise plans as well. The studio is currently working alongside&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake developer Bloober Team on a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/konami-bloober-team-new-silent-hill" rel="nofollow">reimagining of the first game</a>, although no release date or gameplay have yet been revealed.</p>

<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2</em>, it's a remake of the 2001 survival horror classic, shifting the action from the fixed camera angles of the original to a more modern over-the-shoulder perspective and adding new story scenes for additional context.</p>

<p>At its core, though,&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>still tells the same story of James Sunderland, who travels to the titular town of Silent Hill in order to investigate a letter he receives from his deceased wife.</p>




<p>You can check out the&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2124490/SILENT_HILL_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/silent-hill-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Reportedly Asking Manufacturers to Produce 25m Switch 2 Units By March]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-25m-production-report</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-reportedly-asking-manufacturers-to-produce-25m-switch-2-units-by-march.1327966/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report has emerged which claims that Nintendo is instructing manufacturers to produce a pretty staggering number of Switch 2 consoles by the end of March next year, indicating that the Japanese gaming giant is expecting a bumper sales year.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-17/nintendo-switch-2-production-plan-25-million-units-by-march-2026" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a>, Nintendo has asked its suppliers to produce "as many as 25 million" Switch 2 units prior to March 2026, which, as Bloomberg points out, will set Nintendo up for "record first-year sales" of its console.</p>

<p>Additionally, Bloomberg notes that according to industry analysts, Nintendo is on track to "comfortably surpass" previous projections of 17.6 million Switch 2 sales within the console's first fiscal year, potentially reaching the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-20m-shipments-report" rel="nofollow">20 million target reported back in January</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-manufacturing-25m-report-console.jpg?itok=KRTdcBZR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-manufacturing-25m-report-console.jpg?itok=xE9UwGDr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nintendo is expecting the Switch 2 to do pretty well, it seems.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that this is a report, and as Bloomberg itself notes, it's possible the figure will be adjusted in the near future, especially as the holiday season approaches and Nintendo gets a better understanding of what demand for the Switch 2 looks like.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it's probably fair to say the Switch 2 has already been a major success for Nintendo. Just a couple of months after the console's release, it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-financials-q1-2026" rel="nofollow">hit six million sales</a> around the world, having already secured the position of Nintendo's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-fastest-selling-nintendo-console" rel="nofollow">fastest-selling console worldwide</a>.</p>

<p>Nintendo itself has stated that it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-15m-switch-2-first-year" rel="nofollow">expects to sell around 15 million</a> Switch 2 consoles in the machine's first year on release, but there's every chance that figure could be revised (either upwards or downwards) soon.</p>

<p>The console's sales numbers have no doubt been buoyed by the release of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">a new&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart&nbsp;</em>game at launch</a>, as well as flagship 3D platformer&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, which may not be a&nbsp;<em>Mario&nbsp;</em>game but which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/donkey-kong-bananza-super-mario-odyssey-team" rel="nofollow">bears the hallmarks of the&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Odyssey&nbsp;</em>team</a> nonetheless.</p>




<p>We'll have to wait and see whether Nintendo achieves its ambitious sales targets for the Switch 2, but current signs look pretty positive. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>
