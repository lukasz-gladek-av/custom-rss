            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/iwgb-game-workers-union-first-manifesto<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>UK-based gaming union IWGB Game Workers has released its first manifesto, which it says sets out "a vision for a better industry", and it includes policies like a four-day working week, an end to the gender pay gap, and more.</p>

<p>Over on <a href="https://www.gameworkers.co.uk/manifesto/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the union's website</a>, IWGB Game Workers says its manifesto is part of envisioning a future "where job insecurity, long unpaid hours, and inadequate compensation are a thing of the past".</p>

<p>First, the union sets out its mission, which includes a "seat at the table", as well as safe and secure jobs that are fairly compensated, solidarity and connection "outside of corporate spaces", and the championing of "diversity, inclusion, and social justice".</p>

<p>Under the "campaigns" section, the union outlines some of its core principles, which include ambitious goals like an end to crunch culture, a universal four-day work week across the industry with no salary reduction, and more inclusive hiring processes, among many others.</p>

<p>In an accompanying press release, Game Workers chair Austin Kelmore says the industry has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-june-14th">"reached a tipping point"</a>, and that industry workers are "unionizing on a scale never seen before", exhorting industry employees to stand together to "make sure the games industry's future looks very different".</p>

<p>IWGB Game Workers BAME officer Charlie Webb, meanwhile, says that the layoffs and tumult of the last year or so have "revealed the underlying instability of the game industry", and that the union's new manifesto represents a "sustainable, sane, and healthy path forward".</p>

<p>Webb and Kelmore are also correct that it's been a particularly brutal couple of years for the industry, with massive companies like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-gaming-layoffs-september">Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/electronic-arts-to-lay-off-5-of-its-workforce-amid-refocus-on-owned-ip-and-sports-games">EA</a> laying off swathes of their employees even as their <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-ceo-payrise-layoffs">executives</a> collect <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-ceo-25-million-income-layoffs">eye-watering paychecks</a>.</p>
