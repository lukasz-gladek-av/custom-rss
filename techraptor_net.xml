            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/anti-defamation-league-steam-extremism-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Anti-Defamation League has released a new report which claims that digital distribution platform Steam is "rife with extremism and antisemitism", with the report also claiming it's identified "millions of examples" of content reflecting this problem.</p>

<p>According to the ADL, the report analyzed over 450 million Steam profiles, as well as more than 152 million "profile and group avatar images" and over 610 million comments on Steam user profiles and group pages.</p>

<p>Among the "millions of examples" of extremist content uncovered by the report were "explicit hate symbols" like the happy merchant figure and the sonnenrad, as well as "copypastas shaped into swastikas". We won't be showing any kind of images illustrating the ADL's points here, but you can imagine the kinds of things the report found.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/anti-defamation-league-steam-report-front-page.jpg?itok=EMHjKk6x 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/anti-defamation-league-steam-report-front-page.jpg?itok=rg51TLN6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Anti-Defamation League says Steam is "rife" with extremist content.</figcaption></figure><p>In numbers terms, the ADL says it identified 1.83 million "unique pieces of extremist or hateful content", as well as 1.5 million users and over 73,000 groups "who used at least one potentially extremist or hateful symbol, copypasta, or keyword" on Steam.</p>

<p>1.18 million unique instances of extremist copypastas were identified, as well as over 820,000 avatars for users and groups containing extremist symbols. Additionally, the report found "thousands of profiles" glorifying violent extremists such as "white supremacist mass shooters".</p>

<p>The ADL blames Valve's "highly permissive approach to content policy" for this issue, stating that while Steam does occasionally remove high-profile extremist content, it has failed to "systematically address the issue of extremism and hate on the platform".</p>

<p>One such example of Valve banning extremist content on Steam was the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/domina-removed-from-steam-after-devs-transphobic-rant" rel="nofollow">removal of gladiator game&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/domina-removed-from-steam-after-devs-transphobic-rant" rel="nofollow">Domina</a>&nbsp;</em>following a transphobic rant on the part of its developer, but the ADL seems to be suggesting that this kind of action is the exception rather than the rule.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/anti-defamation-league-steam-report-profile.jpg?itok=n5mxcVLN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/anti-defamation-league-steam-report-profile.jpg?itok=25U7Qwio 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>According to the ADL, many Steam profiles contain hateful or extremist content.</figcaption></figure><p>So, what does the ADL recommend Valve and Steam do about extremist and hateful content on the platform?</p>

<p>First, the ADL says Valve should adopt specific policies to prohibit extremism. There's currently no policy on Steam that specifically outlaws this kind of content, so the ADL wants to see one implemented.</p>

<p>Other recommendations include adopting policies "prohibiting hate", as well as enforcing policies "accurately at scale" and closing adult content moderation loopholes.</p>

<p>Lastly, the ADL says Valve should "engage with civil society, academics, and researchers" in order to shape its policies and prevent "vulnerable and marginalized groups" from being targeted on Steam.</p>

<p>You can read the ADL's full report, which contains numerous examples of the kind of content discovered on Steam during the course of the report's undertaking, <a href="https://www.adl.org/resources/report/steam-powered-hate-top-gaming-site-rife-extremism-antisemitism" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/live-action-splinter-cell-movie-canceled-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A producer on the long-awaited&nbsp;live-action&nbsp;<em>Splinter Cell&nbsp;</em>movie has confirmed that the project has been canceled, so it's going to be quite a while before you get to see Sam Fisher strut his stuff on screen (in a live-action capacity, anyway).</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/splinter-cell-tom-hardy-movie-exclusive" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a report by movie publication The Direct</a>, producer Basil Iwanyk says the movie is no longer happening. He says the creative forces behind the film "just couldn't get it right, script-wise, budget-wise", but that it "would have been awesome".</p>

<p>Iwanyk goes on to call the&nbsp;<em>Splinter Cell&nbsp;</em>movie "one of the ones that got away, which is really sad". Given that we hadn't heard anything from the film for a number of years, it's perhaps not surprising that it's been canned, but it's a shame nonetheless.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sam-fisher-splinter-cell-blacklist-movie-canceled.jpg?itok=Od9TTlaB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sam-fisher-splinter-cell-blacklist-movie-canceled.jpg?itok=I_KLvVrV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Splinter Cell&nbsp;</em>movie is no longer happening, according to producer Basil Iwanyk.</figcaption></figure><p>We are, however, still getting the&nbsp;<em>Splinter Cell&nbsp;</em>animated series, which was first mooted <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splinter-cell-netflix-series-in-works" rel="nofollow">all the way back in 2020</a>.</p>

<p>Officially titled&nbsp;<em>Splinter Cell: Deathwatch</em>, the show will star Liev Schreiber as Sam Fisher, with original voice actor Michael Ironside claiming there's "no way" he should still be playing Fisher given his advanced age. I'm sure a legion of&nbsp;<em>Splinter Cell&nbsp;</em>fans would disagree, but there we are.</p>

<p>While the animated series is sure to make&nbsp;<em>Splinter Cell&nbsp;</em>fans happy, there's still no new&nbsp;<em>Splinter Cell&nbsp;</em>game on the horizon. The last release in the franchise was 2013's&nbsp;<em>Blacklist</em>, and since then, appropriately enough, Fisher has gone dark.</p>

<p>Back in 2021, Ubisoft <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/4adJLuhgYrPboHAPRfK7Oz/splinter-cell-remake-begins-development-at-ubisoft-toronto" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announced a remake</a> of the original&nbsp;<em>Splinter Cell</em>, but since then, news on the project has been scarce. Given Ubisoft's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sands-of-time-remake-another-studio" rel="nofollow">recent track record with remakes</a>, however, perhaps we shouldn't be too surprised about that.</p>




<p>On the whole, it must be said that&nbsp;<em>Splinter Cell&nbsp;</em>IP owner Ubisoft isn't having the best year of it.</p>

<p>Between <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activist-ubisoft-investor-open-letter-change" rel="nofollow">investor threats</a>, employees taking <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-strike-investor-letter" rel="nofollow">strike action</a>, and major breadwinners <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-february" rel="nofollow">being delayed</a>, not to mention a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-h1-2024-25-fiscal-results" rel="nofollow">dramatic drop in earnings</a>, now might well be the time for Fisher to return from retirement and attempt to save his ailing parent company.</p>
