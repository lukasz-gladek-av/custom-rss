            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft and developer Massive Entertainment have announced&nbsp;<em>From the Ashes</em>, a brand new story expansion for&nbsp;<em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora&nbsp;</em>that's set to launch alongside the third movie this December.</p>

<p>As revealed <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-from-the-ashes-dlc-announced-release-timed-with-fire-and-ash-movie" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">by IGN</a>, the new DLC will arrive on December 19th, which is the same day on which James Cameron's&nbsp;<em>Avatar: Fire and Ash&nbsp;</em>arrives in cinemas. Presumably, it will once again sell absolutely shedloads of tickets, although I cannot for the life of me fathom why.</p>

<p><em>From the Ashes&nbsp;</em>will, according to creative director Omar Bouali, take place "a few weeks" after the events of&nbsp;<em>Fire and Ash</em>, and around six months after the events of&nbsp;<em>Frontiers of Pandora&nbsp;</em>and its existing story packs.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-from-the-ashes-dlc-base-game-bow.jpg?itok=j6eQ9psr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-from-the-ashes-dlc-base-game-bow.jpg?itok=Lhw5Hxon 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora&nbsp;</em>is getting another big story DLC pack.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Bouali, the new&nbsp;<em>From the Ashes&nbsp;</em>expansion will be set in "a ravaged and occupied version of the Kinglor Forest", and it'll give you a new sub-region to explore in the form of The Ravines.</p>

<p>Watching&nbsp;<em>Fire and Ash&nbsp;</em>may well give you a better experience in&nbsp;<em>From the Ashes</em>, too; while Bouali says the two "are set in different reigons of Pandora", there's still some "shared DNA" between the two, with Ubisoft working alongside Cameron's Lightstorm Entertainment to make both stories "complimentary".</p>

<p>It's likely that we'll learn more about&nbsp;<em>Fire and Ash&nbsp;</em>over the next few months, but you can at least expect to encounter the Ash Clan that partially lend their name to the DLC, as well as "one very special creature", about which Ubisoft is remaining tight-lipped for now.</p>

<p><em>From the Ashes&nbsp;</em>will arrive in the same month as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-update-new-game-plus" rel="nofollow">a major update</a> for&nbsp;<em>Frontiers of Pandora</em>, which is scheduled to add a New Game Plus mode to the&nbsp;<em>Far Cry</em>-esque FPS, as well as a third-person view mode and more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Department of Homeland Security Posts Bizarre Pokemon-Themed ICE Raid Video]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/department-of-homeland-security-pokemon-video-post</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/department-of-homeland-security-posts-bizarre-pokemon-themed-ice-raid-video.1305453/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The US Department of Homeland Security has posted a bizarre and, frankly, rather tasteless video that splices footage of ICE immigrant raids with clips from the iconic intro to the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>anime.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://kotaku.com/department-homeland-security-ice-pokemon-song-video-2000627900" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Kotaku</a>, the video was uploaded to the official DHS X account yesterday. It shows various enforcement officers, including ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement), police officers, and the military breaking into properties and arresting people.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it also shows clips from the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>anime, as well as using the anime's theme song to soundtrack the upsetting montage. What's more, the words "Department of Homeland Security" appear at the beginning of the video, rendered in the very recognizable&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>font.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/us-department-of-homeland-security-pokemon-video-card.jpg?itok=z-WB1I4s 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/us-department-of-homeland-security-pokemon-video-card.jpg?itok=rPssa17V 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The DHS' new video also features various "criminal aliens" rendered in&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>card format.</figcaption></figure><p>As if all of that wasn't enough, the video also shows various "criminal aliens" arrested by ICE, but rendered in a sort of parody&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>card format. Their weakness is even listed as the Ice type, which feels particularly tasteless.</p>

<p>I've got to wonder exactly whose idea this was and why they thought it was okay, but of course, it's possible that this video did indeed travel its way up the chain and met with approval at every turn, which is perhaps even more demoralizing than this being one person's maverick whim.</p>

<p>One body whose approval this video almost certainly did not obtain is, of course, Nintendo, the company that holds the IP rights to&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>. If you're familiar with Nintendo, you'll also know that the Japanese gaming giant is, to put it mildly, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-palworld-pocketpair-lawsuit" rel="nofollow">fond</a> of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-garrys-mod-takedowns" rel="nofollow">litigation</a> in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-genki-switch-2-lawsuit" rel="nofollow">certain circumstances</a>.</p>

<p>I'm no legal expert, but I suspect that if Nintendo wanted to, it could probably challenge DHS over its (presumably) unlicensed use of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>&nbsp;assets in this video. I don't imagine the parody defense would get the department too far in that instance, but again, not an expert.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-flying-nintendo-lawsuit-dhs.jpg?itok=intyg7fW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-flying-nintendo-lawsuit-dhs.jpg?itok=wJv0UZJt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Perhaps the DHS should ask&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>studio Pocketpair how Nintendo feels about the perceived unlicensed use of its IP.</figcaption></figure><p>Regardless of your political leanings, I think it's fair to say this DHS video is in pretty poor taste. Let's hope sanity and wisdom prevail and the video is taken down, and whoever's responsible for it has a long, hard think about what they've done.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[PlayStation State of Play Confirmed for Tomorrow]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-state-of-play-september-2025-confirmed</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-state-of-play-confirmed-for-tomorrow.1305390/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has announced a new PlayStation State of Play showcase, which will bring over half an hour of new info about upcoming PlayStation titles.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/23/state-of-play-returns-this-wednesday-september-24/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation Blog post</a>, the next State of Play will air tomorrow at 5pm Eastern (that's 2pm Pacific and around 10pm GMT). Sony is promising "more than 35 minutes of reveals and news from developers around the world".</p>

<p>In particular, Sony says the State of Play will spotlight Housemarque's mysterious&nbsp;<em>Saros</em>, which was first revealed during a State of Play event <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-state-of-play-recap-february-2025" rel="nofollow">back in February</a>. Sony is promising an "extended look" at&nbsp;<em>Saros</em>, including "nearly five minutes of gameplay".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/state-of-play-september-2025-saros.jpg?itok=JseT5F5Q 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/state-of-play-september-2025-saros.jpg?itok=hVLyLvF1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>We'll hopefully learn what the heck is going on in this shot during tomorrow's State of Play.</figcaption></figure><p>Sony is remaining tight-lipped about what else we can expect from the State of Play tomorrow, but if I were a betting man, I'd put my money on <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/marvels-wolverine" rel="nofollow">Insomniac's&nbsp;<em>Wolverine</em>&nbsp;game</a>, from which we have not heard in many a year.</p>

<p>The game was originally announced back in 2021, but since then, Insomniac and Sony have been very quiet about it, save for confirming that it'll be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/insomniacs-wolverine-confirmed-to-be-set-in-same-earth-1048-universe-as-marvels-spider" rel="nofollow">set in the same universe</a> as&nbsp;<em>Spider-Man 2</em>&nbsp;(the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/marvels-spider-man-2" rel="nofollow">more recent one</a>, not the PS2 classic).</p>

<p>Of course, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/insomniac-games-ransomware-attack-report" rel="nofollow">major cyberattack</a> back in December 2023 probably didn't help Insomniac's development process, although the studio did <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/insomniac-games-officially-reacts-to-criminal-cyberattack-marvels-wolverine-will" rel="nofollow">subsequently reveal</a> that its game will "greatly evolve" from the development build that was leaked during that attack.</p>

<p>As for what else we might see from the State of Play show, we may well get a new&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>release date following that game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shocking-no-one-bungies-marathon-delayed" rel="nofollow">delay back in June</a>, and Naughty Dog might reveal more about its upcoming title&nbsp;<em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</em>, although I wouldn't hold my breath for that.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[HoYoverse Reveals First Teaser for Mysterious New Game Petit Planet]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hoyoverse-petit-planet-teaser</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hoyoverse-reveals-first-teaser-for-mysterious-new-game-petit-planet.1305354/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>developer HoYoverse has revealed a teaser for another new game, and this one looks to have a decidedly more cozy bent to it than the studio's previous efforts.</p>

<p>Just a few weeks after unveiling <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hoyoverse-honkai-nexus-anima" rel="nofollow">creature-collecting autochess game&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Nexus Anima</em></a>, HoYoverse has updated the <a href="https://x.com/petitplanetgame" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">social media account</a> for something by the name of&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet</em>, and while details are sparse, the art style and general vibe feels very&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing</em>-esque.</p>

<p>For one thing, the new artwork depicts two extremely cuddly-looking creatures with massive smiles on their faces, which means <i>Petit Planet&nbsp;</i>is probably either a cozy game or a deeply disturbing horror experience masquerading as cozy. My money's on the former, but my heart hopes for the latter.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hoyoverse-petit-planet-critter.jpg?itok=zmBv3wvb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hoyoverse-petit-planet-critter.jpg?itok=fy4VIS_g 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This little guy heralds the announcement of&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet</em>, it seems.</figcaption></figure><p>In the new teaser trailer, we can see the cute little fluffball from the new&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet&nbsp;</em>artwork hopping around a grove that looks extremely reminiscent of&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing</em>, complete with rounded trees and a tiered waterfall.</p>

<p>Honestly, that's pretty much all there is right now, but it's likely that HoYoverse is gearing up for a big&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet&nbsp;</em>announcement, so perhaps we'll get more info about the game in the coming weeks. We can certainly hope so.</p>

<p>If&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet&nbsp;</em>is indeed a cozy life sim-style game, then it will mark a further branching out from HoYoverse's typical RPG slant; its three main exports, namely&nbsp;<em>Zelda</em>-esque&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/genshin-impact" rel="nofollow"><em>Genshin Impact</em></a>, turn-based battler&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/honkai-star-rail" rel="nofollow"><em>Honkai: Star Rail</em></a>, and character action extravaganza&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/zenless-zone-zero" rel="nofollow"><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em></a>, are all various flavors of gacha RPG.</p>

<p>Of course, there's nothing to say&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet&nbsp;</em>won't have gacha mechanics as well, and if I know HoYoverse, it almost certainly will. Still, it looks like it'll offer a completely different gameplay style to prior studio titles, so that's something to look forward to.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hoyoverse-petit-planet-genshin-impact.jpg?itok=Xjhk9ijo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hoyoverse-petit-planet-genshin-impact.jpg?itok=0HR981aE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Petit Planet&nbsp;</em>could mark a big departure from HoYoverse's usual style.</figcaption></figure><p>We'll have to wait a little while to learn more about&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet</em>, but for now, it looks like it's safe to get excited if you were hoping for a HoYoverse cozy game. Stay tuned for more.</p>
