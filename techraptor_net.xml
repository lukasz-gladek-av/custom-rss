If so, then the delightfully-named Seismic Squirrel has you covered thanks to the new release date for its "decopunk narrative RPG" <em>Aether &amp; Iron</em>.</p><p>As revealed in a new trailer, <em>Aether &amp; Iron </em>is heading to Steam on March 31st, and if you've got a Steam Deck, you'll be pleased to know the game will be fully playable on that handheld as well.</p><p>Seismic Squirrel describes its game as a "fully-voiced narrative RPG" in which the decisions you make shape the story. That's a pretty standard boast as far as RPGs go, so it'll be interesting to see whether the game can put its money where its mouth is on that front.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Aether &amp; Iron </em>is a "decopunk narrative RPG" coming in March.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The story for <em>Aether &amp; Iron </em>takes place in "an alt-history 1930s New York" powered by a mysterious resource known only as aether, which provides energy for some pretty fantastical-looking contraptions.</p><p>Just like in games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/disco-elysium" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="989e82b0-e77a-495c-9583-e4576fdec8c0" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Disco Elysium</em></a>, you'll be holding conversations with a wide range of interesting and eccentric characters, and you'll need to roll skills if you want to influence, intimidate, or persuade your conversation partners.</p><p>Those conversations will be punctuated by turn-based vehicular combat in which you'll commandeer "a wide range of incredible aether-powered vehicles", tinkering with your loadout to determine exactly what kind of approach you want to take.</p><p>You can check out the new release date trailer for <em>Aether &amp; Iron</em>, which should also give you a pretty good sense of what you can expect from the game, right here.</p>
<p><em>Aether &amp; Iron </em>is arriving into a world increasingly populated with games looking to take <em>Disco Elysium</em>'s crown, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/longdue-hopetown-kickstarter-disco-elysium" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d3fcdd84-da78-41a4-b39c-85f0cc472810" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">some of them</a> made by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-disco-elysium-devs-new-studios-spiritual-successors" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="dc0c27a2-83ab-45f5-9ee3-60310fb61e94" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">folks who worked on the original</a>, so it'll be intriguing to see whether this one can carve out a place for itself in that landscape.</p><p>If you want to know as well, then you can wishlist <em>Aether &amp; Iron </em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1836560/Aether__Iron/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC via Steam</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has revealed a brand new State of Play presentation for later this week, and it'll be packed to the gills with new information about upcoming games from first-party and third-party studios alike.</p><p>As revealed in a new PlayStation Blog <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/09/state-of-play-returns-this-thursday-february-12/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">post</a>, the State of Play show has been set for February 12th at 2pm Pacific (that's 5pm Eastern and about 10pm GMT). It'll last for around 60 minutes.</p><p>Sony is promising information about "eye-catching third-party and indie games headed to PS5", as well as "the latest from teams at PlayStation Studios". Although the show will include studios from around the world, the presentation will be broadcast in English, with Japanese subtitles additionally available.</p><figure role="group">

<p>As tends to be the case with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-february-2026-announced" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2d141075-7ce0-4253-932a-abe8f3fbe418" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">major presentation announcements</a> from big studios (with some <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-developer-direct-january-22nd-2026" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2c8e5f78-4ad9-43f4-bd6b-54b81360f376" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">notable exceptions</a>), Sony is remaining tight-lipped about exactly what you can expect to see during this week's State of Play.</p><p>In terms of games we already know about, I'd expect to see more on Housemarque's <em>Saros</em>, as well as Bungie's <em>Marathon</em>, since both of them are launching within the next few months.</p><p>I wouldn't be surprised if Insomniac Games turned up to showcase <em>Marvel's Wolverine</em>, too; the last we heard from that game was during Sony's last State of Play <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-state-of-play-september-2025" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="cd5b7ba9-4473-41df-8d3c-8a1ff1c52f90" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">back in September</a>, so we're arguably overdue more info.</p><p>Of course, this being a State of Play, you can also expect the unexpected, as it were; we'll almost certainly be getting announcements for projects and games we don't know about yet. Just don't hold your breath for that <em>Bloodborne </em>remaster.</p><figure role="group">
