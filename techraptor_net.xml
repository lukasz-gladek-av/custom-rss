            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Schedule I </em>developer TVGS has announced an expansion thanks to the simulator's widespread success, rendering the outfit "an actual game studio", in TVGS' own words.</p><p>As revealed in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3164500/view/523111043238464175" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">a post on Steam</a>, TVGS now has a central office location in Sydney, and the studio has also been able to hire a new developer (whose name is Rob, if you're interested).&nbsp;</p><p>A new 3D and technical artist will also be recruited soon; TVGS says that by the end of 2026, there will "likely be four people working on <em>Schedule I</em>". That might not sound like much, but given that the game is essentially a solo effort right now, that's pretty impressive.</p><figure role="group">

<p>As well as revealing the new office, TVGS also says it's releasing a <em>Schedule I </em>patch next week, but don't get too excited; it'll mainly consist of "bug fixing and QoL improvements", in the studio's own words.</p><p>Following that update, the remainder of January will be spent "cleaning up the codebase" and bringing new developer Rob up to speed; TVGS says he's got to "catch up on 120k+ lines of code", so it's not going to be an easy job for him.</p><p>Once all of this is taken care of, TVGS says it will "get to work on the next update", but the studio says it's learned its lesson from prior update delays, so the next major patch for <em>Schedule I </em>won't be announced until TVGS is "confident we'll hit it on time".</p><p>If you're wondering exactly what <em>Schedule I </em>is, well, there's no easy way to say this: it's a drug-dealing simulator that lets you peddle illicit substances to all and sundry. Clutch your pearls as you will.</p>
<p><em>Schedule I </em>has indeed proven very successful; at last count, it had a 24-hour Steam <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3164500/charts/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">player peak</a> of over 30,000. That's a lot of people seeing what all the fuss is about <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-november-2026" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e57d7053-b3ca-42ed-afdb-4ef5c5958b99" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">while they wait for <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em></a> (which almost certainly won't feature drug-dealing mechanics as deep as <em>Schedule I</em>'s).</p><p>You can check out <em>Schedule I </em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3164500/Schedule_I/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">PC via Steam Early Access</a>.
