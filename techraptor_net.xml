            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/deep-rock-galactic-survivor-update-4<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Funday Games and Ghost Ship have released the fourth major&nbsp;<em>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor&nbsp;</em>update, and this one's packed with plenty of stuff that should serve as a good excuse to revisit the game if you've fallen off it.</p>

<p>As you'd probably expect, this update is on roughly the same scale as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/deep-rock-galactic-survivor-update">previous content drops</a> for the bullet heaven game, and its first major addition is a brand new biome in the form of the Azure Weald.</p>

<p>Described as a "surprisingly wet blue cave with luminescent plants" by the devs, the Azure Weald comes complete with crystals that heal you while you stand near them, although you won't find much Red Sugar to provide sustenance here.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/deep-rock-galactic-survivor-update-4-azure-weald.jpg?itok=VHuQNsri 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/deep-rock-galactic-survivor-update-4-azure-weald.jpg?itok=-StJmMgF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The new Azure Weald biome should give you plenty of new reasons to blast bugs in the latest&nbsp;<em>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor&nbsp;</em>update.</figcaption></figure><p>New enemies have also been added, including the Glyphid Warden, which buffs nearby Glyphids' defense, as well as new Mini Exploder and Big Praetorian variants. Spawns work slightly differently in the Azure Weald, too; you'll enjoy periods of calm followed by "larger and more intense" waves.</p>

<p>This latest&nbsp;<em>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor&nbsp;</em>update also adds a new Mutator system, which gives you both positive and negative modifiers across the Vanguard Contracts and Lethal Operations modes, which are also new to this update.</p>

<p>You'll also be able to see your score at the conclusion of each dive, with scores being based on overall performance across a number of stats including completion speed, secondary objective completion, and more.</p>




<p>Naturally, there are plenty of other changes in&nbsp;<em>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor&nbsp;</em>Update 4 as well. You can check out everything that's new via the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2321470/view/4553794655131533851" rel="noopener" target="_blank">patch notes on Steam</a>.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor</em>, it's a&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em>-style bullet heaven auto-shooter set in the dwarf-inhabited world of&nbsp;<em>Deep Rock Galactic</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You'll battle hordes of alien Glyphids, dig up treasure, and build your loadout through upgrades, all while exploring some of the most dangerous caves Hoxxes has to offer.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/phasmophobia-crimson-eye-update-ushers-in-halloween-in-style.1020921/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-crimson-eye-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Kinetic Games has released a new&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>update by the name of Crimson Eye, and as well as getting the game ready for its long-awaited console release, it's also bringing some pretty big changes.</p>

<p>After being <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-console-release">delayed</a> numerous <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-console-delay-halloween">times</a>, a&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>console release was confirmed for 2024 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-console-release-price-hike">back in July</a>, and earlier this month, Kinetic revealed that the multiplayer ghost-hunting horror game would finally be released on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S on October 29th, which is, well,&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/KineticGamesDev/status/1847186876119027991" rel="noopener" target="_blank">tomorrow</a>.</p>

<p>Ahead of that release, the Crimson Eye update has been deployed, and it's introducing a new Halloween weather type by the name of the Blood Moon, which makes ghosts stronger but brings brand new rewards with it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/phasmophobia-crimson-eye-update-darkness.jpg?itok=Yvl7esPv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/phasmophobia-crimson-eye-update-darkness.jpg?itok=KUlPpLab 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Phasmophobia</em>'s new Halloween event is sure to scare you, just in time for Halloween.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as the Halloween Blood Moon event, you're also getting a brand new Event Board to help track in-game challenges. You can find it in the Warehouse, and it's worth spending a bit of time with it if you're a&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>regular, because some things have been moved around to accommodate it.</p>

<p>The game's physics have also been upgraded; doors should no longer push you in or out of locations, and low-FPS players won't clip through the floor anymore in Point Hope. That is...assuming they're not ghosts, of course.</p>

<p>Plenty of other changes have been incorporated as well, including sweeping optimizations that result in "higher performance and more consistent frame rates", among other things. You can check out the full Crimson Eye <a href="https://www.kineticgames.co.uk/blog/phasmophobia-crimson-eye" rel="noopener" target="_blank">patch notes here</a> if you wish.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia</em>, it's a multiplayer-focused ghost-hunting horror game in which you and your fellow hunters must venture into haunted locations to document the spirits that haunt them.</p>

<p>You're armed with an arsenal of ghost-hunting equipment to help you do so, and that equipment can be upgraded. There are a range of spooky creatures and locations to discover, so if you're looking for the perfect Halloween treat to play with your friends,&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>might well be it.</p>

<p><em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/739630/Phasmophobia/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>. It's coming to <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10005673" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PS5</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/phasmophobia-game-preview/9N6D60SBZN05" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> tomorrow.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp Offline Version Arrives in December]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-offline-december</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-offline-version-arrives-in-december.1020918/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-offline-december<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced the release date for the offline version of&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp</em>, as well as a ton of other details regarding how the game will work once its servers are turned off.</p>

<p>Back in August, Nintendo revealed that&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-shutting-down-in-november">would be taken offline</a>, but the gaming giant also announced that an offline version of the game would be made available sometime following the shutdown.</p>

<p>That online version is arriving on December 2nd, it turns out, and it'll cost you $20, although that cost is being reduced to $10 for the first two months or so of the game's release.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-offline-version-campsite.jpg?itok=XMT9xfZV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-offline-version-campsite.jpg?itok=s28gl1Am 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp&nbsp;</em>is going offline soon.</figcaption></figure><p>Dubbed&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp Complete</em>, the offline version will essentially allow you to play&nbsp;<em>Pocket Camp&nbsp;</em>in its entirety without the need for an online connection.</p>

<p>The new version won't have any in-app microtransactions, either, and if you've already been playing&nbsp;<em>Pocket Camp</em>, you'll be able to "retain access to a majority of the items and events" in the original online version of the game.</p>

<p>New features will also be added, including QR-based Camper Cards, which you can use to scan your friends and add them to your card list. Once they're on there, you might see them show up in the all-new Whistle Pass area, where you can also enjoy a daily concert by none other than legendary musician K.K. Slider.</p>




<p>Since the original&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp&nbsp;</em>is online, there will, of course, be a number of features you won't be able to use anymore when the offline version arrives.</p>

<p>You can't play alongside your friends online anymore; the versions of them you see in Whistle Pass will be offline avatars rather than the players themselves. Leaf Tickets and the Pocket Camp Club subscription service also won't be available, and Leaf Tickets won't be transferred over to the new version either.</p>

<p>Be sure to check out Nintendo's new&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp Complete&nbsp;</em><a href="https://faq.complete.ac-pocketcamp.com/hc/en-us/categories/32282819200793-About-Animal-Crossing-Pocket-Camp-Complete" rel="noopener" target="_blank">FAQ</a> to find out what'll happen when the new app launches on December 2nd on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-c/id6547834967" rel="noopener" target="_blank">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nintendo.zasa" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead Review - Say Less, Do More]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/quiet-place-road-ahead-review-say-less-do-more</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-review-say-less-do-more.1020897/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/quiet-place-road-ahead-review-say-less-do-more<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Who said movie tie-in games were dead, eh? Sure, they tend to not come out at the same time as the movies anymore, and their longstanding legacy as mere “shovelware” may undermine whatever qualities they have, but the keyword here is “vigor”. Intent is never detached from passion, and inspiration forms in so many different ways, which is what <em>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead</em> aims to prove.</p>

<p>This is the latest title from Italian developers Stormind Games; a new story set within the <em>Quiet Place</em> universe, and fresh off the heels of the warm reception of the most recent film, <em>A Quiet Place: Day One</em>. This isn’t Stormind’s first foray into the horror genre either, as they were responsible for the rather underseen <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/remothered-broken-porcelain">Remothered</a> </em>games that came out in 2018, and 2020, respectively. If anything else, <em>The Road Ahead</em> is looking promising.</p>

<p>You play as Alex, a young lass who is hiding from the nearly-invulnerable “Death Angels”, along with her father Kenneth, her partner Martin, and Martin’s mother Laura. Taking place 4 months after the aliens crashed down on Earth and ravaged the planet, Alex finds out she’s pregnant with Martin’s child, the aftermath of which causes a fissure between the 4, driven deeper when Martin sacrifices himself to save her from a Death Angel attack.</p>



<p>It seems like a pretty heavy plot, right? There’s a lot of human tension on display, not unlike the themes present in the films. With that said, I have to get into the story – not just because of its similarity to the plot of the first film – but because of its rather asinine explanations for conflict. There seems to be dropping off points for logic as characters hedge all their bets on Alex being the supreme negative force in their post-apocalyptic shambles of a life.</p>

<p>There are a lot of pieces put in place before and during the game’s chain of events that are explained so briefly, and without a tertiary mention until it’s brought to court. Halfway through the game, Laura goes into a tirade about Alex being a disaster case that’s never really set up, or proven true as time goes on. Hell, the game seems to promise human raiders at several points which never comes to fruition either.</p>

<p>As for the gameplay, it’s a throwback type of horror situation: A first-person game of hide and seek with the Death Angels, similar to your <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/outlast-2"><em>Outlast</em></a>’s or <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/observer"><em>Observer</em></a>’s in that there’s no way to really fight back against your foe. You are practically a walking conduit of noise at all times, which <em>The Road Ahead</em> executes with an immense variety. Flares, wind-up flashlights, puddles of water, autumn leaves, tin cans, barrels, doors that have not been lubricated once since they were put into place, latches, and so on and so forth.</p>



<p>It’s certainly worth commending the number of ways <em>The Road Ahead</em> wants you to think about soundplay, even if it is to the point of completely arbitrary nonsense. The level design suffers as you can see the clear path of intent with each new area, where Death Angels can focus on sound traps, although as time goes on, that becomes an issue for the Death Angels too. When they’re forced into a playground to be a constant threat, there’s a good chance that their monstrous hit boxes will create sound by themselves, spooking them constantly.</p>

<p>The crowning jewel is the microphone gimmick, inspired by the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinion/alien-not-aliens-why-isolation-right-move"><em>Alien: Isolation</em></a> mechanic, and working exactly the same. If you have a microphone plugged into your controller or PC, then any noise made will be picked up by the game, and will be a direct source of noise for the Death Angel to grab. In execution, it plays out exactly how you’d expect – that is to say, a reminder of how little <em>The Road Ahead</em> trusts you with it.</p>

<p>In <em>Alien: Isolation</em>, the Xenomorph wasn’t stupid, but they were still bound by the game's rules and structure. You had time to escape if you accidentally just belched into the microphone after necking the last bit of your rum and coke. In <em>The Road Ahead</em>, any large amount of noise is immediately met with a game over, and I’m not talking about the Death Angel merely spawning in – the game will wrestle control from you and force a death, regardless of where you stand.</p>



<p>This is another one of those double-edged sword situations, where unless the game explicitly states it, safety isn’t guaranteed; a noble cause that reminds players of the hopeless situation. At the same time, however, <em>The Road Ahead</em> doesn’t trust the player with a single inclination that isn’t explicitly set up by the game itself. Constant tutorials regarding mechanics, text logs everywhere which reinforce said tutorials, before AND after it’s been stated.</p>

<p>Throughout your average 5-hour long playthrough, you will be bombarded with these gameplay-interrupting tutorials – right until the very end of the game – a total of 51 times, which is frankly insane. Whenever you perform a contextual button press, camera control will be wrestled from you. Whenever you enter a new area, chances are you’ll be forced to look at the scary thing. There’s an objectivity presented as fact which I personally cannot stand, and I’m not scared, just annoyed.</p>

<p>There’s one other unique mechanic <em>The Road Ahead</em> possesses, and that’s inhalers. Early on, it’s revealed that Alex is an asthmatic, and regularly needs one-time-use inhalers so as not to trigger an asthma attack which can point Death Angels in her direction. If one does happen, then I <em>think </em>you have to pull off a brazen QTE, and I use the word “think” because, despite two playthroughs, I couldn’t get one to trigger once through natural gameplay.</p>



<p>It’s such an overwhelming experience to sit through, and I don’t use that word lightly. Constant demand to vary the gameplay up, none of it ultimately providing the same solution as simply crouch walking. It even breaks the universe’s own rules at a certain point, with no other explanation than to justify a truly pathetic emotional climax that it doesn’t earn, which I feel sums up the entire experience perfectly.</p>

<h2><em>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead </em>Review | Final Verdict</h2>

<p><em>The Road Ahead</em> feels like it demands to be a fearful experience, to be a heart-wrenching story to listen to, and rarely will it put the work in to prove that. It’s a slog to sit through even at 5 hours long, it’s a haunted house ride that provides a teleprompter when it wants you to be scared, and it refuses to let you see the game with your own eyes.</p>

<p>Not unless there’s a tutorial on how to open them, at least.</p>
