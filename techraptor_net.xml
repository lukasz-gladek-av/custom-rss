            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/three-pokemon-tcg-collections-coming-in-2025-complete-with-unique-items<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>New <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/pokemon-trading-card-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Pokemon TCG</a> collections are coming next year. Fans of The Pokemon Company's enduring card game should watch for these collections. They will contain unique cards and special physical products for hardcore Pokemon fans.</p>

<h2>The Pokemon TCG Collections Announcement</h2>

<p>According to a post <a href="https://www.pokebeach.com/2024/12/three-tcg-collections-releasing-in-2025-with-new-unique-items-including-lenticular-card" rel="nofollow">on Pokebeach</a>, three new <em>Pokemon TCG</em> collections will be available in North America in 2025.</p>

This set is notable since it will bring back Owners' Pokemon cards. The Collection Box will contain three promo cards, one jumbo card, four booster packs, a code card, and a Polaroid-style postcard.</p>

<p>The last time a Polaroid was included in one of these boxes was part of the 2001 <em>Southern Islands</em> set.</p>

<p>The second of these Pokemon TCG collections is a new Premium Collection box coming April 11. The box will contain six boosters, two promo cards, a photo sticker, a backdrop card, and an acrylic standee sheet.</p>

<p>The post mentions how these products will work isn't entirely clear. However, acrylic stands have been released at Japan's Pokemon Centers before featuring different characters. There's a chance they may operate similarly, letting fans have little dioramas of beloved characters on display.</p>

This will contain five boosters, a code card, three promo cards, and a jumbo lenticular card. This is major since the last time a lenticular card was released, it was in promotion of the 2004 <em>Pokemon Destiny Deoxys</em> movie.</p>

<p>This is different from the lenticular posters contained in certain <em>Pokemon TCG</em> marketing kits. While nice bits of promotion, these promo items aren't real cards.</p>

<p>The <em>Pokemon TCG</em> is one of the most popular trading card games in the world. Its popularity has only grown thanks to the massive success of the mobile game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-dena-revenue" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em></a><em>.</em></p>
