These tariffs, which have already caused several board game companies to shutter, may not affect TTRPG books. However, there are some catches.</p>

<h2>TTRPG Books Potentially Exempt From Tariffs</h2>

<p>As mentioned before, the Trump administration's 145% trade tariffs on imported Chinese goods have severely impacted the entire tabletop game industry. The vast majority of board game production happens overseas in China then is imported back for delivery. But with import costs now more than double, companies like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/greater-than-games-shuts-down-in-response-to-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Greater Than Games</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cmon-reduces-staff-and-pauses-board-game-development-amid-us-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">CMON</a> have paused board game production completely.</p>

This is a curious question since books are usually exempt from import costs due in part to how they are manufactured and their classification as cultural objects or means of technical information. In fact, printed books are on a limited list of products exempt from President Trump's trade tariffs via the executive order <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Annex-II.pdf" rel="nofollow">Annex II</a>.</p>

<p>This seems straightforward. Printed books are exempt from tariffs. TTRPG books are printed books, therefore, they are exempt. According to US Customs however, it is more complicated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a ruling <a href="https://rulings.cbp.gov/ruling/085214" rel="nofollow">from 1989</a>, TTRPGs, referred to as "Fantasy Role Play Books" are not classified as printed books. The ruling states that the books are "designed to enhance fantasy game play, not for passive reading." This means the books are classified not as books but as "arcade, table, or parlor games... parts and accessories thereof," the same classification given to tabletop games.</p>

<p>This ruling is contradicted by more recent findings from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/563608/rpg-books-tariff-exclusions-shadowrun" rel="nofollow">Polygon's</a> own Nicole Carpenter. According to a 2024 Customs and Border Protection ruling, the <em>Shadowrun 6th Edition</em> Rulebook was classified as a printed hardbound book. This ruling applied, "only to the specific factual situation and merchandise description as identified in the ruling request."</p>

<p>Presuming this ruling isn't amended or overruled, that means TTRPG books may be exempt from the trade tariffs if they are imported and sold separately. No dice. No miniatures. No maps. No accessories included alongside the book.</p>

<p>What does this mean for the future of TTRPGs? Considering the ever-changing volatile landscape caused by the current administration, it is difficult to be certain. But, it may mean the cost of starter sets or TTRPG bundles may go up due to this quirk of US Customs.</p>
