            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/system-shock-2-25th-anniversary-remaster-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nightdive has announced the&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster&nbsp;</em>release date, with the reworked version of the classic FPS coming to PC and consoles in summer.</p>

<p>As revealed in a brand new trailer,&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2</em>'s remaster will be launching across PC and consoles (that's current-gen and last-gen consoles, happily) on June 26th.</p>

<p>Just in case you're wondering what happened to Nightdive's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/system-shock-2-enhanced-edition-is-being-ported-to-kex-engine" rel="nofollow">previously-revealed</a>&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2: Enhanced Edition</em>, this is, in fact, that very thing; the project was renamed to&nbsp;<em>25th Anniversary Remaster&nbsp;</em>earlier this year, but it's still the same, ahem, enhanced edition Nightdive has been working on for the past few years.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/system-shock-2-remaster-release-date-robot.jpg?itok=u9-8m4kP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/system-shock-2-remaster-release-date-robot.jpg?itok=J5FgeGFv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>System Shock 2</em>'s remaster is coming in June.</figcaption></figure><p>As you've probably come to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nightdive-the-thing-remaster-tease" rel="nofollow">expect</a> from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/poed-definitive-edition-nightdive" rel="nofollow">previous</a> Nightdive <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nightdive-studios-remastering-shadow-man-restoring-cut-content" rel="nofollow">remaster projects</a>,&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster&nbsp;</em>will bring a number of new features to the iconic 2000 FPS-RPG.</p>

<p>You can expect a visual revamp that will touch up some of the game's rougher edges and models without deviating from Irrational and Looking Glass' artistic vision, as well as some minor quality-of-life improvements, controller support, and more.</p>

<p>The game will also support Steam achievements, as well as achievements and trophies on the relevant consoles, and it'll boast 144fps and ultrawide support too, so this'll likely be the best-looking version of&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2&nbsp;</em>you can play (without mods, of course).</p>

<p>On the subject of mods, Nightdive is also promising expanded mod support for&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster</em>, so if you want to turn all the enemies into Mr. Blobby and work out some very specific trauma, you should find it pretty easy to do so.</p>




<p>It's worth remembering that although Nightdive is the studio responsible for 2023's excellent&nbsp;<em>System Shock&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/system-shock-goes-gold-release-date-for-pc-announced" rel="nofollow">remake</a>, this project isn't on the same scale; it's not a full reimagining, but a remaster, so bear that in mind if you pick it up.</p>

<p><em>System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster&nbsp;</em>launches for PC (via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/866570/System_Shock_2_25th_Anniversary_Remaster/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/system_shockr_2_25th_anniversary_remaster" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a>), <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10013043" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/System-Shock-2-25th-Anniversary-Remaster/9P4FK543SMZF" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and Nintendo Switch on June 26th. Make sure you pick this one up if you're interested in a revamped slice of FPS history.</p>
