            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Bomb Rush Cyberfunk&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Lethal League&nbsp;</em>developer Team Reptile has revealed its latest game&nbsp;<em>Hyperfunk</em>, and if you're a fan of the studio's last effort, it looks like you're going to love this one as well.</p>

<p>As revealed in a brand new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Hyperfunk&nbsp;</em>is an "extreme trick and graffiti game" in which you must pull off stylish trick combos in order to build your boost and speed through the city.</p>

<p>Per the game's brand new Steam page,&nbsp;<em>Hyperfunk&nbsp;</em>takes place in a "bright future" in which society is built around an online space known as the Hyper and graffiti crews compete with one another regarding "how to interpret this new world".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hyperfunk-bomb-rush-cyberfunk-dev-trick.jpg?itok=6b0rbfO3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hyperfunk-bomb-rush-cyberfunk-dev-trick.jpg?itok=-MwxBttC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hyperfunk&nbsp;</em>is the next game from&nbsp;<em>Bomb Rush Cyberfunk&nbsp;</em>studio Team Reptile.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're a fan of&nbsp;<em>Bomb Rush Cyberfunk</em>, you'll likely recognize the visual style Team Reptile is going for with&nbsp;<em>Hyperfunk</em>; this is very much a closely-related spiritual successor rather than a departure from existing styles.</p>

<p>Still, the trailer for&nbsp;<em>Hyperfunk&nbsp;</em>shows a game that looks like it's built much more around speed, trick combos, and traversal than its predecessor was, so if you thought&nbsp;<em>Bomb Rush Cyberfunk&nbsp;</em>could do with being more kinetic and speedy, you're in luck.</p>

<p>There's also an online component to&nbsp;<em>Hyperfunk</em>; you can hang out with random players online in the Hyper, but if you prefer to keep things local to you and your friends, you can chill with them in the streets of the game's city as well.</p>

<p>You can check out a trailer for&nbsp;<em>Hyperfunk</em>, which shows off the game's very&nbsp;<em>Jet Set Radio</em>-inspired visual aesthetic and gameplay style, right here. No "Fly Like a Butterfly", though, sadly.</p>




<p>We don't have a release date or even a broad release window for&nbsp;<em>Hyperfunk&nbsp;</em>yet, but you can wishlist it on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3183480/HYPERFUNK/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a> if you like. Hopefully, this one doesn't get <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bomb-rush-cyberfunk-delayed-to-2023-for-polish" rel="nofollow">delayed like its predecessor did</a>, eh?</p>
