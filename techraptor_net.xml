            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Alan Wake&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em>developer Remedy Entertainment has posted its financial results for the third quarter of its 2025-26 fiscal year, and there's a pretty clear indication in the report that the studio is moving on from&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>.</p>

<p>In an official Remedy <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=34fb39e4-7860-4bea-9485-4f29745db2e6" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a>, new interim CEO&nbsp;Markus Mäki, who stepped in to replace departing exec Tero Virtala <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-ceo-tero-virtala-steps-down" rel="nofollow">just last week</a>, says that the company has "moved development resources [from&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>]&nbsp;to [its] other in-development titles".</p>

<p>Mäki does say that Remedy intends to "respect [its] communicated roadmap" for the game, so at the very least, you can expect the promised updates on said roadmap to arrive in a timely fashion. After that, though, it seems likely Remedy is done with the game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fbc-firebreak-remedy-q3-financials.jpg?itok=abA-jMPi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fbc-firebreak-remedy-q3-financials.jpg?itok=mzZnct5d 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>has resulted in a pretty rotten few months for Remedy.</figcaption></figure><p>Despite this, however,&nbsp;Mäki says that Remedy has "also found positive sides" to&nbsp;the launch of&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>. He says that the studio's "first multiplayer product launch was technically successful in a cross-platform environment", and that the game's release has helped Remedy's publishing team gain experience.</p>

<p>It hasn't been a great few months for Remedy, though. The aforementioned financial report shows that revenue is down a whopping 32% on last year's Q3, although&nbsp;Mäki says that's because the studio received development fees for&nbsp;<em>Control 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-annapurna-control-2-tv-movies" rel="nofollow">from publisher Annapurna</a> during this period.</p>

<p>Additionally, Remedy made an operating loss of €16.4 million this quarter, compared to a profit of €2.4 million during the same period last year. It's safe to say that&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>has rather scuppered Remedy's third quarter this year, and its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fbc-firebreak-breakpoint-update" rel="nofollow">major Breakpoint update in September</a> hasn't helped much.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, development on&nbsp;<em>Control 2&nbsp;</em>and the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Max Payne&nbsp;</em>remakes continues,&nbsp;Mäki says, and the projects are "progressing according to plan".</p>




<p>It may well be a while before we hear anything more from Remedy regarding these projects, but hopefully, we'll learn what&nbsp;<em>Control 2&nbsp;</em>and the&nbsp;<em>Max Payne&nbsp;</em>remakes look like in the coming months. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New World Development Ending as Amazon Suffers Layoffs]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-world-development-ending-amazon-layoffs</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-world-development-ending-as-amazon-suffers-layoffs.1338058/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Amazon Games has announced that development on its PvP-focused MMORPG&nbsp;<em>New World&nbsp;</em>is coming to an end, and that the game's tenth season will serve as its final major update.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.newworld.com/en-us/news/articles/update-on-new-world?tag=updates" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">statement</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>New World&nbsp;</em>website, Amazon says that after <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-world-launch-500k-players-queue-times" rel="nofollow">four years</a> of supporting the MMORPG, it is "no longer sustainable to continue supporting the game with new content updates", hence the halt to development.</p>

<p>Despite that, however, the servers won't be going down; you'll still be able to play&nbsp;<em>New World&nbsp;</em>"through 2026" at the very least, although that naturally doesn't mean the servers will continue to be available after next year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/new-world-development-ending-amazon-party.jpg?itok=hi3xdHbZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/new-world-development-ending-amazon-party.jpg?itok=WNw-Ie5G 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>New World&nbsp;</em>won't be getting any more big updates.</figcaption></figure><p>In an accompanying FAQ, Amazon says that it will "provide more details on what to expect in the coming months" with regards to how long&nbsp;<em>New World</em>'s servers will remain available, and that "a minimum of six months' notice" will be provided before any big changes are made.</p>

<p>In-game currency and purchases are also remaining active, and you'll still be able to buy and play the game on each platform (although the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1063730/New_World_Aeternum/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam page</a> no longer provides the option to purchase <em>New World</em>), as well as downloading it via PlayStation Plus "until further notice".</p>

<p>While development is ending, bug fixes and support will continue, and "world bosses, bonus weeks, and some seasonal events" will stay in rotation as well, although there won't be any more holiday events in&nbsp;<em>New World</em>.</p>

<p><em>New World&nbsp;</em>was released back in 2021 to a rather inauspicious beginning; it was plagued by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-world-is-bricking-gigabyte-rtx-30-series-gpus" rel="nofollow">technical issues</a>, farming <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazon-to-crack-down-on-new-world-farming-bots" rel="nofollow">bots</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/game-breaking-new-world-invincibility-exploit-discovered" rel="nofollow">game-breaking bugs</a> from day one, and updates intended to fix problems would often introduce entirely new ones.</p>




<p>In 2024,&nbsp;<em>New World&nbsp;</em>was relaunched with a brand new title,&nbsp;<em>New World: Aeternum</em>, a relaunch that also saw the game arriving on consoles. It was also a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-world-review-bomb-relaunch" rel="nofollow">particularly unpopular move</a> among the game's PC player base, many of whom felt abandoned by Amazon despite their love for the original game.</p>

<p>News of the game entering maintenance mode also comes as Amazon is hit by sweeping layoffs, with thousands of employees <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/amazon-layoffs-14000-corporate-employees-citing-ai-1236563297/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">losing their jobs</a> amid a push towards AI. The gaming division has also pledged to halt a "significant amount" of its first-party AAA game development.</p>

<p>Amazon isn't exiting the gaming space entirely, though; earlier this month, it was announced that streaming service Luna would be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazon-luna-rework-later-this-year" rel="nofollow">getting a major overhaul</a> to refocus on party gaming, although the rebrand will still offer access to many core audience-focused titles as well.</p>

<p>For the time being, you can still check out&nbsp;<em>New World&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/new-world-aeternum/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/new-world-aeternum/9NPZJNVGHZ3P" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and if you already own the game on PC, you can play it there as well. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>
