            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Legendary <em>Doom </em>and <em>Quake </em>studio id Software has become the latest Microsoft subsidiary to vote to unionize, with a "strong majority" opting to seek representation in the form of the Communications Workers of America (CWA).</p><p>According to <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/video-game-developers-texas-vote-form-latest-wall-wall-union-cwa" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">a post</a> on the CWA website, 165 id Software employees will now be a part of the union's Local 6215 branch, which, like id Software itself, is based in Richardson, Texas. Microsoft has already recognized the union.</p><p>Just like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/world-of-warcraft-blizzard-union" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f999ae61-0042-4749-84bf-b1ba3d4c137a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Blizzard's union last year</a>, id Software's union is wall-to-wall, which essentially means it incorporates employees across all departments rather than simply consisting of workers in a specific area of the company.</p><figure role="group">

<p>Producer Andrew Willis says unionization is "incredibly important" for developers "across the industry" in order to "push back on all the unilateral workplace changes" being imposed on workers by "industry executives".</p><p>Local 6215 president Ron Swaggerty (which, by the way, is an excellent name), meanwhile, says that id Software's native Texas is now a "force in building collective power" in the gaming industry, and that the union looks forward to negotiating a contract that "reflects the skill, creativity, and dedication" of the studio's workers.</p><p>This isn't the first time a studio at Microsoft has unionized, of course. id Software follows in the footsteps of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-overwatch-union" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5c8571b8-a998-407f-adb5-66bec141aeba" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">developers at Blizzard</a>, Bethesda's parent company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenimax-qa-union-strike" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="09d99387-8c9a-4aef-8a3d-6226b7553603" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">ZeniMax</a>, and <em>Call of Duty </em>studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/raven-software-activision-microsoft-labor-complaint" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e5cbcf28-95af-4834-91c2-6ea91eaef2c5" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Raven Software</a>, to name but a few.</p><p>The topic of unionization is a particularly pertinent one at the moment, too; back in November, <em>Grand Theft Auto 6 </em>developer Rockstar was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rockstar-union-busting-accusation-gta-6" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2fb963bf-6dd1-47b3-bfbd-3f16511b3076" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">accused of union-busting</a> after firing a number of employees who were involved in union activity. Rockstar denies the allegations, of course.</p><figure role="group">

<p>Workers in Rockstar's native UK are unionizing, too; <em>Disco Elysium </em>studio ZA/UM (although there's debate regarding exactly how much of the studio is still the <em>Disco Elysium </em>developer) <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/disco-elysium-zaum-union" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6f3e8ab4-4fcd-4a59-a200-ac197c4a274c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">formed the nation's first official gaming union</a> back in October.</p><p>Here's hoping efforts to unionize across the industry continue; after all, there's no better way for workers to get themselves a seat at the table and to hold meaningful conversations with management. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Xbox has announced a brand new Developer Direct show for January, and a studio that's working on one of the publisher's most hotly-anticipated games will be featured during the presentation.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/xbox-game-studios-matt-booty-call-of-duty-movie-dev-direct-plans-1236606594/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Variety</a>, content and studios president Matt Booty says that the show will star none other than Playground Games, the developer currently working on the long-awaited <em>Fable </em>reboot. In case you need a reminder, said reboot was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fable-reboot-delayed-2026" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="48a951d3-c822-4051-88a7-e27a8ee10808" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">delayed from 2025 to 2026</a> earlier this year.</p><p>Booty goes on to say that while Developer Direct shows are usually about "highlighting what's coming up for the year ahead", 2026 is a packed year for Xbox, so the publisher has "more stuff coming up than [it] can fit in one show".</p><figure role="group">

Could we see more of <em>Campaign Evolved </em>during January's show? I'd say the odds are good.</p><p>As for the rest of Xbox's slate, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/forza-horizon-6-revealed-ps5" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7ede297d-3bdf-4de5-b00a-3479b4a33aab" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Forza Horizon 6</em></a>, which will be set in Japan, is set to arrive sometime next year, as is a Switch 2 version of musical action-adventure game <em>South of Midnight</em>, so we might see spots for those at the Direct too.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen exactly what Xbox intends to showcase during its January Developer Direct, and the show doesn't have a date or time yet either, so we'll just have to wait and see. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
