            <title><![CDATA[The Killing Stone Is A 17th-Century Occult Adventure With Deckbuilding At Its Core - Developer Interview]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/killing-stone-is-17th-century-occult-adventure-with-deckbuilding-at-its-core</link>
            <guid>1411966</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>The Killing Stone</em> is a new roguelite deckbuilding game with an added focus on a "17th-century occult horror narrative." This focus on story might not be as common for the genre, but for the team at developer Question, this story was always something they'd had in mind.</p><p>Last week TechRaptor had a chance to sit down with the team at Question, as well as Liam O'Brien and Emma Gregory who lend their voices to <em>The Killing Stone</em>, to learn more about the game and the process of putting it together.</p><p>At the top of our discussion, it was revealed that <em>The Killing Stone</em> will release on February 18, 2026 for PC via Steam. If you're interested in trying out the game, a demo is also currently available to play.</p><p>The story of <em>The Killing Stone</em> takes place after the death of Mariken Swangard (Emma Gregory), a powerful mage whose success was due to various deals that she took on with One Eye (Liam O'Brien) the Devil. Those sins she took on have now been passed on to the family, and the Devil is ready to collect unless Maven, the character you play as, is able to help them get out of those bad deals.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>Jordan Thomas, co-owner of Question and writer and narrative director of <em>The Killing Stone</em>, explained that while they didn't set out to create a game with a narrative focus it was an obsession with a Faustian theme that pushed the development of the story. They also took inspiration from "<em>Slay The Spire, Inscription,</em> and <em>[I Was a] Teenage Exocolonist</em>, but also from <em>Firewatch, Eternal Darkness</em>, and <em>Seventh Guest</em>. Not wanting to take any on in their own turf, but to do what we can to nod to them and appreciate them."</p><p>The core gameplay loop will have the player, Maven, taking on the Devil and his lieutenants by revising the contracts that One Eye has with the different members of the family. These contract changes take place through roguelite deckbuilding battles.</p><h2>The Sins Are Present In The Decks You Play</h2><p>Each family member has a different deck with different cards, boons, and banes. Each of these buffs is tied to the family member that they represent.</p><p>As you progress from node to node you'll encounter different battles, events, and have chances to remove cursed sin cards from your deck or power up other cards.</p><p>Talking us through the combat quickly Thomas described it as "wizard chess meets poker." Thomas also explained that each deck is "meant to start oppressive, but as you bargain with the demon, things will become easier."</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Explore The Mansion Between Games</h2><p>A portion of <em>The Killing Stone</em> that I got to learn more about was what you can do when you're not playing the deckbuilding portion of the game. Stepping up from the game table, Maven is able to explore the massive Swangard mansion.</p><blockquote><p>"It's all about the atmosphere and what's lying under the surface" - Liam O'Brien</p></blockquote><p>During this moment we got to see Maven move through a number of hallways and up a stairwell to a dimly lit and ominous living room with various members of the Swangard family standing around. It was explained that during the downtime you'd be able to learn more about the story and perspective on the events of the game from the characters you'll be helping along the way.</p><p>The story of <em>The Killing Stone</em> can definitely be explored on the surface by just playing through the game, but it's in these moments that you talk with members of the family and explore the mansion where you'll learn far more about what's going on.</p><p>Thomas praised games like <em>Elden Ring</em> for their emergent storytelling, teaching you about the world through character observations and item descriptions, and said that while <em>The Killing Stone</em> "isn't treating you like you're in school… through collaboration and discussion, more of the story can be pieced together."</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Extra Hard Challenges Are Optional But Worth It</h2><p>The Mansion isn't just about exploration either as you can make your way to a grotto where there are chances to complete Arcane Rituals. There are additional challenges that are difficult to complete but will grant you cards that can be cycled into any of the decks going forward, giving you access to some powerful cards.</p><p>We did ask whether there would be additional hidden secrets in the Mansion that could affect gameplay, but it was explained to us that "it's not a game where you're unlocking hidden rooms or solving puzzles, these are more ambient haunting moments and optional conversations but it's a light tough."</p><h2>Audio Tracks For English and Period English</h2><p>One of the most fascinating aspects of the game's 17th-century setting is that there are multiple English language tracks for the game, one where the characters speak in what I might describe as sounding like Old English, and a second that is truly period English.</p><blockquote><p>"One [language track] is a little closer to modern language, there is also a second track where everything is ripped out of centuries old texts."</p></blockquote><p>When the text was first shown off I thought they were beginning with the period English, that was until they toggled it on and replayed the same scene and the entire scene transformed.</p><p>Gregory couldn't be more complimentary of the experience explaining "I had the most wonderful time. I was thrilled that someone had the balls to write in period speak and that to me, I just relished it. I've done a lot of Shakespeare and I love it. There were times that Liam [O'Brien], [Jordan Thomas], and I spoke for hours."</p><blockquote><div><p>'Modern' English<br>"Blood shared with me may be a component, many curses are delimited thus. Regardless, an economy of hexcraft as every my way: Meaning if any substitute soul will do, why was the child selected to absorb my sins?&nbsp;<br>If i wished to compel the rest - er even you - to stay... would not the Damoclean Sword, dangled over his young head, do the trick via pity's soft sorcery?</p><p>'Period' English<br>"Mine own blood, share'd amongst my line - may a catalyst be; many curses are delimited thus. Regardless, an economy of hexcraft was e'er my way. For lo - if any substitute soul will suffice to absorb my sins, wherefore select a child?&nbsp;<br>Were it my will to compel the rest, or e'en thee - to stay: Would not an omen of Damoclean doom o'er a young head dreadful pois'd - then, by pity's soft sorcery - hold all in check?"</p></div></blockquote><p>O'Brien added that the deeper period English adaptations of the text were easier to get into character for and bring out a deeper performance. What added to this is that O'Brien was asked to take the role of One Eye after Thomas saw him performing in a Shakespearean manner as part of a Critical Role ad read.</p><blockquote><p>"The writing is some of the richest, densest, most creatively thrilling work I've had a chance to do in a long time." - Liam O'Brien</p></blockquote><p>You can also choose to mix and match these different versions of English between voice and text if you'd prefer to have Liam O'Brien speak as if he were in a Shakespearean production but have an easier to understand English as text on the screen. The game will also have localizations for French, German, Spanish (Latin American), and Simplified Chinese.</p><p>For fans of deckbuilding roguelites who have been looking for a bit more of a narrative drive, <em>The Killing Stone</em> is shaping up to be a game just for you. It's less than a month until its release on February 18 now.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
