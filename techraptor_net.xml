            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 Direct is officially underway, and its first major announcement is&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>, a brand new game in the&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart&nbsp;</em>series.</p>

<p>Revealed as the first trailer during today's Direct,&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>will feature many of your favorite faces from the series, as well as new playable characters like a Hammer Bro, a Moo Moo Meadows cow, and more.</p>

<p>As you'd probably expect,&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>will be exclusive to the Switch 2; it won't be available for the first-gen Switch, so this is our very first confirmed first-party Switch 2 exclusive. Nintendo is promising a "vast world" with kart races taking place in regions that "span the globe".</p>

<p>Races will support 24 drivers, "the most in series history", and there will be a number of gameplay modes on offer, including the non-stop world tour-style Knockout Tour mode. Racers are eliminated in this mode based on where they're placed at each checkpoint.</p>

<p>Uniquely,&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>also has a Free Roam mode, which will allow you to drive around the game's world and explore off-course "wherever your heart takes you". Not only that, but the Free Roam mode supports multiplayer, so you can enjoy it alongside your friends.</p>

<p>As you'd probably expect,&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>will be available as a Switch 2 launch title, and you'll be able to get more information about it on April 17th, when a&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>-focused Nintendo Direct show will be held.</p>

Stay tuned for more.</p>
