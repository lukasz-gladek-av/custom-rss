The expansion, <em>Blades in the Dark: Deep Cuts</em>, contains new worldbuilding details for the game's setting and new alternative gameplay mechanics.</p>

<h2>The <em>Blades in the Dark: Deep Cuts</em> Announcement</h2>

<p>According to the game's itch page, <em>Blades in the Dark: Deep Cuts</em> is a 118-page supplement. The book is broken up into two parts. One part introduces new lore into the game's electropunk city of Duskvol. The second part contains new modular rules systems for players to use in their games.</p>

Players can choose from 100 new heritage and backgrounds to better flesh out their characters.</p>

<p>In addition, the book includes 13 new technological innovations to reflect the setting's ongoing industrial age advances. Those advancements include new rare and nefarious tech that Scoundrels can use in their next job.</p>

<p>For those wanting more dynamic elements, <em>Blades in the Dark: Deep Cuts</em> introduces a new concept: Catalysts. A Catalyst is a world-shaking event that expands and alters the setting, providing new avenues for intrigue and new opportunities for every crew type.</p>

<p>As for the modular rules, the book includes six new ones. They include flexible Harm &amp; Trauma rules, and a modified Advancement system designed to customize character progress.</p>

<p>Last but not least, the book includes a revised Load and Action system. The former is more closely tied to the game's fiction while remaining simple. The latter streamlines the base game's action resolution mechanics. It is designed to empower players further and speed up the process of play.</p>

<p><em>Blades in the Dark: Deep Cuts</em> is available right now in PDF form for $10.00. It is also sold in a bundle with the original <em>Blades in the Dark</em> for $27. There are currently no plans for a physical release.</p>
