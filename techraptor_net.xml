            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-roadmap-january-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Pocketpair has shared a brand new&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>roadmap to celebrate the game's first anniversary, and it includes some pretty major features, although it's not clear exactly when these features are set to debut.</p>

<p>In a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1623730/view/596264277969469557" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, Pocketpair celebrates&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>'s first birthday by announcing a number of initiatives related to the game, only one of which is the aforementioned roadmap. The studio will also be holding a "worldwide Pal popularity poll", and a soundtrack has been released for free, too.</p>

<p>The roadmap promises a number of new "future" features without committing to timeframes, including major new features and miscellaneous improvements alike.</p>

You can also look forward to new Pals and technologies, as well as a new "ending scenario".</p>

<p>Pocketpair also promises "game collaborations", including the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-terraria-crossover-2025" rel="nofollow">upcoming&nbsp;<em>Terraria&nbsp;</em>collab</a>, so it sounds like there will be more&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>crossovers in the future. Just <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-lawsuit-patents-demands-nintendo" rel="nofollow">don't expect a&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>crossover</a> anytime soon.</p>

<p>Improvements coming to&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>in the future include tweaks for "world object placement", Pals, game optimization, and UX, so&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>should be a smoother experience overall once those have been applied.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this roadmap doesn't commit to even a vague time window for when we can expect these improvements to arrive. Pocketpair simply pledges to "continue updating <i>Palworld&nbsp;</i>as we prepare for the official release".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-roadmap-2025-1st-anniversary-artwork.jpg?itok=WVQPoUeA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-roadmap-2025-1st-anniversary-artwork.jpg?itok=JYUDmmg2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Pocketpair shared this cute artwork to celebrate&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>'s first anniversary.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not au fait with&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>, it's a survival game that mashes up the creature collecting of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>with the base-building and exploration of games like&nbsp;<em>Ark: Survival Evolved</em>.</p>

<p>Often distilled (perhaps unfairly) down to "<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>with guns",&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>was a breakout hit when it was released, attracting <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-25-million-players-matching-pokemon-scarlet-violet" rel="nofollow">tens of millions of players</a>&nbsp;during the first month or two of its release.</p>

<p>Those&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>comparisons might not be fair, but Nintendo clearly doesn't think so; the Japanese gaming giant is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-palworld-pocketpair-lawsuit" rel="nofollow">currently suing Pocketpair</a> over some rather arcane patents, a situation which led to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-ps5-release-japan" rel="nofollow">delay of the game's PS5 release</a> in Japan.</p>
