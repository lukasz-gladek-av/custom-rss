            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-engineers-2-early-access-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Keen Software House has announced the&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>Early Access release date, as well as unveiling the game's first full trailer in anticipation of that date.</p>

<p><em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-engineers-2-announced" rel="nofollow">revealed last week</a>, and as part of that reveal, Keen Software House (not to be confused with&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/enshrouded" rel="nofollow">Enshrouded</a>&nbsp;</em>studio Keen Games) promised an Early Access release date the following week.</p>

<p>Now, that time has come;&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>will officially arrive in Early Access on January 27th, so make sure to mark that date on your calendar if you're looking forward to some co-op space engineering fun.</p>

<p>Plenty of new systems and gameplay mechanics will be introduced in&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2</em>, including new creative tools, a brand new engine with "better performance and future optimization potential", and improved visuals, among many other changes.</p>

<p>If you pick up&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>in Early Access, you'll gain, erm, access to what Keen Software House calls the "first vertical slice" of the game, which will consist of its Creative Mode. This mode will show off many of the game's new tools and features, so if you're looking to get an idea of what&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>will be capable of in the future, the Early Access release is the place to go.</p>




<p>In future, Keen Software House says it'll keep updating&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>with new "vertical slices", each of which will expand the game's "features and content". In essence, it sounds like they'll work just like most Early Access game updates do.</p>

<p><em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>is coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1133870/Space_Engineers_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on January 27th.</p>
