            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-dating-sim-announced-again<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>developer Pocketpair has seemingly announced a dating sim spinoff by the name of&nbsp;<em>More than Just Pals</em>, but there's reason to believe it might not be a serious prospect.</p>

<p>The game was revealed via <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1906687045130653704" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on X earlier today, in which Pocketpair calls the game "a <i>Palworld&nbsp;</i>school romance VN (visual novel)" and invites players to wishlist it via its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3620480/Palworld_More_Than_Just_Pals/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">brand new Steam page</a>.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time&nbsp;<em>More than Just Pals&nbsp;</em>has appeared, though. The first announcement for the game came <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/april-fools-day-2024-gaming-roundup" rel="nofollow">on April Fools' Day last year</a>, at which point Pocketpair said it would launch on the same day the following year (i.e. tomorrow).</p>

<p>Then again, back then, I wrote that Pocketpair had willed the project into genuine existence by virtue of creating it as a joke, and that may well be what's happened. If it is, well, we might be beyond help this time around.</p>

<p>Assuming&nbsp;<em>Palworld: More than Just Pals&nbsp;</em>is real, you'll be attending the Palagos Private Academy, where you'll meet a number of romanceable Pals. You can "stay friends with the Pals, develop romantic relationships with them, or even dismember and eat them".</p>

<p>It rather looks like&nbsp;<em>More than Just Pals&nbsp;</em>is taking a more&nbsp;<em>Hatoful Boyfriend</em>-style approach to dating sims rather than the conventional path; this feels rather like a parody effort to me.</p>




<p>Pocketpair also says it's giving away a Lovander body pillow to celebrate the new announcement of&nbsp;<em>Palworld: More than Just Pals</em>. If you want to enter the competition (again, assuming it's real), <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1906688298925633793" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">you can do so on X</a>.</p>
