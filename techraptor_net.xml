<p>In a thread of social media posts on X (formerly Twitter), Tolarian Community College announced this year's <a href="https://give.translifeline.org/campaign/tolarian-community-college-trans-lifeline-2025-fundraiser/c658047" rel="nofollow">Trans Lifeline</a> fundraiser. It started with a simple request. Donate multiples of $4.00 to the fundraiser and you will be eligible to win one of ten <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Masters boxes.</p>

One day later, that amount increased to over $270,000. To commemorate this milestone, Tolarian Community College announced a series of thank-you gifts would be going out to certain donors.</p>

<p>Those gifts included gaming accessories like playmats and Infinitotokens. But mostly the gifts were sought after <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> cards and decks including the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/secret-lair-x-doctor-who-regeneration-brings-15th-doctor-to-magic-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Doctor Who</em></a> Commander Deck, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/secret-lair-x-dungeons-dragons-50th-anniversary-superdrop-announced-by-wizards-of" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em> Secret Lair</a>, a Zendikar Rising Collector's Box, and a Revised Counterspell card signed by Mark Poole.</p>

<p>The most recent update by Tolarian Community College exclaimed surprise at the Trans Lifeline fundraiser raising over $425,000. This puts the fundraiser close to its stated goal of $500,000.</p>

In addition, the organization's members are part of the transgender community. Their stated goals include keeping their members' identities anonymous and confidential, providing peer support, and dismantling the institutional bigotry of white supremacy.</p>

<p>The support for Trans Lifeline comes during a volatile time in the United States. Due to several executive orders by President Trump, transgender identity is being erased or actively overwritten. This includes the removal of "transgender" and "queer" altogether from the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-news/references-transgender-queer-removed-stonewall-monuments-webpage-rcna192204" rel="nofollow">Stonewall National Monument's</a> web page.</p>

<p>The Trans Lifeline fundraiser concludes February 15.</p>
