            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has announced new sales milestones for&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>DLC, as well as the experimental multiplayer spinoff&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, and they're both doing very well indeed.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1948382858109698175" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on social media, the studio reveals that&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>has reached the 10 million sales mark, which means it's doubled its sales count in the year or so since it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-sales" rel="nofollow">hit five million in its first week</a>.</p>

<p>Since base&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>sales were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-30m" rel="nofollow">sitting at around 30 million</a> at last count, that means around a third of all&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>players have checked out&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, which is a pretty impressive adoption rate for DLC.</p>

<p>Sales of&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>may only be a fraction of its bigger brother's, but it's worth remembering that&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>isn't a mainline FromSoftware Soulslike; rather, it's an experimental spinoff that draws from roguelikes,&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>, and games like&nbsp;<em>Risk of Rain</em>, so these sales are still pretty impressive.</p>

<p>Indeed,&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>sold well enough to keep both Nintendo Switch 2 launch title&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>and Hideo Kojima trip&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach&nbsp;</em>from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/circana-june-2025-us-gaming-sales-data" rel="nofollow">all-format top spot in June</a>, so Bandai Namco has plenty of reason to feel smug.</p>

<p>The franchise's future is looking pretty rosy as well; back in May, a live-action movie helmed by&nbsp;<em>Ex Machina&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Annihilation&nbsp;</em>filmmaker Alex Garland <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-movie" rel="nofollow">was announced</a>, so there's even more&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>around the corner.</p>

The studio is currently hard at work on&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods</em>, a PvPvE game coming <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-duskbloods-fromsoftware-nintendo-switch-2" rel="nofollow">exclusively to Nintendo Switch 2</a> (yes, you read that right) next year.</p>
