            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft is enacting another voluntary redundancy program, but rather than one of the publisher's many studio locations, it's the Paris head office where roles are at risk this time around.</p><p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-launches-voluntary-redundancy-process-to-cut-200-jobs-from-paris-head-office" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gamesindustry.biz</a>, Ubisoft looks to be cutting around 200 staff roles from its Paris location, which constitutes around 18% of the studio's overall staff. That's not an insubstantial cut at all.</p><p>At the moment, the redundancy program is strictly voluntary, but Ubisoft has previous form with following up a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/massive-entertainment-ubisoft-layoffs" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="eb337fd6-aaaa-412a-8249-337dc274de4e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">voluntary redundancy</a> initiative by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-layoffs-massive-stockholm" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4b995302-57da-4b38-b244-d5e338eabf5f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">laying off staff who didn't take said redundancy</a>, so there's every chance that'll happen again if not enough Paris staff are enticed.</p><figure role="group">

<p>News of Ubisoft's latest voluntary redundancy program comes after the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-canceled" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="91d63675-e1f4-4624-a716-79db888eb3c6" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">announced a major restructuring effort</a> last week, with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-arriving-in-january" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3014a94f-b7e6-448b-9e28-45fa936df680" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">long-awaited</a> <em>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time </em>remake being shut down as part of that effort.</p><p>The game was canned along with several other projects in Ubisoft's pipeline, all as part of an attempt to streamline the studio's output and focus on profitability.</p><p>Ubisoft's decision was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/union-calls-for-ubisoft-strike-tomorrow-following-new-plan" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7caa1331-487f-43c9-a977-3070ecf2f7c5" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">met with outrage</a> by French union Solidaires Informatique, along with a call for Ubisoft employees to strike.&nbsp;</p><p>That call was <a href="https://www.lesechos.fr/tech-medias/hightech/ubisoft-les-syndicats-francais-appellent-a-une-greve-massive-du-10-au-12-fevrier-2212033" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">repeated today</a> after the voluntary redundancy program's announcement, and it seems Ubisoft employees have indeed voted in favor of action, with the strike due to take place between February 10th and 12th.</p><figure role="group">

<p>In general, it's not been the best of times for Ubisoft recently, with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-assassins-creed-boss-suing-ubisoft" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="da42bb57-e4f1-4a65-91eb-9ce61dfcfee5" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">impending lawsuits</a> from former execs, studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-halifax-shutdown" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5c381dd9-8d80-4d19-ac2f-5c64bbb6ef55" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">shutdowns</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-creative-houses-q1-financials" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="acd9f3a1-9a63-4e42-9b91-122a243964e9" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">disappointing financial results</a> all lining up outside the publisher's door.</p><p>If Ubisoft continues at this pace, I can't imagine the remaining employees will be particularly happy or comfortable, which could cause further problems for the company down the line.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has released its Q3 financial results for this fiscal year, and when it comes to consolidated results for the nine-month period as a whole, the studio is doing pretty well, as are some of its core franchises.</p><p>In its latest <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/explanation/2025/3rd/explanation_2025_3rd_01.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">financial presentation</a>, Capcom reveals that its sales, operating profit, and ordinary profit are all up by varying degrees when compared to March-December 2024, and the studio is on track for a better 2025-26 fiscal year as a whole, too.</p><p>When it comes to specific games, Capcom says the <em>Resident Evil </em>series, along with <em>Street Fighter 6</em>, "continued to grow" in sales terms, and that <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>managed to surpass the 11 million sales mark within the March-December period as well.</p><figure role="group">

<p>The new sales figure means <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>has garnered <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-10m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3047bd12-37c9-4b65-bd39-064968be79fa" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">another million sales since the end of March</a>, which rather validates Capcom's concern that sales slowed down dramatically after launch, although whether the so-called <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-ps5-barrier-capcom" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a0c5ff11-5fb9-4929-804b-8a8d4f7adae0" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">"PS5 barrier" is to blame</a> is another matter.</p><p>Capcom also says that sales of the <em>Resident Evil 4 </em>remake<em> </em>and <em>Resident Evil Village </em>grew thanks to the announcement of <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>, which is due to arrive next month. Both games had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-sales-10m-village-11m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="649d13dc-948c-45a4-b39b-fbab7260a9b1" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">crossed the ten million sales barrier</a> at last count.</p><p>With regards to Capcom's future, the company has a pretty packed slate. The aforementioned <em>Resident Evil Requiem </em>leads the pack, but there's also <em>Monster Hunter Stories 3 </em>and <em>Mega Man Star Force Legacy Collection </em>to look forward to in March.</p><p>In total, Capcom sold 34.64 million game units between March and December 2025, which is around four million units higher than the previous year's total. It's fair to say Capcom is on the up right now.</p><figure role="group">

<p>We'll have to wait and see what else Capcom has in store for the year, but for now, the company will no doubt be celebrating this past nine-month period's improvements. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
