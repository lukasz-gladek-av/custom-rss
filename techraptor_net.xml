            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-warhammer-40000-astra-militarum-army-box-features-death-korps-of-krieg<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Games Workshop has revealed its latest <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000</em></a> Astra Militarum army box. However, this newest army box does not showcase the army's usual mascot, the Cadians. Instead, as part of the tenth edition, the Death Korps of Krieg has the spotlight.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/rlzyczbw/death-korps-of-krieg-whats-in-the-new-army-box/" rel="nofollow">Warhammer-Community post</a>, Games Workshop showcased the Death Korps of Krieg units in the upcoming <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> Astra Militarum army box.</p>

The key focus on the post was on the named unit, Lord Marshal Dreir, and the new Artillery Units.</p>

<p>Lord Marshal Dreir maintains the Krieg's sci-fi trappings of German WWI frontline infantry. He charges into battle on a Krieg steed called ES819 with a sabre drawn. He is so attached to this horse it has been brought back from the brink of death several times.</p>

<p>Dreir shares this diehard nature. Dreir is Tough To Kill with six wounds, a 4+ save, and a 4+ Invulnerable Save. In addition, his Leading the Charge ability gives melee attacks Devastating Wounds.</p>

Their Screening The Line ability allows them to reposition when a unit advances or falls back within 9 inches of them. When used effectively, this can set up devastating countercharges.</p>

<p>His men believe he is actually immortal, and given the grievous injuries he can shrug off and the units he has felled, can you blame them for that?</p>

<p>Of course the Death Korps of Krieg wouldn't be iconic if they didn't have artillery. The new <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> Astra Militarum army box has that in spades. Each team mans four massive cannons. Siege Cannons lobs D6 Strength 12 Rend -2 shells, great for blasting enemy units and artillery. The Multiple Rocket Launcher fires D6+3 Anti-Infantry+3 explosives, perfect for shredding ground units.</p>

<p>The <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> Astra Militarum Krieg army box will be available for pre-order this Saturday.</p>
