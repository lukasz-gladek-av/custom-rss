            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Paradox and&nbsp;<em>Vampire: The Masquerade&nbsp;</em>IP owner White Wolf&nbsp;have announced that&nbsp;<em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</em>'s Lasombra and Toreador clans will no longer be optional extra DLC for the game.</p>

<p>In the description of a new overview trailer, the two studios say that both clans "are confirmed for the base game at launch", and that this means all six playable clans will now be available for everyone rather than just those who pony up a little extra cash.</p>

<p><em>Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>executive producer and White Wolf executive VP Marco Behrmann says players' "frank feedback" has been heard, and that since that feedback made it clear Lasombra and Toreador should be included in the base game, "that is what we are doing".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-clans-paywall-shooting.jpg?itok=imC_aknQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-clans-paywall-shooting.jpg?itok=TFp_tuwS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Bloodlines 2</em>'s Toreador and Lasombra clans will no longer be behind a paywall.</figcaption></figure><p>It was first revealed that two clans would be hidden behind a paywall <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-sucks-youll-have-to-pay-for-two-clans-in-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">back in August</a>, quickly prompting an outcry, especially given that the add-on required to unlock both clans would have set you back an extra $22.</p>

<p>Honestly, this feels like a great time to ask why it was so easy for Paradox and White Wolf to remove the paywall on both clans. It's almost as though it was arbitrarily added to make the studios a bit of extra money in the first place, but hey, what do I know?</p>

<p>Of course, if you are desperate to pay some extra money on top of the fee you're already coughing up for <i>Bloodlines 2</i>, there will still be some DLC you can grab at launch, namely two story packs that are included as part of the expansion pass every game must now have.</p>

<p>The Loose Cannon and The Flower &amp; The Flame story packs won't be released until next year, but you will get the Santa Monica Memories Cosmetic Pack on day one, so, well, there's that, I suppose.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</em>, it's the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-october-2025" rel="nofollow">long-awaited</a> (and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-yet-again" rel="nofollow">oft-delayed</a>) followup to the cult 2004 action RPG. The game was originally being worked on by Hardsuit Labs before a developer switch to&nbsp;<em>Dear Esther&nbsp;</em>studio The Chinese Room was announced&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-back-developed-by-chinese-room" rel="nofollow">in 2023</a>.</p>

<p><em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>is set to launch on October 21st for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/532790/Vampire_The_Masquerade__Bloodlines_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10007767/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/9pf9rkwb9b50" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

      <div><p>Paizo's recent crowdfunding project, <em>Pathfinder Quest</em>, is a runaway hit on Backerkit. The board game, which promises an authentic GM-less version of the fantasy TTRPG experience, was fully funded in just 90 minutes and has been steadily reaching stretch goals since going live.</p>



<p>According to the campaign page, <a href="https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/paizo-inc/pathfinder-quest" rel="nofollow"><em>Pathfinder Quest</em></a> is a cooperative board game designed for 1-4 players. Like the beloved <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/pathfinder" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Pathfinder</em></a> TTRPG, players can create their own characters, choosing their ancestry, class, and abilities. Alternatively, they can play as pregenerated characters based on Iconics like Valeros, Harsk, and Ezren.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pathfinder-quest-game-contents.jpg?itok=slA2NMee 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pathfinder-quest-game-contents.jpg?itok=bBQOc4k4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Those characters will embark on a campaign spanning 12 possible adventures. These adventures will be packed with exploration, combat, and choices that will ripple throughout the multisession campaign. Each of these adventures is designed to last roughly two hours and strikes a balance between random dungeon crawls and a more curated, in-depth experience.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Pathfinder Quest</em> isn't a direct translation of the TTRPG. Dungeon navigation, combat, and leveling up are still present, but mechanics are more streamlined. Whenever an action is taken, you roll Quest Dice, which are D6s, and you refer to the game's Challenge Book to determine the results of your action. In addition, it appears damage is not represented as hit points, but as wound tokens.</p>

<p>The game is available in two editions. The standard edition contains everything you need to play. Dice, ability cards, various books, character and enemy standees, etc.. The second is the Backerkit-exclusive Deluxe Edition, which includes special variants of those game pieces and sculpted miniatures. These miniatures are perfectly scaled to work with existing Pathfinder miniatures for your home game.</p>

<p>The pledge levels for <em>Pathfinder Quest</em> are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Apprentice Adventurer for $100:</strong> A standard edition copy of the game, as well as any physical and digital stretch goals</li>
	<li><strong>Veteran Dungeoneer for $120:</strong> A deluxe edition copy of the game, as well as any physical and digital stretch goals</li>
	<li><strong>Dragon's Hoard for $240:</strong> A deluxe edition copy of the game, a unique set of magma dice by FanRoll, four player mats made by GameHead, A Hero Miniatures set by Titan Forge, and a Narrative Companion App by Forteller</li>
	<li>&nbsp;<strong>Miniature Menagerie for $450:</strong> A deluxe edition copy of the game, a Hero Miniatures Set, Early Encounter Creature Miniatures set, Late Encounter Creature Miniatures set, and Time Dragon miniature</li>
	<li><strong>Animal Companion for $1000:</strong> Collaborate with Paizo to create an Animal Companion Card based on your pet or an animal of your choosing. This includes a high-quality art print illustration and 20 copies of the Animal Companion Card to use in the game</li>
</ul><p>At the time of writing, the <em>Pathfinder Quest</em> campaign has raised&nbsp;<span data-controller="funding-counter" data-funding-counter-amount-value="256592" data-funding-counter-currency-value="$" data-funding-counter-target="amount" id="funding-counter-project-2656">$256,592, more than three times its initial funding goal of $75,000. This has unlocked several stretch goals for the campaign, including additional dice, new undead enemy miniatures, the Oracle class, and a treasure chest-shaped custom organizer for all game components as an optional add-on. The campaign ends on October 17.</span></p>
