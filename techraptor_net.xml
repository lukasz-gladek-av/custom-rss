            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hasbro-q3-2024-financial-report-cites-growth-for-magic-gathering-and-dungeons-dragons<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Hasbro Q3 2024 financial earnings report has been released. The report by one of the world's largest toy and game companies cites a decline in revenue alongside growth with their tabletop properties, specifically the new <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> set and the new <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> 2024 books.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://investor.hasbro.com/static-files/8150e0fd-4d0f-4f25-a904-639e74eb79c2">Hasbro Q3 2024</a> report, the company's revenue decline 15%. Excluding the divestiture of their film company eOne which produced the recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-honor-among-thieves-review-adaptation-that-understands-its-roots" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> movie</a>, that revenue decline becomes 9%.</p>

<p>But this doesn't mean Hasbro has lost money. In fact, <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> is marked as a standout in growth for this financial quarter, lead by the release of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/cutest-cards-we-pulled-from-magic-gathering-bloomburrow" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Bloomburrow</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/this-new-mechanic-is-magic-gathering-duskmourns-ultimate-weapon" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Duskmourn</em></a> sets and set to grow with the recently announced licensed <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-magic-gathering-marvel-crossover-details-revealed-including-new-secret-lair-and" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Marvel cards</a>.</p>

<p>The wildly popular card game's revenue has increased 3% behind growth in both tabletop and the digital platform <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-gathering-arena" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering Arena</em></a>.</p>

<p>As for <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, the Hasbro Q3 2024 report states the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-player-handbook-review-mixed-messaging-around-strong" rel="noopener" target="_blank">2024 Player's Handbook</a> is the fastest selling product in the fantasy TTRPG's 50-year history, beating plan by over 50%. This, combined with ongoing support for D&amp;D Beyond has lead to more than 19 million registered users on the digital platform alongside 60% increase in revenue.</p>

<p>Before this earnings report went live, Hasbro announced <a href="https://toybook.com/hasbro-organizational-changes-fall-2024/">sweeping organizational changes</a>. This "operational streamlining" of their staff included laying off 100 employees. Among those employees were four <a href="https://www.enworld.org/threads/hasbro-hit-with-layoffs-wizards-of-the-coast-impacted.707539/">from Wizards of the Coast</a>, including creator relations manager Dixon Dubow.</p>

<p>Overall, Hasbro has reported a year to date operating profit of $630 million with a $98 million dividend payout to their shareholders.</p>
