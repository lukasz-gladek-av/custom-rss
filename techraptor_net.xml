            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There are few moments in <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> quite as harrowing as when Gollum leads Sam and Frodo into the lair of Shelob, the horrifying Spider-like creature and offspring of Ungoliant who snares and webs the poor Hobbits. Games Workshop has sent us an all-new feature box called <em>Path of Cirith Ungol: Shelob &amp; Gollum</em> to check out, along with the newest Swan Knights of Dol Amroth. We checked out the sprues, so follow along for this first sneak peek!</p><h2>Path of Cirith Ungol: Shelob &amp; Gollum</h2><p>First up is this wonderful new box set, <em>Path of Cirith Ungol: Shelob &amp; Gollum</em>, which features Shelob and Gollum both in brand-new poses. It <em>also</em>, importantly, features a very sad figure: Frodo unconscious and tied up in Shelob's webbing! There was a previous box set called <a href="https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/shop/In-the-Clutches-of-Shelob?srsltid=AfmBOoozgrrsTynbK7AbMcfy7Y_WJAPrMEbmsRMxqsf1uTHGFOv3QJht" rel="nofollow"><em>In the Clutches of Shelob</em></a>, which included Shelob and Sam (with webbed up Frodo), but this new set swaps out Sam for Gollum.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>I love the new pose for Shelob included in this box set, which sees her crawling across a small crevasse of rocks, ready to strike. The previous model of Shelob had her rearing up on her hind legs, ready to strike. But this pose looks much more menacing, presenting her as the creeping terror she truly is.</p><p>Gollum also has another very gollum-y pose, perched on rocks and ready to strike (or scheme). This box set releases alongside a new book of scenarios all around Gollum, the Hobbits, and Shelob, entitled <em>The Treachery of Gollum</em>, which will present scenarios where players can reenact their favorite moments from the story.&nbsp;</p><p>From trying to steal the ring from a sleeping Frodo and Sam, to this pivotal confrontation with Shelob, there will be lots to explore.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>I wasn't able to get my hands on an advanced copy of this new book, so I can't speak to updated rules for the figures or the scenarios, but needless to say I'm thrilled for its eventual release in a few weeks.</p><p>As for poor ol' master Frodo, he'll be stuck in place in his webbing, with this model to be used as an objective marker in the Bravery of Master Samwise scenario found in the new book. Now let's take a closer look at how the figures come on the sprue.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/middle-earth-strategy-battle-game-path-of-cirith-ungol-shelob-and-gollum.jpeg?itok=SB6lG5Xk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1280" height="960">

  </picture><p>Looking over the assembly instructions, I appreciate the simplicity and straightforward nature of these sprues. The Shelob model, which could have been overly complicated, looks clean and streamlined, without the need to assemble five pieces per leg.</p><p>And Frodo simply couldn't look more pathetic on the sprue - don't you just want to swoop in and save the little guy?</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Swan Knights of Dol Amroth</h2><p>I don't know why, but Prince Imrahil is one of my favorite characters from <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, with very little time on the page (and no time in the films), he swoops in at the last minute with his Swan Knights to help save the day. Now, a new set of those very same Swan Knights are available from Games Workshop!</p><picture>

  </picture><p>Cast in resin, these will be trickier to assemble than plastic miniatures. I, for one, have no patience, and use super-glue and a quick-dry solvent spray to put them together immediately. But more practiced and careful builders love the flexibility that gluing with super glue gives you, and more power to them!</p><p>Let's dive into the sprues on these models and see what we're working with here.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The detailing on these knights is really quite incredible, I especially like their armor and plating, which sets them apart from other <em>Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game</em> men-at-arms by having a more regal, well-equipped look to them.&nbsp;</p><p>These are fighting men with the training and coin to come to the battlefield ready to deliver a decisive blow (or at least <em>help</em> deliver that decisive blow).</p><picture>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has announced a new Secret Lair superdrop for <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>. The new Secret Lair: Rad Superdrop brings in more cards from Bethesda's post-apocalyptic sci-fi franchise, <em>Fallout</em>.</p><h2>The <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Secret Lair: Rad Superdrop Announcement</h2><p>In an official <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/secret-lair-rad-superdrop" rel="nofollow">announcement post</a>, Wizards of the Coast detailed four drops of cards as part of the Secret Lair: Rad Superdrop. These four drops will focus on different elements and facets of the <em>Fallout</em> series.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The first drop, <em>Secret Lair x Fallout: Beyond Vault 33</em>, focuses entirely on the <em>Fallout</em> TV Show on Prime Video. This drop will contain six cards. Three of these cards are original designs featuring the show's leads: Lucy, The Ghoul, and Maximus. The other three are equipment cards, <em>Pre-War Formalwear</em>, <em>Spirit Mantle</em>, and <em>T-45 Power Armor</em> reimagined as <em>T-60 Power Armor</em>.</p><p>Notably, this drop is the first Secret Lair made available on Amazon. This is most likely an extension of marketing for the show's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/fallout-season-two-doesnt-just-go-to-new-vegas-it-builds-on-it" rel="nofollow">second season</a>.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>For dog lovers, the <em>Secret Lair x Fallout: Greet The Dog</em> drop is for you. This drop contains five cards, featuring artwork of the most loyal pup in the post-apocalyptic wasteland. The drop contains the following:</p><ul><li data-list-item-id="ee9f19ef828879ce874bd6471eb75c698"><em>Yoshimaru, Ever Faithful</em> as "<em>Dogmeat, Constant Companion</em>"</li><li data-list-item-id="ed9b77cbdac11aa9f7ae3c40d8d3375c3"><em>Arcane Signet</em></li><li data-list-item-id="e3eedaf10bbb77436594fd74452b110f4"><em>Lightning Greaves</em></li><li data-list-item-id="e621aee5bdd15f1acfe012e0ae6fbb2de"><em>Patchwork Banner</em></li><li data-list-item-id="ea03b03b1666842cf9421234dc0632f8c"><em>Sol Ring</em></li></ul><picture>

  </picture><p>The third drop in the Secret Lair: Rad Superdrop is aptly titled <em>Secret Lair x Fallout: Rad</em>. This drop of cards focuses on the more outlandish sci-fi elements of the series. This includes the Nightkin Supermutants, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/fallout-76" rel="nofollow"><em>Fallout 76's</em></a> Mothman, and the bizarre mutations brought on by wasteland radiation. The cards contained are as follows:</p><ul><li data-list-item-id="e2469fca0265aba744ca5d0ba2520d077"><em>Ripples of Potential</em></li><li data-list-item-id="e36faab575ad75118607da1a970016ac7"><em>Mutational Advantage</em></li><li data-list-item-id="ea83bcb79d7732bcdf7614b816d9e0a24"><em>The Wise Mothman</em></li><li data-list-item-id="e27fdc1470fbfee69d52d33a462492152"><em>Mindcrank</em></li><li data-list-item-id="ea0f5683831427994ccf444ee312b4538"><em>Mesmeric Orb </em>as<em> "Mothman Egg"</em></li></ul><picture>

  </picture><p>Lastly, drop number four spotlights the fan-favorite <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/fallout-new-vegas" rel="nofollow"><em>Fallout: New Vegas</em></a>. The drop, <em>Secret Lair x Fallout: Welcome to New Vegas</em>, is more standard fare. Older <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> cards featuring Fallout-themed artwork and card names. Humorously enough, one of those repurposed cards comes from the official <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> set, <em>Adventures in the Forgotten Realms</em>. The five cards included are as follows:</p><ul><li data-list-item-id="eec7a5947c4270ff88347a1b1596c0954"><em>Tinybones, Trinket Thief </em>as<em> "Benny, Platinum Thief"</em></li><li data-list-item-id="e3e3f4a246eb819530a385640dad2983f"><em>Isshin, Two Heavens as One </em>as <em>"Joshua Graham, Burned Man"</em></li><li data-list-item-id="ecc2730b05d38587ef5b017ff7fc6d442"><em>The Deck of Many Things </em>as<em> "Custom Caravan Deck"</em></li><li data-list-item-id="e2b87ac5cfb30eb2f224f832196def83c"><em>Caged Sun </em>as<em> "The Platinum Chip"</em></li><li data-list-item-id="e0b66ae422782ab664f4bdc9bc75c3f81"><em>Nuka-Cola Vending Machine </em>as<em> "Sunset Sasparilla Machine"</em></li></ul><p>Pre-orders for the Secret Lair: Rad Superdrop will go live on January 26, 2026. <em>Beyond Vault 33</em> is available in non-foil at an MSRP of $39.99 and foil at an MSRP of $49.99. The other drops are available in non-foil at an MSRP of $29.99 and foil at an MSRP of $39.99. For those with deep pockets, any purchase above $149 will get a <em>Silver Shroud Costume</em> promo card at no additional cost while supplies last.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
