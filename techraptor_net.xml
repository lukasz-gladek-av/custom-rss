            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-mans-sky-relics-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hello Games has released another new&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>update, and this one's all about the past; you'll be unearthing bones, assembling fossils, and doing battle with giant stone guardians.</p>

<p>The Relics update follows on from previous updates like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-mans-sky-worlds-part-2-update" rel="nofollow">Worlds</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-mans-sky-orbital-update" rel="nofollow">Orbital</a>, and like those updates, this one's pretty substantial. Its main addition is the ability to "design and assemble complete skeletons from your collection of ancient bones".</p>

<p>According to Hello Games, you'll be able to "imagine how ancient alien creatures might have looked, and re-assemble their bodies from their fossilized remains". There will also be "millions of possibilities for unique species" that you can assemble.</p>

<p>A new Expedition will also see you signing up with the Galactic Paleology Society to "recreate ancient lifeforms and uncover secrets". If you've been waiting for a chance to discover the kind of creatures that inhabited&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky</em>'s countless planets in the past, this update is for you.</p>

<p>Once you've assembled fossil exhibits, you can then visit Fossil Collectors aboard Space Stations in order to sell your creations or trade bones for other fossils.</p>

<p>Of course, this being a&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>update, you will also find tons of other new features and things to look forward to. You can read the update's full patch notes, as well as a rundown of its more significant features, <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/relics-update/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>.</p>




<p>The Relics update continues Hello Games' quest to turn&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>into the most comprehensive space survival sim ever, and it's admirable just how focused on the game's ongoing development the studio still is all these years later.</p>

<p><em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/275850/No_Mans_Sky/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/no-mans-sky/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/no-mans-sky/BQVQTL3PCH05" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/no-mans-sky-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.
