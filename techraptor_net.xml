Darrington Press' highly anticipated fantasy TTRPG, set to release sometime this year, will have the support of one of the industry's largest VTT platforms and professional GM services.</p>

<h2>The <em>Daggerheart</em> Launch Event Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, Roll20 and StartPlaying have put together an extensive <em>Daggerheart</em> launch event. StartPlaying has provided over 150 officially vetted Game Masters with advance copies of the <em>Daggerheart</em> Core Rulebook via the Demiplane Nexus. This means once the TTRPG launches, those wanting to experience it as intended can do so through StartPlaying.</p>

The entire launch month of Daggheart will be packed with exclusive online game sessions hosted by StartPlaying. Registration for these gaming tables are limited, so if you are a fan of Critical Role or have been enjoying the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/daggerheart-13-playtest-available-now" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">past playtests</a> of the game, it is best to register now while you can.</p>

<p>The press confirmed that the Daggerheart Demiplane Nexus will offer everything needed to play the game. This will include a digital reader, compendium, character builder, and GM tools. Furthermore, courtesy of the new <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/official-roll20-demiplane-integration-feature-is-now-in-beta" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">platform integration</a> feature, these tools will be completely compatible with Roll20.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“This is an incredible opportunity for fans who have been eagerly awaiting Daggerheart’s release," said Jayme Boucher, Senior Marketing Manager at Roll20, the parent company of Demiplane. "Being able to learn and enjoy a brand-new TTRPG on launch day with professional GMs is not a typical day one experience, but it’s one that Roll20, StartPlaying, and Darrington Press are delighted to offer the community.”</p>
