            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dragon Quest&nbsp;</em>creator Yuji Horii has been recognized by the Japanese government with its third-highest state honor, becoming the first video game designer to be recognized in this way.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/dragon-quest-designer-yuji-horii-becomes-first-game-designer-named-in-japans-autumn-honors/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">VGC</a>, Horii has received the Order of the Rising Sun, which is only third to the Order of the Chrysanthemum and the Order of the Paulownia Flowers in terms of Japanese state recognition. These two honors are usually reserved for politicians and statespeople.</p>

<p>Despite Japan's rich and illustrious video game history, Horii is the first designer from his industry to be awarded the Order of the Rising Sun. Let's hope he serves as a precedent for more designers and developers to be awarded the honor.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest&nbsp;</em>series began all the way back in 1986, and since then, it has seen eleven mainline entries released, as well as plenty of spinoffs and tie-in media.</p>

<p>The earliest entries in the series are also the most recent thanks to a spate of remakes in Square Enix's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/trademark-for-octopath-travelers-hd-2d-filed-by-square-enix" rel="nofollow">trademark HD-2D visual style</a>, with the latest,&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em>, launching just last week.</p>

<p>Discounting those, however, the latest mainline&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest&nbsp;</em>game remains 2017's&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest XI: Echoes of an Elusive Age</em>, although&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest XII&nbsp;</em>is currently in development, along with a newly-revealed remake of the seventh main game in the series.</p>




<p>As well as creating&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest</em>, Horii is also known for his work on&nbsp;<em>Chrono Trigger</em>, having served as one of the writers and designers on the iconic 1995 RPG.</p>

<p>Horii is also the writer and designer of&nbsp;<em>The Portopia Serial Murder Case</em>, an influential 1983 game that served as one of the first ever visual novel adventure games. It was followed by&nbsp;<em>The Hokkaido Serial Murder Case: The Okhotsk Disappearance</em>, which got itself <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2920390/The_Hokkaido_Serial_Murder_Case_The_Okhotsk_Disappearance_Memories_in_Ice_Tearful_Figurine/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a remake just last year</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rockstar, the studio behind the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, has been accused of union-busting after firing a number of employees who were purportedly involved in union activity.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-31/-grand-theft-auto-studio-accused-of-union-busting-after-firings" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a>, Rockstar fired between 30 and 40 employees late last week. According to a spokesperson for the UK's Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB), all of the fired employees were either members of the IWGB or were attempting to organize.</p>

<p>IWGB president Alex Marshall called the firings "one of the most blatant and ruthless acts of union busting in the history of the games industry" and accused Rockstar of holding "flagrant contempt for the law and for the lives of the workers who bring in their billions".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rockstar-union-busting-allegations-gta-6.jpg?itok=6B9rf7dm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rockstar-union-busting-allegations-gta-6.jpg?itok=36sDyfnI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>GTA 6&nbsp;</em>studio Rockstar has been accused of union-busting by the UK's IWGB union.</figcaption></figure><p>Rockstar parent company Take-Two claimed that the layoffs were due to "gross misconduct" on the part of the employees, and that the company "fully support[s] Rockstar's ambitions and approach". No further explanation was given regarding the nature of said "gross misconduct".</p>

<p>Of course, Rockstar isn't the only company to be accused of anti-union activity (although I'm sure that won't come as much comfort for the studio). It joins the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activision-blizzard-accused-of-trying-to-stifle-albany-union" rel="nofollow">Activision</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-accused-of-anti-union-practices-in-nlrb-complaint" rel="nofollow">Nintendo</a>, both of whom have had their union policies called into question.</p>

<p>Despite major companies' best efforts, studios and workers continue to unionize, with developers like&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/disco-elysium-zaum-union" rel="nofollow">ZA/UM</a>&nbsp;and Blizzard workers on games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-overwatch-union" rel="nofollow">Overwatch</a>&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/world-of-warcraft-blizzard-union" rel="nofollow">World of Warcraft</a>&nbsp;</i>forming unions in the last couple of years.</p>

<p>Rockstar's layoffs come as excitement reaches fever pitch regarding&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-released-early-following-leak-coming-in-2025" rel="nofollow">officially unveiled back in December 2023</a>. The game, which is currently scheduled for release on May 26th next year, will mark the first mainline&nbsp;<em>GTA&nbsp;</em>entry in almost 13 years.</p>




<p>We'll have to wait and see whether&nbsp;<em>GTA 6&nbsp;</em>lives up to expectations, although I think it'd probably need to somehow cure all known diseases and solve world hunger to do that. Stay tuned for more.</p>
