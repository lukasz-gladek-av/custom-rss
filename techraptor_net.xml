            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic's Tim Sweeney has revealed that Google has made what he calls an "awesome" proposal to open up the Android operating system, thus setting the stage for a potential burying of the hatchet (if you'll forgive the mixed metaphors).</p>

<p>Speaking <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1985920786545123613" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on X</a> earlier today, Sweeney said the proposal would "double down on Android's original vision as an open platform" by streamlining "competing store installs", reducing developer service fees on the Play Store, and enabling third-party "in-app and web payments".</p>

<p>Sweeney goes on to describe this proposal as a "comprehensive solution" which he contrasts against Apple's "model of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-apple-500-million-euro-fine" rel="nofollow">blocking all competing stores</a> and leaving payments as the only vector for competition".</p>

He says the proposal is aimed at "expanding developer choice and flexibility, lowering fees, and encouraging more competition all while keeping users safe".</p>

<p>Samat goes as far as to say that if the proposal is approved in court, it would "resolve [Epic and Google's] litigations", so if the proposal goes through, it'll mark an end to the protracted legal battle that began all those years ago.</p>

<p>Epic and Google's battle started in 2020, when&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-sues-google-over-fortnites-removal-from-play-store" rel="nofollow">removed from the Play Store</a>&nbsp;after Epic attempted to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-slashes-up-to-20-off-purchases-on-all-platforms" rel="nofollow">bypass Android's proprietary payment system</a> in order to offer direct discounts on several in-game purchases.</p>

<p>In response, Epic sued Google (as well as Apple, who took similar measures), leading to a lengthy court battle in which Epic accused both companies of holding a mobile duopoly and discouraging competition.</p>




<p>The proposals must now be approved by US District Judge James Donato, who's presiding over the Epic vs. Google case. According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/google-proposes-app-store-reforms-settlement-with-fortnite-maker-epic-games-2025-11-05/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Reuters</a>, Donato is scheduled to meet with lawyers for "a previously scheduled hearing" tomorrow, so the new proposals may be discussed then. Stay tuned for more.</p>
