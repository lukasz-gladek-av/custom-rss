            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/powerwash-simulator-wallace-gromit-dlc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix and FuturLab have revealed a brand new&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator&nbsp;</em>crossover DLC, and this time around, it's beloved Aardman animation&nbsp;<em>Wallace &amp; Gromit</em>'s time to shine.</p>

<p>As revealed in a brand new trailer, the<em>&nbsp;PowerWash Simulator Wallace &amp; Gromit&nbsp;</em>DLC will take you to the iconic 62 West Wallaby Street to clean some of the absent-minded inventor's most prized possessions, as well as the likes of Gromit's kennel and more.</p>

<p>The DLC's new Steam page promises to take you "from charming British suburbs to cheesy celestial bodies", so it sounds like you'll be able to visit the moon from the duo's inaugural adventure&nbsp;<em>A Grand Day Out</em>. Cracking!</p>

<p>It might stand a chance of being the strangest, but this <i>PowerWash Simulator Wallace &amp; Gromit&nbsp;</i>DLC is far from the game's first crossover.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It joins the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/powerwash-simulator-shrek-dlc-release-date" rel="nofollow"><em>Shrek</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/powerwash-simulator-back-to-future-dlc" rel="nofollow"><em>Back to the Future</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/powerwash-simulator-final-fantasy-vii-crossover-dlc-arrives-in-march" rel="nofollow"><em>Final Fantasy VII</em></a>, and, of course,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/powerwash-simulator-warhammer-40k-dlc" rel="nofollow"><em>Warhammer 40k</em></a>, all of which have offered up their various vestiges and objects for&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator</em>&nbsp;to hose down.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we don't yet have a release date for the&nbsp;<em>Wallace &amp; Gromit&nbsp;</em>pack, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3077590/PowerWash_Simulator__Wallace__Gromit_Special_Pack/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wishlist it on Steam here</a> if you want to keep up with it.</p>




<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator</em>, well, I'm sure you can guess what it is, but in case you need a refresher, it's a work sim-style game in which you must hose down various unclean locations and objects.</p>

<p>Playing either by yourself or alongside your friends, you can clean dirt from interiors and exteriors alike, taking satisfaction in a job well done. It's very much a relaxing, combat-free experience, unless you count the battle of water versus dirt as combat.</p>

<p><em>PowerWash Simulator&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1290000/PowerWash_Simulator/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/powerwash-simulator/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/powerwash-simulator/9NHDJC0NW20M" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/powerwash-simulator-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.
