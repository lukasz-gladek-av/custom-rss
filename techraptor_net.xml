            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/japanese-nintendo-switch-eshop-payment-crackdown<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced that starting later this year, you'll no longer be able to use overseas-issued payment cards or PayPal accounts in order to pay for content from the Japanese Switch eShop.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://support.nintendo.com/jp/information/2025/0130.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">notice</a> on the Japanese Nintendo website (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/switchs-japan-eshop-will-no-longer-accept-foreign-cards-or-paypal-to-prevent-fraudulent-use/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">VGC</a>), the gaming giant says that in order to "prevent fraudulent use" (we're using machine translation for the post, which is originally in Japanese", overseas-issued cards and PayPal accounts will be banned.</p>

<p>It looks as though PayPal accounts opened in Japan, as well as Japan-issued credit cards, will still be valid. Unfortunately, though, if you've been using the Japanese eShop from outside Japan, it looks like you might have to find a new payment method.</p>

<p>Nintendo's reference to "fraudulent" behavior might be a veiled nod to this practice; it might seem relatively harmless to me, but Nintendo is well-known for what could charitably called <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-lawsuit-patents-demands-nintendo" rel="nofollow">"fiercely protecting its products"</a>, so I wouldn't be surprised if that was the reasoning.</p>

<p>So, what does this mean for you if you're a frequent user of the Japanese eShop? Well, it means you'll need to find some way of using a Japan-issued payment method if you want to continue, unfortunately.</p>

<p>This decision shouldn't affect your country's native eShop, and it also likely won't change anything if you're already using a Japanese payment method to access the eShop.</p>

<p>We still don't know what kind of specs the machine will have, though; we'll have to wait until April's forthcoming Nintendo Direct in order to learn that.</p>

<p>Still, with a new device coming, perhaps it's no wonder Nintendo is tightening its rules a little. Stay tuned for more. In the meantime, the Japanese eShop payment crackdown takes effect on March 25th.</p>
