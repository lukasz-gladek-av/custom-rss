            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Critical Role has appointed a new General Manager for their streaming platform, Beacon. The beloved media entertainment studio's newly appointed member, Alyssa Zeisler, has plans for the future of the platform and its style of TTRPG entertainment.</p><h2>Alyssa Zeisler's Appointment as General Manager of Beacon</h2><p>&nbsp;In an official press release, Alyssa Zeisler will oversee various elements of the Beacon streaming platform. These include product roadmaps, content and platform strategy, building the platform as a community hub, creator-led ecosystem, and central destination for Critical Role and TTRPG content.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>Business wise, Zeisler's appointment is a savvy choice. She is a veteran digital media and product executive with a respectable track record handling scaling subscription, platforms, and bringing savvy strategy to legacy media brands. Her previous position was Vice President of Product of Hallmark media, where she helped launch the Hallmark+ membership platform.</p><blockquote><p>“My goal for Beacon is to make it the gold standard for direct-to-consumer platforms,” said Alyssa Zeisler, General Manager of Beacon. “It’s a place where we can experiment with new formats in the TTRPG space while creating a seamless experience for fans. We’re building the blueprint for how a community-led brand transitions into a sustainable, global media company, and I’m excited to be at the helm as we evolve this ecosystem into something truly industry-defining.”</p></blockquote><p>The appointment of Alyssa Zeisler to Beacon is a sensible decision on behalf of Critical Role. The Beacon platform has showcased many different actual play series such as the ongoing <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-campaign-4-trailer-introduces-us-to-land-of-araman" rel="nofollow">Campaign 4</a> DM'd by Brennan Lee Mulligan, and the upcoming <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-and-titmouse-announces-new-actual-play-draw-your-weapons" rel="nofollow">Draw Your Weapons</a> and has continued to grow alongside Critical Role as a media brand.</p><p>That media brand has included their tabletop branch, Darrington Press, the developer of the fantasy RPG <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/darrington-press-announces-daggerheart-hope-fear-its-first-official-expansion" rel="nofollow"><em>Daggerheart</em></a>, two Prime Video animated shows, and a partnership AdHoc Studio's superhero adventure game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dispatch-sales-3m-stats-adhoc" rel="nofollow"><em>Dispatch</em></a>.</p><p>With that growth comes with the demands of long-term strategy. In this case, Zeisler's strategy for Beacon is to grow the platform as a fan-first membership experience, all while supporting Critical Role's long-term vision for sustainable, meaningful, expansion.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p dir="ltr"><em>Resident Evil</em> returns to its roots in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/resident-evil-9-requiem-closed-door-presentation-shows-classic-re-puzzles-and" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="33eaca7a-990f-42da-a131-81cbcae617b8" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Resident Evil Requiem</em></a>, introducing a new protagonist to crawl around a spooky building in a more classic approach to <em>Resident Evil</em>, while also giving the fans what they want in the return of Leon. Just how well does the story work around multiple gameplay styles, while also telling the latest story of zombie terrors and bioweapons?</p><p dir="ltr">The game opens with FBI agent Grace Ashcroft investigating a strange series of murders where the corpses that have appeared are all showing strange signs of bruising and bleeding. With the latest of these bodies being found in the same hotel where her mother, Alyssa Ashcroft, was murdered. Grace follows the trail, not realizing it was a trap to bring her to Rhodes Hill Care Center.</p><p dir="ltr">While Grace's investigation is taking place, Leon isn't too far behind, following up after the deaths of a handful of survivors of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/resident-evil-20-years-later" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="cbe64463-3b9a-42c5-9a0c-c274b905de74" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">original Raccoon City</a> outbreak, which leads him to Dr. Victor Gideon, the man in charge of Rhodes Hill Care Center.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2 dir="ltr">The Focus Of <em>Resident Evil Requiem's</em> Story Shifts With The Playable Character</h2><p dir="ltr">Throughout the story, the game relies heavily on the idea that while Grace is competent in her own right, the reality of getting thrown into a horror story with hulking monstrous creatures and zombies roaming the hallways has her looking for a way to get out asap. Along the way, other secrets crop up, including a blind girl locked away and a mysterious keyword that continues to pop up.</p><p dir="ltr">Leon's story, while still tense, follows a more action-forward focus as his story is less about exploration and more about completing his mission and getting to the bottom of the work that Dr. Gideon is doing.</p><p dir="ltr">Some of the elements of the story that I enjoyed the most were how much there was a focus on exploration and learning about Rhode Hill from environmental clues and documents, the intrigue surrounding the events of the story, and how intelligently paced the story was swapping between Grace and Leon.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/resident-evil-requiem-puzzles.jpg?itok=5HzQ9P8- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/resident-evil-requiem-puzzles.jpg?itok=pLJg5u_V 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p dir="ltr">Grace's gameplay is similar to that of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/resident-evil-7-biohazard-review-groovy" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1a560db9-346a-4407-98cb-00ff8b36ed59" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Resident Evil 7</em></a> and <em>8</em>: you're a fish out of water making your way through unfamiliar territory. Exploration is promoted as a way for you to obtain additional resources, while also not trying to kick the zombified hornet's nest and get yourself stuck in a worse situation.</p><p dir="ltr">While there were a few puzzles, those that were of note were all part of the primary story. Don't expect to be doing too much to go out of your way to get side-items, but the things that you do find, like Antique Coins in safes, are definitely worth tracking down.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Inventory Management Had Me Hording</h2><p dir="ltr">Coupled with this is an incredibly limited inventory, starting out at just 8 slots, two to three of which are pretty much always going to be occupied by a gun, some extra ammo, and a makeshift shiv.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/resident-evil-requiem-grace-inventory.jpg?itok=qZ5gB2Qo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/resident-evil-requiem-grace-inventory.jpg?itok=KKk6AwqM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p dir="ltr">From the central hub chamber of Rhodes Hill, you are met with a large locked door that requires three specific items to open the door, allowing you to get free. You can obtain these by working your way through the various rooms and tight hallways of the Care Center, obtaining access to different restricted areas of the building, and doing your fair share of running away from monstrosities.</p><p dir="ltr">First setting foot in the Care Center, the environment was tense, I found myself creeping EVERYWHERE and picking up everything I possibly could. The limited inventory definitely stressed me out and resulted in me yoyoing from where I was in the mansion back to the save room and the item chest.</p><p dir="ltr">While it was frustrating to spend so much time going back and forth, I couldn't help but also appreciate that if I had been able to carry every weapon, charm, bottle, piece of ammo, and molotov cocktail I picked up, the environment would just not be the same.</p><h2 dir="ltr">The Pacing Was Perfect</h2><p dir="ltr">An aspect of <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> that I absolutely loved was the pacing. As I stated above, the settings were tense as Grace was skulking through new hallways, until I knew the layout and I knew the locations of just about every zombie and obstacle. At the point the feeling of safety kicked in and I was far more spirited about my actions… that's when the setting would change.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/resident-evil-requiem-stealth.jpg?itok=XBdHk51_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/resident-evil-requiem-stealth.jpg?itok=SzuB-1IT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p dir="ltr">Either a new location would be unlocked, or embarked upon, or perhaps that would be the moment that we'd switch to Leon in a bit more of a 'high action' scenario. After getting that action back out of my system, we'd return to Grace, scared in the dark once again, and it would completely reset my fear while playing.</p><p dir="ltr">This reset of the tone also tended to go hand in hand with major plot moments and reveals. Just as Leon discovered something important about Grace, you'd cut away, having to push forward to learn more.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Leon's Gameplay Finds A Sweet Spot Between Action and Horror</h2><p dir="ltr">Unlike Grace's gameplay, focusing on light stealth and puzzle solving, Leon's is more about making your way to an objective through a decent-sized horde or just one really massive Zombie. <em>Resident Evil</em> fans will immediately recognize the change in gameplay as your inventory blooms from 8 slots to a full briefcase of storage.</p><p dir="ltr">Accompanying the action-forward gameplay was also a number of larger boss fights, which normally consist of a running section where Leon needs to charge through doorways, leaping over and under obstacles, for fear of instant death, that then ends in an intricate arena. Here you'll find a way to put some distance between yourself and the opponent before turning around and trying to fill them with the most powerful bullets you have at your disposal.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/resident-evil-requiem-leon-boss.jpg?itok=aCL2Jy-m 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/resident-evil-requiem-leon-boss.jpg?itok=0kcci7RB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p dir="ltr">While formulaic, these fights did up the tension for Leon a fair bit, and served as good high points of progress for him. For the most part, Leon's gameplay leans far more into the fear of the zombies in numbers overpowering you than experiencing one tense zombie encounter at a time.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><em>Resident Evil Requiem's</em> Lighting Is A Paid Actor</h2><p dir="ltr">The game wouldn't be anywhere near as spooky without the incredible locations and just how good the RE Engine's lighting systems are.</p><p dir="ltr">You've got everything you expect out of <em>Resident Evil's</em> locations: a creepy old mansion, decrepit basements, apocalyptic cityscapes, and pristine laboratories. While it was the first time seeing many of these places, the DNA of <em>Resident Evil</em> from the original game ran deep.</p><p dir="ltr">When in those darker locations, the unpowered hallways and basements, the light shines just enough to reveal the features, but lets you lose context as the light trails off. Catching portions of chain fences, bannisters, or other obstructions, I'd catch the shifting light in the corner of my eye, jumping that a zombie might be nearby.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/resident-evil-requiem-laboratory.jpg?itok=POcXUYH2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/resident-evil-requiem-laboratory.jpg?itok=L7fynGNO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p dir="ltr">Moments I loved, and also hated, were when whatever large creature you were hiding from couldn't be seen in the dark aside from the silhouette cast from the light behind them. No features, just a dark, skulking form that you were hoping wouldn't notice you.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> Promotes Replayability, Even If It's The Same Story</h2><p dir="ltr">As is to be expected with <em>Resident Evi</em>l, as you complete the game, you'll get access to a harder difficulty mode, and the chance to replay the story with some of the items you already unlocked in your arsenal.</p><p dir="ltr">Each Achievement or Trophy completed translates to points you can use to purchase unique weapons, and the harder ones can even give you items that will make completing the game on a harder difficulty just a bit easier if you don't want the full challenge.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/resident-evil-requiem-map-exploration.jpg?itok=I1-x3XW3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p dir="ltr">I'm a big fan of Achievements and Trophies being used as a way to push a player to complete a game in a wholly unique way. Beating it in a certain amount of time, beating it without using healing items, etc. While it's still the same plot and story beats on each replay, there are equipment and goals that will make the way you take that journey just slightly different each time.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2><p dir="ltr"><em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> successfully threads the needle between the gameplay of Grace with a focus on <em>Resident Evil 7</em> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/resident-evil-village" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7d76fc24-612e-4e7e-9804-64ccee40af28" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Village</em></a>-style exploration and combat, and a more action-packed story suited for a modern-day Leon (without falling into the territory of <em>Resident Evil 6</em>). There's plenty for new and old fans of <em>Resident Evil</em> to get into with this focus on a new character that might also prompt them to explore some of the rest of Resident Evil's latest remake offerings.</p><p dir="ltr">Fans of the direction that <em>Resident Evil </em>has been on will have an excellent time hopping into the latest adventure, fighting for their lives while uncovering yet another secret plot.</p><hr><p><em><strong>Resident Evil Requiem </strong>was reviewed on PlayStation 5 with a copy provided by the publisher - All screenshots were taken by the reviewer over 15 hours of gameplay</em></p></div><div><p><span><div>
