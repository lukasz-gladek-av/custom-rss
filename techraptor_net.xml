<p>As FRVR points out, <em>Where Winds Meet</em>, an MMO released in November and published by NetEase, has generative AI woven into its DNA; it's in everything from NPC conversations to face generation and more.</p><p>Niko Partners research director Daniel Ahmad <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/2019051793125093813" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">also confirmed</a> that NetEase is still in favor of generative AI, citing a statement in which the company declares that the situation Suda51 describes "did not occur" and that NetEase has "not published any related policies".</p><p>Generative AI remains a hot topic when it comes to game development.

<figcaption>Will we see more of <em>Resident Evil Requiem </em>during tomorrow's Direct?</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You can expect to see info on a host of upcoming third-party Switch 2 games during the show; I'd be surprised if we didn't hear from the likes of <em>Resident Evil Requiem </em>and <em>Pragmata</em>, as well as potential wildcards like Square Enix's <em>The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</em>.</p><p>Given that it's set for a 2026 release, I'd also be shocked if we didn't hear something about <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-duskbloods-fromsoftware-nintendo-switch-2" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6f0c1798-c188-4c09-822f-c25a303f26bd" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">FromSoftware's upcoming multiplayer game <em>The Duskbloods</em></a>, especially in light of the fact that it's a Switch 2 exclusive that we still don't know too much about.</p><p>One game you definitely won't be hearing from during tomorrow's showcase is, of course, Take-Two and Gearbox's <em>Borderlands 4</em>. The two studios confirmed in a quarterly earnings report that development on the Switch 2 version of the looter-shooter <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/borderlands-4-switch-2-development-paused" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bf810aa2-cd2e-4c11-8d89-e7133b1a6a5b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">has been paused indefinitely</a>.</p><p>These shows almost always contain surprises of one kind or another, too, so there will almost certainly be games that we don't know about yet. If Nintendo wants to drum up hype for the Switch 2, that's a great way to do so (although <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-sales-nintendo-financials" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="74a7d6cd-352a-4ab9-b87d-a526929366dd" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">whether it needs to is another question!</a>).</p><figure role="group">

<p>Other Take-Two Switch 2 releases, like upcoming sports titles <em>PGA Tour 2K25 </em>and <em>WWE 2K26</em>, are unaffected, of course, but <em>Borderlands 4 </em>probably isn't going to be making an appearance on the console anytime soon.</p><p>Of course, given the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/borderlands-4-pc-performance-top-priority" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5688e820-72a9-4399-b5b3-7c667ee289da" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">well-documented performance woes</a> on PC (whatever <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/randy-pitchford-borderlands-4-performance-comments" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ee451f31-ff9e-4b56-9889-1f0581a00b2d" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Gearbox head Randy Pitchford might say</a>), it's not really a surprise that Take-Two doesn't seem to have been able to arrive at a satisfactory Switch 2 port for <em>Borderlands 4</em>.</p><p>This news was revealed alongside Take-Two's quarterly earnings report for the third quarter of the fiscal year, in which the company revealed its net bookings have grown by 28% compared to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gta-6-still-on-track-for-fall" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="181a935f-1c61-410f-b3d0-545f99839ba0" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">same period last year</a>.</p><p>Back then, CEO Strauss Zelnick was confident that upcoming juggernaut <em>Grand Theft Auto 6 </em>would arrive in a timely fashion in fall 2025, but as we now know, that proved to be a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-vi-release-date-delay" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fbc88268-1772-45bc-9881-7e2e1cd1ca6d" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">rather optimistic estimate</a> for the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-november-2026" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e57d7053-b3ca-42ed-afdb-4ef5c5958b99" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">release date</a>.</p><figure role="group">
