            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced three more SNES games making their way to the Nintendo Switch Online library, and if you're looking for more opportunities to spend time with some of the most iconic platforming mascots around (and Bubsy), then this one's for you.</p>

<p>As a quick reminder, unlike <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-klonoa-mr-driller" rel="nofollow">Game Boy Advance</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/forsaken-64-nintendo-switch-online" rel="nofollow">N64</a> games, SNES titles are available for everyone who subscribes to Nintendo Switch Online, regardless of whether you pick up an Expansion Pack addon or not.</p>

<p>The first game being introduced to the SNES lineup for Nintendo Switch Online this month is&nbsp;<em>Mario &amp; Wario</em>, a puzzler that has never been released in the West before. This one, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-paint-nintendo-switch-online" rel="nofollow">like <em>Mario Paint&nbsp;</em>before it</a>, comes complete with Joy-Con 2 mouse support as well (in fact, it's required to play).</p>

<p>The first of these two is the pun-tastic&nbsp;<em>Bubsy in: Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind</em>, a side-scrolling platformer which stars a mascot who, with the best will in the world, apparently refuses to die despite the industry's best efforts.</p>

<p>As&nbsp;<em>Bubsy&nbsp;</em>games go, this one probably isn't quite as offensive as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/bubsy-paws-on-fire-review-stop-making-bubsy-games" rel="nofollow">some of the little bobcat's other offerings</a>, which isn't a ringing endorsement, but hey - if you've exhausted all of the other Switch Online platformers, this one might kill an hour or two.</p>

<p>Finally, the last game to be added to the SNES contingent of Nintendo Switch Online this month is&nbsp;<em>Fatal Fury Special</em>, a one-on-one fighter that features the cast of&nbsp;<em>Fatal Fury 2</em>, plus new fighters to get to grips with.</p>




<p>It looks as though all three of these games are available to check out via Nintendo Switch Online right now, so if you're a member and you're interested, just fire up your console and you should be able to play them all.</p>
