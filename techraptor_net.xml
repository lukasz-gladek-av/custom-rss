            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-reach-4x-space-sim<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ex-Ubisoft and Creative Assembly staffer James Miller has announced&nbsp;<em>Stellar Reach</em>, a 4X space sim from his new studio Stelleas, and it's due to arrive on PC this September.</p>

<p>Per a press release, Miller intends&nbsp;<em>Stellar Reach&nbsp;</em>to be "as rewarding for genre veterans as it is approachable for newcomers", which is a hard sell; this is, after all, a famously complex genre, but perhaps Miller can truly straddle the line.</p>

<p>Miller and Stelleas promise "classic 4X gameplay across a real-scale, fully 3D star-system map", so if you're a fan of the likes of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/stellaris" rel="nofollow">Stellaris</a>&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sins-of-solar-empire-is-making-comeback-after-15-years" rel="nofollow"><em>Sins of a Solar Empire</em></a>, then you're probably going to dig this one as well.</p>

You can also look forward to three distinct victory paths: Supremacy, Prosperity, and Industrial Supremacy, which are all fairly self-explanatory.</p>

<p>There's also a "comprehensive research system" in the game, which will grant you access to six tech trees and shared technologies that enable "strategic synergy".</p>

<p>You'll be able to exploit 13 different resource types across&nbsp;<em>Stellar Reach</em>'s galaxy, and each will play "a crucial role in enhancing the effectiveness of your fleets, armies, and industries", according to Miller and Stelleas.</p>

<p><em>Stellar Reach&nbsp;</em>will also be taking place across "a fully 3D starfield", although whether or not that means the game will feature&nbsp;<em>Homeworld</em>-style Z-axis combat remains to be seen. I, for one, sure hope so.</p>




<p>It's fair to say the 4X space sim market isn't exactly barren; games like&nbsp;<em>Master of Orion</em>,&nbsp;<em>Galactic Civilization</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Endless Space&nbsp;</em>remain hugely popular among their fanbases, so Miller and Stelleas have some work to do if they want to dominate this particular galaxy.</p>

<p>We'll get to find out whether he can achieve this goal when&nbsp;<em>Stellar Reach&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2578670/Stellar_Reach/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, apparently sometime in September. Stay tuned for more.</p>
