            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/winkeltje-little-shop-followup-faire-trade-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Cozy shop sim&nbsp;<em>Winkeltje: The Little Shop&nbsp;</em>is getting a followup by the name of&nbsp;<em>Faire Trade</em>, and developer and publisher Sassybot's new game is coming to PC via Steam Early Access sometime later this year.</p>

<p>Sassybot says that while&nbsp;<em>Faire Trade&nbsp;</em>may bear a new name, it will have the "same charm of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/winkeltje-little-shop-10-update-finally-arrives" rel="nofollow">its predecessor</a>", as well as boasting "more depth and customisation options than ever before".</p>

<p>Just like in&nbsp;<em>Winkeltje</em>, you'll be running your own cozy little shop, and you'll grow it from humble beginnings into the lifeblood of a bustling fantasy town with plenty of repeat customers to get to know.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/faire-trade-winkeltje-followup-shop.jpg?itok=Sh5og0-D 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/faire-trade-winkeltje-followup-shop.jpg?itok=yICd1HQL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Faire Trade&nbsp;</em>asks you to manage your very own bustling fantasy shop (or perhaps that should be "shoppe").</figcaption></figure><p>Your goal in&nbsp;<em>Faire Trade&nbsp;</em>is to "stay ahead in a shifting economy" by selling everything your customers might need, "from fresh goods to enchanted armor". If you can imagine a less anime-styled&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/recettear-hd-2025" rel="nofollow"><em>Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale</em></a>, then you're probably not a million miles away.</p>

<p>Sassybot is also promising plenty of "eccentric" characters to meet in&nbsp;<em>Faire Trade</em>, each of whom will have their own "secrets" to uncover. You'll get to know them across shifting seasons, which will bring new challenges and new opportunities for your shop.</p>

<p>You'll also be able to create many of the items you're looking to sell, from forging armor yourself through to growing and sourcing your own fresh produce.</p>

<p>Of course, since this is a shop sim, you'll also need to pay attention to your balance sheets; you'll need to hire employees, make sure you're paying them fairly, and "make tough business decisions" in order to ensure the smooth day-to-day running of your store.</p>




<p><em>Faire Trade&nbsp;</em>launches on PC via Steam Early Access sometime later this year. Sadly, we don't have a more specific release date for the game than that, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2526560/Faire_Trade?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wishlist it on Steam here</a> if you want to keep up with its progress.</p>
