            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tango-gameworks-unique-games-krafton<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Hi-Fi Rush&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Ghostwire: Tokyo&nbsp;</em>developer Tango Gameworks has revealed that it's still looking to make "unique and interesting" games following its acquisition by&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>publisher Krafton earlier this year.</p>

<p>In an interview with Japanese news platform <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/681/G068145/20241212042/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">4Gamer</a> (with additional reporting and translation by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/tango-gameworks-will-continue-to-make-unique-games-after-acquisition-by-krafton-lead-devs-confirm/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Automaton Media</a>), Tango Gameworks execs Colin Mack, John Johanas, and Kazuaki Egashira discuss their studio's future and its approach to creativity.</p>

<p>As a reminder, Microsoft <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown" rel="nofollow">washed its hands</a> of Tango (alongside&nbsp;<em>Redfall&nbsp;</em>developer Arkane Austin) earlier this year, leading many to believe that the studio's days were done. However, Krafton then <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-acquires-tango-gameworks-and-hi-fi-rush-ip-with-plans-for-future-expansion" rel="nofollow">swept in</a> to purchase Tango Gameworks, as well as the <i>Hi-Fi Rush&nbsp;</i>IP.</p>

<p>That appears to be a sentiment echoed by Krafton itself, incidentally. Back in September, CEO Changhan Kim said he didn't think&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hi-fi-rush-2-krafton-ceo" rel="nofollow">would be a profitable endeavor</a>, but that his company wants to "try something new" and take risks, which is a rather refreshing outlook.</p>

<p>Johanas chips in by saying that he wants Tango to be somewhere people think of games as "their baby" rather than as "some task to be done", and Mack says Tango's goal is to continue to create "unique and interesting games" for the studio's fans.</p>

<p>In short, if you were worried that Krafton would transform Tango into a sequel mill or a DLC producer for&nbsp;<em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em>, then it looks like you needn't worry; the goal at the moment appears to be to let the studio retain its unique identity.</p>

<p>For now, though, rest assured that whatever Tango does next, it's likely to come out of leftfield in a similar way to their previous projects. Stay tuned for more.</p>
