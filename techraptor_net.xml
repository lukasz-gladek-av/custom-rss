            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Gun-fu action game <em>Spine </em>was supposed to get a release date this year, but, as you've probably already noticed if you're following its progress, that didn't happen. Now, developer and publisher Nekki has taken to social media to explain why.</p><p>In <a href="https://x.com/playspine/status/2005664237407145990" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">a message</a> on X, Nekki acknowledges that they promised to reveal a release date for <em>Spine </em>this year, but that the team wasn't "ready" to announce a date or even a rough window.</p><p>Nekki says that since <em>Spine </em>is the team's first PC and console game, the project is "setting a new bar for quality, scope, and production values", and that the team's top priorities are <em>Spine</em>'s "product quality and...overall gameplay experience".</p><figure role="group">

<p>Nekki says that <em>Spine </em>is now "entering the final stages of development", and that the team is currently polishing the game's "content, locations, animations, voice acting, and interface". Developer diaries will continue between now and whenever <em>Spine</em>'s release date ends up being.</p><p>Sadly, you're not going to get that date today, either; Nekki says the team doesn't want to "name a release date [it isn't] fully confident in", but that you'll be hearing the date "in the near future". Expect more in the new year.</p><p>If you're not familiar with <em>Spine</em>, Nekki describes it as "a single-player action game about close-quarters gunfights with aesthetics of Gun-Fu movies", so you can expect inspiration from the likes of <em>John Wick </em>and the <em>Matrix </em>movies, as well as games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/cyberpunk-2077" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c4cdcb94-eb27-4726-bc08-ac26ee9ad89e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></a><em> </em>and the tragically-dormant <em>Deus Ex </em>series.</p><p>The game casts you as "rebellious street artist Redline and her sentient combat implant Spine", and together, the two must battle an "autocratic AI regime". What else, after all, does one do in a cyberpunk setting?</p>
<p>When <em>Spine </em>does eventually launch, you'll be able to check it out on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1731290/SPINE__This_is_Gun_Fu/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch 2.
