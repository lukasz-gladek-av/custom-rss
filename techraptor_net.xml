            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/safe-and-sound-infinity-action-box-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Transportation accessories for wargaming are essential for taking your miniatures safely to a gaming club, tournament, or even a friend's house, and carry cases tend to fall into 1 of 2 types, foam or magnetized. Foam storage either has the miniatures sitting between two layers or has shapes in the foam that the miniatures sit in. Magnetic has metal in a part of it, and after attaching magnets to your miniatures, they'll sit securely on the metal plate in the carry case.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.safeandsound.pl/" rel="nofollow">Safe and Sound</a> decided that if you're going to the trouble of selecting and carrying a case, it might as well be useful once you get to your gaming area. The&nbsp;<em>Infinity</em> Action Box, once it's done the job of transporting your miniatures securely, also doubles as a piece of scenery during the game. In this article, we'll look at the <em>Infinity</em> Action Box, and see how many <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/infinity-operation-sandtrap-review-launch-of-infinity-n5" rel="nofollow">Infinity</a></em> miniatures we can get in it, and we'll also look at some of the larger magnetic boxes Safe and Sound offers.</p>

<p>The Safe and Sound<i> Infinity </i>Action Box is a magnetic miniatures transportation box, that also doubles as a scenery piece for your games. It's officially sanctioned by Corvus Belli, the makers of <em>Infinity</em>, so you'll see lots of Infinity markings all over it. The box also comes with a removable internal element that acts as walls if you want to use the case an internal building, and also a card shipping container.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/safe-and-sound-7.jpg?itok=ZFhw0xTF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/safe-and-sound-7.jpg?itok=cP020v99 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Safe and Sound <em>Infinity</em> Action Box comes in 3 types with different options (Photo Credit - Safe and Sound).</figcaption></figure><p>The <em>Infinity</em> Action Box comes in three different types.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>The standard <em>Infinity</em> Action Box&nbsp;with a magnetized base (this is the type we're reviewing in this article)</li>
	<li>The <em>Infinity</em> Action Box with a magnetized base and back plate</li>
	<li>The <em>Infinity</em> Action Box with a magnetized base and lid</li>
</ul><figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/safe-and-sound-2.jpg?itok=E6KXGhoo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/safe-and-sound-2.jpg?itok=42jzpQSm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>We nearly got all of our <em>Infinity</em> JSA miniatures in the Safe and Sound <em>Infinity</em> Action Box.</figcaption></figure><h2>How Many Miniatures Can The Safe And Sound Infinity Action Box Carry?</h2>

<p>As you can see in the image above, we got nearly our entire <em>Infinity</em> JSA collection into a single <em>Infinity</em> Action Box. That was 65 miniatures, including 5 on large bases. The only ones we couldn't get in were 2 bikes, 2 remotes, and the old&nbsp;O-Yoroi Kidobutai T.A.G. (which doesn't fit in the box standing up and needs to be laid down). If we had the box with the magnetized back plate or lid, we could have easily put these in as there was loads of space above the standard units in the larger area.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/safe-and-sound-3.jpg?itok=gh0sZP3S 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/safe-and-sound-3.jpg?itok=WfdQfzCn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Once your miniatures are magnatised, the Safe and Sound <em>Infinity</em> Action Box keeps them secure during movement.</figcaption></figure><p>The <em>Infinity</em> Action Box also held the miniatures securely when sideways or upside down, the magnets holding well to the metal plate. To magnetize your miniatures, pick up some&nbsp;5x2mm magnets, which are pretty small and very cheap for packs of 100 or more. The standard <em>Infinity</em> bases (because Corvus Belli are awesome), actually have a round slot for the magnet to fit in, so once a small bit of super glue is on the base, it keeps the magnet from sliding around while it dries, giving you a solid connection. Some of the older larger, metal <em>Infinity</em> miniatures like the bikes and the O-Yoroi need 2 of the smaller magnets, but as the new larger <em>Infinity</em> miniatures are made from a lightweight resin, one 5x2mm is perfect to hold them in place.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/safe-and-sound-5.jpg?itok=FgnuUbg0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/safe-and-sound-5.jpg?itok=_ZLfHibZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Safe and Sound <em>Infinity</em> Action Box looks great during games, even if you're not using the internal elements, it's even got my factions NA2 logo on the front.</figcaption></figure><h2>How Durable Is The Safe And Sound Infinity Action Box?</h2>

<p>When you think about a card box, it probably doesn't sound very durable over a plastic box, but the <em>Infinity</em> Action Box can take a knock and still keep your miniatures safe. More so because they're stuck to the base, so they're not moving around inside when it is moved or bashed. When closed, two card folds slide into slits, and a velcro fastener keeps it shut while traveling. The thickness of the sides also helps with durability, keeping the lid straight across the top, even with heavy miniatures placed on it (like you might when using it during games).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/safe-and-sound-6.jpg?itok=4Y9ulusY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/safe-and-sound-6.jpg?itok=qxbVcKYw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Here you can see the Strike Force box is twice the size of&nbsp;The Safe and Sound <em>Infinity</em> Action Box, with some extra height for larger miniatures.</figcaption></figure><h2>Do Safe And Sound Make Other Box Sizes?</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.safeandsound.pl/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Safe and Sound</a> makes a whole range of boxes, storage, and transport products for your wargaming needs. They even make foam inserts for the boxes and bags that you can stack multiple boxes in. You can see in the image above the size comparison of the <em>Infinity</em> Action Box, and the Sci-Fi Strike Force Box, which is two Action Boxes long, and a bit higher for the taller miniatures. Safe and Sound offers a range of sizes and styles of magnetized and standard boxes to suit your army transportation requirements. I generally play skirmish games, with smaller army sizes, like <em>Infinity</em>, <em>Bushido</em>, and <em>Kill Team</em>, and the Army Box is perfect for carrying my entire collection for that game's faction, to give me some list-building variety while I'm there.</p>

<h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On The Safe And Sound Infinity Action Box?</h2>

<p>The <em>Infinity</em> Action Box is a solid transportation option, that fits a lot of miniatures for its small size. The fact that it doubles as a scenery piece is a bonus and that you get another scenery piece and the internal walls is awesome. I would definitely invest in the Action Box with the metal lid, just for the extra capacity and to maximize the use of the space, and also because having your JSA ninjas hanging off the roof is very on-theme.</p>

<h2>Should I Buy The Safe And Sound Infinity Action Box?</h2>

<p>If you want a magnatised transport option, that also looks great during games of <em>Infinity</em>, then the <em>Infinity</em> Action Box is a great purchase. The box doesn't suit fantasy settings, but Safe and Sound do offer other box styles. It also fits a lot of miniatures for a skirmish game. If you only play with 10-15 miniatures, it might be too big, and if you roll out with 70+ miniatures and large vehicles, then the other size boxes might be a better option.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chivalry-2-torn-banner-layoffs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Chivalry 2&nbsp;</em>developer Torn Banner has become the latest studio to be hit by the ongoing wave of industry layoffs, following in the footsteps of both indie and major studios alike.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7269735996861091841/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on the official Torn Banner LinkedIn page, CEO Steve Piggott says his studio has made the "very difficult decision to undergo a restructure and reduce some of our talented workforce". Piggott doesn't state how many employees have been laid off.</p>

<p>He puts the layoffs down to Torn Banner being a "fully independent, self-funded developer" that is currently "up against many challenges", describing himself and his studio as "saddened to part ways with some of our incredible team".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/torn-banner-layoffs-chivalry-2-army.jpg?itok=_bgY0Mbz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/torn-banner-layoffs-chivalry-2-army.jpg?itok=GOA7c0Yc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Chivalry 2</em>'s Torn Banner is the latest studio to report layoffs.</figcaption></figure><p>With regards to the future of Torn Banner's games, Piggott says that&nbsp;<em>Chivalry 2&nbsp;</em>won't be affected by these layoffs; the game "is not impacted", and servers will remain up as normal. As a reminder,&nbsp;<em>Chivalry 2&nbsp;</em>received its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chivalry-2-content-complete" rel="nofollow">final major content update</a> earlier this year.</p>

<p>In addition, Piggott says he and Torn Banner are still committed to working on&nbsp;<em>No More Room in Hell 2</em>, which he says he still believes is "one of the most unique and incredible zombie experiences out there". He goes as far as to call&nbsp;<em>No More Room in Hell 2&nbsp;</em>"central to our goals as a studio".</p>

<p>At time of writing, however, it seems that players are divided on whether they agree with him or not.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>No More Room in Hell 2&nbsp;</em>is currently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/292000/No_More_Room_in_Hell_2/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sitting at a "Mixed" rating</a> on Steam across over 6,600 reviews, and its 24-hour player peak <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/292000/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">stands at just 228</a>, which isn't a great number for what is supposed to be one of a studio's cornerstone games.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/no-more-room-in-hell-2-torn-banner.jpg?itok=dp3ELhqy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/no-more-room-in-hell-2-torn-banner.jpg?itok=xl3FcFfx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>No More Room in Hell 2&nbsp;</em>may not quite be the success Torn Banner had hoped it would be.</figcaption></figure><p>Still, it's entirely possible that with the dedication Piggott seems determined to show to&nbsp;<em>No More Room in Hell 2</em>, the game can be turned around prior to its 1.0 release, which is currently scheduled for next year.</p>

<p>Torn Banner's layoffs are just the latest in a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-june-14th" rel="nofollow">sweeping wave</a> that has been consuming both major industry bodies and smaller studios alike, leading to mass layoffs, project <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tequila-works-rime-sexy-brutale-layoffs" rel="nofollow">cancellations</a>, and studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/piranha-bytes-shut-down-report" rel="nofollow">closures</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-console-sales</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/phasmophobia-console-sales-top-1m-total-sales-now-almost-22m.1050792/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-console-sales<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Kinetic Games has revealed that&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>console sales have already hit a very impressive milestone, even though the game has only been out on consoles for just over a month.</p>

<p>In a press release, Kinetic marks 35 days since&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia</em>'s console launch, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-console-release" rel="nofollow">delayed</a> multiple <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-console-delay-halloween" rel="nofollow">times</a> before finally happening just before Halloween this year. Since that point,&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>has sold a million copies on consoles.</p>

<p>According to Kinetic, that figure brings&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia</em>'s total sales up to almost 22 million, which is a very impressive milestone indeed. That figure puts&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>ahead of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hazelight-josef-fares-new-ip-it-takes-two-sales" rel="nofollow">co-op platformer&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hazelight-josef-fares-new-ip-it-takes-two-sales" rel="nofollow">It Takes Two</a>&nbsp;</em>and remaster collection&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crash-bandicoot-n-sane-trilogy-sales" rel="nofollow"><em>Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy</em></a>&nbsp;at last count.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/phasmophobia-console-sales-camera.jpg?itok=NTlbRGC1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/phasmophobia-console-sales-camera.jpg?itok=QHjnA1_K 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Phasmophobia</em>'s console release has sold very well indeed for Kinetic Games.</figcaption></figure><p>Kinetic CEO and&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>lead developer Daniel Knight describes the sales milestone as "the best Christmas present we could have wished for", thanking the game's "wonderful, supportive, and engaged community".</p>

<p><em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>was originally released on PC via Steam Early Access back in September 2020. It's received a number of updates since then, with major patches bringing things like a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-ascension-update-release-date" rel="nofollow">progression overhaul</a>, new <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-update-0810-adds-insanity-difficulty-and-more" rel="nofollow">difficulty levels</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-update-adds-3-new-ghosts-truck-improvements" rel="nofollow">more ghosts to contend with</a>, among other things.</p>

<p>Technically speaking, the game remains in Early Access; Kinetic still says it's planning a full release in late 2024, but since we're in the early days of December, this is looking more and more unlikely.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia</em>, it's a multiplayer ghost-hunting horror game in which you must team up with your friends to find and document supernatural phenomena in a range of haunted locations.</p>

<p>You'll have access to a range of ghost-hunting equipment to help you do so, and each ghost behaves in a different way, so you'll need to have your wits about you in order to discover which ghost you've encountered and how to best deal with it.</p>

<p><em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/739630/Phasmophobia/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10005673" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/phasmophobia-game-preview/9N6D60SBZN05" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>
