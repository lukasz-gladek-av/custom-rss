            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hunt-showdown-1896-post-malone-crossover<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Crytek has announced a major new crossover event for&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown 1896</em>, and it's set to be the game's "biggest event yet", according to the developer.</p>

<p>The appropriately-named Post Malone's Murder Circus event will serve as a crossover between&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown 1896&nbsp;</em>and - who else? - music artist Post Malone, whose work crosses genres like hip-hop, alternative rock, and country.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.huntshowdown.com/news/post-malone-s-murder-circus-coming-soon" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> (no pun intended) on the official&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown 1896&nbsp;</em>website, Post Malone's Murder Circus will bring a "unique blend of gothic horror and surreal carnival corruption" to players who "dare" to experience it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hunt-showdown-1896-post-malones-murder-circus-tent.jpg?itok=AsZTgVOP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hunt-showdown-1896-post-malones-murder-circus-tent.jpg?itok=o1H9IM6l 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hunt: Showdown 1896&nbsp;</em>is about to get circus-level spooky.</figcaption></figure><p>The event will cast Post as a character called the Deposed King, who once led "a twisted carnival corrupted by the dark power of the HelioStone". He's now out to destroy the stone, recruiting "bounty hunters, desperadoes, and suchlike" to help him.</p>

<p>In practical terms, the collaboration will introduce a major new Monster in the form of Ursa Mortis, a pair of conjoined orphaned bear cubs transformed into a twisted monstrosity. They'll "charge at Hunters and attack with a lethal roar".</p>

<p>You can also expect new themed skins, weapon variants, and enemies in the collaboration, all of which will be wrapped up in a "surreal carnival-inspired aesthetic" combining&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown 1896</em>'s gritty shooter mechanics with Post Malone's unique style.</p>




<p>More information about Post Malone's Murder Circus, including a release date and extra details about what kind of goodies you can expect from the event, will be released in the future.</p>

<p>If you missed out on the&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown 1896&nbsp;</em>hype, it's essentially <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hunt-showdown-sequel-esrb-leak-rumor" rel="nofollow">a rework</a> for extraction shooter&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown</em>. As well as a release for current-gen consoles, the updated version of the game also introduces a new biome, tech upgrades for the engine, and more.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown 1896&nbsp;</em>right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/594650/Hunt_Showdown_1896/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/hunt-showdown/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/hunt-showdown-1896/9nprv0r4cs1z" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>

<article role="article">

  
    

  
  <div>
      <div><p>We recently reviewed the <em>Hametsu</em> core rulebook, which you can read <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/hametsu-core-rulebook-review" rel="nofollow">here</a>, but the rulebook is only the start of your journey and here we're going to delve into the <em>Hametsu&nbsp;</em>miniatures that represent the characters during the game. You can use any miniatures for this miniature agnostic system, but Black Site Studios produces a full range of heroes and enemies for every profile in the rulebook, and also those that have been released after. In this article, we'll have a look at the heroes, enemy units, and boss miniatures and how they work in the game.</p>



<p>Hametsu includes a whole host of heroes to choose from when creating your party, and these all come under the 3 core schools from the Hametsu rulebook, the bonus school from the campaign, and an additional school that has been released separately since.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hametsu-001-school-of-magic.jpg?itok=yQvlYwj_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hametsu-001-school-of-magic.jpg?itok=luACUu6D 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h4>School of Magic</h4>

<p>The School of Magic focuses on those who harness otherworldly energies through various forms.</p>

<ul><li>Onmyoji - These magic users focus on&nbsp;elemental energies, starting with access to the lightning bolt ranged ability, building through options for chain lightning, spirit summoning, and ending with Lifeforce Detonation where they can channel their own hit points into dealing damage to enemies.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Bunraku - The students of death magic are similar to the more widely known necromancers. They start with the ability to weaken enemies, lowering their resilience, and can level up through controlling lesser enemies, to control of small zombie hordes.</li>
	<li>Monk - These spiritual magic users have the highest body outside of the school of strength, and they use their progress to build into a talented martial warrior with attacks like suppressing palm, and eventually flurry of blows.</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hametsu-002-school-of-stealth.jpg?itok=0VCpV5B6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hametsu-002-school-of-stealth.jpg?itok=SOksIYA9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h4>School of Stealth</h4>

<p>My favorite School, and I'm going to try an entire School of Stealth party at some point to see how they fare. They obviously focus on the less forward arts of combat.</p>

<ul><li>Shinobi - These ninjas and&nbsp;masters of stealth excel at remaining hidden and boost their abilities to do so as they level up with Master of Hiding, the amazing video game nod, Get Over Here attack, and finally have the option for the Faces of Death ability at the highest level where they can create duplicates of themselves.</li>
	<li>Geisha - These performers use their abilities for distraction, gaining bonuses if they use attacks and songs in the same activation. Their songs build up from Soothing Serenade, Hypnotic Dance, and then to Divine Cacophony that can damage all nearby enemies.</li>
	<li>Matagi - The stealthy ranged warriors get a boost&nbsp;to their ranged damage if attacking outside of a target's line of sight.&nbsp;They get to focus their leveling up on their ranged attacks with volley&nbsp;of arrows and chain shot and with traps like the tripwire and the pit which can trap enemies and then remove them instantly if the Matagi is able to spend an action to remove it.</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hametsu-003-school-of-strength.jpg?itok=MJ-Fftqj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hametsu-003-school-of-strength.jpg?itok=Ej53_XlL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h4>School of Strength</h4>

<p>The core warriors of <em>Hametsu</em> come in three varieties of melee-focused combat.</p>

<ul><li>Ronin - These masterless samurai are what you expect from a feudal Japanese setting, and they don't disappoint. They start with Iaijutsu, which is the art of drawing and striking, and they deal 2 extra damage to an enemy when they first damage them each game. Their prowess also comes across as they gain levels, with Intimidating Presence, and finally with the option to take Undeniable Legend, which lets them chain attacks across the board if they can reach an enemy with a move after defeating the previous target.</li>
	<li>Gaijin - These foreign knights specialize in wearing armor and high-damage attacks. They can take the Wide Swing attack to target multiple enemies at Level 5, and Descendant of Heroes at the final level, which lets them attack an enemy when they're reduced to 0 wounds, staying alive if they slay their target.</li>
	<li>Sumo - The famous large fighters who specialize in hand-to-hand combat have the highest starting body points. They have the wonderfully thematic starting ability, Sacred Dohyo, which boosts their attacks and mind if they stay within the token. They can gain grapple and toss abilities as they level up, finally gaining access to the Greater Dohyo, which uses 6 templates inside of 1 and improves the boosted abilities.</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hametsu-004-school-of-corruption.jpg?itok=Mc0XyQYl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hametsu-004-school-of-corruption.jpg?itok=alXSefPW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h4>School of Corruption</h4>

<p>This bonus school is included as part of the Wolf and the Devil campaign, and players should play through the campaign before looking to use this school.</p>

<ul><li>Ketto - These are fast dual-wielding warriors who can gain the effects of two weapons when they attack. Other enemies will struggle to keep up with them when they level up, gaining Master of the Duel which gives an enemy -1 melee if they are the only one engaged with the Ketto, and gaining the option for the Flashing Whirlwind ability which can damage all enemies they move through.</li>
	<li>Kaeru - These stealthy acrobatic hunters are able to parkour around the battlefield, leveling up to attack multiple opponents and at the highest level, moving enemies with their attack for massive damage.</li>
	<li>Doku - The poison users are able to dish out poison counters, increasing the damage each counter deals as they level up to 10 per counter at the highest levels.</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hametsu-005-school-of-elements.jpg?itok=QfLi8fml 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hametsu-005-school-of-elements.jpg?itok=bl1p-Xd5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h4>School of Elements</h4>

<p>The School of Elements is an extra school, with the rules available when you purchase the <a href="https://blacksitestudio.com/products/hametsu-school-of-elements?variant=44885405040881" rel="nofollow">physical or digital miniatures</a> from Black Site Studios.</p>

<ul><li>Sora - The Sora harnesses the unseen energy in all things. They have a level 1 ability option that if they use both actions to perform in a single turn, boosts their stats (and reduces their resilience) for the rest of the game. They gain buff and debuff abilities as they level up, and one of their options at the highest level is a spell&nbsp;to resurrect a hunter that has been removed from the game, with full health points, making them an incredible asset on the battlefield.</li>
	<li>Hikaze - These warriors are fueled by fire and air, dishing out burning counters and fire attacks culminating in the Flames of Ambition ability that allows them to put any number of burn counters on themselves, gaining +1 mind or melee for each, but taking 8 damage for each unless they spend an action to put out the flames. This allows them to produce a single incredible attack, and possibly combust at the end of it.</li>
	<li>Tsuchimizu - These monks harness the power of earth and water, making them resilient in body and mind. The Level 6 Level Ground ability is one of my favorites, letting them remove a piece of terrain and damage all enemies on it.</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hametsu-006-enemies.jpg?itok=TVAupGnH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hametsu-006-enemies.jpg?itok=Ulv8LMdz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>The Enemies Of Hametsu</h2>

<p>The Cataclysm caused a whole host of demonic horrors to pour from the portal. The core rulebook focuses on different types of Oni (Japanese demons).</p>

<ul><li>Lesser Oni - The lesser oni are the weakest of the various types of Oni, but they like to fight in packs, and their melee increases if they can gang up on a hunter.</li>
	<li>Oni - More effective than their lesser counterparts, they get a boost to their melee if they make a second attack in their activation.</li>
	<li>Oni Marksman - Firearm-carrying&nbsp;Oni, they can spot hunters at a longer range during the stealth phase.</li>
	<li>Oni Lookout - These Oni carry longbows, and like the Marksman, can spot hunters at longer range during the stealth phase.</li>
	<li>Oni Captain - The captains are the most dangerous of the Oni. They are more effective in combat and inspire other Oni engaged with the same hunter. If the Oni Captain damages a hunter, another random Oni also engaged with that hunter gets a free attack.</li>
	<li>Oni Shaman - The Shaman is a magic user and has a unique set of AI to attack, escape, and heal itself depending on its location in relation to the hunters.</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hametsu-007-bosses.jpg?itok=iit-bpFS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hametsu-007-bosses.jpg?itok=FAYxe0c3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>The Bosses Of Hametsu</h2>

<p>Once the Hunters have found enough clues, the boss of the scenario appears. The <em>Hametsu</em> ore rulebook contains 6 bosses, all with their own unique challenge to beat.</p>

<ul><li>Enenra - These monsters are made of smoke and ash, which makes them hard to land attacks&nbsp;on. They drift around the battlefield, trying to sneak up behind hunters and devour them.</li>
	<li>Daitengu - These winged Tengu are superb fighters and offer one of the hardest face-to-face challenges. Their Sword of the Wind attack pushes hunters away, and they deal damage when they successfully defend against the hunters'&nbsp;attacks.</li>
	<li>Shikigami - These random sprits are unpredictable, moving a random amount in a random direction each turn, with all nearby hunters having to save against a deathly cold attack, and then the furthest&nbsp;hunter from the Shikigami automatically taking damage from its Horrible Memory attack.</li>
	<li>Nogitsune - This nine-tailed fox always heads for the hunter with the lowest starting body and attacks. If it damages a hunter, it can attack again twice more, and with 2 core attacks each turn, it can really ramp up the damage if you don't defend well.</li>
	<li>Komainu - These stone lion-dogs are extremely hardy, starting with the most body points of all the bosses and if you damage them too much, they get a free attack the following turn. They also have a charge attack which pushes all hunters in its path and damages them, so positioning is key when fighting this boss.</li>
	<li>Ogumo - This giant spider does what you would expect a giant spider to do, it shoots webs, and heads straight for its chosen prey, grasping them and attacking them until they're subdued. It also moves around the battlefield, carrying the hunter they've grasped and dogging the other hunters.</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hametsu-008-raid-bosses.jpg?itok=x9osOdOO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hametsu-008-raid-bosses.jpg?itok=N5_L9TSW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>The Raid Bosses Of Hametsu</h2>

<p>Once hunters have progressed to Level 8, the bosses get easier, and they look for tougher enemies to bring down. These enemies are known as Raid Bosses, and battles with them don't follow the normal rules. There's no stealth or clash phase, players jump straight into the battle with the Raid Boss. The STLs for the miniatures for these bosses are available in the <a href="https://blacksitestudio.com/en-gb/pages/hametsu-digital-products" rel="nofollow">Digital Downloads section</a> of the <em>Hametsu</em> products page.</p>

<ul><li>Omukade - The rules for this raid boss are in the <em>Hametsu</em> core rulebook. This giant insect-like boss moves through a series of 7 actions whenever it activates, moving, attacking with pincers, and trying to grasp the hunters, along with activating a series of cold spells. With 1000 body points, it will take a while to bring this enemy down, but each hunter that survives doing so, gets to roll on the Omukade's unique loot table.</li>
	<li>Gashadokuro - The raid rules for this boss can be found for free on the <a href="https://blacksitestudio.com/en-gb/pages/hametsu-resources" rel="nofollow">Hametsu resources page</a>. This unique scenario finds the hunters battling and unkillable enemy, and having to survive a number of turns against it until the magics animating it wear out. While the hunters can't defeat the Gashadokuro, they can damage it and reduce its combat effectiveness. Each turn, the Gashadokuro moves through a series of actions, trying to grab and crush the hunters, and releasing death magic to reduce the hunters own effectiveness at trying to survive. Like the all raid bosses, there's a unique loot table that all hunters can roll on if at least 2 survive.</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hametsu-009-campaign-bosses.jpg?itok=0AeKWijs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hametsu-009-campaign-bosses.jpg?itok=l2HA9huP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>The Campaign Bosses Of Hametsu</h2>

<ul><li>The Wolf and the Devil - I won't go into too much detail about the Wolf and the Devil, as they are part of the narrative campaign of the same name in the <em>Hametsu</em> core rulebook. But you can see from the miniature pack&nbsp;that it includes a large spectral wolf and a sturdy-looking devil miniature. You'll have to play through the campaign yourself to find out how you face them and what they're capable of.</li>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-genesis-november-2024</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-online-gets-three-more-classic-genesis-games.1046508/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-genesis-november-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Three more classic Sega Genesis games have been added to the Nintendo Switch Online library, with two classic platformers and a military-themed run-and-gun shmup now up for grabs for subscribers.</p>

<p>As with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-online-june-2023-genesis" rel="nofollow">other Genesis games</a> on Switch Online, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-n64-halloween" rel="nofollow">N64</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-f-zero" rel="nofollow">Game Boy Advance</a> titles on the service, you'll need the Expansion Pack addon to enjoy these new Genesis games; a basic Switch Online subscription won't cut it, unfortunately.</p>

<p>If you do have the Expansion Pack addon, then the first Genesis game you'll be able to enjoy as part of November 2024's haul is the funky platformer&nbsp;<em>ToeJam &amp; Earl in Panic on Funkotron</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/toejam-earl-in-panic-on-funkotron-nintendo-switch-online.jpg?itok=5r_jm8sd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/toejam-earl-in-panic-on-funkotron-nintendo-switch-online.jpg?itok=_In3M1eE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>ToeJam &amp; Earl in Panic on Funkotron&nbsp;</em>is one of three Genesis games that have been added to the Nintendo Switch Online library.</figcaption></figure><p>The 2D platformer is a sequel to 1991's off-kilter roguelike-style action-adventure game&nbsp;<em>ToeJam &amp; Earl</em>, and it sees the two titular alien protagonists attempting to rid their home planet Funkotron of a pesky human invasion.</p>

<p>Your next Genesis game for November 2024 is&nbsp;<em>Vectorman</em>, a 1995 platformer that takes inspiration not only from other platformers like&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Country&nbsp;</em>but also from run-and-gun affairs like <i>Metal Slug&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<em>Gunstar Heroes</em>.</p>

<p>If you're looking for a platformer but you're not in the mood for the colorful, high-octane antics of ToeJam and Earl, then&nbsp;<em>Vectorman</em>'s more somber tone and techno-inspired soundtrack should go a long way towards making you happy.</p>

<p>Finally, the third game being added to the Switch Online library today is the 1991 run-and-gun shmup&nbsp;<em>Wolf of the Battlefield: Mercs</em>, also known as simply&nbsp;<em>Mercs&nbsp;</em>or as&nbsp;<em>Wolf of the Battlefield 2</em>.</p>




<p><em>Mercs&nbsp;</em>plays a lot like top-down shooters along the lines of&nbsp;<em>Ikari Warriors&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Smash TV</em>, so if you want something a little more action-oriented than the aforementioned two games, then this one should be right up your street.</p>

<p>All three of these games are available to check out right now if you've got a Nintendo Switch Online membership and an Expansion Pack addon, both of which you can get via your console's eShop.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-terraria-crossover-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/palworld-terraria-crossover-announced-for-next-year.1046481/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-terraria-crossover-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Pocketpair has announced a&nbsp;<em>Palworld Terraria&nbsp;</em>crossover for next year, bringing together the worlds of two immensely popular games, although details are fairly light at the moment.</p>

<p>Announcing the crossover <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1861560568756462079" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on social media platform X</a>, Pocketpair promises more info "soon", as well as sharing a piece of artwork that depicts characters from both games clasping their hands together, all while Pals look on in the background.</p>

<p>It's not currently clear whether the crossover goes both ways; presumably, we'll be getting to see&nbsp;<em>Terraria&nbsp;</em>characters and locations make their way into&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>, but we don't yet know whether the reverse is true as well.</p>

<p>In the post announcing the crossover, Pocketpair also announced that "2024 isn't finished yet for&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>" and that another update is on the way for the game, with more information about that also coming "very soon".</p>

<p>It's not clear whether that update will be a substantial one, but the fact that Pocketpair describes the news as "exciting" should hopefully be encouraging for those hoping for more&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>content before the new year.</p>

<p>All in all, it's fair to say it's been a year of ups and downs for Pocketpair and&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>. On the plus side, the game launched early in 2024 to a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-finally-dethrones-baldurs-gate-3-as-most-played-game-on-steam-deck-in-february" rel="nofollow">rapturous reception</a> from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-25-million-players-matching-pokemon-scarlet-violet" rel="nofollow">gamers</a>, cementing its place in the popular zeitgeist as a&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>pastiche with enduring appeal.</p>

We don't know yet.</figcaption></figure><p>On the other hand, however, it's been a bit of a fraught year for&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>. Pocketpair was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-palworld-pocketpair-lawsuit" rel="nofollow">sued by Nintendo back in September</a>, with the Japanese gaming giant <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-lawsuit-patents-demands-nintendo" rel="nofollow">alleging patent infringement</a>&nbsp;and apparently seeking the cessation of&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>'s sale in Japan.</p>

<p>Of course, none of that stopped&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-ps5-release-japan" rel="nofollow">launching on PS5</a> this year, nor has it stopped the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-mobile-version-krafton" rel="nofollow">development of a mobile version</a> over at&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>studio Krafton. We'll bring you more on this crossover, plus all else <i>Palworld</i>-related, as soon as we get it.</p>
