            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/wanderstop-review-more-than-managing-tea<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Wanderstop</em> is the first title from Ivy Road, a studio formed by industry vets in 2021. Trailers showcased the title as a tea shop manager, but it’s so much more, and less, than that. Presenting a complex story and taking care of customers’ tea orders is only the tip of the iceberg.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Serving Up Tea in <em>Wanderstop</em></h2>

<p>You play as Alta, a fighter known for being the best. After having her win streak of three years broken, she enters the woods to find the one person who can train her back to perfection. Weakened from consistent running, you pass out and awaken in a clearing.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wanderstop-boro-dialogue.jpg?itok=snXRUB4e 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wanderstop-boro-dialogue.jpg?itok=45d_NI06 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This is where the 10-15 hours of gameplay begins. You start by exploring the clearing and the tea shop known as Wanderstop. Managed by Boro, you’re stuck helping him make tea until you’re able to lift your sword and leave the woods. I found that having your own cup to savor at this moment can really heighten the experience. I chose a nice herbal blend to sip while serving my first customers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The tea making process involves multiple steps, but once you have it down, it’s fairly easy. You grow specific fruits to gather, collect and dry tea leaves, then brew the drink inside the shop. All ingredients needed are found in the clearing, and there are no time limits on how long someone will wait for their beverage. If you make it incorrectly, they’ll even let you try again with no penalty to their dialogue.&nbsp;</p>

Aside from a handful of specific client asks, most of the tea making you do is extremely straightforward. From growing the plants, finding the correct ingredients, and making the tea, it’s quite lacking in variety.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The most challenging part is playing the title with a mouse and keyboard, then trying to quickly select one of the items from your inventory. It’s not super difficult, but getting what item you want and where you want it can take some finesse. A controller is far superior when it comes to inventory scrolling and using the shears.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wanderstop-large-hybrid.jpg?itok=K6Ks9HPi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wanderstop-large-hybrid.jpg?itok=ibKsNxy_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>While tea creation may have been the premise that drew people in, it’s not the main focus of the title. What <em>Wanderstop</em> lacks in management complexity, it gains in narrative focus. The story is the highlight of the title, evoking emotions I wasn't prepared to experience.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Without delving too much into the story and ruining all the surprises, you go through Alta’s history and attempt to discover how to fix her current situation. It does pull at the heartstrings and could make you ponder your own views as you work through the different stages of the game. The characters are endearing, many of them with distinct personalities and conversational mannerisms.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wanderstop-extradimensional-character.jpg?itok=BhK_0iWr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wanderstop-extradimensional-character.jpg?itok=jBpKkxmX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As you progress, you’re confronted with moments that alter what the clearing looks like. These changes bring new color schemes, new plants, and new customers. It also ends prior interactions with customers, cutting some side stories preemptively. This is irksome, but you do get chances to learn more about those characters as the game progresses.</p>

<h2><em>Wanderstop </em>Review <em>|&nbsp;</em>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><em>Wanderstop</em> is less a tea shop management game and more a visual novel guiding players through a difficult, emotional narrative. It can be a tear-jerking experience, especially towards the end of the game. However, once played, I doubt I’ll personally dive back into the world now that I know the full story. It’s perfect for those wanting less of a commitment, with short windows of game time, or who need breaks between storytelling moments.&nbsp;<br>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/blizzcon-returns-september-2026</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/blizzcon-returns-in-september-2026-blizzard-announces.1131324/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/blizzcon-returns-september-2026<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Blizzard has announced the return of its BlizzCon gaming show, but there's a catch: the show isn't coming back until September 2026, which means it will have skipped two years in a row for the first time in its history.</p>

<p>In an announcement <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24178650/blizzcon-returns-in-2026" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, Blizzard reveals that the convention will be returning to Anaheim, CA on September 12th and 13th next year. Naturally, tickets aren't on sale yet, but you can already sign up for updates via the <a href="https://blizzcon.com/en-us" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official website</a>.</p>

<p>Blizzard doesn't reveal what will be appearing at 2026's BlizzCon, but the studio does say the event is "one of [its] favorite traditions" and that it's planning to build the next BlizzCon "with a deep commitment to [its] players".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/diablo-4-blizzcon-2026-announcement.jpg?itok=aNU0eqj9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/diablo-4-blizzcon-2026-announcement.jpg?itok=Wlhf4HpD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Blizzard has announced BlizzCon's return...for next year.</figcaption></figure><p>While no specifics are revealed, Blizzard does say you can expect the return of "BlizzCon staples like Opening Ceremony, in-depth panels, the Darkmoon Faire, friendly competition, hands-on gameplay, and more".</p>

<p>If I had to guess, I'd say we'll probably get a reveal for the next&nbsp;<em>World of Warcraft&nbsp;</em>expansion that will constitute the second chapter of creative lead Chris Metzen's&nbsp;<em>Worldsoul Saga&nbsp;</em>trilogy, after <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/world-of-warcraft-war-within-reveals-tons-of-details-on-delves-warband-hero-talents" rel="nofollow">2024's&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/world-of-warcraft-war-within-reveals-tons-of-details-on-delves-warband-hero-talents" rel="nofollow">The War Within</a>&nbsp;</em>kicked things off in that regard.</p>

<p>Assuming it hasn't already been revealed, we may also get some more information about the next&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4&nbsp;</em>expansion, which Blizzard has already confirmed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/next-diablo-4-expansion-2026-blizzard" rel="nofollow">won't be coming until 2026</a>, making BlizzCon the perfect place to reveal it.</p>

<p>Of course, I can't predict what else Blizzard will announce during the event, but I think those two guesses are safe bets. You can see the announcement trailer for BlizzCon 2026, which isn't particularly long or informative, here.</p>




<p>Given that tickets aren't yet on sale for BlizzCon 2026, we don't know much they'll cost, but you can probably expect to pay a few hundred dollars for the privilege of attending. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[First New Katamari Damacy Game in Almost Eight Years Announced for Apple Arcade]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/katamari-damacy-rolling-live-apple-arcade</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/first-new-katamari-damacy-game-in-almost-eight-years-announced-for-apple-arcade.1131321/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/katamari-damacy-rolling-live-apple-arcade<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Apple and Bandai Namco have announced that the first&nbsp;<em>Katamari Damacy&nbsp;</em>game in almost eight years is heading to Apple Arcade next month, along with five other new titles.</p>

<p><em>Katamari Damacy Rolling Live&nbsp;</em>is, as Apple puts it in its <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/03/apple-arcade-launches-new-katamari-and-space-invaders-games-in-april/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement post</a>, "the&nbsp;<em>Katamari&nbsp;</em>franchise's first original game in nearly eight years", following the release of remasters&nbsp;<em>Katamari Damacy Reroll&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>We Love Katamari Reroll+ Royal Reverie</em>. It's launching on April 3rd.</p>

<p>Just like other&nbsp;<em>Katamari&nbsp;</em>games,&nbsp;<em>Rolling Live&nbsp;</em>will see you taking control of the Prince as he completes a series of Katamari-based tasks given to him by the quirky King of All Cosmos. Apple says the series' core gameplay idea of "roll, stick, and grow" is intact in&nbsp;<em>Rolling Live</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/apple-arcade-katamari-damacy-rolling-live-phone.jpg?itok=uaOigroC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/apple-arcade-katamari-damacy-rolling-live-phone.jpg?itok=vzc61j4e 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Katamari Damacy Rolling Live&nbsp;</em>is the series' first original game in nearly eight years, and it's coming to Apple Arcade.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that while Apple and Bandai Namco haven't confirmed this,&nbsp;<em>Katamari Damacy Rolling Live&nbsp;</em>is unlikely to boast the involvement of original&nbsp;<em>Katamari&nbsp;</em>creator Keita Takahashi.</p>

<p>Having left Bandai Namco in 2010, Takahashi hasn't worked on a&nbsp;<em>Katamari&nbsp;</em>game since 2005's&nbsp;<em>We Love Katamari</em>. Instead, he's hard at work on the rather&nbsp;<em>Katamari</em>-esque adventure game&nbsp;<em>To a T</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/to-a-t-release-date-katamari-creator" rel="nofollow">launching in May</a>.</p>

<p>As well as&nbsp;<em>Katamari Damacy Rolling Live</em>, Apple also announced five other games making their way to the Apple Arcade service. The first of these is Taito's&nbsp;<em>Space Invaders Infinity Gene Evolve</em>, an honest-to-goodness new entry in the&nbsp;<em>Space Invaders&nbsp;</em>series.</p>

<p>It's joined by <i>Puffies</i>, a game by&nbsp;<em>Lumen&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Stitch&nbsp;</em>developer Lykke Studios, as well as the Atari remaster&nbsp;<em>RollerCoaster Tycoon Classic+</em>, which Apple says has been "enhanced for iPhone and iPad".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rollercoaster-tycoon-classic-apple-arcade.jpg?itok=7t9Rf0cY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rollercoaster-tycoon-classic-apple-arcade.jpg?itok=vdzcJ77u 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>RollerCoaster Tycoon Classic+&nbsp;</em>is also on its way to Apple Arcade.</figcaption></figure><p>Rounding out the new Apple Arcade collection are Marmalade Game Studio's&nbsp;<em>The Game of Life 2+&nbsp;</em>and STEM educational game&nbsp;<em>Sesame Street Mecha Builders+</em>, which, contrary to its name, probably isn't about Big Bird wrecking puppets with a giant mech.</p>

<p>All of these games join the Apple Arcade service, which is available on iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV, on April 3rd.&nbsp;</p>
