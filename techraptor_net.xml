            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, Nintendo held a brand new Indie World showcase packed with information about indie games coming to Switch 2 and Switch in the near future. Here's everything that was announced during that showcase!</p>

<hr><h2><em>Mina the Hollower&nbsp;</em>kicks the show off</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-indie-world-august-2025-mina-the-hollower.jpg?itok=FnIVgsaO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-indie-world-august-2025-mina-the-hollower.jpg?itok=Zb3iifeW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Mina the Hollower&nbsp;</em>arrives in October.</figcaption></figure><p>First, we get a new glimpse at Yacht Club's upcoming Game Boy-style top-down action-adventure game&nbsp;<em>Mina the Hollower</em>, which, as we know, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mina-the-hollower-release-date-yacht-club" rel="nofollow">launches on October 31st</a>. A demo will be available today for Switch 2 and Switch!</p>

<h2><em>Well Dweller&nbsp;</em>is a spooky Metroidvania coming next year</h2>

<p>Top hat Studios is up next, and it has revealed&nbsp;<em>Well Dweller</em>, a spooky-looking Metroidvania with more than a whiff of Tim Burton about it. Perhaps this will fill the&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>void? It's coming next year to Switch, anyway.</p>

<h2><em>Neverway&nbsp;</em>is a life sim with a difference</h2>

<p>Cozy games are gradually becoming spookier and spookier, it seems, and&nbsp;<em>Neverway&nbsp;</em>is a good example of that. It's a "nightmarish life-sim RPG" with a woozy color palette, co-created by the pixel artist behind&nbsp;<em>Celeste</em>, and it's coming to the Switch next year.</p>

<h2><em>Herdling&nbsp;</em>is the next game from the folks behind&nbsp;<em>Far</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/herdling-nintendo-indie-world.jpg?itok=G5Vs-y0G 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/herdling-nintendo-indie-world.jpg?itok=o3kiy-Kx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Herdling&nbsp;</em>has you herding animals in a beautiful, yet desolate landscape.</figcaption></figure><p>Next up, it's <i>Herdling</i>, an action-adventure game that comes from the devs behind the&nbsp;<em>Far&nbsp;</em>games. It combines&nbsp;Team Ico-style lonely vistas with the herding gameplay of&nbsp;<em>Herdy Gerdy&nbsp;</em>(remember that?), and it's coming to the Switch on August 21st.</p>

<h2><em>Is This Seat Taken</em>? brings "pleasant puzzle" vibes</h2>

<p>From Wholesome Games and Poti Poti Studio comes&nbsp;<em>Is This Seat Taken</em>?, a puzzler in which you must organize people depending on what they want and don't want. It comes to Switch later today!</p>

<h2><em>Little Kitty, Big City&nbsp;</em>will let you customize your cat and more</h2>

<p>A new update is coming to&nbsp;<em>Little Kitty, Big City</em>, and it'll let you customize your cat, meet new friends, and take photos with new photo mode features. The update is heading to Switch later this year.</p>

<h2><em>Content Warning&nbsp;</em>is coming to Switch 2</h2>

<p>Landfall's&nbsp;<em>Content Warning</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/content-warning-sales-two-million" rel="nofollow">proved a massive hit</a> when it launched on PC last year, is bringing its "friendslop" fun to Switch 2. It's heading to Nintendo's console next year.</p>

<h2><em>Ball x Pit&nbsp;</em>is an action roguelite with some big influences</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ball-x-pit-nintendo-indie-world.jpg?itok=LZIpriF6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ball-x-pit-nintendo-indie-world.jpg?itok=-iBy-wSL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Action roguelite&nbsp;<em>Ball x Pit&nbsp;</em>is coming to Switch 2 and Switch.</figcaption></figure><p>If you've ever wanted to see&nbsp;<em>Breakout&nbsp;</em>rendered as an action roguelite that also blends influences like&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Loop Hero</em>, then&nbsp;<em>Ball x Pit&nbsp;</em>is for you. This one comes to Switch 2 this fall and to Switch on October 15th.</p>

<h2><em>Ultimate Sheep Raccoon&nbsp;</em>is a chaotic followup to&nbsp;<em>Ultimate Chicken Horse</em></h2>

<p>Yep, that's right - wacky racer&nbsp;<em>Ultimate Chicken Horse&nbsp;</em>is getting a followup, and it looks to bring even more ways to mess up your friends' day on chaotic race courses. It's coming to Switch 2 and Switch this winter.</p>

<h2><em>Glaciered&nbsp;</em>takes place on a wintry Earth 65 million years in the future</h2>

<p>Playism and Studio Snowblind have announced&nbsp;<em>Glaciered</em>, which takes place on a far-future Earth that's been completely overtaken by ice. You'll swim through waters filled with "ferocious marine beasts" in post-apocalyptic action RPG style this holiday on Switch 2.</p>

<h2>It's indie sizzle reel time!</h2>

<p>Lastly, we got to see a sizzle reel of indie games heading to Switch 2 and Switch in the near future. Here's everything that was included in that sizzle reel!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Media Molecule Co-Founder David Smith Departs to Focus on Personal Projects]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/media-molecule-david-smith-leaving</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/media-molecule-co-founder-david-smith-departs-to-focus-on-personal-projects.1264314/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Media Molecule co-founder David Smith has announced that he's leaving the studio after nearly 20 years in order to focus on his own personal projects.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mediamolecule.bsky.social/post/3lvqf3rzp622e" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message</a> on social media, Smith says that while he's "proud" of everything Media Molecule has created, he has been "feeling a growing itch to explore truly wild ideas and make things based on [his] personal whimsy".</p>

<p>He says that while he still "greatly enjoy[s] the creative dynamic of working at Media Molecule", he doesn't have enough time to do so and work on his personal projects "without entirely giving up on pursuing that mythical creature called 'work-life balance'".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/media-molecule-david-smith-leaving-dreams.jpg?itok=zxymWiTs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/media-molecule-david-smith-leaving-dreams.jpg?itok=f-8xYf8m 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Media Molecule is best known for games like the PS4 creative sandbox&nbsp;<em>Dreams</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Although he's leaving the studio, Smith says he "hope[s] to be involved with Media Molecule in future", and that he wants to "drop in from time to time", praising the "positivity and free exchange of ideas" that he says "remains true to the founding spirit of the company".</p>

<p>It's not clear exactly what personal projects Smith will be working on; whether he intends to start a new studio away from Media Molecule is unclear. We may well learn more about his plans in the coming months.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with Media Molecule, it's a development studio that was founded back in 2006 by Smith and three others: Mark Healey (who <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/media-molecule-co-founder-mark-healey-leaves-studio-after-17-years" rel="nofollow">departed the studio himself back in 2023</a>), Alex Evans, and Kareem Ettouney.</p>

<p>The company's first game as Media Molecule was 2008's PS3 exclusive&nbsp;<em>LittleBigPlanet</em>, a platformer that emphasized user-generated levels, although it did also offer a campaign of its own created by Media Molecule staffers.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/media-molecule-littlebigplanet-franchise.jpg?itok=rIL-VXCE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/media-molecule-littlebigplanet-franchise.jpg?itok=D0xYVvAU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Media Molecule created the&nbsp;<em>LittleBigPlanet&nbsp;</em>franchise back in 2008.</figcaption></figure><p><em>LittleBigPlanet&nbsp;</em>would go on to become a successful franchise for Sony, with two further sequels and a number of spinoffs arriving in subsequent years, although Media Molecule itself stepped away from the series in 2014.</p>

<p>The studio's most recent release is&nbsp;<em>Dreams</em>, the PS4 creativity sandbox that acts as a game and content creation tool more than a title in and of itself. Live support for&nbsp;<em>Dreams&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/media-molecule-says-dreams-live-support-is-ending-in-september" rel="nofollow">ended in 2023</a>, but Media Molecule said at the time that it was moving onto an "exciting new project", although we still don't know what that might be.</p>
