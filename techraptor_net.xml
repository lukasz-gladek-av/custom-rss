            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Arc Raiders&nbsp;</em>developer Embark Studios has revealed that it intends to lower the price of some of the extraction shooter's cosmetics soon, and that Duo-prioritized matchmaking has already been "silently tested and enabled".</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/duo-and-store-update/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> addressing some of the community's most common concerns, Embark says that its new system first prioritizes solo and squad players to play with those of their own kind, then "Duos to play with other Duos" and "Trios to play with Trios".</p>

<p>However, Embark says that the new system is "not 100% guaranteed", so it's possible you'll still find yourself running into "differing constellations of players other than your own". Still, given that this is one of the community's <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-players-plead-with-embark-studios-to-make-a-duos-mode-but-not-all-fans-of-the-new-shooter-are-convinced-this-game-isnt-meant-to-be-a-balanced-team-death-match/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">most-requested features</a>, it's a nice tip of the hat.</p>

<p>The studio says it's "reviewed [its] prices and made adjustments to lower prices where applicable", and that new cosmetic item prices will come into effect tomorrow at 10:30 CET (that's around 4:30am Eastern).</p>

<p>If you've already bought the cosmetics in question, then you'll be compensated for the difference, with the Raider Tokens you've spent being "refunded back into your account automatically in the coming week".</p>

<p>Embark also says it will start to introduce new Raider Decks in the future, and that some of those decks will be paid, but that gameplay items will only be in free decks and that "no pay to win items" will be featured in premium decks.</p>




<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders&nbsp;</em>is, it's a post-apocalyptic extraction shooter in which players must contend with deadly mechs and squads of other players as they loot areas and attempt to escape.</p>

<p>After multiple <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/arc-raiders-delay-pushes-release-date-to-2023" rel="nofollow">delays</a>, the game was released in late October, quickly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/arc-raiders-sales-4m" rel="nofollow">racking up millions of sales</a>&nbsp;within the first two weeks of its launch.
