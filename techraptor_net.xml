            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We need more puzzle games in the hands of the people. Forget the daily Wordle, or those insipid color sort games, you gotta say to yourself that "the day doesn’t start until I complete this <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/baba-is-you" rel="nofollow"><em>Baba is You</em></a> level", or until you figure out what gets wetter as it dries. Thank goodness Enhance have got this in mind also, as <em>Lumines Arise</em> has, well, risen.</p>

<p>This is the latest game from Enhance Games, the Japan-based studio fronted by Tetsuya Mizuguchi, who was also the director of the original <em>Lumines </em>in 2004. With Enhance, Mizuguchi and co. have been refining a certain transcendental experience that collides with almost menial puzzle gameplay, whether it’s <em>Rez Infinite</em>, the widely revered <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/tetris-effect" rel="nofollow"><em>Tetris Effect</em></a>, or the bustling nature of <em>Humanity</em>.</p>

<p><em>Lumines Arise</em> sees itself neck-and-neck with the likes of <em>Tetris Effect</em>, not just because of its block-based gameplay, but the way it presents itself; almost hoity-toity in fashion. Let it be stated for the record that I personally don’t see what the gift is in <em>Tetris Effect</em>, as its aesthetic clashed way too much mechanically with what <em>Tetris </em>is, and indeed became. What was once 5 minutes on the john with a Game Boy was now lampooning as an artistic endeavor, embarrassed to provide flow.</p>



<p>By contrast, the gameplay of <em>Lumines </em>is simplistic to the point of oversight. You are given two different tones of blocks that always come in the shape of 2x2, and it’s your job to create other 2x2 squares of one tone or the other. Sometimes they spawn in as such, a free point bonus if you will, but you also have to time your drops to the beat of the song playing. It's a very delicate dance, one that surprisingly punishes brute force quite often.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Still, there is a lifeline in the form of a “linker”. Say you have a long 1x1 line of one tone that snakes across your messy board, and a linker of that tone is able to connect to it? That entire line is completely erased, leading to a major reset of the board's opportunities. Despite a much more stilted execution of combos, it's very similar to<em> <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/puyo-puyo-tetris-2" rel="nofollow">Puyo Puyo</a></em> in that regard.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is also a new power-up similar to the “Zone” bonus in <em>Tetris Effect</em>, in the form of “Burst”. Like with Zone, a square of one tone will form and expand, with each single 1x1 square added with the same tone, making it grow and eat any other squares. With that monstrous square formed, a new one spawns of the other tone, and boom, another major reset.</p>



<p>It’s an exceptionally powerful ability, one which seems almost negligible since the linkers work to the same effect, but it works with the visual design brilliantly. Each board blossoms with the progression, and with much broader strokes than the underspoken developments of <em>Tetris Effect</em>’s backgrounds and songs. Still, with time, <em>Lumines Arise</em> effectively evolves into something very different.</p>

<p>While the painting of <em>Arise </em>is similar to <em>Effect</em>, the painter in question is one much more indebted to how <em>Lumines </em>came to existence to begin with. This was always meant to be “transcendental”, to instill a purity through new-age affirmations, even back in 2004, when Mizuguchi’s Sega experience influenced every part of <em>Lumines</em>’ Y2K aesthetic. As it stands, <em>Lumines Arise</em> IS the game that should define Enhance as a studio.</p>

<p>The end result is absolutely magical. From the moment you begin to see yourself in the same shoes of holistic block-based puzzle gameplay, you begin to notice the songs are providing more influence on the board. It's not just that the background is thumping behind the actual action, but the blocks transform, they intertwine with those elements until it becomes what <em>Lumines </em>wanted to be from the beginning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You’ll notice in the corner of gameplay that there’s a little individual reacting to your gameplay, and that’s your Loomii; a customizable avatar who adds a surprising amount of personality to proceedings. They’ll meditate, they’ll rave, they’ll float and interact with other Loomii’s you come across, and it’s nice to see that be the blueprint for <em>Lumines Arise</em>’s general connectivity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As with any <em>Lumines </em>game, the songs are a huge part of the core experience, and here, they're all earworms. The ones that are purely instrumental are the heaviest hitters, with legitimate structure throughout, and the right amount of dynamic co-operation with each square clear and combo chain. It's a huge upgrade on the underspoken and otherwise one-note house music that <em>Lumines </em>tended to pair itself with.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Lumines Arise</em> also tries to expand how it plays with mission modes, which tries to extract the same amount of variety that <em>Tetris Effect</em> does with what it can do with its gameplay. In <em>Arise</em>’s case, it isn’t nearly to the same effect, largely choosing to test the player on timing, as opposed to gimmickry, but when it does provide a unique angle, <em>Lumines </em>Arise runs with it. The “Egg” challenge in particular is both humorous and invigorating to plow through.</p>



<p>With each level clear, you’re also subject to achieving points that can be used on the “Loomi-Pon”, a pseudo-gacha machine which can generate unlockables for your Loomii. These range from cosmetic heads and decorations for their body to different adjectives and titles for your profile. There’s a LOT to unlock, in what is <em>Lumines Arise</em>’s biggest problem, which is with general UX.</p>

<p>For something so welcoming and desperate, it’s surprising to see the GUI of <em>Lumines Arise</em> be an absolute nightmare to navigate. Trying to customize your Loomii with new items is an excruciating effort of trying to find the one item that doesn’t have a tiny lock symbol next to it, and the titles? Forget about it, sifting through hundreds of words on each side? Just grating to get through.</p>

<p>Still, this is <em>Lumines Arise</em>’s only true blemish, as the rest is a beautiful cacophony of particle effects of genuine awe-struck talent. Similar to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/once-upon-katamari-review-ureshii-matsuri" rel="nofollow"><em>Katamari</em></a>’s blissful exercises of saccharine joy, Mizuguchi’s baby has grown into something that looks back on its history, the way it communicated to players, and now we have a statement of pure intent. That statement? Enjoy yourself.</p>

<h2><em>Lumines Arise&nbsp;</em>Review | Final Verdict</h2>

<p>Despite a heinous UX, <em>Lumines Arise</em> genuinely finds itself leaps and bounds above Enhance’s previous titles, in what should become a mainstay title. The gameplay of <em>Lumines </em>is the pinnacle of the phrase “easy to learn, hard to master”, and nowhere is it better showcased than here. A beautiful sprawling entity of brilliant music, fantastic visual design, and worthwhile vibes.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Pokemon Pokopia Release Date Revealed Ahead of Thursday's Trailer]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-pokopia-release-date-leak</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pokemon-pokopia-release-date-revealed-ahead-of-thursdays-trailer.1349911/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It looks like the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Pokopia&nbsp;</em>release date has been leaked ahead of a new trailer that's set to arrive for the cozy&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>life sim on Thursday.</p>

<p>As spotted by&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>news platform <a href="https://x.com/SerebiiNet/status/1988245459807113647" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Serebii</a>, what looks like a Japanese-language thumbnail for the upcoming trailer apparently reveals the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Pokopia&nbsp;</em>release date to be March 5th next year.</p>

<p>At time of writing, the front <a href="https://www.serebii.net/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">page</a> of Serebii's official website also confirms that the game's physical version will be a Game Key Card and will require 10GB of memory to install, so if you're planning on picking up&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Pokopia</em>, make sure you've got at least that much space.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-pokopia-release-date-leak-charmander.jpg?itok=H60ZkLFA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-pokopia-release-date-leak-charmander.jpg?itok=fxLNqQB5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It looks like the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Pokopia&nbsp;</em>release date may have been leaked.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that the Japanese release date for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Pokopia&nbsp;</em>may not be the same as its Western launch date, but simultaneous worldwide releases have been the norm for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>for a while now, so it's likely the game will launch around the world on the same day.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Pokopia&nbsp;</em>is, it's an upcoming&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>-themed&nbsp;life sim. Revealed during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-september-2025-recap" rel="nofollow">September's Nintendo Direct</a>, the game casts you as "a Ditto transformed into a human". It's up to you to "shape an empty land into a beautiful home for Pokemon".</p>

<p><em>Pokemon Pokopia&nbsp;</em>looks to resemble games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch-2-edition-free-update" rel="nofollow"><em>Animal Crossing</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Hello Kitty Island Adventure</em>, and HoYoverse's upcoming&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/petit-planet-preview-hoyoverses-foray-into-life-sims" rel="nofollow"><em>Petit Planet</em></a>. It'll feature Pokemon like Squirtle, Charmander, and Bulbasaur, and you'll be able to use their abilities to shape the world around you.</p>

<p>The game will serve as a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive, so if you want to check it out, you'll have to make the leap to Nintendo's new machine. Hey, at least you'll be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-financials-q1-2026" rel="nofollow">far from alone in doing so</a>!</p>




<p><em>Pokemon Pokopia&nbsp;</em>is set to arrive on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/pokemon-pokopia-switch-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch 2</a> on March 5th next year, assuming this Serebii leak is correct, of course. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Arc Raiders Sales Reach 4m in Less Than Two Weeks]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/arc-raiders-sales-4m</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders-sales-reach-4m-in-less-than-two-weeks.1349905/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Embark Studios has announced that its post-apocalyptic extraction shooter&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders&nbsp;</em>has passed a major sales milestone in less than two weeks.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://prtimes.jp/main/html/rd/p/000000421.000014847.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a> (which is entirely in Japanese, so we're using machine translation),&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders&nbsp;</em>sales have shot past four million, and the game seemingly continues to grow in popularity, too, having reached a record 700,000 concurrent users across all platforms this week.</p>

<p><em>Arc Raiders&nbsp;</em>is still the <a href="https://steamdb.info/stats/globaltopsellers/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">best-selling</a> piece of software on Steam at time of writing, too. The game is beating popular rivals like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dispatch-sales-1m-10-days" rel="nofollow">Telltale-style adventure&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dispatch-sales-1m-10-days" rel="nofollow">Dispatch</a>&nbsp;</em>and FPS&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-6-sales-7m" rel="nofollow">Battlefield 6</a>&nbsp;</em>to the (second from) top spot, something about which Embark is no doubt thrilled.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/arc-raiders-sales-4m-hiding.jpg?itok=m-kr2njn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/arc-raiders-sales-4m-hiding.jpg?itok=_0K8qbnf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Arc Raiders&nbsp;</em>is really making a name for itself.</figcaption></figure><p>It's an impressive feat for a game that has had a somewhat lengthy and complex development history. Originally revealed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-announcement-from-game-awards-2021" rel="nofollow">back in 2021</a>, Embark's game was originally intended to be a co-op third-person shooter set for release in 2022, but it was subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/arc-raiders-delay-pushes-release-date-to-2023" rel="nofollow">delayed into 2023</a>.</p>

<p>Following that delay, Embark revealed that the game's scope had been changed, and that it would now be a PvPvE extraction shooter along the lines of&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov&nbsp;</em>or Bungie's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shocking-no-one-bungies-marathon-delayed" rel="nofollow">upcoming&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>reboot</a>.</p>

<p>The game was released on October 30th to a positive reception, although it garnered some criticism for its use of generative AI to create some voice lines (and it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/examining-generative-ais-usage-in-steam-next-fest-2025" rel="nofollow">far from the only game</a> on Steam to use that technology).</p>

<p><em>Arc Raiders&nbsp;</em>sees players descending into a post-apocalyptic landscape in order to do battle with both lethal ARC machines and roving squads of other players, gathering loot and attempting to survive until extraction.</p>




<p>If you're interested in giving&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders&nbsp;</em>a go, you can pick it up right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1808500/ARC_Raiders/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/arc-raiders/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/arc-raiders/9ndf1f263rz4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> (and it sounds like now really is the time to do so, judging by the size of the player base). Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sony Sales Up but Income Down as Bungie and Destiny 2 Disappoint]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-q2-2025-26-destiny-2-bungie</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-sales-up-but-income-down-as-bungie-and-destiny-2-disappoint.1349902/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has released its financial statement for the second quarter of the 2025-26 fiscal year, and it looks like Bungie and&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2&nbsp;</em>aren't doing the business the Japanese tech giant had hoped for on acquisition.</p>

<p>As revealed in Sony's <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/25q2_sonypre.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">latest financial presentation</a>, sales in the company's gaming sector increased by 4% when compared to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-financials-q1-2025" rel="nofollow">previous quarter</a>, but operating income fell by 13% across the same period, and Sony puts this down largely to "impairment losses" relating to&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2&nbsp;</em>and Bungie.</p>

<p>In an accompanying <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/25q2_sonyspeech.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">document</a>, Sony says that&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>'s "sales and user engagement" haven't reached "the expectations [Sony] had at the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-is-acquiring-destiny-2-developer-bungie" rel="nofollow">time of the acquisition of Bungie</a>". The publisher therefore "downwardly revised" its "business projection" as a result of this underperformance.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/destiny-2-bungie-sony-financials-q2-2025.jpg?itok=kxbQ7xl6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/destiny-2-bungie-sony-financials-q2-2025.jpg?itok=XSw5znDZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Destiny 2&nbsp;</em>hasn't proven the golden goose Sony apparently hoped it would be.</figcaption></figure><p>Sony contrasts&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>'s disappointing performance with that of&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>, which it says is performing "extremely well", with sales of the game "significantly increas[ing]" due both to its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-xbox-series-xs-august" rel="nofollow">release on Xbox Series X|S</a> and "increased engagement from existing users on PS5 and PC".</p>

<p><em>Ghost of Yotei</em>, which was released in October, has apparently already surpassed the three-million sales mark as well, which makes it "a major hit like its predecessor", according to Sony.</p>

<p>Exactly why&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;Bungie have disappointed Sony isn't clear from this presentation, but the game's player numbers have <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1085660/charts/#6m" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">plummeted</a> in recent months (although it is worth noting that the game hasn't received a major expansion since July).</p>

<p>This will almost certainly be making Sony anxious about&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>, Bungie's next major project, which still doesn't have a release date after being <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shocking-no-one-bungies-marathon-delayed" rel="nofollow">delayed indefinitely back in June</a>.</p>




<p>That decision was made following the revelation that some of the artwork in&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-marathon-art-stolen" rel="nofollow">had been stolen</a> from an online artist, as well as the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marathon-director-fired-report-bungie" rel="nofollow">firing of the game's director</a> last spring after he was hit with misconduct allegations.</p>

<p>Despite Sony's disappointment in Bungie and&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>, the company says that over 40% of its revenue this quarter came from live-service games, so this isn't likely to mark a return to single-player shooters on Bungie's part. Stay tuned for more.</p>
