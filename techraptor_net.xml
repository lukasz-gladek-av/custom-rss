</ul><p>The production of a <em>Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy</em> accessory line was expected given the pedigree of both series. <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> debuted in 1993 and is widely considered one of the most popular TCGs of all time. For over 30 years, it has entertained millions of players with accessible gameplay, complex epic fantasy lore, and crossovers with other properties like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/lord-of-rings-tales-of-middle-earth-details-emerge" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Lord of the Rings</em></a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/doctor-who-commander-decks-will-have-50-new-cards-each" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Doctor Who</em></a>.</p>

<p>Alternatively, <em>Final Fantasy</em> is one of the most beloved and enduring RPG series in the world. It debuted in 1987 on the NES and has slowly expanded into a sprawling series packed with iconic characters, imaginative worlds, and compelling storytelling. It has produced sixteen mainline entries and several spin-offs like <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/doctor-who-commander-decks-will-have-50-new-cards-each" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">F</a><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/doctor-who-commander-decks-will-have-50-new-cards-each" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">inal Fantasy Tactics</a></em>.</p>

<p>The <em>Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy</em> crossover set will release June 13.&nbsp;</p>
