      <div><p>Mark Rosewater has released a sneak peek at the next <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> set. The new <em>Lorwyn Eclipsed</em> teaser has provided tiny snippets of information regarding the set's new cards, creature types, and gameplay mechanics. Here is what was revealed.</p><p>Like all prior glimpses behind the curtain, the <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Lorwyn Eclipsed teaser was revealed through a post on Rosewater's <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/markrosewater/803004920167120896/maros-lorwyn-eclipsed-teaser-before-previews" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Tumblr account</a>. As is tradition with <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-tarkir-dragonstorm-teaser-gives-fans-sneak-peek" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">past sneak peeks</a>, the teaser contains partial information, snippets of game text devoid of context, in four distinct batches. These are designed to give dedicated <em>Magic</em> players a small glimpse at how the new set may change the play dynamics at the table.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The first batch reads as follows:</p><div><ul><li><span>A planeswalker that makes Kithkin creature tokens</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>Kindred reprints</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>Some counters in the set: charge, dream, flying, first strike, indestructible, and lifelink</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>Another card in the Thirst for ________ series</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>Another card that makes something a Coward</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>A card that tutors every turn</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>A new card that copies triggers</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>A keyword introduced in 2025 returns</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>A number of Lorwyn/Shadowmoor block mechanics have cameos</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>Some tokens in the set: 1/1 colorless Shapeshifter, 1/1 blue/black Faerie, 2/2 black and green Elf, 3/3 green Elk, and 3/4 green Treefolk</span></li></ul><p><span>As per usual, some of this information is straightforward. A Planeswalker that makes Kithkin tokens isn't too wild, given the Kithkin are a major race in Lorwyn. The return of certain Lorwyn and Shadowmoor block mechanics is expected as well.</span></p><p><span>But there are some pleasant surprises. Various Kindred cards getting reprinted is sure to delight players who use any color in their decks. There are also some head-turning phrases. A new card that copies triggers is interesting since it can potentially lead to greater multi-card combos, and a returning keyword from 2025 could mean anything.</span></p><p><span>The second batch of the Lorwyn Eclipsed teaser focuses on rules text. For those interested in how this set may shift the meta, this is where a lot of speculation lies. The batch reads as follows:</span></p><ul><li>“As this artifact enters, choose Elemental, Elf, Faerie, Giant, Goblin, Kithkin, Merfolk, or Treefolk.”</li><li>“where X is the difference between its power and toughness.”</li><li>“Counter all spells your opponents control”</li><li>“Spend only to cast spells with a mana value 4 or greater.”</li><li>“If this is the third time this ability has resolved this turn,”</li><li>“This creature enters with six -1/-1 counters.”</li><li>“At the beginning of each end step, if you put a counter on a creature this turn,”</li><li>"You may cast that card without paying its mana cost if the spell’s mana value is less than or equal to the amount of life you gained this turn.”</li><li>“Add X {G} or X {W} where X is the number of other creatures you control.”</li><li>“Double all damage that sources you control of the chosen type would deal.”</li></ul><p>As expected, the rules text covers many different playstyles. Control decks will enjoy just countering all enemy spells. Those who enjoy high-cost cards may enjoy a resource for cards costing four or more. And there is some mechanics around tokens for those who like engines that ramp up.</p><p>Some rules do stand out. Doubling all damage a chosen type deals can potentially lead to novel twists on burn playstyles, and a card that can be played for free based on life gain could mean a new focus on White spells and life gain.</p><p>The third and final batches of the Lorwyn Eclipsed teaser focus on creature types and card names in the set. Those batches read as follows:</p><ul><li>Creature – Kithkin Ranger</li><li>Creature – Elemental Scout</li><li>Creature – Faerie Assassin</li><li>Creature – Noggle Rogue</li><li>Creature – Goblin Sorcerer</li><li>Creature – Ouphe</li><li>Creature – Giant Mercenary</li><li>Creature – Treefolk Cleric</li><li>Creature – Horse Serpent</li><li>Legendary Creature – Elf Faerie Noble</li></ul><div><ul><li><span>Bark of Doran</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>Champions of the Perfect</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>Chaos Spewer</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>Flitterwing Nuisance</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>Gilt-Leaf’s Embrace</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>Glister Bairn</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>Mirrorform</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>Moonglove Extractor</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>Moonshadow</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>Scuzzback Scrounger</span></li></ul><p><span>Generally, this batch is full of expected terms for </span><em><span>Lorwyn Eclipsed</span></em><span>. It is a faerie-coded set, so much so it is now </span><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dd-beyond-digital-supplement-lorwyn-first-light-brings-fey-mischief" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><span>part of the Feywild</span></a><span> in </span><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em><span>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</span></em></a>. As such, seeing Faerie Assassins, Elf Faerie Nobles, and Goblin Sorcerors are not surprising. As for the names, they do hold interesting connotations for the rules presented above.</p><p>Lorwyn Eclipsed is set to release worldwide on January 23, 2026.</p></div></div></div>
