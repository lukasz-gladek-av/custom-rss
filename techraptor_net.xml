            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new prewritten adventure is available for free on D&amp;D Beyond. To promote the upcoming Forgotten Realms books coming to <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> 2024, Wizards of the Coast is releasing one of the book's new adventures, <em>The Tenebrous Stone</em>, as part of a sneak peek.</p>



<p>According to a post on <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/2084-claim-your-copy-of-the-tenebrous-stone-adventure" rel="nofollow">D&amp;D Beyond</a>, the free adventure being released is intended for level 3 adventurers. It is a "Deity Adventure" set in Helmsdale. An adventuring party is sent to a basalt quarry to track down an evil artifact. On their journey, they will face down dark cultists and undead horrors. This one-shot adventure is designed to be completed in about 2-3 hours.</p>

This contains brief, high-level notes about the adventure and a breakdown of key encounters. Additionally, the adventure features digital maps and monsters on the platform's Maps VTT. This isn't to be confused with their dedicated VTT, Sigil, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-closes-doors-on-sigil-dd-beyond-vtt" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ending support</a> at the end of this month.</p>

<p>In short, this adventure is a solid starting point for new adventurers, online or otherwise.</p>

<p>The Tenebrous Stone is just one prewritten adventure that appears in the upcoming Forgotten Realms: Adventures in Faerun book. According to its listing, the book will contain over 50 prewritten adventures and 52 maps, all packed with adventures for heroes of all stripes. It is being sold alongside a player supplement that will include new subclasses, spells, magic items, and a new <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-previews-dungeons-dragons-2024-circle-magic-in-new-forgotten-realms" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Circle Magic</a> gameplay mechanic.</p>

<p>There is no expiration date given for <em>The Tenebrous Stone's</em> availability on D&amp;D Beyond. However, given WOTC has done similar promos before, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/spelljammer-academy-on-dd-beyond-for-free" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">previewing monster</a> statblocks ahead of Spelljammer, providing a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dungeons-and-dragons-vecna-5e-statblock-revealed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">new 5e statblock</a> for The Whispered One, Vecna, and even released official statblocks for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/baldurs-gate-3-character-sheets-released-by-wizards-of-coast" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">cast of <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a>, it is wise to pick up the adventure now while you can.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>My time machine to return to 2012 must have worked. A co-op centric shooter reboot of <em>Painkiller</em>, a 2004 title that originally didn’t feature co-op centric gameplay, looking to emulate the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/10-years-of-left-4-dead-hunters-and-boomers-and-smokers-oh-my" rel="nofollow"><em>Left 4 Dead</em></a>? There’s still work to be done. I need to hoard some <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/counter-strike-global-offensive" rel="nofollow"><em>Counter-Strike</em></a> skins and make sure <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinion/why-microsoft-looking-sonys-dinner-sales-floor" rel="nofollow">Xbox doesn’t shoot itself in the foot</a> to create a substantially healthier console war atmosphere.</p>

<p>This is the latest title from Polish developers Anshar Studios, a studio typically involved in providing assistance, most notably for teams like Bloober (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/silent-hill-2-remake-revives-classic" rel="nofollow">Silent Hill 2</a>, Layers of Fear), and Larian (<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/baldurs-gate-3" rel="nofollow">Baldur’s Gate III</a>). Other than that, they’ve also dabbled in the likes of CRPGs with <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/gamedec" rel="nofollow">Gamedec</a>, and experimented with VR in the form of Detached and Telefrag. It’s clear they’ve got charisma and the variance to match it.</p>

<p>You play as one of four individuals, tasked by Metatron, the Voice of God, to prevent Azazel’s invasion of Earth by way of an endless demon horde. These characters are composed of Ink, a no-nonsense female mercenary type, Roch, a brutish individual displaying Dwarfish personality traits, Void, a strangely geeky individual who seems to play the straight man, and Sol, a devilish minx type who cosplays as a nun.</p>



<p>Judging from the eye test, <em>Painkiller </em>doesn’t <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/painkiller-preview-classic-fps-back-from-purgatory" rel="nofollow">leave a lot to hope for</a>. Similar to the gothic environments on display, this cold, almost cynical portrayal of Hell and how you interact with it immediately leaves a bitter taste in your mouth. With that said, it’s not like <em>Painkiller</em>’s name is being inexplicably ripped away from its legacy, a la the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/prey-review-dont-fear-reaper" rel="nofollow"><em>Prey</em> </a>reboot, and indeed, an outcome similar to <em>Prey WAS </em>possible.</p>

<p>For example, the weapons that made the original game famous have returned and are modernized, like the titular “Painkiller” and electro-shuriken shooter, and for the most part, the weapons feel great. Standard additions such as the shotgun and rocket launcher have the feedback to provide catharsis, although the aforementioned electro-shuriken shooter fails to have the same oomph as times past. This may be due to the enemy variety also, as all of them are squishy vessels for ultra-gibbing and shiny red gore, pressed under the modern demand for video games, so the lack of a visible body count hurts proceedings.</p>

<p>Also, no skeleton warriors. Boo!</p>



<p>All 4 characters have a preset perk, their only defining factor of difference in gameplay styles, and all of them are a borderline for co-op synergy. With that said, synergy is saved for the returning tarot card system, which is executed wonderfully in the core gameplay loop. There are 1 or 2 outliers that are able to single-handedly win you a run, with bots or otherwise, but the ones that offer baseline buffs tend to be felt in actual gameplay.</p>

<p>There’s also a scoring system attached to general proceedings, one which is largely negligible in terms of what it rewards, that being simple kills. Sure, there are minuscule bonuses attached when you kill an enemy with a certain element, but the rewards for it are, frankly, invisible. You never really feel like you get more gold or XP after a match, whether you score 3 million points or 30 million, which is disappointing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Levels themselves are largely linear, sprinkled with gold, small amounts of team banter, and arena standoffs. With the latter, you’ll either have to transport a barrel-shaped object from one area to the next, or survive against 3 enemy waves – and it’ll always be 3 enemy waves. Respectively, they’re a test of brain and brawn, and for Painkiller itself, a showcase of how not to transplant this type of gameplay into a co-op core.</p>



<p>The problem here is pace. <em>Painkiller </em>wants to host&nbsp;a lot of free-running flow in its mechanics and level design, with slides, dashes, and grappling available, in very strict, suffocating doses. In reality, the rugged and otherwise decrepit portrayal of the visual design and arenas leads to an attainable flow not being possible. You’ll more than likely slide for a second before a bump or outcropping of rocks stops you dead.</p>

<p>Due to a completely arbitrary stamina system attached to the movement mechanics, and the generally low base speed of your characters, teamwork is more forced than generated naturally. It’s really easy to get swarmed, and the character perks and systems aren’t there to substantiate a system that doesn't just result in corner camping. You’ll almost always be a squishy, quippy – unbearingly quippy – hunk of meat with bullets coming out of it.</p>

<p>The writing is also another bag of worms. Before you’ve even faced your first demon, characters will be drenching every line with such sour, grotesque flavors of ironic detestability, as if Purgatory is only showing Joss Whedon films. There’s no variety in the dialogue either, so each of the 9 levels present in the base game will present you with the exact same exposition, and the exact same call-outs, and the exact same insufferable jokes.</p>



<p>There is absolutely no reason for this. No one was asking Daniel Garner in the original <em>Painkiller </em>to punctuate his later adventures with references to <em>Deuce Bigalow</em>, and what exactly do these one-note personalities add to proceedings? Why does Void “act” like a charming robot, despite being some nebulous, unknown vessel? If it’s due to the lack of modern context, why does everyone have a modern lexicon?</p>

<p>It sounds nitpicky, but when you have to hear the same thing every single run, with no variance in the arenas, their spawns, their dialogue, or otherwise, it grows into this incessant banter-y beast. It’s not funny hearing Sol’s dominatrix quips for the 100th time; it’s not funny hearing Azazel act like Barney from <em>How I Met Your Mother</em>. There is no character growth here, just pointless jokes while history and context are all buried behind a completely codex of flavorless history, which feels antithetical to what characters and their personalities generate.</p>

<p>As harsh as it is to say, this co-op function is the worst part of&nbsp;<em>Painkiller</em>, which is why you should focus on yourself. Play with bots, create your own rampage, and find yourself in a much better position than worrying about your teammates. The bot AI is an over-performer in terms of the issues it faces, and it seems Anshar is aware of any potential issues, which is why it'll teleport to any location almost on demand.</p>



<h2><em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>Review | Final Verdict</h2>

<p>When it comes down to it, Painkiller is a shooter set in Hell, stylistically and substantially so. But when compared to the competition, games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/doom-2016" rel="nofollow"><em>DOOM</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/first-person-spotlight-quake" rel="nofollow"><em>Quake</em></a>, <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/bpm-bullets-per-minute-review" rel="nofollow">BPM: Bullets Per Minute</a></em>, <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dread-templar" rel="nofollow">Dread Templar</a></em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/metal-hellsinger" rel="nofollow"><em>Metal: Hellsinger</em></a>, <em>Shadows of the Damned</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/ultrakill" rel="nofollow"><em>Ultrakill</em></a>, <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/warstride-challenges" rel="nofollow">Warstride Challenges</a></em>, <em>Killing Floor</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/prodeus" rel="nofollow"><em>Prodeus</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dusk" rel="nofollow"><em>Dusk</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/devil-daggers-review-giving-devil-its-due" rel="nofollow"><em>Devil Daggers</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/originals/first-person-saturday-blood" rel="nofollow"><em>Blood</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/originals/coverage-club-nightmare-reaper-is-brutal-callback-to-fps-golden-age" rel="nofollow"><em>Nightmare Reaper</em></a>, and even&nbsp;<em>Clive Barker's Jericho</em>? This is a graveyard of creativity by comparison, spawned from the corpse of a world that flourished before.</p>

  <div>
      <div><p>The Combined Army, under the command of the alien AI, the Evolved Intelligence, has recruited the hero Achilles from humanity's AI, Aleph, to lead a combined force of aliens and enhanced humans under the banner of the Next Wave. But Achilles hasn't abandoned humanity, but has changed sides to save it. In this article, we check out the first release for <em>Infinity's</em> newest sectorial, the Next Wave Action Pack.</p>

<p><em>Infinity N5 </em>launched last year with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/infinity-operation-sandtrap-review-launch-of-infinity-n5" rel="nofollow">Operation Sandtrap</a> box, and those who've been reading my articles for a while will know that I started my own <em>Infinity</em> journey with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/infinity-jsa-army-pack-review-take-to-war-with-cyber-ninjas-and-samurai-power" rel="nofollow">JSA launch box</a> back in 2018 when the JSA broke away from Yu Jing and became a non-aligned army, before finally becoming their own standalone faction in the current edition of&nbsp;<em>Infinity, N5</em>.</p>




<h2>Humanity Evolved</h2>

<p>The Evolved Intelligence is an alien AI that has destroyed and assimilated multiple worlds and races to its cause. Its forces are known as the Combined Army, specially selected races and units that serve in specific roles. We've previously looked at the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/infinity-morat-aggression-forces-guide" rel="nofollow">Morat Aggression Forces</a>, the mailed fist of the Combined Army. Now, the EI has unleashed its newest force, the Next Wave, a combined force of alien races and humans that have defected from the control of ALEPH, humanity's AI.</p>

<p>The <em>Infinity</em> Next Wave Action Pack contains 10 miniatures that are exclusive to the Next Wave sectorial, so don't feature in the wider Combined Army faction. The action pack contains:</p>

<ul><li>3 Harbingers (2x Combi Rifle, 1x Hacker) - These are the Next Wave line infantry and can be upgraded to Paramedic, Lieutenant, or Comlink Specialist with the Combi-Rifle profile. They come with Dodge +3 as standard and Combat Instinct, which makes them difficult to catch off guard. The extra skills throughout the Next Wave profiles are what set them apart from the human line infantry in other forces.</li>
	<li>1 Contrabandolero (Boarding Shotgun) - This unit is designed to sneak with&nbsp;Hidden deployment, Infiltration with a bonus to the check, Stealth, Surprise Attack, Dodge +3, and Mimetism -3, and if that wasn't enough, can specialize&nbsp;as&nbsp;a Hacker, Minelaye,&nbsp;or Forward Observer.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>1 Cliff-Jumper (Boarding Shotgun) - This unit, as the name would suggest, is a specialist parachutist who also comes with +1Burst to make their ranged weapons more effective.</li>
	<li>1 Ironside (HMG) - This heavy infantry unit&nbsp;is made up of humans&nbsp;melded with a technorganic device attached to their spine. Their&nbsp;Albedo equipment means that units targeting them with specialist abilities and equipment take a negative modifier, and their BS-3 skill means that they're more likely to win opposed shooting rolls.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>2x Raindancer (1x Red Fury, 1x Contender) - These are close combat specialists with Dodge +3 and +2 inches, Mimetism -6, and Stealth to help them close up. Despite being close combat focused, both of these profiles have soldi ranged weapons to use as they move up the field.</li>
	<li>1 Tekdraken Steeljaw (Boarding Pistol) - The Tekdrakens have 2 different types in Next Wave. The Steeljaw versions are the close combat specialists. They are fast with&nbsp;a 6-4 move, as you might expect from a cybernetically boosted dinosaur. You can also pay an extra point to give them a combi-rifle turret (and you should, because it looks awesome).</li>
	<li>Pandora (Viral Pistol) - This special character is a pitcher deployer, meaning she&nbsp;can fire a repeater token to extend her hacking area. She's also key here because she is a Fireteam Master, so she can join a Fireteam with the Tekdrakens to keep them in line.</li>
</ul><figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/infinity-combined-army-next-wave-action-pack-3.jpg?itok=NGZopXU0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/infinity-combined-army-next-wave-action-pack-3.jpg?itok=hCNzjr-I 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Infinity</em> Next Wave Tekdraken is a literal TechRaptor!</figcaption></figure><p>From what we can tell, Next Wave is going to have a lot of focus on multiple small fire teams, with some solid infantry, lizard/dinosaur heavy-hitting units, and the special characters that made the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/infinity-codeone-operation-blackwind-guide" rel="nofollow">Steel Phalanx</a> awesome.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/infinity-combined-army-next-wave-action-pack-4.jpg?itok=ENrm9v3g 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/infinity-combined-army-next-wave-action-pack-4.jpg?itok=sLrvfZLP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you order within the pre-order window, you can grab the&nbsp;<em>Infinity</em> Next Wave Action Pack bundle and preorder exclusive Glyph Warcor.</figcaption></figure><h2>What's Next For The Next Wave?</h2>

<p>Releasing alongside the Next Wave Action Pack as part of the pre-order, is the Juggernaut, who, rather than standard TAG which are piloted armoured suits, is a technorganic giant cat with a rider. The juggernaut comes with an 8-2 move and a multi-HMG with -1 to the opponent's saving throw.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The special pre-order bonus for Next Wave is the Glyph Warcor, an alien journalist with the standard Dodge +3 that the Next Wave infantry has. They can have either sixth sense, which lets them respond to attacks outside of their normal arc, or the 360-degree visor, which lets them shoot outside of their normal arc.</p>

<p>After that, we expect the rest of the faction to fill out with a release a month, along the same lines as previous factions, with their named characters, and more awesome alien fusion (and the other flavor of TechRaptor, I mean Tekdraken).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/infinity-combined-army-next-wave-action-pack-5.jpg?itok=GKFfQbAi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/infinity-combined-army-next-wave-action-pack-5.jpg?itok=flnSQGda 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The <em>Infinity</em> Next Wave Juggernaut miniature is a break from standard TAGs, and features a mounted rider.</figcaption></figure><h2>Infinity Next Wave Action Pack Final Thoughts?</h2>

<p>The Next Wave looks awesome. The layered plates and reptilian texture on their armor make them look like the fusion of human and alien that they are. The fact that they have a literal TechRaptor is a bonus. They also stand out, and the wealth of abilities on top of their stats makes them seem like humanity evolved. Outside of the Action Pack, the Juggernaunt miniature is incredible, and I love that rather than go the standard TAG route, we've got a full mounted cavalry unit. I can't wait to see the named characters as they get introduced to the faction, and what other alien fusions come along.</p>
