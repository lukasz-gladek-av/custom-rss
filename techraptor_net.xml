<p>If you're not familiar with <em>2XKO</em>, it's a <em>League of Legends</em>-themed fighting game that includes characters from the celebrated MOBA.</p><p>Announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/league-of-legends-fighting-game-officially-named-2xko-as-spectacular-new-gameplay-is" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f3ec28b2-9e16-4ae6-a24a-11a8af39db67" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">back in 2024</a> (well, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-project-l-gameplay-details-revealed-by-riot" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6b4d1a85-12a2-46e6-82af-d985715a9e5d" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">officially, at any rate</a>), the game features characters like Illaoi, Yasuo, and Teemo, and new characters are being added over time, so if your favorite isn't in the game yet, they may well be introduced soon.</p><p>After being in development for some years, <em>2XKO </em>launched in Early Access <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/2xko-early-access-release-date" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f9a82e6e-d1fa-4755-bf89-d3f786e17e74" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">in October last year</a>. It's free-to-play, so you can check it out without paying a penny if you want to, and presumably, the console releases will follow the same model.</p><p>The next champion to arrive in <em>2XKO </em>will be the sniper Caitlyn, and presumably, she'll be launching at the same time as the game does on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. That hasn't technically been announced yet, but we can probably expect a reveal when the trailer is officially launched.</p>
<p><em>2XKO </em>is available to <a href="https://2xko.riotgames.com/en-gb/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">play right now for free on PC</a>, and it'll presumably be hitting PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S on January 20th. We'll have to wait and see whether that turns out to be the case or not. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
