            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-layoffs-january-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yet another round of layoffs has hit Microsoft, affecting employees working at the tech giant's gaming division, as well as two of its other divisions.</p>

<p>A report by <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-layoffs-hit-security-devices-sales-gaming-2025-1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Business Insider</a> (which is paywalled; we're using additional reporting by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/microsoft-to-lay-off-unknown-number-of-staff" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GamesIndustry.biz</a>) cites a spokesperson as saying that a small number of Microsoft employees would be affected, although the spokesperson stopped short of saying how many constitutes that small number.</p>

<p>Given that Microsoft is a massive company that employs hundreds of thousands of people, a small number could refer to tens of employees, a few hundred, or even a few thousand; anything short of thousands and thousands of employees being laid off would likely be a drop in the ocean for Microsoft.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/microsoft-layoffs-january-2025-flight-sim.jpg?itok=0Vm9UEUt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/microsoft-layoffs-january-2025-flight-sim.jpg?itok=KUruUp6Q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Microsoft's latest round of layoffs affect employees in gaming, as well as other divisions.</figcaption></figure><p>In addition to the gaming division, the latest layoffs also affect employees in Microsoft's security and sales departments, although we don't know what proportion of employees were laid off across each division.</p>

<p>As noted by GI.biz, the spokesperson said that these layoffs weren't related to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/08/microsoft-confirms-performance-based-job-cuts-across-departments.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">performance-based job cuts</a> announced last week, so it doesn't sound like these employees are being let go because their performance is unsatisfactory (or not solely because of that, anyway).</p>

<p>Back in January last year, Microsoft apparently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">laid off almost 2,000 staff</a> solely from its gaming division, with Xbox head Phil Spencer reportedly claiming the cuts were part of reaching a "sustainable cost structure" to support Xbox's "growing business".</p>

<p>Of course, those layoffs didn't prevent CEO Satya Nadella from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-ceo-payrise-layoffs" rel="nofollow">scoring a payrise</a> to the tune of tens of millions of dollars. Perish the thought that the C-suite could perhaps absorb some of the cost when it comes to considering layoffs.</p>

<p>It'll feature looks at games like&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>South of Midnight</em>, as well as a reveal for a brand new game, although reports suggest that game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/oblivion-remake-reportedly-confirmed" rel="nofollow">won't be the long-rumored <i>Oblivion&nbsp;</i>remake</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-ending-dumb</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-ending-is-really-dumb.1082832/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-ending-dumb<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rocksteady has released the final update for&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em>, and it looks like the joke's on you if you're still invested in the game's narrative for some reason.</p>

<p>Over on social media platform X, content creator Synth Potato <a href="https://x.com/SynthPotato/status/1879239456320032790" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">posted</a> the game's final cutscene in its entirety. It takes the form of a&nbsp;<em>Redfall</em>-style 2D animated storyboard cutscene, probably - as Synth Potato notes - "due to budget cuts".</p>

<p>The cutscene is narrated by Harley Quinn, who tells the story of how she and the Suicide Squad entered Brainiac's lair only to find Superman alive and well (and, notably, not Brainiac-possessed). It turns out that the evil Justice League wiped out in the main story were just clones. Of course.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-ending-superman.jpg?itok=-JFeShDJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-ending-superman.jpg?itok=0Phn5dIy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You can't scare me, Superman. You're just a clone.</figcaption></figure><p>The whole thing turns out to have been one of Batman's characteristically complex plans, although when Batman asks how the Suicide Squad knew the Justice League were clones, Quinn says they didn't. Ha, and indeed, ha.</p>

<p>Superman then says the Justice League needs to "atone" and put as many worlds right as it can, while Harley and the Suicide Squad get their collars shorted by the "wonder trio of Hack, Lawless, and Toyboy", pledging to go on a "road trip".</p>

<p>It's all exactly as abrupt and nonsensical as it sounds. I'll put my cards on the table and admit I didn't play&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em>, so I have no idea whether this is a satisfying ending to the story or not, but I'm going to hedge my bets and say that it isn't.</p>

<p>In case you need a reminder, Rocksteady <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-seasons-ending-in-january-offline-mode" rel="nofollow">announced back in December</a> that&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em>'s fourth season would be its last, and that an offline mode would be added in order to allow players to play without an online connection.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-harley-gang.jpg?itok=bZwP6Owb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-harley-gang.jpg?itok=KkqqP2ok 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em>'s ending is unlikely to have many fans.</figcaption></figure><p>This decision was almost certainly made due to&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em>'s terminally small player base, as well as the fact that its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-kill-justice-leagues-sales-disappointed-hogwarts-legacy-is-big-win" rel="nofollow">disappointing sales</a> contributed to a $200 million loss for publisher Warner Bros.</p>

<p>It seems to me that the best thing one can say about this ending is that it technically leaves the door open for another game in the&nbsp;<em>Batman: Arkham&nbsp;</em>series, although with longtime voice actor Kevin Conroy now sadly no longer with us, that might not be such a good idea. Stay tuned for more.</p>

<hr><h2>Third Place -&nbsp;Destiny 2</h2>



<p>Developer: Bungie | Release Date: September 6th, 2017</p>

<p>Written by Tyler Chancey</p>

<p><em>Destiny 2</em> has reached a new era. After ten years of being the series that popularized the live service shooter, its current state is less a complete fall and more of a denouement. The main story regarding The Witness has been resolved, but there are still lingering story threads being set up by Bungie's team. Threads that are potentially less cosmic in scope.</p>

<p>Players have been given the most tools to explore the combat sandbox to date. Weapons with the most exotic support mods. Prismatic subclasses allowing for greater player expression. It is a gameplay loop the fanbase has become intimately familiar with, for better or for worse.</p>

<p>The state of the game is a far cry from where it started. But this year, Bungie can officially say that their decade-long story came to its conclusion</p>

<h2>Second Place - Fortnite</h2>



<p>Developer: Epic Games | Release Date: September 26th, 2017</p>

<p>Written by Blair Bishop</p>

<p>Three things in life are certain: Death, taxes, and <em>Fortnite</em>. As Epic continues to embellish and reinforce the creative aspects of what’s possible inside their game, what’s spawned is now a nearly-endless cavalcade of combat game modes, quirky reenactions of multiplayer hits like <em>Phasmophobia </em>and <em>Battlefield</em>, and it’s breathtaking to watch.</p>

<p>That isn’t to detract from its primetime Battle Royale mode, however, which continues to shake up and modify the formula in many different ways. With the re-introduction of <em>Fortnite</em>’s OG island towards the end of the year, it’s clear that Epic are looking to recognize the history of the game that brought them to the peak, and has continued to since 2017.</p>

<h2>Winner - Helldivers 2</h2>



<p>Developer: Arrowhead Game Studios | Release Date: February 8th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Dan Rockwood</p>

<p>When <em>Helldivers 2</em> dropped last February, it offered an impressive array of gameplay options with two battle passes (Warbonds), countless ship and stratagem options, and a wide assortment of maps on two fronts with a variety of mission objectives. Now, nearly a year later, the game has expanded multiple times, cementing its legacy from just another live service game to one of the most iconic titles of 2024.</p>

<p>Though there were issues along the way, like nerfing fire weaponry immediately ahead of releasing the Freedom's Flame Warbond, or requiring Steam players to create and link a PlayStation Network account, these have been largely rectified through patches, indicating to players that Arrowhead Game Studios is listening to their needs.</p>

<p>Today,<em> Helldivers 2</em> offers many more options for new and returning players. There's now a whole new enemy added to the frontlines: the Illuminate alien race, new planets to fight on, vehicles to commandeer, and multiple new warbonds that offer unlockable weapons, armor, and more. With so many changes that helped improve the game throughout 2024, it's exciting to see what the next year will bring.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortunes-run-developer-prison</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortunes-run-development-halted-as-developer-sentenced-to-prison.1082796/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortunes-run-developer-prison<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Development on sci-fi immersive sim FPS&nbsp;<em>Fortune's Run&nbsp;</em>is being halted, and it's because the developer has been sentenced to three years in prison. Yes, you read that right.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1692240/view/532087801681805318" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news update on Steam</a>, developer Dizzie, who is now "the sole developer" of&nbsp;<em>Fortune's Run</em>, shares that they've been "sentenced to prison for the next three years", describing the sentencing as "a long story".</p>

<p>According to Dizzie, they've been going through the legal process for their case all the time that they've been working on&nbsp;<em>Fortune's Run</em>. They say that they were "a very violent person" and that they "hurt a lot of people in [their life]".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fortunes-run-development-stopped-dev-prison-punch.jpg?itok=MBQpS2KX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fortunes-run-development-stopped-dev-prison-punch.jpg?itok=beU8Mmhl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Development on&nbsp;<em>Fortune's Run&nbsp;</em>has been halted for the foreseeable future.</figcaption></figure><p>Cryptically, Dizzie says that "the other developer" on&nbsp;<em>Fortune's Run&nbsp;</em>has left the project, stating that after she recovered from "botched surgery", she decided she no longer wanted to work as a game developer.</p>

<p>Dizzie says that their case doesn't relate to&nbsp;<em>Fortune's Run</em>'s other developer, Arachne, who is - or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1692240/view/4234028300480496465" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">was, at one point</a> - Dizzie's wife. They also say that their crime is not a "sex crime", but that they're not going to go into specific charges, simply stating that what they did was "wrong".</p>

<p>Before Dizzie's incarceration, however, they have released a major update for&nbsp;<em>Fortune's Run&nbsp;</em>that contains plenty of new story content and gameplay changes. It will invalidate previous save files, though, so you'll have to start a new game if you want to experience it.</p>

<p>You can read the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1692240/view/532087801681805320" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">patch notes for that update right here</a>. Naturally, owing to Dizzie's prison sentence, it may be quite a while before another update for the game is released.</p>




<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Fortune's Run&nbsp;</em>is, it's an immersive sim-style shooter inspired by the likes of&nbsp;<em>Deus Ex&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>EYE: Divine Cybermancy</em>. It also features what the devs call "the campy tone of space operas and titles like&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid</em>".</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Fortune's Run&nbsp;</em>right now on PC <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1692240/Fortunes_Run/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">via Steam Early Access</a>. Again, though, it's probably going to be quite some time before any more content is added to the game, so bear that in mind before you make a purchase.</p>

<hr><h2>Third Place -&nbsp;Destiny 2: The Final Shape</h2>



<p>Developer: Bungie | Release Date: June 4th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Tyler Chancey</p>

<p>Bungie's Light and Darkness saga concluded this year with<em> Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em>. This finale managed to end their space opera tale and deliver the most robust expansion ever to the game.</p>

<p>The Pale Heart location is a stellar showcase of Bungie's impeccable art direction, presenting familiar locations twisted into grotesque corrupted shapes. The story campaign managed a strong blend of pitched gunbattles, haunting imagery, and powerful character moments.</p>

<p>Its fundamental game design reached a zenith with the introduction of Prismatic subclasses and its most challenging Raid to date, Salvation's Edge.</p>

<p><em>Destiny 2: The Final Shap</em>e reminded the world of Bungie's talent and dedication. For an entire generation, this expansion will be what they remember when they imagine what this studio is capable of.</p>

<h2>Second Place - Alan Wake II: The Lake House</h2>



<p>Developer: Remedy Entertainment | Release Date: October 22nd, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Tyler Chancey</p>

<p>While light on runtime, <em>Alan Wake 2: The Lake House</em> continues the atmosphere and overarching themes of the original game. Blending the reality-bending surreality of a world at the whims of Alan's creative process with the sterile procedural office culture of the Federal Bureau of Control.</p>

<p>The level design also manages a similar mix, combining the key-hunting navigation of <em>Control </em>with the meticulous dangerous monster encounters of <em>Alan Wake 2</em>. This is punctuated perfectly with the introduction of the new painted enemies.</p>

<p>In two short hours, <em>Alan Wake 2: The Lake House</em> expands the possibilities of the Remedy Connected Universe and alludes to the nightmares and thrills that we may see in the next title</p>

<h2>Winner - Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</h2>



<p>Developer: FromSoftware | Release Date: June 21st, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Joseph Allen</p>

<p><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em> is longer, more involved, and more rewarding than many full-length games.</p>

<p>Given the huge success of the base game, director Hidetaka Miyazaki and his studio FromSoftware could have just indulged in a victory lap, but that’s never been their style, and <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> is arguably even more ambitious than the foundations upon which it’s built.</p>

<p>This expansion packs in some of <em>Elden Ring</em>’s most beautiful (and horrifying) sights, from ruined, flooded castle courtyards to caves embedded with giant coffins and gorgeous fields full of delicate blue flowers in bloom.</p>

<p>The story you’ll discover as you explore those locations is characteristically obscure, but Miyazaki and company know that if you’re invested in <em>Elden Ring</em> enough to reach the point you need to in order to access <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, you’re in it for the long haul.</p>

<p>It’s that attitude that also allows FromSoftware to craft some of the most involved, satisfying, and occasionally maddening bosses they’ve ever put forth in one of their signature Soulslike action RPGs.</p>

<p>It’s best to know as little as possible about <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>’s gauntlet of boss encounters before playing, so if you’ve yet to experience this near-masterpiece, I won’t go into detail. Suffice it to say that if, for some reason, you thought <em>Elden Ring</em> went too easy on you, <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> will give you the run for your money you want.</p>

<p>Like all of FromSoftware’s work, it’s not perfect, but <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> cements the studio’s legacy as an art-driven collective looking to engage and inspire you with its work rather than simply to help you kill time.</p>
