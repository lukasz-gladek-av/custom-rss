            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Chinese Room co-founder and former creative director Dan Pinchbeck has expressed his regret that&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>wasn't called something different, suggesting that his studio felt the game wouldn't serve as a true sequel to the 2004 cult classic.</p>

<p>In an interview with The Goth Boss Podcast's Cat Burton (via <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/dan-pinchbeck-ex-the-chinese-room-was-aware-they-couldnt-make-the-vtmb2-that-fans-wanted-in-time-and-wanted-paradox-to-call-it-something-else.1362589/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ResetEra user doops</a>), Pinchbeck says that he and a former producer at&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>studio Paradox would hold planning sessions for how to get the producers "to not call it&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines 2</em>".</p>

<p>He says that trying to recreate the "magic" of the original&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines&nbsp;</em>is "wrongheaded" in the modern environment, because the finished product wouldn't make anyone happy; fans of the original would be disappointed, and new players would get a "flawed game that was built too fast and with not enough money".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bloodlines-2-chinese-room-comments-combat.jpg?itok=Nva6RQx- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bloodlines-2-chinese-room-comments-combat.jpg?itok=cHg2jW8J 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There might be a reason&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>doesn't feel much like the first game.</figcaption></figure><p>Pinchbeck reckons that it wasn't possible for The Chinese Room to make a true&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>because the studio had neither the time nor the money to do so; instead, he says his studio approached development from a perspective of what could be done with what it had available.</p>

<p>The result of that was, according to Pinchbeck, something that wasn't&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines 2</em>, nor was it an open-world RPG like&nbsp;<em>Skyrim</em>. Instead, it was something closer to&nbsp;<em>Dishonored</em>, a "tightly focused and true to the mythos" game that, nonetheless, wasn't a&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines&nbsp;</em>sequel.</p>

<p>Judging by the <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/19138/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">critical</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/532790/Vampire_The_Masquerade__Bloodlines_2/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">fan</a> reception to&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines 2</em>, Pinchbeck is right; most people don't really seem to view it as a proper successor to Troika's flawed-but-fun 2004 RPG. Perhaps a change of name might have been a good idea on that front.</p>

<p>Still, even if&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>isn't what it should be, it's perhaps a miracle that the game was released at all, given its lengthy history of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-indefinitely" rel="nofollow">delays</a>, developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-back-developed-by-chinese-room" rel="nofollow">changes</a>, and slightly sketchy <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloodlines-2-toreador-lasombra-paywall-removed" rel="nofollow">monetization practices</a>.</p>

<h2>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Holiday Gift Guide</h2>

<h3>Dungeons &amp; Dragons - Starter Set: Heroes of The Borderlands</h3>

<p>There is nothing better to buy for someone that wants to get into <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> with some friends or family than the Heroes of the Borderlands Starter Set. It comes with everything a brand new player and DM will need to get started playing the game. It's the perfect gift for someone that's been curious to give the game a try.</p>

<p><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-heroes-of-borderlands-review-starter-set-everyone-deserves-to" rel="nofollow">Our review</a> goes into more detail.</p>

<h3>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Stranger Things: Welcome to The Hellfire Club Adventure Game</h3>

<p>For many, <em>D&amp;D</em> caught their eye when <em>Stranger Things</em> came out. If you're a fan of the show, this lets you play as the <em>D&amp;D </em>heroes the characters of the show actually play as. This is great for people new to <em>D&amp;D</em>, with a lot of the same things as the Starter Set above. But, it's also a good time for <em>D&amp;D</em> veterans who want some<em> Stranger Things</em> flavor.</p>

<h3>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024 Dungeon Master's Guide</h3>

<p>Check <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-dungeon-masters-guide-review-true-dms-best-friend" rel="nofollow">our review</a> for more specific information, but if you have anyone you know that's interested in becoming a DM for <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, this is THE book to get. It has all of the information they'll need to get going and is considered one of the core rulebooks of the game. The starter sets may be a better option for someone just dipping their toes, but this is great for someone that's ready to jump in fully.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dungeons-Dragons-Dungeon-Masters-Rulebook/dp/0786969520/?tag=techr051-20" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a></p>

<h3>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024 Player's Handbook</h3>

<p>If you already have the 2014 Player's Handbook and some of the expansions released later, this probably isn't needed. And if someone in the player group has one already, you probably don't need one of your own. But, this is still one of the "core" books for<em> D&amp;D</em> that includes all of the nitty gritty details to play the game. Everything a player would need to know.</p>

<h3>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024 Monster Manual</h3>

<p>This is the final core book that would flesh out just about everything anyone would need to know to play as expansive a game of D&amp;D as they would want. It details all of the most popular monsters in <em>D&amp;D</em>, how to make a monster and use them, and everything else. With the updated layout that is easier to use, this is a great pick up for a veteran <em>D&amp;D</em> fan who may not have sprung for the newer manual yet.</p>
