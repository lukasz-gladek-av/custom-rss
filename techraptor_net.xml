            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-vi-release-date-delay<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rockstar and Take-Two have announced the&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI&nbsp;</em>release date at long last, but if you were hoping for the game to be released this year, then you're going to be disappointed.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://x.com/RockstarGames/status/1918265468076605706" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X,&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI&nbsp;</em>will be launching on May 26th next year, which Rockstar acknowledges is "later than you expected". The studio gives a pretty standard reason for the game's delay; it needs time to "deliver at the level of quality" players expect, and it wants to "try and exceed your expectations".</p>

<p><em>Grand Theft Auto VI&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-released-early-following-leak-coming-in-2025" rel="nofollow">first unveiled in December 2023</a>, with the game's debut trailer achieving a staggering <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-achieved-crazy-90-million-views-in-24-hours" rel="nofollow">90 million views in just 24 hours</a>. At that point,&nbsp;<em>GTA VI&nbsp;</em>was slated for a fall 2025 release.</p>

<p>Despite that, as late as February this year, Take-Two head Strauss Zelnick was claiming that&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI&nbsp;</em>would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gta-6-still-on-track-for-fall" rel="nofollow">still be releasing in the fall</a>, despite the fact that rumors (which turned out to be correct) were swirling at the time pertaining to the game's delay.</p>

<p>Of course, although this probably isn't the news Take-Two was hoping to deliver, it'll come as a relief to many publishers, who can now presumably breathe sighs of relief and release their games towards the end of 2025 without fear.</p>




<p><em>Grand Theft Auto VI&nbsp;</em>will serve as the sixth numbered installment (although it's far from the sixth game overall) in the&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto&nbsp;</em>series.</p>

<p>We don't know much about the game at the moment; it'll be set in the fictional US state of Leonida, in which can be found the Miami-esque Vice City, and it'll feature the series' first major female protagonist. Other than that, it's all up for grabs.</p>

<p>Rockstar will release&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI&nbsp;</em>on May 26th, 2026 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. Stay tuned for more.</p>
