            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Necrosoft and publisher Ysbryd have announced that&nbsp;<em>Demonschool</em>, the long-delayed tactical RPG about balancing demon-hunting and university life, is coming this September.</p>

<p>This news was announced during today's Nintendo Indie World show, but for some reason, the announcement was left out of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-indie-world-august-2025-show" rel="nofollow">the Western presentation</a>; instead, it was revealed during the Japanese show. Strange, but that's life.</p>

<p>Of course, this isn't the first time we've had a promise that&nbsp;<em>Demonschool&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/demonschool-release-date" rel="nofollow">would be launching in September</a>&nbsp;(albeit not this September), but hopefully, the game won't be delayed again and Necrosoft can finally release it. This certainly feels like a full stop rather than a tentative comma.</p>

Inspired by the&nbsp;<em>Persona&nbsp;</em>series, as well as Italian horror movies, the game essentially marries the tactical combat of&nbsp;<em>Into the Breach&nbsp;</em>with the life-sim elements of Atlus' celebrated RPG series.</p>

<p>You play as Faye, the last in a long line of demon-hunters. She "loves to punch up", but she's not just about violence; she's also a caring person, as you'll learn through her relationships with her companions.</p>

<p>Necrosoft is promising a "light horror narrative told through huge avatars with side quests aplenty" in&nbsp;<em>Demonschool</em>; you'll be able to build relationships with each of the game's 15 characters, and doing so will also help you to strengthen your party for combat.</p>

<p>That combat takes the form of a turn-based tactical system in which you can strategically rewind in order to create combos and outfox your opponents. You can also use your environment contextually for extra bonuses.</p>




<p><em>Demonschool&nbsp;</em>will finally be launching across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1900250/Demonschool/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10007754" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch on September 3rd (assuming it doesn't get delayed again, at any rate). Stay tuned for more.</p>
