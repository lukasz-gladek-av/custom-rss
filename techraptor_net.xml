            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and Polyphony Digital have revealed&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>Update 1.62, and in the racing sim's latest update, you can drive a brand new Corvette, plus three more exciting new vehicles.</p>

<p>August's&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>update <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-update-161" rel="nofollow">follows on from July's</a>, in which a very rare car was added to the roster to give you a once-in-a-lifetime driving experience (virtually, of course). This update doesn't have anything quite so rare, but it does have a brand new hypercar that "offers a glimpse into the future of the Corvette".</p>

<p>The '25 Chevrolet Corvette CX Concept is an all-electric vehicle with a very sleek design and over 2,000hp, and it's available for you to check out in&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>Update 1.62.</p>

The first, the '26 Afeela 1, is described by Sony and Polyphony Digital as a car that will "challenge the concept of transportation", and it's the first production model following the introduction of the prototype at CES 2024.</p>

<p>Another new Chevrolet Corvette concept car, the CX.R Vision Gran Turismo, is available in Update 1.62 as well, but if your tastes skew a little more street-level, you can drive the '02 Renault Avantime 3.0 V6 24V, a more modest (but no less fascinating) car.</p>

<p>All of this, of course, comes alongside new Extra Menus, new World Circuit events, and a new featured Curation in Scapes in the form of Tokyo Bay. You can check out a trailer showing it all off right here.</p>




<p>This update arrives just after Sony introduced a brand new official&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/official-gran-turismo-7-car-database" rel="nofollow">car database</a>, which collects the hundreds of vehicles currently available in the game in one handy place for your perusal.</p>

<p><em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>Update 1.62 arrives today at 10pm Pacific (that's tomorrow at 1am Eastern or around 6am GMT). The game is available right now on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/gran-turismo-7/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation consoles</a>.</p>
