            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/selaco-sales-100k<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Altered Orbit Studios has announced that ambitious FPS&nbsp;<em>Selaco&nbsp;</em>has already crossed a major sales milestone that represents a fourfold increase on the studio's original goal for the game.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/SelacoGame/status/1874873018637603201" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message on social media platform X</a>, Altered Orbit reveals that&nbsp;<em>Selaco&nbsp;</em>has sold 100,000 copies, a figure the studio says it "never expected to reach", especially during the Early Access period (which began back in May this year).</p>

<p>Altered Orbit <a href="https://x.com/SelacoGame/status/1874873021556736150" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">follows up</a> by saying that its original intention was to sell 25,000 copies of&nbsp;<em>Selaco&nbsp;</em>in the game's first twelve months on release, but that "somehow", this figure was quadrupled in "just half the time".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/selaco-sales-100k.jpg?itok=2Inn0I7B 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/selaco-sales-100k.jpg?itok=-37znJFg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Selaco</em>'s mixture of retro nostalgia and ambitious thinking has resulted in a very respectable sales milestone within its first six months or so on sale.</figcaption></figure><p>The developer says that it decided to go publisher-free and place all its faith "in the game itself", as well as "the community to help spread the word", and it looks like those strategies worked.</p>

<p>Still, Altered Orbit <a href="https://x.com/SelacoGame/status/1874873023557480935" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">does acknowledge</a> that others played a role in&nbsp;<em>Selaco</em>'s success too. Specifically, the studio thanks New Blood's Dave Oshry for doing "more for us than I could fit in an entire Twitter thread", as well as "other developers" who are "always ready to offer help and see their peers succeed". Aww.</p>

<p>Amusingly, Altered Orbit closes its thank-you statements by <a href="https://x.com/SelacoGame/status/1874873025470107948" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">suggesting</a> that players only bought&nbsp;<em>Selaco&nbsp;</em>to play its "Burger Flipper" minigame. If that minigame isn't significantly expanded in the full release, I expect boycotts.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Selaco</em>, it's a throwback first-person shooter that promises to offer "thrilling action set pieces, destructibility, smart enemies, and a fleshed-out story" within what Altered Orbit calls an "immersive game world".</p>




<p>The game owes a debt to the likes of&nbsp;<em>Duke Nukem 3D</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/genre-advancing-shooters-half-life" rel="nofollow">genre-advancing classics like <i>Half-Life</i></a>, and more recent titles like&nbsp;<em>F.E.A.R.&nbsp;</em>for its action set pieces. That's a pretty heavy cross of influences to bear.</p>

<p>If you're interested, you can check the game out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1592280/Selaco/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>, and if you're still not convinced, perhaps our very own Austin's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/selaco-sets-new-standard-for-fps-genre" rel="nofollow">glowing preview</a> will do the trick.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/antonblast-already-profitable</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/indie-platformer-antonblast-is-already-profitable-developer-says.1073244/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/antonblast-already-profitable<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Antonblast&nbsp;</em>developer Summitsphere has announced that the game has already recouped all of its costs related to development, marketing, and production, officially making it a profitable endeavor less than a month after release.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tonycomputerentertainment.com/post/3lesqbhu4ys2y" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post on social media platform Bluesky</a>, Summitsphere's Tony Grayson reveals the happy news and says it "looks like Summitsphere is going to be making a lot more games for a lot longer", thanking&nbsp;<em>Antonblast&nbsp;</em>players for their support.</p>

<p>Just in case you aren't familiar with&nbsp;<em>Antonblast</em>, it's a 2D "explosive action platformer" with a visual style that owes a heavy debt to&nbsp;<em>Wario Land</em>. You can think of it as a cousin to&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2231450/Pizza_Tower/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Pizza Tower</em></a>, although the two are developed by different studios.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/antonblast-profitable-boss.jpg?itok=M1d8LByN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/antonblast-profitable-boss.jpg?itok=KTiKLFyv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Antonblast</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Wario</em>-style shenanigans are already profitable, developer Summitsphere says.</figcaption></figure><p>Playing as either the titular Anton or his "cranked-out coworker Annie", you must do battle with Satan in order to retrieve Anton's prized collection of spirits.</p>

<p>Along the way, you'll explore "bizarre worlds", battle "screen-filling bosses", and experiment with what Summitsphere calls a "totally dynamic playstyle" that allows you either to rush through stages at speed or explore them at your leisure.</p>

<p>All of this is wrapped up in what the developer calls an "urban graffiti-inspired art style", which is certainly true, although it's also quite clearly a&nbsp;<em>Wario Land</em>-inspired art style as well (no shade; I love that art style).</p>

<p>Screenshots don't quite do&nbsp;<em>Antonblast&nbsp;</em>justice, so check out the trailer below to see what the game looks like in motion.</p>




<p>A game like&nbsp;<em>Antonblast&nbsp;</em>achieving profitability in just under a month is no mean feat. It's not quite&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>becoming profitable <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-2-profitable-sales-350k" rel="nofollow">just a few days after its launch</a>, but hey, maybe Summitsphere's next game will achieve that lofty goal.</p>

<p>In the meantime, you can check out&nbsp;<em>Antonblast&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1887400/ANTONBLAST/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/antonblast-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>. There's no word yet on whether the game is coming to other consoles, but given that it's already profitable, I wouldn't be surprised if it did.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/games-workshop-announces-new-rules-for-golden-demon-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Games Workshop has announced Golden Demon 2025. The official <em>Warhammer</em> miniature painting competition will return this year with changes to its various categories and awards.</p>

<h2>The Golden Demon 2025 Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/6vp4sdtr/golden-demon-2025-the-prestigious-painting-competition-returns-to-adepticon-with-a-new-category-and-new-awards/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Warhammer-Community</a> post, the first leg of Golden Demon 2025 will happen at this year's AdeptiCon, which will be held in the United States at the Baird Centre in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on March 26.</p>

<p>The post continues to describe changes to the competition's different categories. Duel will return as its own category, allowing entrants to showcase fierce battles between two opponents. Furthermore, both <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warcry-briar-and-bone-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warcry</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-underworlds-grandfathers-gardeners-and-jaws-of-itzl-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer Underworlds</em></a> entries will be entered under the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-age-of-sigmar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em></a> Unit umbrella category.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/golden-demon-2025-category-list.jpg?itok=FZTjEdZe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/golden-demon-2025-category-list.jpg?itok=ImAmsy5X 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Otherwise, all other categories of Golden Demon 2025 are unchanged. <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000</em></a>, the <em>Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/warhammer-old-world-core-boxes-announced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer The Old World</em></a>, <em>Warhammer The Horus Heresy</em>, <em>Necromunda</em>, and <em>Blood Bowl</em> are all unchanged.</p>

<p>As for awards, Games Workshop adds some new achievements below the podium. In addition to the Gold, Silver, and Bronze awards, there are Finalist, Commended, and Notable awards. The latter three positions are for entries that have caught the judges' attention. It is a welcome consolation for entries that go that extra mile.</p>

<p>Games Workshop's changes to the Golden Demon continues their active support alongside listening to constructive fan feedback. This includes their update to Golden Demon 2024 entries <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/games-workshop-imposes-golden-demon-ai-ban-preventing-its-use-in-miniature-painting" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">banning AI-generated</a> materials in any submitted entry. This may have been caused by the use of an AI-generated backdrop by 12-time winner Neil Hollis.</p>

<p>Games Workshop will be providing more Golden Demon 2025 details in the lead-up to AdeptiCon. In the meantime, if you have an idea for an entry to submit, the sign-up form is the same as last year on the official <a href="https://citadelcolour.com/golden-demon-2025/" rel="nofollow">Golden Demon</a> website. Potential US winners, you have three months to start assembling and painting.</p>
