            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Pre-orders for the newest adventure for the <em>Fallout</em> TTRPG have gone live. Modiphius Entertainment's <em>Fallout: Royal Flush</em> will bring players to the Mojave Wasteland, a location home to fan-favorite entries in Bethesda's post-apocalyptic series, and home to season 2 of the TV show.</p>

<h2>The Fallout: Royal Flush Pre-Order Announcement</h2>

<p>In an official press release, Modiphius Entertainment announced that Fallout: Royal Flush is available for pre-order now on their webstore. This is a prewritten adventure for <em>Fallout: The Roleplaying Game</em>, which utilizes Modiphius' distinct 2d20 RPG system.</p>

In the adventure, players will handle regional tensions and fight against numerous gangs. These conflicts eventually tie to an accelerationist conspiracy to bring war back to the West.</p>

<p>Complicating matters further is that the adventure is set before the Second Battle of the Hoover Dam. For dedicated fans, this means the events of the game are before the events of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/fallout-new-vegas" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Fallout: New Vegas</em></a>, where the New California Republic managed to repel Caesar's Legion and bring some semblance of law to the Mojave.</p>

<p>For especially dedicated players, one of the locations in this adventure is New Reno. This is an area from <em>Fallout 2</em>. It is also a key location for the upcoming second season of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/fallout-season-one-review-welcome-to-apocalypse" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Fallout</em> TV</a> show. If you've only seen the show and want a glimpse of what awaits those characters, this is an adventure to seek out.</p>

It contains the main quest and side quests designed to take characters from levels 1-21. In addition, it will have new NPCs and three new player origins: Enclave Remnant, Follower of the Apocalypse, Viper Initiate. For GMs, the book has new rules for harsh environmental effects, gambling, encounter generation, and vehicles.</p>

<p>The book is available now at an MSRP of $47.99, not including shipping. It is expected to be released in late November.</p>
