            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Laps Games has announced the Early Access release date for <em>Valorborn</em>, a sandbox RPG in which the world continues "with or without the player".</p><p><em>Valorborn </em>will be arriving in Early Access on April 15th, and if you're a fan of systems-driven RPGs like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/kingdom-come-deliverance" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6e4b0179-74b4-44fb-9823-e5f2d834f37f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em></a><em> </em>or even the <em>Stalker </em>series, then it sounds as though <em>Valorborn </em>will be right up your alley.</p><p>Laps Games describes <em>Valorborn</em>'s world as one "built around systemic simulation", so you can expect villages to continue about their business even when you're not around, as well as faction power struggles and "dangers moving across the land whether [you] intervene or not".</p><figure role="group">

<p>Laps Games also says that <em>Valorborn</em>'s world will be fully realized, which means that "every building, cave, and point of interest is fully enterable" and there will be "no fake doors or decorative entrances".</p><p>You'll be able to choose on what level you want to engage with <em>Valorborn</em>. Will you be a sellsword, fighting off threats for coin? Perhaps you'll take the role of a hunter, living off the land and eschewing the benefits of civilization.</p><p>Whatever you choose to be, you'll be able to take on <em>Valorborn </em>alone or assemble a party to experience the game's world with you. Bear in mind, though, that this is very much a single-player project, so you won't be able to play alongside your friends.</p><p>According to Laps Games, permadeath will be "a core part of the experience" in <em>Valorborn</em>, but setbacks are intended to be "part of each player's story rather than a dead end".</p>
<p>Over the course of <em>Valorborn</em>'s time in Early Access, you can expect more kingdoms to explore, more starting options for new journeys, and "more ways for adventurers to define their own origin".</p><p><em>Valorborn </em>arrives on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3372530/Valorborn/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on April 15th. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
