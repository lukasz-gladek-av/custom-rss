            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-best-selling-japan<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>have become the series' best-selling games of all time in Japan, beating out the previous record-holder for the first time in decades.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202411/24646" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Famitsu report</a> (for which we're using machine translation),&nbsp;<em>Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>have sold over 8.3 million copies between them in Japan, which means they've officially sold more than the original&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Red and Green&nbsp;</em>(since Japan's game was&nbsp;<em>Green&nbsp;</em>rather than&nbsp;<em>Blue</em>).</p>

<p>Until this moment, those original games held the record for Japan's best-selling&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games, and given just how much of a phenomenon&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>was when it first arrived, that's no mean feat.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-sales-record-coalossal.jpg?itok=klUuspfK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-sales-record-coalossal.jpg?itok=aE4MZqtO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>have become the best-selling games in the series in Japan.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that these sales figures do only apply to Japan, so&nbsp;<em>Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>may well not be the best-selling&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games elsewhere in the world.</p>

<p>However, given the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-has-sold-13936-million-units-super-mario-bros-wonder-sold-1196-million" rel="nofollow">huge success of the Nintendo Switch</a>&nbsp;and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-25-million-players-matching-pokemon-scarlet-violet" rel="nofollow">sky-high sales numbers</a> of&nbsp;<em>Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>around the world, I wouldn't be surprised if the newest games were also the best-selling in other regions.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, mainline <i>Pokemon&nbsp;</i>games are released every three years or so, and since&nbsp;<em>Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>launched in 2022, we can perhaps expect an announcement regarding the next major&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games soon.</p>

<p>It's likely, though, that Nintendo will wait until the successor to the Switch is announced. We're expecting news on that front <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation" rel="nofollow">sometime before April 2025</a>, so the new&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games may well be revealed alongside the console.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-sales-record-venonat.jpg?itok=LgYrtUII 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-sales-record-venonat.jpg?itok=cvyror6x 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>New&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games could be announced before the fiscal year is out.</figcaption></figure><p>That announcement seems especially likely to coincide with the Switch 2's given that&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>met with criticism at launch regarding their lackluster performance on Switch.</p>

<p>They're not the only games in that particular firing line, either. It seems that devs <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gamescom-onl-2024-switch" rel="nofollow">may be avoiding releasing games</a> on the Switch owing to its aging internals, so a successor would presumably improve things on that front, not just for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>but across the board.</p>

<p>Still, since it's been confirmed that the Nintendo Switch 2 (or whatever the console ends up being called) <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-successor-will-be-backwards-compatible" rel="nofollow">will be backwards compatible</a>, perhaps there'll be some sort of performance boost for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>on that front. We can but hope.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em><a href="https://scarletviolet.pokemon.com/en-gb/buy/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right now on Nintendo Switch</a>. A DLC pack,&nbsp;<em>The Treasure of Area Zero</em>, which comprises two extra story episodes, is also available now.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kunitsu-gami-path-of-goddess-underperformed</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/capcom-admits-new-ip-kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-underperformed.1038447/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kunitsu-gami-path-of-goddess-underperformed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has admitted that&nbsp;<em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em>, an action-tower defense hybrid that also represents a foray into new IP for the studio, underperformed compared to its expectations.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/capcoms-new-ip-kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-missed-sales-targets-despite-high-reviews/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Automaton Media</a> (which, in turn, cites a Japanese <a href="https://gamebiz.jp/news/396057" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GameBiz report</a>),&nbsp;<em>Kunitsu-Gami&nbsp;</em>received strong reviews from both critics and players, but failed to translate those reviews into unit sales.</p>

<p>Capcom blames this deficiency on "insufficient marketing and the failure to generate buzz prior to release", as Automaton says. In essence, not enough was done to let people know what exactly&nbsp;<em>Kunitsu-Gami&nbsp;</em>was before release, and that's never going to help unit sales.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-capcom-tower-defense.jpg?itok=209PJ2rg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-capcom-tower-defense.jpg?itok=zgTImkld 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess&nbsp;</em>didn't sell quite as well as Capcom hoped for.</figcaption></figure><p>The studio certainly isn't wrong when it comes to&nbsp;<em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em>' critical performance. The game has an 82 critic average on <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/16948/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">OpenCritic</a>, with 90% of critics recommending it, and it enjoys scores in the 80-85 range across <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess/critic-reviews/?platform=xbox-series-x" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">all</a> three current-gen&nbsp;<a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">platforms</a> on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess/critic-reviews/?platform=pc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Metacritic</a> as well.</p>

<p>Users also seem to have broadly positive opinions about the game. It currently has a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2510710/KunitsuGami_Path_of_the_Goddess/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">91% Very Positive rating on Steam</a> across 1,149 reviews (at time of writing), so it's clear that those who are playing&nbsp;<em>Kunitsu-Gami&nbsp;</em>are enjoying it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it's often the case that critically-acclaimed games that exist within a particular niche can't drum up sales.&nbsp;<em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess&nbsp;</em>might be a tough sell for a lot of players; it's an action-tower defense hybrid, and it's not easy to see exactly what kind of game it is from screenshots, either.</p>

<p>Still, in the GameBiz report (for which we're using machine translation), Capcom says it intends to continue promoting&nbsp;<em>Kunitsu-Gami&nbsp;</em>in order to achieve its initial sales target, although it wasn't clear about what that target actually is.</p>




<p>Although sales of&nbsp;<em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess&nbsp;</em>were apparently lackluster, Capcom says games like&nbsp;<em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Ace Attorney Investigations Collection&nbsp;</em>have been selling as expected.</p>

<p>Additionally, the company is currently gearing up for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-release-date" rel="nofollow">release of&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>in February</a>, and if its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-steam-records" rel="nofollow">beta performance</a> is anything to go by, that game is likely to provide a massive boost to Capcom's finances when it's released.</p>

<p>If you'd like to see what&nbsp;<em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess&nbsp;</em>is all about, you can check the game out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2510710/KunitsuGami_Path_of_the_Goddess/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, as well as on <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10008719" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess/9PCWXX0MS15S/0010" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/half-life-2-steam-player-count-record<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Half-Life 2&nbsp;</em>player numbers on Steam have shot up following an anniversary update released last week, resulting in the game reaching its highest concurrent Steam player count since its release.</p>

<p>A quick look at&nbsp;<em>Half-Life 2</em>'s <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/220/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB charts</a>&nbsp;shows that the game managed to reach 64,085 players around 21 hours ago (at time of writing), which is its highest total of all time on the platform.</p>

<p>At time of writing, 45,121 players were still enjoying Gordon Freeman's second major adventure, so&nbsp;<em>Half-Life 2&nbsp;</em>is still riding that wave of renewed popularity. Who knows for how much longer it will last? Let's hope a while, at least.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/half-life-2-player-count-update-ravenholm.jpg?itok=jbFy806S 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/half-life-2-player-count-update-ravenholm.jpg?itok=MNMuVhwb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Half-Life 2&nbsp;</em>is enjoying a surge of popularity.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Half-Life 2</em>'s surge in popularity comes after the appropriately-named&nbsp;<em>Half-Life 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/220/view/6633333780228604001" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">20th Anniversary Update</a>, which was released on Friday to coincide with - you guessed it - the game's 20th anniversary.</p>

<p>The update adds both Episode One and Episode Two to the base&nbsp;<em>Half-Life 2&nbsp;</em>game, so if you somehow own&nbsp;<em>Half-Life 2&nbsp;</em>but not its expansions, then you can now enjoy those at no additional cost. They're well worth it!</p>

<p>You'll also now find developer commentaries for the original game included in the Steam package, as well as Steam Workshop support to make modding a little easier. Several visual bugs have been fixed, and new graphics options have been added to "push the visual fidelity of&nbsp;<em>Half-Life 2</em>".</p>

<p>If you want to know how&nbsp;<em>Half-Life 2&nbsp;</em>was made, then you'll also probably find the new documentary, created by the folks behind a similar project for the original&nbsp;<em>Half-Life</em>'s&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/half-life-update-by-valve-available-now-with-steam-deck-support" rel="nofollow">25th anniversary</a>, entertaining and interesting.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/half-life-2-player-count-update-combine.jpg?itok=71D-1yxj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/half-life-2-player-count-update-combine.jpg?itok=8x2yTmdr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Half-Life 2</em>'s just as fun as it ever was, so go give it a try today!</figcaption></figure><p>It wasn't just the update that bolstered&nbsp;<em>Half-Life 2</em>'s player numbers, though. The game is currently being given away <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/220/HalfLife_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">for free on Steam</a>, with the giveaway running until 10am Pacific today (that's 1pm Eastern). Grab it if you haven't already.</p>

<p>This&nbsp;<em>Half-Life 2&nbsp;</em>update arrives not long after the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/project-white-sands-codename-half-life-rumor" rel="nofollow">discovery of something codenamed&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/project-white-sands-codename-half-life-rumor" rel="nofollow">White Sands</a>&nbsp;</em>once again set off speculation around a new <i>Half-Life&nbsp;</i>game earlier this year. Just in case you need reminding, White Sands is the name of a location in New Mexico, which is also where&nbsp;<em>Half-Life</em>'s Black Mesa is located.</p>
