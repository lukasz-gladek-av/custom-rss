            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/laika-aged-through-blood-review-burst-tyre-under-fire<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s never a dull moment to freshly visit a release that’s already got more than enough critical lauding behind it. <em>Laika: Aged Through Blood</em>, developed by Spanish team Brainwash Gang, and dubbed “Motorvania”, has already met the positive end of the critical reception stick since its release in 2023. 2 years later, it has finally driven over to the Nintendo Switch, which you’d assume to be a perfect victory lap.</p>

<p>You play as Laika, an immortal anthropomorphic dog who’s in an endless war alongside her similar animal compatriots against a covenant of birds, who’ve deemed themselves genetically superior. Due to her accursed immortality, she’s often seen as the first and last line of defense for the rest of her cabal, who are preparing for a devastating weapon to be used against them by the birds. In between all of this, she is the mother to a growing and otherwise affable pup, who’s destined to take her mantle, as well as her curse, much to the chagrin of Laika.</p>

<p>When I say “Motorvania”, what exactly does that entail? Well, that requires a bit of context. <em>Laika: Aged Through Blood </em>is a title specifically inspired by the Adobe Flash games of old, from <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/review/trials-fusion-review" rel="nofollow">Trials</a> </em>to <em>Bush Shoot-Out</em>. It’s the former that is obviously the bigger mine for inspiration, as <em>Laika </em>utilizes old-school Flash bike-riding as its main movement mechanic. As such, you’ll be flipping your bike, wheelie-ing, and struggling with the most curvaceous of hills for most of your playtime.</p>



<p>Not only that but there’s combat on top, the closest comparison being something like the equally audacious <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/my-friend-pedro-review-max-pedro" rel="nofollow"><em>My Friend Pedro</em></a>. The difference between the two however is that instadeath is a permanent possibility throughout your playthrough, but Laika can fight back. The underside of your motorbike can deflect most bullets, as well as your character being able to turn on the 2D platforms in order to deflect bullets on a straight plane.</p>

<p>It’s an easy-to-learn, hard-to-master mechanic, and one that initially provides some berth and exceptionally high swells of pride once you perfect it. Drive head-first into a valley of trigger-happy avian bastards, and spam bullets in every direction until the screen turns into a sea of magnetically-attracted currency and guts. Once it starts, <em>Laika </em>will never let off the brakes, and that’s both a blessing and a burden.</p>

<p>It’s quite easy to find yourself stuck in a relentless cycle of dying and restarting over and over again just to perfect a single section that’s just as likely to have another difficulty spike behind it. It’s an endurance test in how much BS you can take before you either break through with bloody knuckles or shut the console off and say “That’s enough”. As it stands, the latter was the more likely outcome for me.</p>



<p>As it stands, <em>Laika </em>is a game where you have to put the time in, especially when its main movement mechanic defines the progression. As such, the level design seeks to at least be engaging enough throughout the entire runtime with obstacle courses and trick jumps you’re more likely to see in <em>Trials</em>-adjacent titles. However, this doesn’t make backtracking necessarily interesting, more that it becomes a permeating checklist of remembering exactly how and where you’re meant to execute specific jumps on specific ramps, that look like every other specific jump or specific ramps.</p>

<p>This is something that correlates to Brainwash Gang’s history, as their debut game, <em>Nongunz</em>, was a similar war of attrition between how far you’re willing to go to progress, or hell, even understand. In <em>Nongunz</em>’ case, however, the playing field wasn’t surmounted by what could – in certain pretenses – be described as a gimmick. Gimmicky narrative? Sure, but there are bigger demons in sight here.</p>

<p>For one, despite <em>Nongunz</em>’ mono-chromatic visual design, enough attention was paid to busier arenas to make sure the player wasn’t overwhelmed with odds. In <em>Laika</em>, the visual design has been over-produced to the point where it’s an unintelligible mess in its peaks, at least on the Nintendo Switch. This isn’t a case of playing on handheld either, whether it’s the handheld mode, or docked, <em>Laika </em>is simply too busy of a game to justify its messy proceedings.</p>



<p>How do we fix this? Make the camera static. Seriously, <em>Laika </em>is much too interested in constantly messing up perspective, as well as throwing mixed challenges of precision platforming and sludgy combat which I can’t ascertain is a design decision or not. Performance is all over the place on the Nintendo Switch, which puts me in the camp of believing this is a poorly-performing port.</p>

<p>So the question becomes “Is <em>Laika: Aged Through Blood</em> worth driving through despite this?”, and the answer I came to is “no”. The long and short of it is that the story is much too interested in pitting its frankly mawkish narrative against the even more absurd gameplay core of <em>Trials-</em>flipping combat nonsense. It’s an exceptionally harsh juxtaposition that’s hard to shake off unless you’re fully committed to its over-wrought presentation.</p>

<p>It’s not without its failings, mind you. As was the case with <em>Nongunz</em>, <em>Laika </em>is blessed with an utterly fantastic and melancholic soundtrack, <a href="https://beicoli.bandcamp.com/album/laika-aged-through-blood-ost" rel="nofollow">composed by Beatriz Ruiz-Castillo</a>. They’re a collectible within the world also, and you bet your bottom dollar they’re worth going the extra mile for. Beautifully composed, and far and away, the most well-intentioned and aligned aspect of <em>Laika</em>’s more gloomy angles.</p>



<p>There’s a distinct flavor to how <em>Laika </em>presents its story, one which requires full dedication to the edginess of its world-building. I mean, it starts off with your daughter wailing at the sight of a crucified anthropomorphic animal - quite upsetting in its depiction, but in hindsight, silly as you see how Laika enacts revenge by being the best showboating motorbike rider in the wastelands.</p>

<h2><em>Laika: Aged Through Blood </em>Review | Final Verdict</h2>

<p>In any other timeline, the kind of antics <em>Laika: Aged Through Blood</em> showcases would be a perfect fit for the kind of platforming shenanigans the Nintendo Switch is known for at this point. This isn’t the case, however, as its overdesigned, overcomplicated, and indeed, overcooked storyline fails to make a dent in the library's more venerated classics.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-update-155<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and Polyphony Digital have released a new&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>update, and it brings four brand new cars for you to drive, plus an expansion to the game's Sophy AI system and more.</p>

<p>Previous&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>updates have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-update-152" rel="nofollow">set the precedent</a> of bringing <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-update-144" rel="nofollow">new cars to check out</a>, and this one's no different, starting with the original formula car F3500-A, which has been created "in the image of classic F1 cars". If you like old-school racing machines, you'll love this one.</p>

<p>Your next new car is the Honda Civic Si Extra (EF) '87, a touring car racer that's also known as the Grand Civic, and it's known for being used at events like the Japan Touring Car Championship.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gran-turismo-7-update-1.55-new-cars.jpg?itok=zm7JmJAd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gran-turismo-7-update-1.55-new-cars.jpg?itok=S_JvEj0d 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Four new cars are available to drive in&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>Update 1.55.</figcaption></figure><p>Next up, it's the Hyundai IONIQ 5 N '24, a revision of Hyundai's first all-electric model that "challenges the preconceptions of BEVs", according to Sony (that's battery electric vehicles, by the way).</p>

<p>Last but not least, you can now also drive the Toyota C-HR S '18, an "unconventional crossover SUV" most famous for taking on the&nbsp;Nürburgring 24 Hours circuit in prototype form. Pretty impressive stuff, no?</p>

<p>All four of these cars can be purchased from&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7</em>'s Brand Central, so head on over there and pick up whichever is your favorite (or all of them, if you're so inclined).</p>

<p>You can check out a trailer that shows off these cars, as well as some other elements of the new update, right here.</p>




<p>Also new in this update are two new courses for&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7</em>'s Sophy AI racing agent, as well as new events in the game's World Circuits and more. You can take a look at everything that's been added <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/30/gran-turismo-7-update-1-55-details-revealed-live-today/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here via the PlayStation Blog</a>.</p>

<p><em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/gran-turismo-7/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>; unlike <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-psn-account-requirement-incentives" rel="nofollow">many other Sony first-party games</a>, it's yet to secure itself a PC release. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/beyond-two-souls-tv-series</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/beyond-two-souls-tv-series-coming-elliot-page-to-produce.1095891/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/beyond-two-souls-tv-series<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A&nbsp;<em>Beyond: Two Souls&nbsp;</em>TV series is in production, with star Elliot Page's production company Pageboy Productions set to develop the adaptation, although it's unclear whether Page himself will star or not.</p>

<p>Per a Deadline <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/01/beyond-two-souls-video-game-television-series-elliot-page-pageboy-1236267129/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, the adaptation is currently in early development, and it's expected to follow the same storyline as the game, which tracks Page's Jodie as she comes to terms with the supernatural powers that allow her to see and communicate with a mysterious entity known as Aiden.</p>

<p>Page says that&nbsp;<em>Beyond: Two Souls&nbsp;</em>represented "one of the most challenging and fulfilling acting experiences of [his] career", and that the goal is to "create a unique vision of the characters" in what he describes as a story with "rich narrative and emotional depth".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/beyond-two-souls-jodie-nathan.jpg?itok=bsgGXn04 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/beyond-two-souls-jodie-nathan.jpg?itok=Zf7AinW2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Beyond: Two Souls&nbsp;</em>is set for a TV adaptation.</figcaption></figure><p>Alongside Page as Jodie, the game also starred Willem Dafoe as paranormal scientist Nathan Dawkins, a researcher working to understand the nature of Jodie's powers.</p>

<p>Deadline's report doesn't state whether Page or Dafoe will be returning to star; the production is still fairly early on in development, so it's possible that actors haven't been cast yet.</p>

<p>Quantic Dream's David Cage says he's "absolutely thrilled" to be working with Page on the&nbsp;<em>Beyond: Two Souls&nbsp;</em>TV show, and that Page "has all the talent and instinct to make it something really unique on TV".</p>

<p>Whether Page himself is as thrilled to be working with Cage is less clear. Back in 2015, it was <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ellen-page-explored-legal-action-154256357.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reported</a>&nbsp;(note: this article is several years old and uses Page's deadname) that he explored legal action following his discovery that Quantic Dream had made a fully rendered nude model of his in-game character without his permission.</p>




<p>As for what's next for Quantic Dream, the studio, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/quantic-dream-acquired-by-netease" rel="nofollow">acquired by Chinese gaming giant NetEase</a> in 2022, is currently developing adventure game&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Eclipse</em>.</p>

<p>Announced during the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-announcement-from-game-awards-2021" rel="nofollow">2021 Game Awards</a>, the studio has been relatively silent about the game since; it still has no release date or even vague release window, so it's likely to be some time before we hear from it again.</p>

<p>That's also true about the&nbsp;<em>Beyond: Two Souls&nbsp;</em>TV show, given how early in production it apparently is. Stay tuned for more on that, and in the meantime, you can check the game out right now on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/beyond-two-souls/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS4</a> (and PS5 via backwards compatibility) and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/960990/Beyond_Two_Souls/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/japanese-nintendo-switch-eshop-payment-crackdown</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/japanese-nintendo-switch-eshop-payment-crackdown-bans-overseas-cards-and-paypal.1095855/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/japanese-nintendo-switch-eshop-payment-crackdown<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced that starting later this year, you'll no longer be able to use overseas-issued payment cards or PayPal accounts in order to pay for content from the Japanese Switch eShop.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://support.nintendo.com/jp/information/2025/0130.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">notice</a> on the Japanese Nintendo website (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/switchs-japan-eshop-will-no-longer-accept-foreign-cards-or-paypal-to-prevent-fraudulent-use/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">VGC</a>), the gaming giant says that in order to "prevent fraudulent use" (we're using machine translation for the post, which is originally in Japanese", overseas-issued cards and PayPal accounts will be banned.</p>

<p>It looks as though PayPal accounts opened in Japan, as well as Japan-issued credit cards, will still be valid. Unfortunately, though, if you've been using the Japanese eShop from outside Japan, it looks like you might have to find a new payment method.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-eshop-japanese-payment-crackdown.jpg?itok=RWrI0Juv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-eshop-japanese-payment-crackdown.jpg?itok=uUO1bQMx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll have to pick a different payment method for the Japanese eShop in future.</figcaption></figure><p>It's common for Switch players to buy their games from the Japanese eShop, either to circumvent what they see as poor exchange rates or to get games that they can't get in their native countries.</p>

<p>Nintendo's reference to "fraudulent" behavior might be a veiled nod to this practice; it might seem relatively harmless to me, but Nintendo is well-known for what could charitably called <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-lawsuit-patents-demands-nintendo" rel="nofollow">"fiercely protecting its products"</a>, so I wouldn't be surprised if that was the reasoning.</p>

<p>So, what does this mean for you if you're a frequent user of the Japanese eShop? Well, it means you'll need to find some way of using a Japan-issued payment method if you want to continue, unfortunately.</p>

<p>This decision shouldn't affect your country's native eShop, and it also likely won't change anything if you're already using a Japanese payment method to access the eShop.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-handheld-mode.jpg?itok=Oa1ZSUGg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-handheld-mode.jpg?itok=numsHrxt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nintendo is currently gearing up for the release of the Switch 2.</figcaption></figure><p>Earlier this month, Nintendo <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">officially announced the Switch's successor</a>, putting an end to months of speculation and leaks regarding the device's appearance.</p>

<p>We still don't know what kind of specs the machine will have, though; we'll have to wait until April's forthcoming Nintendo Direct in order to learn that.</p>

<p>Still, with a new device coming, perhaps it's no wonder Nintendo is tightening its rules a little. Stay tuned for more. In the meantime, the Japanese eShop payment crackdown takes effect on March 25th.</p>
