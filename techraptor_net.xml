<p>IllFonic design director Jordan Mathewson says Haddonfield allowed the team to "reimagine the tension" of the town "in a way that feels both intimate and terrifying".</p><p>He says the studio wanted players to "feel the comfort of the neighborhood they recognize from the film" before it quickly descends into "panic", with each "hedge, hallway, and backyard" intended to "heighten suspense and reward clever play".</p><p>If you're not familiar with <em>Halloween</em>, it's an upcoming asymmetrical multiplayer horror game along the same lines as Behaviour's <em>Dead by Daylight </em>or IllFonic's own <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/friday-13th-dedicated-servers-shutting-down-this-month" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c879cbbc-8ea0-4c10-a2ef-2b4cd295e2a3" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">ill-fated</a> <em>Friday the 13th: The Game</em>.</p><p>Playing as either The Shape (also known as Michael Myers) or one of his victims, you'll be tasked with either slaughtering everyone who's playing as a survivor or attempting to phone the police for help before Myers catches you.</p>
