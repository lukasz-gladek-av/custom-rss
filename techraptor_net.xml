            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/date-everything-delayed-again<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sassy Chap Games and publisher Team17 have announced that upcoming dating sim&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>has been delayed, meaning it'll no longer hit what would have been its perfect release date.</p>

<p>Announced in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/date-everything-dating-sim" rel="nofollow">July last year</a>, the game was subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/date-everything-delayed-valentines-day" rel="nofollow">delayed to Valentine's Day</a>, but it's been pushed back once again. It'll now launch in June, although the two studios haven't announced a new fixed date for&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>yet, ironically.</p>

<p>In a press release, lead designer Ray Chase says that while&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>has reached the point at which the game is complete without the studio compromising its "bonkers artistic vision", he and Sassy Chap got "too confident" that they could test all of the game's pathways and outcomes.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/date-everything-delayed-again-keyes.jpg?itok=jgbO_Q73 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/date-everything-delayed-again-keyes.jpg?itok=AjvTviz6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>sadly won't meet its perfect release date of February 14th.</figcaption></figure><p>Chase goes on to say that&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!</em>'s "bug list is finally starting to dwindle down", but that it would have been a "disservice" to release the game with "so many outstanding glitches", hence the new June release window.</p>

<p>In case you're wondering, by the way, it is indeed apparently possible to date the glitches in question. Chase says "their name is Daemon" and that he's "currently in a love/hate relationship with them". I, for one, hope he's being serious.</p>

<p><em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>is an upcoming dating sim in which the stated aim is to allow you to, well, date everything.</p>

<p>That claim may not be entirely true, but you certainly can date a wide range of suddenly-animate objects, including your piano, your vacuum cleaner, and your overwhelming sense of existential dread.</p>




<p>The game promises 100 dateable objects, full voice acting, and branching narratives. With that many characters, I'm not surprised extra development time was needed to make sure they all made sense.</p>

<p><em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>launches sometime in June for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2201320/Date_Everything/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010892" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/date-everything/9n0ccpmbljq8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and Nintendo Switch. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/video-game-history-foundation-opens-free-online-gaming-history-library.1096041/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/video-game-history-foundation-free-online-library<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Video Game History Foundation (VGHF) has launched a brand new online library that contains a massive repository of gaming history research materials, and it won't cost you a penny to access.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://gamehistory.org/vghf-library-launch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on its website, VGHF says it's been building, cataloging, processing, and digitizing its collections since <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/video-game-history-foundation-officially-launches" rel="nofollow">it started in 2017</a>, and that the library is now "ready to open [its] (virtual) doors to the public for the first time", albeit in Early Access.</p>

<p>As for what the library contains, it'll give you access to "a curated selection of materials" from the wider VGHF library, including unseen game development materials, iconic games' press kits and promos, and "over 1500 full-text searchable out-of-print video game magazines".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/video-game-history-foundation-free-online-library-mgs4-promo-booklet.png?itok=g6hIcMax 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/png"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/video-game-history-foundation-free-online-library-mgs4-promo-booklet.png?itok=2yFwJWGC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/png"></picture><figcaption>The Video Game History Foundation has launched a massive new gaming history library that anyone can access online.</figcaption></figure><p>Specifically, VGHF points to what it calls "the Mark Flitman papers", a series of digitized documents and file backups kept in the basement of retired game producer Mark Flitman.</p>

<p>His collection includes work he did for companies like Konami, Acclaim, and Midway during the 90s and 2000s, and it's all available right now for you to view online, along with tons of other materials.</p>

<p>The library also includes "over 100 hours of footage" from developer Cyan's work on the&nbsp;<em>Myst&nbsp;</em>series, including never-before-seen interviews with the development team behind the likes of&nbsp;<em>Myst&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Riven</em>.</p>

<p>You can access all of this material via an interface that allows you to search for the material you want, view digital items directly in your browser, and even search for text within articles, making this one of the biggest online repositories of gaming information available right now.</p>




<p>As you might expect, the library will also be adding new materials to its archive over the coming years, so even if you don't find what you're looking for now, you may well do in the future.</p>

<p>It's the Video Game History Foundation's self-proclaimed mission to preserve, celebrate, and teach gaming history, and it's doing so through initiatives like the new online library, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/simcity-nes-prototype-digitized-and-dissected-by-video-game-history-foundation" rel="nofollow">digitizing rare game prototypes</a> and more.</p>

<p>VGHF is one of several organizations currently aiming to bring game preservation to the forefront of conversations within the industry; it joins the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gog-preservation-program" rel="nofollow">GOG and its Preservation Program</a> on that front. Good show, say I.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-updates-paused-poe-2</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/path-of-exile-updates-paused-as-grinding-gear-focuses-on-path-of-exile-2.1096002/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-updates-paused-poe-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Path of Exile&nbsp;</em>developer Grinding Gear Games has announced that it's pausing updates for the first game while it works on&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2</em>.</p>

<p>In a video message to fans, game director Jonathan Rogers says that Grinding Gear "can't really work on [upcoming update]&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile&nbsp;</em>3.26 before&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>0.2.0 has shipped", and that the studio "probably need[s] to support that for a couple of weeks" after launch, too.</p>

<p>While the studio will be working on "a bunch of preproduction" for <i>Path of Exile&nbsp;</i>update 3.26, it'll be dragging across staff from the first game in order to work on the second, which Rogers says still has "major issues", making it the priority for Grinding Gear at the moment.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/path-of-exile-updates-paused-path-of-exile-2-lightning.jpg?itok=BPMhx2Ys 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/path-of-exile-updates-paused-path-of-exile-2-lightning.jpg?itok=j17ztKKC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Updates for the first&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile&nbsp;</em>are being paused while Grinding Gear works on the second game.</figcaption></figure><p>Rogers goes on to say that it's "hard to even think about" what the team might create for&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile&nbsp;</em>when the sequel has "really obvious problems that need fixing".</p>

<p>He goes on to say that once&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>0.2.0 has been launched, the team will "devote as many resources as are needed" to get&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile&nbsp;</em>update 3.26 finished "as soon as possible".</p>

<p>Previously, Rogers had said that dedicating resources to both&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile&nbsp;</em>and its sequel "shouldn't be an issue", and that Grinding Gear Games is "set up" in a way that allows it to do so. Evidently, however, that's not the case, at least not this time.</p>

<p>You can see Rogers' full video message, which contains a little more information regarding the shift in focus, right here.</p>




<p><em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>originally started life as a major update for the first game, but eventually, its scope expanded to the point that Grinding Gear Games decided to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-will-be-standalone-game-closed-beta-date-gameplay-revealed" rel="nofollow">make it its own title instead</a>.</p>

<p>The game was released to a broadly positive reception from players, although several issues were identified, leading Grinding Gear to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-devs-feedback-early-access" rel="nofollow">promise fixes for those issues</a> in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2694490/Path_of_Exile_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>, as well as on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/path-of-exile-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/path-of-exile-2-game-preview/9ND8N4RW5GHX" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. The first game is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/238960/Path_of_Exile/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/path-of-exile/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 4</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/path-of-exile/bwc95bzpfbs7" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox One</a>, and you can play that one for free, too.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[BioWare Hit by Layoffs Following Dragon Age: The Veilguard's Failure]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioware-layoffs-veilguard-failure</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bioware-hit-by-layoffs-following-dragon-age-the-veilguards-failure.1095981/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioware-layoffs-veilguard-failure<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>BioWare has laid off several of its employees as part of an initiative to become a "more agile" studio, although the developer itself hasn't officially announced these layoffs.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bioware-quietly-lay-off-key-dragon-age-team-members-while-talking-up-the-next-mass-effect" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">noted</a> by Rock Paper Shotgun, several BioWare employees who worked on&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, including lead writer Trick Weekes and producer Jennifer Cheverie (among others), have posted on social media that they're now looking for a new job.</p>

<p>Yesterday, BioWare posted a studio <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2025/01/29/bioware-studio-update/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">update</a>&nbsp;in which general manager Gary McKay said the studio was becoming "a more agile, focused studio", referring obliquely to "today's news" and refraining from announcing any of the staff departures that were subsequently confirmed by staff members themselves.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-bioware-layoffs-combat.jpg?itok=ZepTStaq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-bioware-layoffs-combat.jpg?itok=eZWGZM6v 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>'s flop appears to have led to layoffs at BioWare.</figcaption></figure><p>McKay also says that "a core team" at BioWare is currently working on the next&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect</em>, and that the game will boast the involvement of folks who worked on the original trilogy. He cites names like series producer Mike Gamble, designer Preston Watamaniuk, and cinematics animator Parrish Ley.</p>

<p>He also says that given the "stage of development" the next&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect&nbsp;</em>is currently at, the team doesn't "require support from the full studio", and so some BioWare employees have been moved to "other teams at EA that had open roles that were a strong fit".</p>

<p>While this isn't necessarily the sole reason behind these layoffs, it's worth noting that EA recently revealed its flagship RPG&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>was a flop, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-ea-sports-fc-25-underperformed" rel="nofollow">selling around half of the copies</a> the publisher expected it to shift.</p>

<p>The game also spent a very, very long time in development, undergoing at least one major reboot before being shaped into the game that was eventually <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-release-date-leaked-trailer" rel="nofollow">released in October</a>.</p>




<p>Right before these layoffs were reported,&nbsp;<em>Veilguard&nbsp;</em>director Corinne Busche <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/veilguard-director-corinne-busche-leaving-bioware" rel="nofollow">revealed</a> that she was leaving BioWare, so it's possible that she jumped before she was pushed.</p>

<p>Whatever the case may be, all eyes are now on the next&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect</em>, which seemingly has a lot of work to do if it's going to pull BioWare back from what appears to be a pretty dangerous brink. Stay tuned for more.</p>
