            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shotgun-cop-man-my-friend-pedro-creator<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Devolver Digital (because of course) and developer DeadToast Entertainment have announced&nbsp;<em>Shotgun Cop Man</em>, the studio's next freewheeling shooter after its debut title&nbsp;<em>My Friend Pedro</em>.</p>

<p>Described by the two studios as a "devilishly fun ballistic platformer",&nbsp;<em>Shotgun Cop Man&nbsp;</em>sees the titular shotgun cop man descending into the depths of hell in order to arrest Satan. Yes, you read that right.</p>

<p>If you've played&nbsp;<em>My Friend Pedro</em>, then you can probably guess that this game likely won't be too heavy on the story. After all, in&nbsp;<em>Shotgun Cop Man</em>'s debut trailer, our hero yells at Satan to freeze, upon which he says "fuck you, Shotgun Cop Man" and flees. It's that sort of soiree.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shotgun-cop-man-gameplay.jpg?itok=xw9FIaSV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shotgun-cop-man-gameplay.jpg?itok=ga44pLn8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Shotgun Cop Man&nbsp;</em>eschews&nbsp;<em>My Friend Pedro</em>'s 2.5D look for a pure 2D aesthetic.</figcaption></figure><p>Gameplay-wise,&nbsp;<em>Shotgun Cop Man&nbsp;</em>promises to continue&nbsp;<em>My Friend Pedro</em>'s frenetic dual-wielding shooter gameplay, albeit with a much more pleasing to the eye (for me, at least) 2D visual style.</p>

<p>You'll go in armed with Shotgun Cop Man's signature boomstick and pistol, but you'll also be able to acquire other weapons on-site. You won't just be using the guns to shoot bad guys, either; you'll also be using them to traverse the world, propelling yourself through hell by the power of bullets.</p>

<p>Devolver and DeadToast are promising a "hand-crafted campaign" to enjoy, as well as extra No Damage and Speedrun modes if you really want to test your skills against the hordes of hell.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Shotgun Cop Man&nbsp;</em>right here.</p>




<p>As well as the aforementioned modes,&nbsp;<em>Shotgun Cop Man&nbsp;</em>will also let you create your own levels, and others can play them for "endless replayability". After all, Shotgun Cop Man is going to need a pretty convincing excuse to hang around hell after Satan has been arrested.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Shotgun Cop Man&nbsp;</em>on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2966850/Shotgun_Cop_Man/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and Switch when it launches later this year, and a PC demo is available to try out right now.
