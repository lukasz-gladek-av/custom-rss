            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valorant-mobile-revealed-china<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Riot Games has finally revealed&nbsp;<em>Valorant Mobile</em>, which is, as you'd probably expect, a mobile version of the popular FPS&nbsp;<em>Valorant</em>, and you can pre-register for it right now...but only if you're in China.</p>

<p>After a series of teaser trailers, Riot finally unveiled&nbsp;<em>Valorant Mobile&nbsp;</em>with an official debut trailer, a gameplay snippet, and an <a href="https://x.com/VALORANT/status/1914144559594172591" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>, in which the studio also reveals the game is a co-development effort with Tencent's LightSpeed Studios (also the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideaki-itsuno-lightspeed-studios" rel="nofollow">home of&nbsp;<em>Dragon's Dogma 2</em>'s Hideaki Itsuno</a>).</p>

<p>Riot and Lightspeed say that although the goal is to bring&nbsp;<em>Valorant Mobile&nbsp;</em>"to as many players as possible", the two are "starting in China and taking it from there", with further updates coming "as [their] plans develop further".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/valorant-mobile-revealed-china-gameplay.jpg?itok=X3zuMeOZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/valorant-mobile-revealed-china-gameplay.jpg?itok=GZZeB2Ma 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Valorant Mobile&nbsp;</em>has been officially revealed, but only for China (so far).</figcaption></figure><p>A mobile version of&nbsp;<em>Valorant&nbsp;</em>was actually revealed all the way back <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valorant-mobile" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">in 2021</a>, but save for a few teaser trailers showing off some of the Agents coming to the mobile version of the game, things have been pretty quiet on the news front since then.</p>

<p>When&nbsp;<em>Valorant&nbsp;</em>does hit mobile, you can expect it to feature a number of the same weapons, maps, and Agents as the main game, including the likes of Sage, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valorant-killjoy-reveal-brings-bots-to-riots-shooter" rel="nofollow">Killjoy</a>, and Cypher, among others. Of course, it's likely new Agents and other stuff will be added to the game once it's out.</p>

<p>Sadly, there's no release date or window for&nbsp;<em>Valorant Mobile&nbsp;</em>yet, but if you want, you can pre-register for the game <a href="https://valm.qq.com/main.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">via its official website</a>. Be aware that it's in Chinese, since the game is only intended for Chinese players at the moment.</p>




<p><em>Valorant&nbsp;</em>is just one of a number of games getting mobile spinoffs, and many of them are similarly focused on the Chinese market. Others include the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-mobile-revealed" rel="nofollow"><em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-outlanders-mobile-rpg" rel="nofollow"><em>Monster Hunter</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/destiny-mobile-spinoff-destiny-rising" rel="nofollow"><em>Destiny</em></a>, to name but a few.</p>

<p><em>Valorant Mobile&nbsp;</em>is in development right now and will hit mobile devices in China when it's released. The game is also available on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S <a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-gb/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">worldwide</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/escape-from-tarkov-10-2025-steam-confirmed</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-tarkov-1-0-due-in-2025-steam-version-confirmed.1169337/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/escape-from-tarkov-10-2025-steam-confirmed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Battlestate Games has announced that its extraction shooter&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov&nbsp;</em>will hit its 1.0 release sometime this year, and that a Steam version of the game is also planned, although we don't know when that's coming.</p>

<p>In a livestream held over the weekend (with a <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-tarkov-2025-roadmap-1-0-steam-release-final-map-and-questline.1168725/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">handy summary</a> by the wonderfully-named ResetEra user Saucycarpdog), Battlestate confirms that&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov&nbsp;</em>1.0 is coming in 2025, and that a Steam version is coming after that release.</p>

<p>Additionally, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/escape-from-tarkov-arena-finally-revealed-by-battlestate" rel="nofollow">spinoff game</a>&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov: Arena&nbsp;</em>will also be arriving on Steam, and that one is due to land on Valve's platform before the big 1.0 release of the main game. Again, though, no concrete release dates or windows were announced.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/escape-from-tarkov-1.0-2025-shootout.jpg?itok=hiQk6bB6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/escape-from-tarkov-1.0-2025-shootout.jpg?itok=1wpWwBRq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Extraction shooter&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov</em>'s 1.0 release is coming this year.</figcaption></figure><p>Before the 1.0 release, though, at least three more updates are planned. The first, in May, will bring a number of optimizations and improvements, while the second is due in June, bringing more gameplay tweaks and improvements to audio.</p>

<p>July's update will bring revamped gunshots for both players and AI opponents (that's CPU enemies, not generative AI), while August's patch will optimize the Interchange location and bring a new event with it.</p>

<p>All of this means that the 1.0 release probably won't arrive before September at the very earliest, and that's assuming it doesn't get delayed. Hopefully, though, we'll see&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov&nbsp;</em>leave the murky confines of its closed beta before the year is through.</p>

<p>The PvE mode, which was the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/escape-from-tarkov-unheard-edition-backlash" rel="nofollow">subject</a> of some <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/escape-from-tarkov-pve-eod-free" rel="nofollow">controversy</a> back when it was first being discussed, will apparently also be coming to Steam after&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov</em>'s 1.0 release, and it'll be getting just one wipe before launch to level the playing field.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/escape-from-tarkov-arena-steam-release-confirmed.jpg?itok=rlpFZGVo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/escape-from-tarkov-arena-steam-release-confirmed.jpg?itok=RcycEObY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Escape from Tarkov: Arena&nbsp;</em>is also coming to Steam.</figcaption></figure><p>When&nbsp;<em>Tarkov&nbsp;</em>1.0 does arrive, it'll face stiff competition from a growing number of extraction shooters, including Bungie's&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>, which will be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marathon-release-date-gameplay-revealed" rel="nofollow">launching in September</a>. Heck, even <em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>and <em>Dark Souls&nbsp;</em>developer FromSoftware is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-duskbloods-fromsoftware-nintendo-switch-2" rel="nofollow">getting in on the action</a>.</p>

<p>For now, though, you can pick up&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov: Arena&nbsp;</em>on PC via the games' <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official website</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Pokecology Is a Real Pokemon Behavioral Science Book Coming in June]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pokecology-is-a-real-pokemon-behavioral-science-book-coming-in-june.1169325/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokecology-pokemon-behavioral-science-book<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you've ever wondered how Pokemon behave out in the wild - and, indeed, why they might behave the way they do - then there's a new book called&nbsp;<em>Pokecology&nbsp;</em>that's just for you.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/new-pokemon-book-by-actual-doctor-of-animal-behavior-and-ecology-academically-explains-and-illustrates-behaviors-of-wild-pokemon/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Automaton Media</a>, <i>Pokecology&nbsp;</i>is landing in June. The book<em>&nbsp;</em>is written by two behavioral scientists, and it's been created with a view to explaining the whys of Pokemon from a scientific and ecological perspective.</p>

<p>Topics, according to Automaton's translation of the official&nbsp;<em>Pokecology&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.shogakukan.co.jp/pr/pokecology/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, include "Pokemon eating and sleeping habits, hibernation periods, and migration patterns", among other things.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-legends-z-a-pokecology-book.jpg?itok=Gm70sfth 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-legends-z-a-pokecology-book.jpg?itok=myJVELcq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ever wondered why Pokemon behave the way they do? This new book is for you.</figcaption></figure><p>The authors of the book are Yoshinari Yonehara and Chihiro Kinoshita, both of whom have PhDs in relevant subjects. Yonehara has worked on&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games before, while Kinoshita has worked as an illustrator for ecology-focused children's books.</p>

<p>Right now, the book has only been confirmed for Japan, and we don't yet know which Pokemon will be featured. If you want to pick it up, you'll have to import it; Automaton says it'll cost the equivalent of around $10, but of course, that doesn't factor in shipping.</p>

<p>It's a pretty busy time for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>right now. In the fall, Nintendo and&nbsp;The Pokemon Company will release&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-a-announced" rel="nofollow">latest game in the long-running franchise</a> (although not technically the next mainline entry in the series).</p>

<p>The game will take place entirely in the Kalos-based city of Lumiose, and will see the player encountering Pokemon across a number of "Wild Zones", while also taking on trainers as part of the titular Z-A Royale competition.</p>




<p>As for the tenth generation of mainline&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games, nothing has been revealed so far, but when it does land, we're expecting the games to be available exclusively for the Switch 2, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">which launches in June</a>. Pre-orders for the console <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-us-canada-april-24th" rel="nofollow">recently opened back up</a> after a tariff-induced delay.</p>
