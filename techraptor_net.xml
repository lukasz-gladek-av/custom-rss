She's being held in the city of Easafir, a far cry from our humble forest home. Her plea for help suggests this might be more than just a rescue mission, and her captor might have designs on a larger prize unless we can stop them.</i></p>

<p><em>Fateforge Chronicles of Kaan </em>was a successful Kickstarter back in 2022, and this month, they're launching the next KS for the second printing of the core set, and a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mightyboards/fateforge-chronicles-of-kaan-second-print-and-new-expansion" rel="nofollow">new expansion</a>. In this review though, we're just looking at the core&nbsp;<em>Fateforge Chronicles of Kaan</em> set. While this is our first foray into <em>Fateforge Chronicles of Kaan</em>, we've covered Mighty Boards products before. One of my earliest tabletop reviews on TechRaptor was the awesome <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/vengeance-review-so-any-more-subordinates-for-me-to-kill" rel="nofollow">Vengeance</a>. Along with the board game we're reviewing here, <em>Fateforge</em> also has a tabletop RPG and upcoming video game, which you can check out <a href="https://fateforge.org/en" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p><em>Fateforge Chronicles of Kaan </em>is&nbsp;an app-driven narrative cooperative adventure game that can be played solo, or with up to 4 players. Each player picks a character, and the app then guides you through a series of narrative options, battles, and side quests. Mighty Boards have deliberately focused the different elements into manageable chunks, with each combat taking around an hour, including set up, and the exploration and side quest elements between 15 and 30 mins.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fateforge-chronicles-of-kaan-6.jpg?itok=Yx1WpH_D 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fateforge-chronicles-of-kaan-6.jpg?itok=ZcL9i1oI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The early build of our&nbsp;<em>Fateforge Chronicles of Kaan </em>Rogue adventurer.</figcaption></figure><h2>Chosen For Adventure</h2>

<p>The core<i>&nbsp;</i><em>Fateforge Chronicles of Kaan </em>set has 5 character options that most will recognize as fantasy archetypes. There's the Mercenary, Rogue, Forest Guard, Shaman, and Noble. Each has their own unique dice pool and style of play, along with character development along the way. The Forest Guard for example starts with 3 blue and 1 green dice, blue for ranged combat and green for intelligence. The dice themselves have different icons for movement, ranged and melee combat, misses, and also focus which can be used to activate skills and abilities.</p>

<p>During each combat turn, all players roll 4 dice which will indicate what actions they can do during their turn. Certain abilities will let you reroll misses and convert some icons into others. The shaman's power chant for example can turn a miss into a focus, which they can then use to heal other party members. As the characters develop, you'll be able to change your dice pool and add more abilities to give you better options and more powerful attacks.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fateforge-chronicles-of-kaan-5.jpg?itok=Cs7HRNZg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fateforge-chronicles-of-kaan-5.jpg?itok=caaOoJeC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Players decide when their characters will activate, and the app mixes in some surprise enemy reactions before all the enemies activate at the end of the round.</figcaption></figure><h2>The App Controller</h2>

<p>The <em>Fateforge Chronicles of Kaan </em>app takes players through the story, detailing all the narrative elements and offering choices as players progress. It also details how combat missions are set up, and regulates the actions of the enemies, which are controlled by AI scripts on cards. I found the AI controls for the enemies to be extremely well handled. Most maps are close enough that you could feel the pressure of the enemies, and although they could be worked around (some enemies don't move, and will only attack if you're in their or an adjacent zone), it felt in keeping with the story.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I felt that the game did suffer from what all app-driven games suffer from, and that's the feeling that sometimes it could all be done on the app, or none of it, and the transition between the two, especially in combat can feel a little jarring. I forgot to progress the app during combat a few times, following the combat phase stages until the reaction phase of the enemies, which is detailed by the app. It does progress the narrative well, and the way it remembers and changes the narrative based on your actions is difficult to do with pure physical components.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fateforge-chronicles-of-kaan-3.jpg?itok=twu_GF5Z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fateforge-chronicles-of-kaan-3.jpg?itok=DHEUXOfF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Each&nbsp;<em>Fateforge Chronicles of Kaan </em>enemy type has an AI action programe they follow when they activate.</figcaption></figure><h2>Are We Nearly There Yet?</h2>

<p>As mentioned above, Mighty Boards have deliberately managed the timing of combats and narrative sessions in&nbsp;<em>Fateforge Chronicles of Kaan</em>, and the pacing feels great. In a full gaming night, you can get through several combats and their linked events, or if you're only able to meet for an hour or so, you can move slowly through the campaign that way and it won't feel like your campaign is stagnating if you can't meet for longer sessions.</p>

<p>The game is challenging as well, and your health doesn't fully regenerate between combats, making you manage it between combats, or deal with the scenarios differently. If you're low on health, you will have to choose to miss objectives, just punch straight through to the exit, or be a lot more tactical in avoiding combat and enemies. My Rogue and Forest Guard combination sees the Rogue rushing forward, stunning and removing enemies, and the Forest Guard trying to take out the rest at range. They had no healing between them, so if the Rogue's stealth failed and she took a beating, it meant us trying to avoid combat for the rest of that scenario, and possibly the next.</p>

<p>The story itself is a lot more engaging than I thought it would be, and the city itself, the characters you meet, and the choices you make feel very impactful, and is probably as close as you could get to a full roleplaying game without a Games Master.</p>

<p>I was surprised by&nbsp;<em>Fateforge Chronicles of Kaan. </em>I thought the dice combat was going to be annoying (I usually prefer to just choose my actions), but the different skills and abilities as you level up make it a unique and challenging puzzle, and although the enemies have set AI controls that can be worked around, it feels like part of the game. The setup and play time is fast and the story is extremely rewarding, and each of the different character options feels unique, and their development, along with that of the core narrative is extremely engaging.</p>

<p>The app is very prevalent, so if app-driven content isn't your thing, you can't avoid it here, but it does add to the game well, and although it does feel like the entire thing could be done digitally, without the need for physical components, having that physical element, especially with 2 to 4 players, helps keep it grounded in the moment.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/warhammer-40k-first-look-more-krieg-campaign-coming-soon<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Another week brings with it a fresh batch of Games Workshop products up for pre-order, and this week we're taking a quick sneak peek at a few important new releases for&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40K</em>. Games Workshop provided me with preview copies of two new Death Korps of Krieg units, as well as a PDF of the new&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40K Crusade: Nachmund Gauntlet</em>, which brings campaign play back into the 41st millenium! Read on for my first impression thoughts!</p>

<h2>Warhammer 40K Crusade - Nachmund Gauntlet</h2>

<p>Enclosed in this massive tome is everything you need to start running your own&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40K&nbsp;</em>campaign with your gaming group, compatible with the latest edition of the rules.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-crusade.jpg?itok=rrjN1Ntn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-crusade.jpg?itok=yONWzMBc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Step into war on the bloody streets of Sangua Terra!</figcaption></figure><h3>Nachmund Gauntlet - Storytelling At Its Finest</h3>

<p>This massive book, which clocks in at around 120 pages, dives deep into the story so far - we learn of the warlords seeking to lay claim to the world of Sangua Terra, one of the fortified bastions against Chaos in the famed Nachmund Gauntlet.</p>

<p>If you're a fan of the lore of&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40K</em>, and want to know the latest in the story the underpins the events of the game as a whole, this is a treasure trove of fantastic storytelling. One of the aspects I most love about all the Codexes and rulebooks that come out for all Games Workshop products is the level of storytelling on display. This isn't simple "the baddies are moving closer to their goal" writing, we dive deep into the various factions at play, their machinations, and more.</p>

<h3>Nachmund Gauntlet Campaign - Build Your Forces, See Them Through</h3>

<p>There are&nbsp;<em>so</em>&nbsp;many campaign rules for this game, it's hard to cover it all in a preview. So I'll keep it brief for the sake of discovery. In this Crusade book, you'll find rules to help guide a campaign over a series of missions, and there's a truly robust ruleset designed to help you play through it all.</p>

<p>You'll order all players into the campaign into alliances (ideally based on the army they're fielding) split between Guardians who seek to protect Sangua Terra, Despoilers who wish to conquer the world, and Marauders who seek to use the turmoil on Sangua Terra to their own benefit.</p>

<p>There are also a whole suite of Crusade rules specific to this Sangua Terran war, including how to use Crusade Badges, Battle Traits, Crusade Relics, and rules on using Tactical Reserves, recording your missions, blessings, agendas, and so much more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-crusade-image-large.jpeg?itok=JwMd1Xxb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-crusade-image-large.jpeg?itok=ur_LOfq3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>An image from Games Workshop showcasing how the turmoil of the Crusade can look on your battlefield.</figcaption></figure><h3>Nachmund Gauntlet Campaign - Missions</h3>

<p>As for the missions included in this book, you'll find fifteen distinct missions that see forces doing everything from securing drop sites to acting as heralds for larger incoming forces. One of my favorites is the Saboteurs mission, which sees the Attacker-designated player trying to get deep into Defender territory to use a special action to sabotage important points on the map.</p>

<p>All throughout, these missions seem to me to balance a bit of novel and thematic gameplay with well-balanced challenges. There's nothing in here that feels so story driven that you're at a disadvantage for being on the wrong side of the narrative. This is a seriously robust Crusade book, and if you've got a regular playgroup or a local shop running this campaign, it's well-worth checking out.</p>

<h2>Warhammer 40K - Death Korps of Krieg New Releases</h2>

<p>Many, many new releases are coming this week for pre-order for the Death Korps of Krieg army. We recently covered the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/ranking-units-from-new-warhammer-40k-death-korps-army-box" rel="nofollow">brand new Krieg Army Box</a> that just released for the forces, and many of the units that were bundled in the box are now available for pre-order separately. I'm now getting my first look at two additional units coming that weren't included in the box set: The Krieg Heavy Weapons Squad, and the Krieg Command Squad.</p>

<h3>Warhammer 40K - Death Korps of Krieg&nbsp;Heavy Weapons Squad</h3>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-krieg-heavy-weapons-unit.jpg?itok=49PN03cC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-krieg-heavy-weapons-unit.jpg?itok=NhpYXT7D 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Heavy Weapons Squad unleashes serious firepower.</figcaption></figure><p>The Heavy Weapons Squad is designed to be built and suited to your needs! Each unit contains three Heavy Weapons Gunner models and one Fire Coordinator model, and each model has both a laspistol and close combat weapon for when the battle gets a little too close to them.</p>

<p>But we're not here to talk about laspistols! The standard construction for these models is to have each Heavy Weapons Gunner equipped with a lascannon, which fires a single shot at a staggering 12 Strength, dealing D6+1 damage per hit. But you can swap these out as you see fit to include a Twin Krieg heavy stubber which hits hard with three Attacks per model and has Rapid Fire 3.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can also build these models with a Krieg heavy flamer, which has the "ignores cover" and "torrent" keywords and deals d6 attacks at 2 damage each.</p>

<p>All in all, this unit is a great option if you want some heavy fire but don't like fielding tanks!</p>

<h3>Warhammer 40K - Death Korps of Krieg&nbsp;Command Squad</h3>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-krieg-command-sqaud.jpg?itok=Ie3Xpszc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-krieg-command-sqaud.jpg?itok=AnF8d1_4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Krieg Command Squad is great for getting those crucial orders issued to your army.</figcaption></figure><p>Finally, let's take a look at the new Krieg Command Squad! This is the Krieg army knife of the army, with so many different weapon loadouts for the various members of the Squad. Where it really all comes together is in the Wargear abilities for the various bits, bobs, and gadgets attached to your models.</p>

<p>Let's chat about those abilities quickly: there's the Master Vox - which allows the Officer in this unit to issue orders up to 24" away, the Alchemyk Counteragents - which gives the unit the "Feel No Pain 6+" ability against mortal wounds, the Regimental Standard - which adds 1 to the Objective Control score of models in the unit (that's for&nbsp;<em>each</em>&nbsp;model), and the Servo-scribes - which, once per battle, lets the Officer issue two Orders at once (and is marked with a very cool Servo-scribes model).</p>

<p>If you're trying to get the most out of issuing orders to your Krieg army, this unit is not only pretty tough, and full of great weaponry, but they'll help you get those orders out efficiently.</p>

<p>That covers everything we got a chance to check out early with this week's preorder previews! Let us know what you think about these new releases in the comments!</p>
