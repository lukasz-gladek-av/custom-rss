            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has announced the release date for&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.6, and the next major update for the turn-based gacha RPG is landing later this month.</p>

<p>Following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-34-release-date" rel="nofollow">previous</a>&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-33-release-date" rel="nofollow">updates</a>, Version 3.6 will be arriving on September 24th, and it'll be bringing two playable characters with it, as well as a new high-difficulty challenge and more.</p>

<p>First up, you can, of course, expect new story content in this&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>update. HoYoverse says that the world of Amphoreus "stands at a crossroads", and that Miss Evernight (who's also joining the roster as a playable character) will be unveiling her plan to save the world, which "diverges from the prevailing creed of salvation".</p>

The first is the aforementioned Everwild, who joins as a 5-star Ice fighter. She can summon a sprite to help her accumulate extra damage, then deal that damage as soon as the stack is full. Her Ultimate, meanwhile, deals extra damage and sets her up for even more buffs.</p>

<p>Your second playable character for this update is the rather improbably-named Dan Heng • Permansor Terrae, who can buff his team by shielding them, but don't worry; he can also deal his own damage and hold his own in a fight.</p>

<p>Until the end of&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 4.0, you can also claim Dan Heng • Permansor Terrae for free simply by logging into the game. He's a five-star character, too, so he's no slouch, and he should be a solid addition to your team.</p>




<p><em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.6 launches across all platforms on September 24th. The game is <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">available to play for free</a> right now on PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices. Stay tuned for more on this one!</p>
