            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-ios-app-store-returns<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic has announced that&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>is finally available on the iOS App Store once again, following a protracted legal battle between itself and Apple over third-party payment systems and storefronts.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1924949632628523199" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Epic confirms that&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>has been re-added to the App Store on both iPhones and iPads in the US, while in Europe, it's available as part of the mobile version of the Epic Games Store.</p>

<p>Just last week, Epic <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-offline-worldwide-ios-apple-block" rel="nofollow">complained that Apple was blocking the release</a> of&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>on the App Store, leading to a worldwide outage of the game on the platform until the issue was resolved (which, thankfully, now looks to be the case).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fortnite-ios-restored-shooting.jpg?itok=6sJ6H9Ei 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fortnite-ios-restored-shooting.jpg?itok=XPMkebt9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Apple has restored&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>on the iOS App Store in the US and the mobile Epic Games Store in Europe.</figcaption></figure><p>Epic's battle against Apple began back in 2020, when the former hosted a sale on in-game currency that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-slashes-up-to-20-off-purchases-on-all-platforms" rel="nofollow">slashed up to 20% off prices</a> if customers used Epic's own proprietary payment system rather than Apple's.</p>

<p>Apple swiftly retaliated by removing&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>from the App Store, prompting Epic to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-apple-store-version-removed-for-violating-app-store-guidelines" rel="nofollow">file a lawsuit in response</a>. It wasn't just Apple whose wrath Epic incurred, either; the&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-sues-google-over-fortnites-removal-from-play-store" rel="nofollow">also sued Google</a> after the game was removed from the Play Store for the same reason.</p>

<p>What followed was a protracted battle between the two companies, one that saw Apple <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/apple-rejects-epic-request-to-relist-fortnite-in-korea" rel="nofollow">blocking numerous attempts</a> on Epic's part to get&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/apple-rejects-move-to-restore-fortnite-ios-on-app-store" rel="nofollow">relisted on the iOS App Store</a> in various territories.</p>

<p>In April this year, Apple was forced to pay a €500m fine by the European Commission due to its refusal to allow developers to direct customers towards alternative third-party payment systems, which Epic will no doubt have seen as a huge win.</p>




<p>As for what's going on within&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>itself, the game is currently in the middle of its&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-star-wars-crossover-2025" rel="nofollow"><em>Star Wars</em>-themed Galactic Battle season</a>, which has introduced character skins like Darth Jar Jar and Emperor Palpatine to the game.</p>

<p>Rather embarrassingly, however, Epic had to issue an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-swearing-darth-vader-ai-fixed" rel="nofollow">emergency hotfix last week</a> thanks to an AI-powered Darth Vader that was openly swearing at players. Needless to say, he won't do that anymore. I, for one, am disappointed.</p>
