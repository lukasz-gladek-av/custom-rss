</figure>
<p>Co-creators Vic Nguyen and Jon Maur say that <em>Find Your Words </em>was inspired by raising "non-speaking kids", which is why the game's main character doesn't communicate through speech; instead, they'll use a system of symbols discovered around the game's world to help them speak to others.</p><p>Combining symbols in different ways will give them "unique meanings", Capybara Games says, and you'll need to combine those symbols in certain ways in order to get your message across to those who communicate with more conventional methods.</p><p><em>Find Your Words </em>utilizes a form of <a href="https://oxfordhealth.nhs.uk/cit/resources/aac/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">AAC</a> (alternative and augmentative communication), a system that uses charts, photographs, symbols, and other non-verbal methods to help non-speaking children to communicate. It sounds like a great place to start if you're a total neophyte to AAC (as I am!).</p><p>You can check out a trailer for <em>Find Your Words</em>, which showcases the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/open-world-adventure-lil-gator-game-announced" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="18770544-2804-4295-8528-2dea52074262" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Lil Gator Game</em></a><em> </em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/to-a-t-release-date-katamari-creator" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f775e3d3-b847-4a43-af06-09cef92662a9" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>To a T</em></a>-style aesthetic direction, right here.</p>
<p><em>Find Your Words </em>is due to launch on PC via Steam sometime next year. No versions for other platforms have been announced as yet. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

<p>If you're not familiar with <em>Spirit Crossing</em>, it's a cozy MMO developed by the folks behind the similarly snuggly <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/cozy-grove" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e1bcbf8e-3646-43c1-a749-5b4dfa26e9b4" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Cozy Grove</em></a><em> </em>(I mean, the clue's right there in the name).</p><p>Described by Spry Fox as a game about "the joy of shared experiences, creative expression, and connection with friends", <em>Spirit Crossing </em>takes place in a "vast, beautiful world with ever-changing environments".</p><p>Upon starting the game, you'll be assigned to a Waystation, a smaller community-within-the-community, and together with your fellow Waystation members, you'll "collectively build, decorate, and fortify" your little patch of cozy ground.</p><p>Don't worry, though; there's no PvP play in <em>Spirit Crossing</em>, although you can travel to other players' Waystations and engage in "co-op activities such as harvesting, dancing, and mural painting" if you want.</p>
<p>Rather uniquely for the cozy MMO space, <em>Spirit Crossing </em>employs what Spry Fox calls a "friendship progression system", through which you'll gradually unlock features like proximity chat, two-player emotes, and gift-giving, plus more.</p><p>You'll be able to check out <em>Spirit Crossing </em>when it launches on PC via Steam sometime next year. If you're a Netflix member, then you can also enjoy it on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netflix.NGP.SpiritCrossing&amp;hl=en_GB" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Android</a> and iOS right now at no extra cost.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
