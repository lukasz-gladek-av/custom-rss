            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher IO Interactive has announced what kind of PC specs you're going to need if you want to run the upcoming <em>007 First Light</em>, but there's something pretty obvious missing from its rundown.</p><p>You can see the official PC specs <a href="https://ioi.dk/hitman/news?panel=https%3A%2F%2Fioi.dk%2F007firstlightgame%2Fnews%2F2026%2F007-first-light-unveils-pc-specs-and-nvidia-collaboration" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">over on IO's website</a>, where you'll find a measly two presets, namely Minimum and Recommended. Notably, both appear to be targeting 1080p as their resolution and don't feature any tips on what you might need to get stable performance at 1440p or 4K.</p><p>Naturally, that doesn't mean your rig won't be able to handle <em>007 First Light </em>at higher resolutions (or, indeed, higher frame rates than 60fps), but it is a little strange that IO Interactive wouldn't include this information in its infographic.</p><figure role="group">

<p>Thankfully, it looks like if you do want to run <em>007 First Light </em>at 1080p and maintain a stable 60fps, you won't need too beefy a rig to do so. Here are the two presets IO has announced for the game. Both require 64-bit installations of either Windows 10 or 11.</p><h3>Minimum (1080p at 30fps)</h3><ul><li>CPU: Intel Core i5-9500K or AMD Ryzen 5 3500</li><li>GPU: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660, AMD Radeon RX 5700, or Intel equivalent</li><li>RAM: 16GB</li><li>VRAM: 8GB</li><li>Storage: 80GB minimum</li></ul><h3>Recommended (1080p at 60fps)</h3><ul><li>CPU: Intel Core i5-13500 or AMD Ryzen 5 7600</li><li>GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti, AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT, or Intel equivalent</li><li>RAM: 32GB</li><li>VRAM: 12GB</li><li>Storage: 80GB minimum</li></ul>
<p>If you're not familiar with <em>007 First Light</em>, it's a stealthy action-adventure game from IO Interactive, the folks behind the <em>Hitman </em>series, and you can expect a similar blend of sneaking and high-octane thrills from the game.</p><p>Originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/007-first-light-release-date" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2642ca01-5e15-44ba-9ed9-26d9d752f67a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">slated for a March launch</a>, <em>007 First Light </em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/007-first-light-delayed-may-2026" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e0d84f2a-3cf3-41a8-9a3a-eb43f66bc545" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">delayed to May</a> just before Christmas, possibly in response to Rockstar revealing that industry powerhouse <em>Grand Theft Auto 6 </em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-november-2026" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e57d7053-b3ca-42ed-afdb-4ef5c5958b99" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">would be moved from May to November</a>.</p><p>When it does arrive, <em>007 First Light </em>will be available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3768760/007_First_Light/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/007-first-light/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/007-first-light/9PN198B459VB" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/007-First-Light-2792136.html" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.
