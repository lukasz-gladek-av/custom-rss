            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> leads with a lot of messages directly to the player over a shimmering background. In this game, the player is assured, you can be anyone. You can go anywhere.&nbsp;</p><p>It sounds great: a promise that many games make, but exceedingly few deliver on. Unfortunately, <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> is closer to the empty promise of the many than the delivery on the few.</p><h2>Freedom Facade</h2><p>Where this freedom fails is the story that <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> attempts to tell. Instead of using the eight protagonists that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/octopath-traveler-review-road-less-traveled" rel="nofollow">defined the original Octopath</a>, 0 centers your journey around antagonists. Specifically, these antagonists embody the temptations of Fame, Power, and Wealth.</p><p>Gone are the days of small vignettes. Instead, this tale is a continent-spanning epic about warring kingdoms. The bigger war going on is between the story and the game that’s containing it. Octopath’s structure of chapters that last around an hour or two is perfect for smaller-scale stories, as a few bite-sized, self-contained stories lead to a climactic conclusion.</p><p>On the other hand, this longer-form story struggles. It cycles through a seemingly endless supply of new characters, nearly all of whom are one of two absolutes: “I am a good guy” or “I am a bad guy.” None of them goes through meaningful growth or change.</p><p>During dialogue exchanges your custom character protagonist has with this large cast, you’ll occasionally be prompted to make choices. These choices, a totally new addition to the franchise, are also a superfluous one. Every time you make a choice, there is a clear “right” and “wrong” answer. If you choose the wrong one, you’re usually just taken back to the dialogue choice. Less <em>Baldur’s Gate</em>, more <em>Pokémon</em>.</p><p>This created protagonist also comes at the cost of the usual octet of heroes on your journey. Where previous games had the heroes’ personalities at the forefront, <em>0 </em>has only your created protagonist with no dialogue. In attempting to create a canvas, <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> is left with more of a husk.</p><h2>Familiar Feelings</h2><p>Where <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> shines is in the places it borrows from its predecessors. The turn-based battle system is as sharp as ever. Strategizing Boost Points and attack types to Break your opponents is immensely satisfying.&nbsp;</p><p>With how balanced the game is around the new, more singular story, the level curve is more direct. Your party members will all begin to have all of their skills unlocked and reach their full potential right at the final showdown. It feels free of level scaling issues that have plagued other entries.</p><p>The biggest change is with the freedom granted by the additional party members. Your battle party consists of eight characters instead of 4. This means that certain party members can take a supporting role in the back row, while a vanguard fights up front. &nbsp;This switch-up refreshed the already top-of-the-class battle system in a very engaging way.</p><p>To support this greater battle, you can get quite a few new heroes in your total ranks. Instead of the usual eight, there are loads of characters to find– my final crew had 15– and it's fun to try out all of the different combinations. You'll find a few favorites: shoutout to Viator, the best tank a guy could ask for. However, changing out your party is a quick menu away.</p><p>This sizable band of heroes comes at the cost of the old skill upgrade style and a new, more rigid system. Like all <em>Octopath </em>games, you gain more agency as time goes on, but it's a long walk. It's a neat change, but I'm hoping not the new normal.</p><p>It also still has the same HD-2D style that the series has become known for. It still has its same perks– gorgeous pop-up book environments, cool enemy battle sprites– and its same drawbacks– lack of character expression, limitations of how varied characters look. It also has the same great soundtrack as the first two games, but it is mostly reused from other games.</p><p>Also returning from the original games is the lengthy endgame. <em>Octopath Traveler</em> is at its best when you can break the battle system, and getting the last tools to do so is always a satisfying feeling.</p><h2><em>Octopath Traveler 0</em>&nbsp;| Final Thoughts</h2><p><em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> is a game at odds with itself. The game presents a fantasy: you can go anywhere. You can be anyone.</p><p>In reality, every added freedom comes at too high of a cost. There are more party members than ever, but in exchange, you can customize them far less. You create your own protagonist, but in exchange, they have no personality.</p><p>Where the best freedoms of the <em>Octopath Traveler</em> series have always come from have been the way that the eight paths and eight protagonists intersect. You mix and match their jobs. You sequence break their chapters to wander into higher-level locations than you should be and challenge yourself.</p><p>In breaking these sorts of norms, <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> ends up being the most restrictive and weakest entry in the entire franchise. At least now I’m <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/octopath-traveler-ii-review" rel="nofollow">free to play <em>Octopath Traveler 2</em> again</a> instead.</p><hr><p><em><strong>Octopath Traveler 0</strong> was reviewed on Nintendo Switch 2 with a copy provided by the developer over the course of 35 hours of gameplay. All screenshots were taken during the process of review.</em><br>&nbsp;</p></div><div><p><span><div>

Paul Tobin, a distinguished Senior Concept Artist and Art Director at Weta Workshop, will be bringing his creative experience and passion to the acclaimed tabletop studio.</p><h2>Paul Tobin Joining Chaosium</h2><p>According to the official press release, Paul Tobin had a hand in many blockbuster films during his time at Weta Workshop. His work has been featured in Peter Jackson's <em>The Hobbit</em> trilogy, James Cameron's <em>Avatar</em> franchise, the award-winning sci-fi TV show, <em>The Expanse</em>, and Denis Villeneuve's <em>Blade Runner 2049</em>. Tobin's work even appeared in Monolith Software's <em>Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor</em> video game.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>But Tobin's work has also appeared in other tabletop projects. These include <em>Werewolf: The Apocalypse</em>, <em>Curseborn</em>, and <em>13th Age</em>. &nbsp;In addition, he already has a working relationship with Chaosium, working for several months on the latest edition of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/chaosium-releases-pendragon-quick-start-rules" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Pendragon</em></a>, the TTRPG set in the time of Arthurian knights.</p><p>That relationship has now strengthened with Paul Tobin working full-time at Chaosium. Furthermore, he will be contributing to art direction for the studio's most popular tabletop game, <em>Call of Cthulhu</em>. The cosmic horror TTRPG is one of the most beloved in the industry, recently celebrating its 50th anniversary with a recently announced <a href="https://www.chaosium.com/call-of-cthulhu-chaosium-50th-anniversary-slipcase-set/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">slipcase set</a>. Tobin stated the following regarding the new chapter of his career:</p><blockquote><p>"I started playing Call of Cthulhu 35 years ago, so joining Chaosium in its 50th year feels like I’ve just rolled a critical success on my Luck roll. Working on Pendragon these past few months has been incredible, and I’m excited to meet even more of the team in the months ahead."</p></blockquote><p>Chaosium was founded in 1975 by game designer Greg Stafford. &nbsp;Since its foundation, the studio has been behind many beloved tabletop experiences like the swashbuckling pirate adventures of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/7th-sea-price-of-arrogance-is-first-major-campaign-for-pirates-ttrpg" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>7th Sea</em></a>, and the bronze age fantasy of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cults-of-runequest-announced-by-chaosium" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Runequest</em></a>.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Skyblivion</em>, the ambitious total conversion mod that aims to rebuild <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</em>'s world of Cyrodiil inside its sequel <em>Skyrim</em>, has once again been delayed, this time to next year.</p><p>In a <a href="https://skyblivion.com/dev_diary/delay-announcement/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">news post</a> on the mod's official website, the <em>Skyblivion </em>team says its goal "since [the mod's] initial announcement" has been to launch in 2025, but that in order to deliver a "polished, stable, and complete experience", <em>Skyblivion </em>must be delayed to 2026.</p><p>Specifically, three areas require additional attention before the mod is complete, namely Imperial City assets and interiors, technical work on NPC and creature functionality (as well as quests), and general polish across the board.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Skyblivion </em>needs a little extra time before it's ready for release.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Despite the delay, the <em>Skyblivion </em>mod team says it's "closer than ever" to release, and that the mod is currently "in the best state it has ever been", so perhaps we can hope that this will be the final delay for the ambitious project.</p><p>Specifically, the team says the entire world map of <em>Oblivion </em>is "100% complete" in <em>Skyrim</em>, and you can check out an interactive map of the team's work <a href="https://skyblivion.com/map/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">here</a> (although it might be a little slower to load whenever the site is busy, apparently).</p><p>Additionally, all quest dungeons are complete "with unique boss battles and rewards", and the mod's core weapon, armor, and clutter assets are "essentially finished" and sporting "beautiful and unique redesigns".</p><p>You can check out a video that contains a more detailed breakdown of where the <em>Skyblivion </em>team is at, and what needs to be done next, right here.</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with <em>Skyblivion</em>, it's a total conversion mod that is aiming to reproduce the entirety of <em>Oblivion</em>'s world in <em>Skyrim</em>, complete with the former's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/skyblivion-devs-detail-remastered-quests-and-environments" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ef9bba54-91b5-4661-99d0-8e16492cc51d" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">quests</a>, environments, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/biggest-skyblivion-update-shows-world" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="892838a0-bbd2-435a-8df4-97e3eeb52ea1" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">world</a>.</p><p>The mod will be free when it launches, but it will require you to own both <em>Oblivion</em>'s Game of the Year Deluxe edition and <em>Skyrim</em>'s Special Edition, so make sure you've got both of them before you install it (when it releases, of course).</p><p><em>Skyblivion </em>has been in development for a number of years; in the intervening time between its announcement and the present day, Bethesda <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-released" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a10701c6-a666-4045-979d-936482373c34" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">released its own <em>Oblivion </em>remaster</a>, although arguably, what the <em>Skyblivion </em>team is aiming to do is even more ambitious than that.
