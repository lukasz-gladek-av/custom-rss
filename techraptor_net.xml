            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher NIS America has announced <em>Disgaea Mayhem</em>, which, as the name suggests, is a spinoff of the popular <em>Disgaea </em>strategy RPG series, and it's coming to PC and consoles this summer.</p><p>As revealed via a new trailer, <em>Disgaea Mayhem </em>will land on PC, PS5, and both Switch machines sometime later this year (sorry, Xbox owners). It marries <em>Disgaea</em>'s signature silly style with more kinetic and action-foucsed gameplay.</p><p>Per the newly-released Steam page for <em>Disgaea Mayhem</em>, the game will cast you as N.A., a mercenary hired by a princess in order to help her, erm, eat as much sweet stuff as she can. It's classic off-the-wall <em>Disgaea </em>fare.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Disgaea Mayhem </em>looks just as bonkers as the core series.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><em>Disgaea Mayhem </em>will offer seven different classes for you to play as, each based on classic <em>Disgaea </em>weapons like swords, guns, and axes, and you can switch between them at any time you like.</p><p>This being <em>Disgaea</em>, you can, of course, also look forward to two series staples in <em>Mayhem</em>: absurd grind and ludicrously over-the-top damage numbers.</p><p>NIS America says the game will feature the chance to "grind levels, improve your equipment, and...make the numbers go up until you're dealing a million damage with every hit", which sounds like <em>Disgaea</em> alright.</p><p>You can take a look at the debut trailer for <em>Disgaea Mayhem</em>, which shows off what you can expect from this new spinoff's gameplay (as well as its classic art style), right here.</p>
<p>Being a spinoff, <em>Disgaea Mayhem </em>isn't part of the mainline <em>Disgaea </em>series; the latest core title to be released is still <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/disgaea-7-vows-of-virtueless" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d70f97e5-48e0-402f-bef0-abea488c70a0" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">2023's seventh installment</a>, although judging by the past release cadence for the series, we shouldn't be too far off <em>Disgaea 8</em>.</p><p>In the meantime, however, you can check out <em>Disgaea Mayhem </em>when it lands on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4402250/Disgaea_Mayhem/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, PlayStation 5, and both Switch 2 and Switch this summer. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
