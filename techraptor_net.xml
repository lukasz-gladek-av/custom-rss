            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The trailer for <em>Critical Role</em> Campaign 4 has arrived. The newest campaign by the acclaimed actual play series will introduce a new expansive cast of characters, a different face behind the GM screen, and a brand new fantasy setting. All of this and more are teased in this trailer.</p>



<p>The official <em>Critical Role</em> Campaign 4 trailer is light on artwork, but heavy on atmosphere. It is carried with voice-over by GM Brennan Lee Mulligan, dropping events and proper names like the Falconer's Rebellion, the Sundered Houses, and the Revolutionary Council, and stating that the players' grandparents have defied the gods.</p>


<p>This worldbuilding is crucial since the major selling point of Campaign 4 is that it is not set in Matt Mercer's world of Exandria. Instead, it is set in the world of Araman, a world that has recently seen the death of their gods. Because of this, the trailer is helping set the world of Araman apart from the land that hosted the heroics of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/legend-of-vox-machina-season-3-review-darker-season-of-dd-twists" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Vox Machina</a> and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-announces-mighty-nein-release-date-first-image-of-yasha" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Mighty Nein</a>.</p>

<p>When paired with the video description, the <em>Critical Role</em> Campaign 4 trailer seems to confirm where this story will begin. The party is brought together to uncover the truth of the fate of hero Thjazi Fang, who has been marked for execution. To this end, they will journey across the fractured world and connect in ways never imagined.</p>

<p>This campaign is one packed with firsts for the actual play series. This is the first long-form campaign not GM'd by <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a9a9913f-42e9-4189-bbde-08061c01a7e8" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/matthew-mercer-interview" rel="nofollow">Matt Mercer</a>; instead, it will be helmed by Dimension20's own Brennan Lee Mulligan. In addition, the campaign will be done West Marches-style, spanning three tables of characters set in different locations across the vast fantasy setting of Araman.</p>
