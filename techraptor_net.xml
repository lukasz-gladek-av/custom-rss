            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gears-of-war-e-day-people-can-fly<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Gears of War: Judgment&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Bulletstorm&nbsp;</em>developer People Can Fly has announced that it is returning to the series to work as a co-developer on the upcoming <i>Gears of War: E-Day</i>.</p>

<p>In an announcement <a href="https://peoplecanfly.com/partnership-announcement/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on its website, People Can Fly reveals that it'll be working on the game alongside The Coalition, the studio which has stewarded&nbsp;<em>Gears of War&nbsp;</em>since 2016's&nbsp;<em>Gears of War 4</em>.</p>

<p>People Can Fly says&nbsp;<em>Gears of War&nbsp;</em>is "deeply embedded in our studio's history" and that the studio has "always been passionate about the series and its legacy". It doesn't reveal exactly what it'll be providing with regards to <i>E-Day</i>'s development.</p>

<p>Development director Guillaume Barry adds that People Can Fly is made up of "dedicated&nbsp;<em>Gears of War&nbsp;</em>fans", and that the studio is "pouring everything we have into creating an experience that will exceed expectations".</p>

<p>For his part, The Coalition studio head Mike Crump says&nbsp;<em>E-Day&nbsp;</em>represents "a return to what makes&nbsp;<em>Gears of War&nbsp;</em>games special and authentic", and says his studio is "pleased" to partner with People Can Fly on the project.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Barry also says People Can Fly "can't share more just yet", so if you were hoping for more details than the scant teaser trailer provides, then you're sadly out of luck.</p>




<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Gears of War: E-Day&nbsp;</em>is, it's a prequel set fourteen years before the events of the original&nbsp;<em>Gears of War</em>.</p>

<p>Announced during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-xbox-showcase-2024-announcement" rel="nofollow">last year's Xbox summer showcase</a>, the game will once again star Marcus Fenix and Dom Santiago as they deal with the beginnings of the Locust invasion.</p>

<p>We don't know a lot about&nbsp;<em>E-Day&nbsp;</em>yet, although we do know it'll <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/gears-of-war/gears-of-war-e-day-director-says-the-new-shooter-will-absolutely-be-doing-more-linear-levels-instead-of-gear-5s-open-ended-maps/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">focus more</a> on the linear levels for which the series became known rather than the open-ended levels of&nbsp;<em>Gears 5</em>.</p>

<p><em>Gears of War: E-Day&nbsp;</em>is set to launch for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3010850/Gears_of_War_EDay/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/gears-of-war-eday" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, although we don't have a release date for it yet. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-lays-off-yet-more-employees-and-closes-another-office.1092858/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-layoffs-leamington-closure<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has closed down yet another studio and laid off almost 200 employees, with a support outfit in the UK being shuttered and three studios undergoing "targeted restructurings", i.e. layoffs.</p>

<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-announces-studio-closure-as-it-lays-off-185-staff" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>, a spokesperson for Ubisoft said the closure and downsizings were "part of our ongoing efforts to prioritize projects and reduce costs" in order to "ensure long-term stability".</p>

<p>As such, the company's Leamington branch, a support studio that's worked on the likes of&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Skull and Bones</em>, will be closed entirely, while Ubisoft Düsseldorf, Ubisoft Stockholm and Ubisoft Reflections will be downsized. Overall, Ubisoft is letting go 185 of its employees.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ubisoft-leamington-closing-layoffs-skull-and-bones.jpg?itok=FrD3gmu7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ubisoft-leamington-closing-layoffs-skull-and-bones.jpg?itok=lpG68lAn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Skull and Bones&nbsp;</em>support studio Ubisoft Leamington is no more.</figcaption></figure><p>The cost-cutting measures to which Ubisoft refers have already seen it close down its San Francisco and Osaka branches, the former being responsible for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing" rel="nofollow">developing the flop multiplayer FPS&nbsp;<em>XDefiant</em></a>.</p>

<p>It's not just&nbsp;<em>XDefiant&nbsp;</em>that flopped, either; two high-profile releases, namely&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Skull and Bones&nbsp;</em>(both of which Leamington worked on as a support studio), <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-h1-2024-25-fiscal-results" rel="nofollow">contributed to a $285 million loss</a> for the company in the first half of the 2024-25 fiscal year.</p>

<p>Ubisoft's woes don't end there, either. Having likely banked on the November release of&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>to bolster its finances, the game was instead <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-february" rel="nofollow">delayed to February</a>, then <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-march" rel="nofollow">again to March</a>.</p>

<p>As if that wasn't enough, the company is also facing unrest from its shareholders, some of whom have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activist-ubisoft-investor-open-letter-change" rel="nofollow">called for "strategic and structural change"</a>&nbsp;and expressed "deep dissatisfaction" with what they see as the direction in which the studio is currently heading.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-leamington-closure.jpg?itok=I3xrNZE8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-leamington-closure.jpg?itok=7kTrshzN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ubisoft is likely banking on a big success with&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Amid reports that company boss Yves Guillemot and major shareholder Tencent are <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-bosses-tencent-private-buyout-report" rel="nofollow">considering taking the company private</a>, another potential force to be reckoned with on this front is the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund, which has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-mirage-dlc-report-ubisoft" rel="nofollow">reportedly provided funding</a> for new&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Mirage&nbsp;</em>DLC.</p>

<p>Whatever the case may be, Ubisoft desperately needs a big hit if it's going to dig itself out of the rut in which it's found itself. For the sake of the company, let's hope&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>is that hit. You can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/assassins-creed-shadows-hands-on-preview" rel="nofollow">read our preview of it here</a> if you want to know how we think it's shaping up.</p>
