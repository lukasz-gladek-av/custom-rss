            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/infinity-nikki-steam-confirmed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Infold Games has announced that an <i>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</i>Steam release is on the way, so you're in luck if you've been wanting to add the cozy open-world adventure to your library on Valve's app.</p>

<p>In a press release, Infold confirms that the game, which has attracted more than 20 million downloads since launching in December, will support cross-progression, so you'll be able to pick up where you left off on Steam.</p>

<p>It does sound like that feature will require an Infold Games account, though, so if you were hoping to check out&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>on Steam without signing up to another third-party account, it looks like you'll be out of luck.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/infinity-nikki-steam-balloons.jpg?itok=PHDGykfy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/infinity-nikki-steam-balloons.jpg?itok=KjRwbbsJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>is floating its way onto Steam.</figcaption></figure><p>Not only will&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>be available on Steam, but it'll also boast "the full range of features unique to the platform", according to Infold Games. That means widespread controller support, Steam achievements, and "social integration".</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/InfinityNikkiEN/status/1890262857750905235" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message</a> on X, Infold says that each <em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>Steam wishlist milestone it reaches will result in more rewards for players. Getting 10,000 wishlists will grant players some "live wallpaper", while hitting 50,000 will reveal some new concept art.</p>

<p>At 100,000 wishlists, Infold will reveal "more surprises", while 200,000 wishlists will result in "the final surprise" being granted to players. That sounds pretty ominous, but given&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki</em>'s cozy vibes and cutesy aesthetic, I'm sure it'll be something light-hearted.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/infinity-nikki-steam-wishlists.jpg?itok=CNySqrzm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/infinity-nikki-steam-wishlists.jpg?itok=AbpvQSXJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Wishlisting&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>on Steam could lead to something good.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki</em>, it's an open-world adventure that emphasizes platforming, minigames, and general cozy vibes rather than action-packed setpieces or tense combat.</p>

<p>The game sees Nikki and her companion Momo exploring the world of Miraland, and while there is a story (and it's got some pretty high stakes at that), the focus here is much more on enjoying the game however you want to.</p>

<p>Since release,&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>has proven pretty popular, attracting <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/infinity-nikki-downloads-10m" rel="nofollow">over 10 million downloads in just a few days</a>. Two major <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/infinity-nikki-version-1-1" rel="nofollow">updates</a> have been released for the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/infinity-nikki-version-12-release-date" rel="nofollow">so far</a>, bringing new outfits, story content, and more.</p>

<p><em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>is available now on <a href="https://infinitynikki.infoldgames.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices</a>. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3164330/Infinity_Nikki/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wishlist the game on Steam right here</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fantasy Life i Release Date Confirmed for May, Additional Platforms Revealed]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fantasy-life-i-release-date-confirmed-for-may-additional-platforms-revealed.1109583/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Level-5 has announced the&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</em>release date, with the long-awaited JRPG landing not only on Switch but also on other platforms in May.</p>

<p>That's right: after numerous delays,&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em>finally has a concrete release date, and it's May 21st. Not only that, but the game will be arriving across PC, PlayStation, and Xbox as well as Switch.</p>

<p><em>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</em>was first revealed during a February <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/february-2023-nintendo-direct-here-are-all-news-announcements" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Direct presentation</a>, at which point it was given a release window of 2023. That release window later proved to be overly optimistic, though, as in November of that year, Level-5 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-girl-who-steals-time-delayed" rel="nofollow">delayed the game to 2024</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fantasy-life-i-release-date-dragon-characters.jpg?itok=64Wg7ErB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fantasy-life-i-release-date-dragon-characters.jpg?itok=kKa7QJEQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</em>finally has a release date.</figcaption></figure><p>Eventually, a release date of October 10th was settled on for&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i</em>, but it was then announced that the game wouldn't make that date either, with Level-5 delaying its "slow life" RPG <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-girl-who-steals-time-delayed-indefinitely" rel="nofollow">indefinitely in August last year</a>.</p>

<p>Now, however, Level-5 has announced a release date for&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i</em>, and it looks like the studio is serious about this one, although there's every chance it'll be delayed again before May 21st rolls around.</p>

<p>The release date was revealed as part of a brand new features trailer for&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i</em>, showing off the things you can do in the game. If you're a fan of the original 3DS&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life</em>, then it's likely you'll find a lot to like here as well.</p>

<p>Not only can you adventure across a "vast open world" and choose which one of a variety of jobs you want to pursue, but you can also create and maintain your own island, delve into "endless dungeons", and even play the game in split-screen co-op.</p>




<p><em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2993780/FANTASY_LIFE_i_The_Girl_Who_Steals_Time/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10013482/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, Xbox, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/FANTASY-LIFE-i-The-Girl-Who-Steals-Time-2339978.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> on May 21st (assuming it doesn't get delayed again). Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-financials-cost-cutting-q3</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-pledges-more-cost-cutting-measures-after-tough-third-quarter.1109580/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-financials-cost-cutting-q3<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has revealed that it plans to implement yet more cost-cutting measures into the next financial year in order to exceed its cost reduction targets "by a significant margin".</p>

<p>In its latest financial <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/2GbdOQTUuRZV3mqGXgTfeK/520f2262c4f60b4bc13f0f3a59ec37e7/Ubisoft_FY25_Q3_PR_English_vFinal.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a> (which covers the period between October and December 2024), Ubisoft reveals that its "net bookings" - essentially net sales sans fees and other cancellations - fell by 34.8% when compared to the same period last year.</p>

<p>The company points to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing" rel="nofollow">cancellation of first-person shooter&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing" rel="nofollow">XDefiant</a>&nbsp;</em>and the closure of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-layoffs-leamington-closure" rel="nofollow">three</a> Ubisoft locations as major cost reduction initiatives, and CEO Yves Guillemot says Ubisoft isn't done yet, although he doesn't clarify exactly what's coming next.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ubisoft-finances-cost-cutting-xdefiant.jpg?itok=6spiOGKj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ubisoft-finances-cost-cutting-xdefiant.jpg?itok=bhcu7Nf7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ubisoft canned first-person shooter&nbsp;<em>XDefiant&nbsp;</em>in December.</figcaption></figure><p>Guillemot says that Ubisoft "plan[s] to pursue [its] efforts" with regards to cost-cutting measures into the 2025-26 financial year, "going beyond the initial target by a significant margin".</p>

<p>It's not entirely clear what he means by that, but given that previous cost-cutting measures have involved layoffs and studio closures, it's not unlikely that we'll see more of that kind of thing in the year to come.</p>

<p>He also says that the "formal review process of [Ubisoft's] strategic options" is ongoing, with a view to "unlock[ing] the best value from our assets for our stakeholders" and fostering the "best conditions to create great games in a fast-evolving market".</p>

<p>For context, a Ubisoft shareholder <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activist-ubisoft-investor-open-letter-change" rel="nofollow">called for "strategic and structural change"</a> at the company back in September, reportedly prompting Guillemot and major stakeholder Tencent to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-bosses-tencent-private-buyout-report" rel="nofollow">consider taking the company private</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-snow.jpg?itok=We_M_-tE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-snow.jpg?itok=y0jZGoJS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ubisoft is probably banking on&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>to do well.</figcaption></figure><p>With regards to Ubisoft's future, Guillemot says the company is "fully focused on the upcoming launch of&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-march" rel="nofollow">on March 20th</a>", echoing the studio's comment when approached about <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-mirage-dlc-report-ubisoft" rel="nofollow">rumors of Saudi-funded&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Mirage&nbsp;</em>DLC</a>.</p>

<p>As noted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisoft-ceo-says-the-plan-is-to-focus-on-open-world-and-live-service-games-year-after-year/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">VGC</a>, during a followup Q&amp;A session, Guillemot told investors that Ubisoft is committed to "open-world action adventure" games and "game as a service-native experiences" for the foreseeable future, so if you were hoping for a&nbsp;<em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown&nbsp;</em>sequel, you may well be disappointed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-31-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has revealed the release date for&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.1, with the latest update for the spacefaring turn-based gacha RPG set to land later this month.</p>

<p>Titled "Light Slips the Gate, Shadow Greets the Throne" in typical grandiose HoYoverse style, Version 3.1 will arrive on February 26th and will bring a brand new map to explore, plus two new 5-star characters to use and more.</p>

<p>First up, Version 3.1 will let you explore the Grove of Epiphany, a city-state under attack by a "shadowy foe" looking to claim its Titan's Coreflame for its own. The Trailblaze Mission for this update will see you investigating what's happening in the Grove and reclaiming the Coreflame.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/honkai-star-rail-version-3.1-release-date-mydei-fight.jpg?itok=vpjY_6zz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/honkai-star-rail-version-3.1-release-date-mydei-fight.jpg?itok=S2RYc3ku 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Mydei is one of your two new fighters in&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.1.</figcaption></figure><p>As you'd expect from a&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>update (well, if <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-27-release-date" rel="nofollow">previous form</a> is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-26-release-date" rel="nofollow">anything to go by</a>, that is), there are two new 5-star characters joining the game's roster in Version 3.1.</p>

<p>The first is Tribbie, a transformed version of the demigod Tribbios. HoYoverse says she deliberately split herself into "thousands of Messengers" using the Century Gate, and now, she can join your party.</p>

<p>She can buff your team and debuff enemies to help your party deal more damage, so she's a valuable combatant to have if you need an extra edge in combat.</p>

<p>Your second new fighter in Version 3.1 is Mydei, a "warrior as valiant as a lion" who consumes HP to deal extra damage. Reruns for Yunli and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-introduces-new-five-star-character-huohuo" rel="nofollow">Huohuo</a> will also appear in the first and second halves of the Version 3.1 event cycle.</p>




<p>You can also look forward to a new season of Divergent Universe in which battles will be split between day and night, introducing unique effects for both times of day. That's alongside the usual gameplay fixes and miscellaneous quality-of-life improvements.</p>

<p><em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices</a>. Version 3.1 launches across all platforms on February 26th.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hyper-light-breaker-roadmap-first-update</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hyper-light-breaker-roadmap-and-first-major-update-revealed.1109490/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hyper-light-breaker-roadmap-first-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Heart Machine and publisher Arc Games have revealed the first major Early Access roadmap for action-adventure roguelike&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker</em>, as well as what's coming as part of the game's first big update next week.</p>

<p>The game launched last month to mixed player reviews on Steam, with players <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hyper-light-breaker-fixes-coming" rel="nofollow">criticizing performance and accessibility issues</a> as well as some of the game's design.</p>

<p>As you can probably guess, the first big update in February, which lands on the 18th, aims to address some of those problems, promising rebalancing for combat and gear as well as "performance updates" and bug fixes.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hyper-light-breaker-roadmap-fight.jpg?itok=oiZfF5AO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hyper-light-breaker-roadmap-fight.jpg?itok=tESpoMn1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hyper Light Breaker</em>'s first roadmap is aiming to address some of its most common sticking points.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as these fixes and rebalancing efforts, the February monthly update will also bring a new player character, new holobytes, and new enemies to fight, plus new affixes to experiment with.</p>

<p>Another monthly update will arrive in March, and it'll bring plenty of new stuff; new enemies and a new assassin are on the way, plus more performance updates and more rebalancing.</p>

<p>Following that, a significant new update is coming in April, and this one's big enough to get its own name. The Buried Below update continues the previous two updates' efforts with regards to rebalancing and bug fixing, but it also brings new areas, another new player character, and "improved onboarding".</p>

<p>There's plenty more coming before the game's 1.0 launch as well, although that launch still doesn't have a release date. You can see the full&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>Early Access roadmap right here.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hyper-light-breaker-roadmap-full.jpg?itok=vjJ4C1_a 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hyper-light-breaker-roadmap-full.jpg?itok=ZQ4dAe-z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There's lots on the way for&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker</em>.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>is the latest game in the&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light&nbsp;</em>series. Developed by Heart Machine, the game eschews its predecessor's top-down&nbsp;<em>Zelda</em>-style perspective in favor of a full 3D look, and it's a roguelike as opposed to&nbsp;<em>Drifter</em>'s handcrafted adventure.</p>

<p>While sales figures haven't been officially released, it seems that&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>hasn't exactly performed as well as parent company Embracer would have liked, at least if its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-2m-embracer" rel="nofollow">recent financial statement</a> is anything to go by.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>right now on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1534840/Hyper_Light_Breaker/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam Early Access</a>, and if you'd like to know what our very own Austin thought of the game, you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/hyper-light-breaker-preview-journey-worth-taking" rel="nofollow">take a look at his preview here</a>.</p>
