            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/warhammer-40000-secret-level-trailer-brings-glory-to-imperium<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> <em>Secret Level</em> trailer has been released. The upcoming animated anthology series, announced during this year's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/secret-level-brings-videogame-anthology-to-prime-video" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gamescom</a>, will be featuring an episode in Games Workshop's grimdark sci-fi universe. Specifically, the new trailer puts the spotlight on the Ultramarines.</p>



<p>In an official Warhammer-Community post, Games Workshop posted the <em>Warhammer 40,000 Secret Level</em> trailer. As the title implies, the trailer is a 40-second teaser of footage from the show set in the enduring sci-fi universe.</p>


<p><em>Secret Level</em> is an animated anthology series aimed at adults. It is being produced by the same creative mind behind another popular anthology series: Netflix's <em>Love, Death + Robots</em>. In addition to <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000</em></a>, the series will include episodes based on <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/sifu" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Sifu</em></a>.</p>

<p>As for what is in that trailer, it appears to be a straightforward mission for the Ultramarines, the power armored enforcers the will of the Imperium of Man. The teaser is light on action, what little can be seen shows the Ultramarines fighting what appears to be a horde of human bandits. They even have <em>Mad Max</em>-esque gear and motorcycles.</p>

<p>The teaser also implies the episode may be an origin story for a named character. There's a brief scene of a young man covered in blood staring at the camera in the rain. All while a narrator voices dogmatic phrases of turning fear into loyalty. The face of the man even match cuts to an Ultramarine putting his helmet on.</p>

<p>The <em>Warhammer 40,000 Secret Level</em> trailer ends with the Ultramarine fighting something alien, his knife covered in glowing blue viscera, followed shortly by succession of rapidfire images.</p>

<p>Secret Level will debut on Prime Video December 10.</p>
