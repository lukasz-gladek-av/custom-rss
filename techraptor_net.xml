            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wizkids-icons-of-the-realms-underdark-expeditions-miniatures-nightlights-to-stop-you-bumping-in-the-dark.1189494/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/wizkids-icons-of-realms-underdark-expeditions-miniatures-nightlights-to-stop-you<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There's a lot of classic Dungeons &amp; Dragons monsters that steal the limelight; dragons, beholders, demons, etc. But for all of the monsters that patrol the surface of our favorite D&amp;D settings there are locations like the Underdark that feature more… unique creatures. Wizkids Underdark Expeditions pack not only includes some of these creepy critters, but also features the first glow-in-the-dark miniatures from Wizkids.</p>

<p>As is standard now Underdark Expeditions is available to purchase in Blind Boxes, each of which contains 3 small or medium sized miniatures, and one large or bigger. These sizes relate to the stat block of the creature.</p>

<h2>Be Sure To Look Up When Exploring The Underdark</h2>

<p>Of the smallest miniatures I received from my eight blind boxes there were plenty of duplicates in this category. Some of the monsters were familiar to me, while others I'll need to do some investigation before I put them out on the table for a low-level party.</p>

<ul><li aria-level="1">Choker</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Darkmantle</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Gazer</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Giant Centipede</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Giant Rat x2</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Myconid Sprout x2</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Piercer x2</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizkids-underdark-expeditions-small.jpg?itok=Dn0v7gvd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizkids-underdark-expeditions-small.jpg?itok=9L5m8Z6N 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>I was really pleased to get some Piercers and a Darkmantle together, as they're canonically known to hunt together. These are fantastic examples of an Underdark twist or something your party might know to expect. The Piercers tails are reminiscent of a stalagtight, these predators hang from the ceilings of caves just waiting to drop. The Darkmantle hunts similarly, it's miniature here shown ready to drop down and envelop the head of it's opponent.</p>

<p>For the more humanoid creatures the Myconid Sprouts show off their eerieness with an unnatural blue color to them. Up close you can make out the features of crossed arms and a face, but from a distance it might even just look like set dressing to players at your table.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for the size the choker just looks like a small green humanoid. A lot of the finer detail, such as the mouth full of sharp teeth, tentacle suckers on the ends of it's arms, or it's maliable cartilage body really come across for this little miniature.</p>

<h2>Aberrant Horrors</h2>

<p>The Medium creatures I pulled immediately take a further turn from the standard into the creepy and eerie. From this I pulled:</p>

<ul><li aria-level="1">Babau</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Choldrith</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Deep Rothe</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Fire Snake</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Gray Ooze</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Quaggoth</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Shadow</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Swarm of Bats</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Vampiric Mist</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Xorn</li>
</ul><p>Starting with the creatures that are spins on what we're familiar with the Quaggoth hunches forward in its stance, leering with it's lowered head. One of it's hands clenched into a fist, while the other is poised to grab an adventurer. The Choldrith too has an impressive pose, reared up on it's hind (four) legs, with a dagger ready to slash. These cursed spawn of Lolth rituals lead others in her ways, obeying only her command.</p>



<p>Moving even further from the norm we have creatures like the Xorn and Babau. These are the kinds of creatures that defy traditional sense, looking like they have too many limbs, or not enough limbs, or just limbs in the totally wrong place.</p>

<p>This is when your players will know that they're not in Waterdeep anymore. For the Xorn specifically the mix of too many limbs and the rocky texture across their body show perfect detail with under the light. No matter where you are on the table you'll be able to see how unique it is.</p>

<p>For those with no form at all the Shadow does a good job of being way too dark and shows just slight humanoid figures. Unlike the Choker who suffers from being too close to a human form but green by making the shadow this ominous and looming form it takes it away from reality and makes it something scarier to face.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizkids-underdark-expeditions-large.jpg?itok=LmFR5fT5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizkids-underdark-expeditions-large.jpg?itok=xLa1ZRjn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>For the Large creatures I pulled:</p>

<ul><li aria-level="1">Barghest</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Carrion Crawler</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Drider</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Giant Bat</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Hook Horror</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Umber Hulk</li>
</ul><p>Here the miniatures remained decidedly subterranean but moved further away from the kinds of aberrant creatures that were medium-sized. Making your way through a system of caves you'll likely run across creatures like the Giant Bat or Carrion Crawler. I am extremely impressed with the smooth leathery quality of the bats wings, spread out, which its beady eyes are focused on a target and teeth are bared.</p>

<p>Interestingly, this isn't the first time Wizkids has included an Umberhulk in their expansions, the last one was available in Spelljammer: Adventures in Space. What did surprise me looking at the two is that each is posed differently. Some slight changes to arm position, stance, and where the head is turning. This is also true of the Drider from Underdark Expeditions and Vecna: Eve of Ruin.</p>

<p>It's nice to have a few minis of something, but even better to have minis with variants to them, it doesn't look like you're throwing down an army of clones and can help combat feel varied.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizkids-underdark-expeditions-glow-in-the-dark.jpg?itok=9ZTqK0qq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizkids-underdark-expeditions-glow-in-the-dark.jpg?itok=GpnYX-yP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Creatures That Go Glow In The Dark</h2>

<p>The last creatures to mention are the glow-in-the-dark ones. From this set I got the following creatures:</p>

<ul><li aria-level="1">Flumph x2</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Gas Spore</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Magma Mephit</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Oblex Spawn</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Venom Troll (This one I believe is Glow In The Dark, it might just be toxic green in color)</li>
</ul><p>Right off the bat, I do want to say that while each of these are marketed as glow in the dark the mileage will definitely vary. The Gas Spore and Oblex Spawn were definitely glowing when I locked myself in my lightless laundry room, some of the paint around the back of the Venom Troll also glowed, but the Flumph and Magma Mephit didn't give off any glow in the dark.</p>

<p>The other genuine question about this is… when are you going to be playing in a dark enough space that you'll be able to review your character sheet, run a session, plan combat, and also have a glow-in-the-dark be recognizable.</p>

<p>I think the charm in these is that by simply looking at them you can tell from the semi-translucent green that they're glow-in-the-dark. The idea of them being glow-in-the-dark is almost a better pay off than getting to see them in the dark.</p>

<p>The most impressive of these is the Gas Spore, this monster looking like a Beholder's distant underdark cousin sits on an incredibly detailed cloud of gas, the semi-transparency lends really well to the effect here.</p>

<h2>Wizkids Icons of the Realms Underdark Expeditions Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>This set does feature a good number of strange and creepy creatures that a party might run afoul of in the Underdark. Followers of Lolth, strange adaptive creatures, and even some (kind of) glowing monsters.</p>

<p>From my mix of draws I did get a number of more common creatures from caves or sewers but it also makes sense that not everything is going to be a horror from the deep Underdark.</p>

<p>The glow-in-the-dark effect is fun on paper, in practice it doesn't quite have the effect you'd expect, maybe if you let them bake under a UV light for a bit before drawing them out you'll get a more impactful reveal.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/fbc-firebreak-preview-synergistic-mayhem</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fbc-firebreak-preview-synergistic-mayhem.1189455/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/fbc-firebreak-preview-synergistic-mayhem<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remedy is well-known for being wonderfully weird, so it’s no surprise to learn that <em>FBC: Firebreak </em>is an exercise in using the insane to kill the horrifying demon-like Hiss. It’s mechanically dense with a lot of interconnected systems that has a few rough edges but a strong heart.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Firebreak </em>is set six years after the events of <em>Control </em>and takes you back to some iconic locations in the Oldest House. In those six years, the Hiss have done a lot to make The Oldest House home, so it’s up to you and a couple of friends to clear them out.</p>

<h2>Firebreak is Like Left 4 Dead But a Whole Lot More</h2>

<p>A co-op shooter made of teams of three, <em>Firebreak </em>will give you <em>Left 4 Dead</em> vibes fairly quickly when you first start to play the game. The more you understand its mechanics, however, the more you’ll come to see all they share is the hordes of enemies to contend with.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, the guns in Firebreak are pretty ineffective and inefficient when it comes to killing the Hiss. You will quickly become overrun, and while there are means to keep getting ammunition more or less indefinitely, it won’t be enough.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That’s where the special weaponry and Crisis Kits come into play. Crisis Kits are classes that come with specific weapons and tools. We had access to three but there will be five on launch. For example, the Fix Kit gives you a big wrench that lets you quickly repair things like healing stations or maybe deploy a turret mounted to a wheeled office chair that will shoot wildly at enemies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Utilizing the abilities and special weaponry within your kits is absolutely the key to <em>Firebreak</em>. As mentioned, guns will only get you so far. Even more, while the kits themselves offer a lot of firepower, their synergy is their greatest strength.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They get more nuanced and complex than this, but an example is the synergy between the Jump Kit and the Splash Kit. The Jump Kit lets you shock enemies and the Splash Kit lets you spray enemies with water. You get the gist.&nbsp;</p>

<p>More importantly, though, those weapons have big areas they hit and allow you to take out a huge group of enemies at once. You’ll never get that sort of efficiency with weapons.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The funnest parts of your kit, however, come in the sort of “ultimate” abilities you get. Each kit has a SCP-like Altered Item that you can unleash on enemies. The Jump Kit lets you fire off a garden gnome that creates a massive storm that will damage anyone, including allies, caught within it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, the kits offered up enough variety they made my experience with each mission, or Job, very different. Your role and what you contribute changes quite dramatically, so you can find the role that fits you like a glove or bounce around if you ever get tired of one.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>You Can Adjust the Difficulty to Your Liking</h2>

<p>We had access to three different Job types in our preview, though there will be five when the game launches. All three of them were wonderfully <em>Control</em>-themed, with very different tasks to complete.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Before getting into some of them specifically, all Jobs have a Clearance Level you can select, which is basically a difficulty selection. The higher the level, the more difficult enemies become, but that's not the only thing that changes.</p>

<p>At higher Clearance Levels, you will have more tasks to complete as well. In one, you essentially unlock a huge boss fight that you must defeat to complete the job. Additionally, there are other wrinkles like moving the ammo and healing stations to random parts of the level. On lower levels, these are always in set locations you don’t need to search for.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To further add to the difficulty, you can adjust the Corruption Level as well. Essentially, this will add corrupted items to the Job that will modify the difficulty in some way. You’ll need to find a special item to destroy them as well. In one of my runs, we had to find a corrupted stapler in the office that doubled the health of enemies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One gripe some may have is in the level design. Each Job’s layout was relatively straight forward, but when a lot of combat revolves around hordes of enemies, the more open layouts with hallways makes some sense. The layouts stay the same for the Job you have each time as well.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Firebreak's Jobs Are All Refreshingly Different</h2>

<p>With that said, I got the feeling that the goal is to have a good variety of Jobs to complete. Each kind of Job is very different and set in an entirely unique location.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In Hot Fix, we were tasked with repairing various systems in the furnace, Paper Chase is all about destroying a bunch of sticky notes that have covered everything (even creating monsters of sticky notes to fight), and Ground Control had us collecting radioactive pearls with a payload we pushed along the level to a launch site to send them off.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Jobs were varied enough with interesting goals to make each feel very distinct from the other. It is not as though each devolved into a “fend off the horde while we mash X button on Y machine,” though there’s plenty of fending off hordes while you’re trying to get something done.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fbc-firebreak-healing-station.jpg?itok=4998Oqdl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fbc-firebreak-healing-station.jpg?itok=P2fbwUAU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>These stations not only heal but get rid of effects like fire, radiation, and even sticky notes that can obscure your vision.</figcaption></figure><p>Movement and positioning yourself between the hordes of enemies and your objectives is key in every Job, but some of them force you to be on the move a whole lot more. It sounds simple when written but the varied dynamism in any one level really makes the experience quite different.</p>

<p>There’s even some hazards/benefits to the different levels as well. Fire is generally a bad thing in that it harms you and can make enemies do more damage, so someone using the Splash Kit can put the fire out on enemies and other players. The office building has sprinklers you can set off to get the job done as well. Keep an eye out for environmental context clues, as there were a few things that just made sense in how they worked and interacted with the rest of the game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The final thing to mention quickly is the upgrade system. Each Job you do, you can collect some currency in the level and will be rewarded at completion. You use that to unlock new weapons, upgrade weapons, cosmetics, perks, etc.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Perks aside, the rest are set up in a very Battle Pass-like way. Not that there is one necessarily, but it’s a familiar looking way to get upgrades.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Perks use the same currencies, and you can have up to 9 at once, all of which are upgradeable to more powerful versions as well. This is where you’ll be able to fine tune a build to what you want.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There will also be premium cosmetic items only available through purchase.</p>

<h2>Firebreak's UI Can Be Confusing and Unwieldy</h2>

<p>Most of my gripes with the game come from the UI and just how little is explained to you. Granted, our preview session gave us access to way more than you’ll get at the start of the game, so it was a little bit of an information overload. We were also told that they’ve already made significant UI changes from the build we played as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Things like the menus were difficult to navigate and sometimes it was hard to see what was going on or where to go on screen with just how much was going on. Hopefully there will be some nice changes there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ineffectiveness and lack of real weight behind any of the guns may be a big turn-off for some people, too. My first hour or so with the game, I was certainly feeling that. So many enemies felt like a bullet sponge, but it wasn’t until the other mechanics clicked that I felt I was able to make progress.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the gunplay felt light and lacking impact. I’m sure there will be some builds and upgrades to make them more useful, but <em>Firebreak </em>is definitely more about the various special weapons and tools you get access to in any one Kit. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>FBC: Firebreak Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>I think there’s enough here to be cautiously optimistic about <em>FBC: Firebreak </em>but who knows the future of the game. The gameplay systems are fun, engaging, and unique, and the Jobs offer some great variety. But are 5 different mission types, each with their own unique but unchanging level, enough? Does the $40 price tag create too much of a barrier even if there aren’t the usual free-to-play trappings to churn through? &nbsp;</p>

<p>It’s impossible to predict the future of these sorts of games, but I think Remedy has put forth an interesting effort that people should enjoy.&nbsp;</p>
