            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>iRacing Studios, the developer behind the upcoming&nbsp;<em>NASCAR 25</em>, has announced a multi-year partnership to bring a series of IndyCar games to PC and consoles, starting with an inaugural title next year.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.indycar.com/news/2025/08/08-26-iracing-console-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on the official IndyCar website, the open-wheel racing brand reveals that the first IndyCar title is due to land on PC and current-gen consoles in "the second half of 2026".</p>

<p>It'll mark the first IndyCar game since 2004's&nbsp;<em>IndyCar Series 2005</em>, which was developed by legendary racing studio Codemasters (which also had the&nbsp;<em>WRC&nbsp;</em>series <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nacon-wrc-games-2027-2032" rel="nofollow">taken away from it by Nacon</a> recently amid rumors of a shutdown).</p>

<p>iRacing president Tony Gardner says that IndyCar fans have "long been clamoring for a standalone title for consoles", and that the studio's upcoming game will "offer all the excitement of the NTT IndyCar series and an immersive experience that fans of all ages can enjoy".</p>

<p>As for IndyCar's president J. Douglas Boles, he says that the IndyCar series is "the most competitive and challenging racing on the planet", and that as such, it "deserves a dedicated and widely available gaming experience".</p>

<p>You can expect a "robust, multilevel career mode" in iRacing's IndyCar game, as well as licensed drivers from the IndyCar series and Indy NXT. Naturally, the game will also support online multiplayer to help you prove your racing dominance around the world.</p>

<p>We'll likely learn more about IndyCar and iRacing's collaboration in the months to come, so stay tuned for more. When it launches, it's due on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, and it looks like it'll support Steam Deck as well.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Skate Early Access Release Date Revealed for September]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/skate-early-access-release-date-september</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has announced an Early Access release date for its&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>reboot, and the always-online open-world reimagining of the classic skateboarding franchise is due to arrive in just a couple of weeks.</p>

<p>As revealed in a trailer released earlier today,&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>is set to launch across PC and consoles (including last-gen machines, but not including Nintendo's Switch family) on September 16th.</p>

<p>Just to remind you, rather than the more traditional boxed-game approach of its predecessors, the&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>reboot will be a free-to-play experience; EA describes it as an "ever-evolving online skateboarding sandbox, refreshed with a forever vision in mind".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skate-reboot-early-access-release-date-church.jpg?itok=P12TtELF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skate-reboot-early-access-release-date-church.jpg?itok=gQn6XRht 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>EA's&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>reboot is set to arrive in September.</figcaption></figure><p>EA first revealed that the&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>franchise would be making a return <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/skate-franchise-willed-into-existence-again" rel="nofollow">back in 2020</a>, at which point it had been ten years since we last heard from the series. Original&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>co-creator Cuz Parry said at the time that the reboot had been "willed into existence" by eager fans.</p>

<p>Subsequently, a new studio, Full Circle, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/skate-4-is-happening-ea-forms-new-studio" rel="nofollow">was created</a> to work on what was then tentatively known as&nbsp;<em>Skate 4</em>, with the project <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/skate-4-now-titled-skate-will-be-free-to-play" rel="nofollow">officially being renamed</a> to simply "<em>Skate</em>" and gaining free-to-play status in 2022.</p>

<p>Following that, in September last year, EA <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/skate-reboot-early-access-2025" rel="nofollow">revealed</a> that&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>would be making its way to Early Access sometime in 2025, and a financial statement from the publisher <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-sales-4m-battlefield-skate" rel="nofollow">later confirmed</a> it would arrive sometime before March 2026.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what this&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>reboot will offer, you can check out EA's new Early Access release date announcement trailer below. It should give you some idea of what you're in for if you decide to check it out.</p>




<p>According to EA, the new&nbsp;<em>Skate</em>'s setting of San Vansterdam will offer "new spots to discover, hundreds of challenges to conquer, and a constantly dynamic scene driven by community". It'll also feature a new iteration of the&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>series' signature "Flick-It" trick system.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, if you're hoping to play&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>offline, you won't be able to do so; EA confirmed back in April that the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-skate-reboot-no-offline-mode" rel="nofollow">won't feature an offline mode</a>, so you'll need an internet connection if you want to check it out.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>launches in Early Access on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3354750/skate/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10006353" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/skate/9PHF9K5Q6ZLZ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a> on September 16th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Another NetEase-Backed Studio Has Closed Without Releasing a Game]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rich-vogel-t-minus-zero-entertainment-netease-shut-down</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/another-netease-backed-studio-has-closed-without-releasing-a-game.1280874/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Another NetEase studio has had its funding pulled without releasing a game, and this time, it's the turn of T-Minus Zero Entertainment and its founder, BioWare and Sony veteran Rich Vogel.</p>

<p>The news was announced by Vogel <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rich-vogel-093425/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">over on LinkedIn</a>, where he says that T-Minus Zero Entertainment's "journey" with NetEase is "coming to an end". Vogel says that he and his studio have been unable to "secure the funding [it needs] at this time" due to "current market conditions".</p>

<p>Although Vogel doesn't technically say that T-Minus Zero is shutting down, he does say later in the post that the studio's "talented team members will continue to explore new opportunities", so even if the studio is only entering hibernation, it sounds like Vogel doesn't expect a windfall anytime soon.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-the-old-republic-rich-vogel-netease.jpg?itok=VIRUv5Ax 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-the-old-republic-rich-vogel-netease.jpg?itok=090kj6Rc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You might know Rich Vogel's name from games like&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: The Old Republic</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Vogel founded T-Minus Zero Entertainment <a href="https://ir.netease.com/news-releases/news-release-details/netease-games-introduces-t-minus-zero-entertainment-new-global" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">back in 2023</a>, at which point he also revealed that his studio was working on an "online multiplayer-focused third-person action title set in a sci-fi universe".</p>

<p>In his LinkedIn post, Vogel says that the project (which is presumably the same one that was revealed at the studio's founding) had a "fully playable hands-on demo", but that this demo was unable to attract funding despite garnering "a lot of interest".</p>

<p>Perhaps Vogel can take some solace in the fact that his is far from the only studio to have NetEase pull the plug on it. Back in November last year, Worlds Untold, the studio founded by&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect</em>'s Mac Walters, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/worlds-untold-netease-pause-shutdown" rel="nofollow">made the decision to "pause operations"</a> amid NetEase pulling its funding.</p>

<p>It's not just studios that didn't manage to release any games, either; the NetEase outfit responsible for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>, which was based largely in Seattle, was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-studio-shockingly-closed-by-netease-laying-off-everyone" rel="nofollow">closed down back in February</a>&nbsp;despite the fact that&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>appears to be a resounding success.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-rivals-netease-rich-vogel.jpg?itok=PYUfhNj9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-rivals-netease-rich-vogel.jpg?itok=mtQx0FdZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Even&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' success couldn't prevent its development team from being shut down.</figcaption></figure><p>It's not clear what Vogel intends to do next, but it looks pretty certain that we've heard the last of T-Minus Zero Entertainment, unfortunately. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things industry-related.</p>
