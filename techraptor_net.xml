As a huge fan of the world of Tolkien&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;a huge fan of trick-taking games, I was ready for a fun beer-and-pretzels style card game. What I got instead from this game, designed by Bryan Bornmueller and published by Office Dog Games (one of Asmodee's in-house creative studios), was even more than I could have hoped for!</p>



<p>In&nbsp;<em>The Fellowship Of The Ring Trick-Taking Game</em>, players dive into the world of&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings </em>as they&nbsp;take on the role of characters from&nbsp;<em>Fellowship</em>, following along with the story through a series of thematic chapters.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Fellowship Trick-Taking Game Stats:</em></p>

<ul><li>1 - 4 Players</li>
	<li>Est. Game Time: 20 min per chapter</li>
	<li>Game Genre: Cooperative Trick-Taking</li>
	<li>Complexity: Low (but ramping up as chapters progress)</li>
</ul></blockquote>

<h2>How Do I Play&nbsp;<em>The Fellowship Of The Ring Trick-Taking Game</em>?</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fellowship-of-the-ring-trick-taking-game-chapter-1-characters-large.jpeg?itok=BA7eVRUZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fellowship-of-the-ring-trick-taking-game-chapter-1-characters-large.jpeg?itok=rG_DH4nJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The first chapter of the game sees players taking on the role of Frodo, Bilbo, Gandalf, and Pippin!</figcaption></figure><p>To play the game, your table will begin by taking the relevant chapter card, and any associated character cards, and setting them out. Most chapters will include additional cards and have special, specific requirements needed for either setup, or to win the chapter. From there, the core gameplay revolves around this being a cooperative trick-taking game.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with trick-taking games, or just not used to hearing the terms, think classic playing card parlor games like Hearts or Bridge. Each player will have a hand of cards dealt randomly to them, and each card will have a suit (Hill, Mountain, Forest, Shadow, and Ring) and a value (from 1 - 8 for everything except Ring cards, which are 1 - 5).</p>

<p>Each chapter, the player controlling Frodo as the ring-bearer will lead the trick by playing a card from their hand. From there, each player in clockwise order has to play a card in that same suit if they can. If they don't have the matching suit, then they can play any other card. There's more to it than that, but I'll play the role of Gandalf here and spare you the crucial details. Essentially, your goal as a group, because this is co-op, is to complete the goals of each character, and any special requirements from the game itself.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fellowship-of-the-ring-trick-taking-game-trick-example-large.jpeg?itok=C1roLKG8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fellowship-of-the-ring-trick-taking-game-trick-example-large.jpeg?itok=kG4r4nHv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Here's an example of a common first trick. Here, Frodo lead with the 5 of Forests, everyone else at the table has to also play a forest. Gandalf, with the 7 of Forests, wins this trick!</figcaption></figure><p>This isn't as easy as it sounds, as each character wants different things! Frodo, for instance, wins by having in his score pile a set amount of Ring cards based on player count. Sam wants to have in his pile of cards he's won a very specific numbered Hill card (because he's always thinking of home). Pippin, always the trouble-maker, wants to win the fewest tricks out of anyone in the chapter. And so on and so on...</p>

<p>As you complete a chapter, you'll move onto the next chapter, which may have you saying goodbye to certain cards (Fatty Bolger's only around for a moment, as is Tom Bombadil) and could introduce new characters. And that's at the center of what's so special about this game.</p>

<h2>Reaching Storytelling Heights</h2>

<p>As I mentioned above, the way that gameplay mechanics mirror and mimic the core of the story is so inventive, it's clear that designer Bornmueller isn't just a huge fan of&nbsp;<em>LOTR</em>, but a close-reader of the text as well! Each chapter, you deal out cards randomly to each player, and the player who is given the 1 of Rings&nbsp;<em>has</em>&nbsp;to play as Frodo, mirroring Frodo's inability to escape his destiny as the ring-bearer.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fellowship-of-the-ring-trick-taking-game-frodos-1-ring-large.jpeg?itok=oVqzSCxG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fellowship-of-the-ring-trick-taking-game-frodos-1-ring-large.jpeg?itok=8RPZefKx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Frodo has the One of Rings aka The One Ring, and he has to win with rings to beat a chapter.</figcaption></figure><p>Another great example of this storytelling shining through the gameplay comes in the chapter where the characters meet Tom Bombadil. Not only are all of the Forest suit of cards removed to become a sort of enemy deck (as Old Man Willow attempts to snatch up the hobbits), but Bombadil himself plays with a bunch of extra cards, showing his rule/world-breaking power.</p>

<p>There are dozens upon dozens of other examples like this as you progress through the 18 chapters of the game, but all of this is to say that it's the perfect use of gameplay mechanics as storytelling. If you're super-familiar with the story of&nbsp;<em>Fellowship,&nbsp;</em>you'll get a real kick out seeing the characters and plot points you love brought to life via game rules.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Growing Difficulty, Growing Dread</h2>

<p>The first few chapters of&nbsp;<em>Fellowship Trick-Taking</em>&nbsp;take it easy on the players. For me and my playgroup, we were even worried that the game might focus so much of great storytelling that the challenge would be too light. But if the difficulty of our heroes' journey increases as&nbsp;<em>Fellowship</em>&nbsp;progresses, so&nbsp;<em>too</em>&nbsp;does the difficulty in this game! And by the time we met up with Old Man Willow, and the barrow wights we were often failing our chapters.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fellowship-of-the-ring-trick-taking-game-initial-characters-large.jpeg?itok=a8rB-hbU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fellowship-of-the-ring-trick-taking-game-initial-characters-large.jpeg?itok=AuRIVWLw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Look at our boys!</figcaption></figure><p>But the beauty of this game is that failing a chapter isn't that big of a deal at all, you simply re-set up the chapter, re-shuffle and deal out the cards, and try again! And when I'm finally able to best a particularly tricky chapter, well that feels better than a float down the Anduin.</p>

<h2>Incredible Components</h2>

<p>Finally, I think it's particularly worth mentioning the quality of the components in the game. The tokens (used to designate when its okay to lead with Ring Cards, and show which characters have completed their objectives) are gorgeously decorated wood, the box itself holds the game in three distinct parts, and comes with three ribbons that are a super-effective way of "saving your progress," and the artwork is stunning! Designed to look sort of like Stained Glass, each card's artwork is rendered in bright, beautiful colors.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fellowship-of-the-ring-trick-taking-game-card-artwork-large.jpeg?itok=_urlaiKn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fellowship-of-the-ring-trick-taking-game-card-artwork-large.jpeg?itok=wHEeu2lW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This is the kind of artwork, stylized and with a lot of personality, that we don't always get to see from tabletop games these days!</figcaption></figure><h2><em>The Fellowship Of The Ring Trick-Taking Game - Final Thoughts</em></h2>

<p>This is, by far, one of the best experiences I've had playing a trick-taking game. And to really make a big, bold statement, I think this might be one of the best experiences I've had playing a&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings</em>&nbsp;game! And I'm a huge fan of the Fantasy Flight card game, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/lord-of-rings-roleplaying-first-impressions" rel="nofollow"><em>Lord of the Rings</em>&nbsp;RPG</a>, and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/lord-of-rings-battle-of-edoras-review-horses-and-pitchforks" rel="nofollow">Games Workshop-produced <i>Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game</i></a>.</p>

<p>If you're a die-hard fan of&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings</em>, you should already be playing this game! If you're a die-hard fan of trick-taking games, this may be as close to perfect as we've yet seen. Either way, other than a quick uptick in difficulty that may catch some players off-guard, this is just about as close to perfect as they come.</p>

<p>Fly, you fools, and grab a copy of this! It's only <a href="https://store.asmodee.com/products/the-fellowship-of-the-ring-trick-taking-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">MSRP'ed at $25 from the Asmodee website</a>, and you'll get many, many hours of enjoyment and a fun challenge out of this one.</p>

<p>In this article, we're going to look at 5 different expansions for <em>Zombicie White Death</em>. If this is the first time you're hearing about <em>Zombicide</em> or <em>White Death</em>, check out our review <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/zombicide-white-death-review-incessant-march-continues" rel="nofollow">here</a>, or our coverage of the other game entires below. We've been fans of CMON's <em>Zombicide</em> franchise for a while, and along with the first <em>Zombicide</em> fantasy game <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/zombicide-black-plague-review-old-school-zombie-slaying" rel="nofollow">Black Plague</a>, we've also covered the modern <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/zombicide-2nd-edition-board-game-review" rel="nofollow">2nd Edition</a> and the awesomely thematic movie tie-in, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/night-of-living-dead-zombicide-game-review" rel="nofollow">Night of the Living Dead</a> version.</p>

<p>Divine Beasts is an abomination expansion pack for<em> Zombicide White Death, </em>and it can also be used with<em> Black Plague </em>and<em> Green Horde. </em>It adds a divine beasts card to the zombie deck, and when drawn, starts off a chain of divine beasts spawns. The first beast to appear is the Vermillion Bird and it will activate for 3 turns, and if not eliminated, it disappears and the next beast spawns next turn until all 4 have appeared.</p>

<p>Each of the 4 beasts has 3 action cards for each turn they're in the game, along with unique rules to eliminate them. The Vermillion Bird for example needs to be hit with a single ranged attack. They each also have a unique effect, like the Black Tortoise which makes nearby zombies need 2 damage to be removed. Eliminating the beasts before they disappear earns the survivors a permanent skill.</p>

Rather than just having to load up damage on an abomination, the players are pushed to position and bring the right weapons to bear in time and it fits in really thematically to the game.</p>

<p>The Crossfire Pack is an expansion pack for<em> Zombicide White Death, </em>and it can also be used with<em> Black Plague </em>and<em> Green Horde.&nbsp;</em>It includes some crossbow-armed guards and zombies. The guards give the player activating them a Delayed Ranged Action card, which can be discarded any time during the zombies phase to perform a ranged attack on a zone. The Deadbolt Walkers add a new challenge for survivors, and when they activate, they target a zone with the most survivors up to 3 zones away.</p>

<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zombicide-white-death-expansions-6.jpg?itok=orBc2yvB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zombicide-white-death-expansions-6.jpg?itok=2CEv06Ba 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Zombicide White Death Climbers And Terrorcotta Walkers</h2>

<p>Climbers and Terrorcotta Walkers is an expansion pack for<em> Zombicide </em>fantasy series, including<em> White Death,</em><em>&nbsp;Black Plague,&nbsp;</em>and<em> Green Horde. </em>This expansion features 2 new types of Zombies. The climbers can ignore ramparts, barriers, and ledges when moving, and can be a real menace when trying to defend against. The Terrorcotta Walkers are fantastically thematic and offer a great new challenge. At the start of each zombie phase, if there are 1 to 4 Terrorcotta Warriors in a zone, more spawn around them until there are 5. This means that you need to take out all 5 in a turn, otherwise, they'll keep coming back, and if you separate them, they'll start spawning multiple sets of 5.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zombicide-white-death-expansions-7.jpg?itok=asgI099N 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zombicide-white-death-expansions-7.jpg?itok=X2fj96Y- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Zombicide </em>Climbers and Terrorcotta Walkers expansion adds 2 new challenging zombie types to your games.</figcaption></figure><p>This is a great enemy expansion for the <em>Zombicide</em> fantasy games. The Terrorcotta Walkers offer a unique and entertaining challenge, and the climbers add a new element to your games. While not as good as the Divine Beasts expansion, it adds some interesting depth.</p>

<p>The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles<i> Zombiecide Timecrash </i>expansion contains a load of new content and can be used with <em>White Death</em>, <em>Black Plague,</em> or <em>Green Horde</em>. In total, it contains 7 new heroes and their unique equipment, a new enemy type and a new necromancer, 10 new quests, and some new rules.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'll be honest, this is why I'm here. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Timecrash and <em>White Death</em> is my thing, and it doesn't disappoint. Each Turtle feels thematically perfect (as does Splinter, April, and Casey) and each comes with their own unique equipment card, which can be upgraded by taking an ultimate token (a pizza slice, for which there are 6 that sit as a whole pizza when not in use).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Enemy-wise, the Foot Soldiers spawn on objectives to make them more difficult to take, and Shredder, a unique Necromancer, deals damage when survivors miss their attacks against him. These all combine in the 10 new quests, which use the included new map tiles and creates an enjoyable zombie-filled ninja romp through the snow.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zombicide-white-death-expansions-9.jpg?itok=UIxClAgU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zombicide-white-death-expansions-9.jpg?itok=r6Vx3Cin 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Zombicide</em> Timecrash Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles miniaturs are fantastic. Now who is the best turtle and why is it Raphael?</figcaption></figure><p>The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Timecrash expansion is fantastic. Incredibly thematic throughout with a load of content that works great in all <em>Zombicide</em> fantasy games. The fantasy design for all the miniatures works very well and it's obvious that some work has gone into capturing the theme in all aspects of this expansion.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zombicide-white-death-expansions-10.jpg?itok=dkUmyqjg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zombicide-white-death-expansions-10.jpg?itok=t4mFsrYs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Zombicide White Death Eternal Empire</h2>

<p><i>Zombicide Eternal Empire </i>is a fantasy expansion for<i> Zombicide. </i>It contains the most content out of all the expansions we've looked at here, including 6 new survivors, chi rules, and upgraded survivor cards for the <em>White Death</em> survivors (and rules for <em>Black Plague</em> and <em>Green Horde</em> survivors as well). It also includes a new action, meditation, which boosts Chi, and Chi Statues (that come in 2 halves to show when they've been broken by the zombies), and full replacement equipment decks that use the chi rules.</p>

<p>2 new zombie types are also included that play into the Chi theme. Warden Brutes, which make it so zombies can only be eliminated with chi attacks, and the God-Eater Abomination, who go straight for the Chi Statues and sap the chi from the survivors.&nbsp; Eternal Empire also adds new map tiles with ice zones that survivors can't attack in (zombies still can though), 10 new quests, and a campaign sheet and rules for linking your <em>Zombicide</em> games together.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zombicide-white-death-expansions-11.jpg?itok=tTKoGTjs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zombicide-white-death-expansions-11.jpg?itok=FcYWvTbH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Zombicide</em> Eternal Empire adds a huge amount of content to your games, and the Chi Statues that break in half are inspired design.</figcaption></figure><p>If it wasn't for how thematically awesome the Turtles expansion is, this would easily be the best of the new <em>Zombicide</em> fantasy expansions. It adds a huge amount of content to your games, even without the new enemies and survivors. The campaign play is fantastic, and the 10 new quests and their objectives are super fun to play through.</p>

<h2>Zombicide White Death Expansions Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>The 5 <em>Zombicide</em> expansions we've looked at here can be divided into 2 types, the Divine Beasts, Crossfire Pack and Climbers and Terrorcotta Walkers simply add new enemies (and guards) to your games. Out of those Divine Beasts adds the most interesting aspect to games, with the Climbers and Terrorcotta Walkers adding a new great dimension and challenge. The Crossfire Pack is decent, but if you're only picking up one, then I'd recommend Diving Beasts.</p>

<p>The other 2 offer a lot more content in their expansions. Timecrash Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Eternal Empire both have a great amount of content. Turtles is my personal favorite, just because it's so thematically brilliant, but Eternal Empire adds huge depth to your games, with new rules and campaign play. Recommending one over the other would depend on what you're after, but if it's just honest <em>Zombicide</em> fun, then Timecrash Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is fantastic.</p>

One day later, that amount increased to over $270,000. To commemorate this milestone, Tolarian Community College announced a series of thank-you gifts would be going out to certain donors.</p>

<p>Those gifts included gaming accessories like playmats and Infinitotokens. But mostly the gifts were sought after <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> cards and decks including the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/secret-lair-x-doctor-who-regeneration-brings-15th-doctor-to-magic-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Doctor Who</em></a> Commander Deck, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/secret-lair-x-dungeons-dragons-50th-anniversary-superdrop-announced-by-wizards-of" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em> Secret Lair</a>, a Zendikar Rising Collector's Box, and a Revised Counterspell card signed by Mark Poole.</p>

In addition, the organization's members are part of the transgender community. Their stated goals include keeping their members' identities anonymous and confidential, providing peer support, and dismantling the institutional bigotry of white supremacy.</p>

<p>The support for Trans Lifeline comes during a volatile time in the United States. Due to several executive orders by President Trump, transgender identity is being erased or actively overwritten. This includes the removal of "transgender" and "queer" altogether from the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-news/references-transgender-queer-removed-stonewall-monuments-webpage-rcna192204" rel="nofollow">Stonewall National Monument's</a> web page.</p>

<p>The Trans Lifeline fundraiser concludes February 15.</p>
