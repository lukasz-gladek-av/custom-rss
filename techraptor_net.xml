<p>In an official press release, Wizards of the Coast showcased both new cards and gameplay features coming in the <em>Final Fantasy</em> <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> crossover.</p>

Each Commander deck will act as adaptations of a specific iconic <em>Final Fantasy</em> games:<em> Final Fantasy VI</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/final-fantasy-vii" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Final Fantasy VII</em></a>, <em>Final Fantasy X</em>, and the <em>Shadowbringers</em> arc of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></a>.</p>

<p>The release will feature over 100 iconic <em>Final Fantasy</em> characters with over 55 in special booster fun versions. These will be showcasing the influential artwork of several artists in the series including Yoshitaka Amano and Tetsuya Nomura. Those characters will feature in Borderless Character Cards, Borderless Woodblock Cards inspired by Japanese woodblock paintings, and Borderless <em>Final Fantasy</em> Artist cards.</p>

They include the prodigal knight Cecil. the existential threat known as Sin, the goofy Cactuar, and the iconic Moogle merchant.</p>

Examples include <em>Yuriko, the Tiger's Shadow</em> as <em>Yuffie Kisaragi</em> and <em>Ancient Copper Dragon</em> as <em>Final Fantasy I's</em> <em>Dragon of Mount Gulg</em>. Both of these cards feature the acclaimed work of Final Fantasy series' artists Yoshitaka Amano and Tetsuya Nomura. The Final Fantasy Through the Ages is a bonus sheet, so will be included in boosters in some form or another that is not yet specified.&nbsp; We have previously seen it in only collector boosters (planeswalkers in collector's boosters for <em>Bloomburrow</em>), multiple types in each play/draft booster (<em>Wilds of Eldraine</em>, and <em>March of the Machine</em>) as examples, and more.</p>

First is the return of Double-Faced Cards. Pay the mana cost on the front to play the card, then flip it when the required conditions are met.</p>

They cost a bit of mana and leave the battlefield after a fixed number of turns, but the investment may be worth it with the right combo.</p>

<p>Lastly, Wizards of the Coast will be releasing three <em>Final Fantasy</em> Secret Lair drops alongside the release of these Commander Decks. As for what those Secret Lairs will include, that remains to be seen.</p>

<p><em>Magic: The Gathering - Final Fantasy</em> will release on June 13, with the pre-release happening a week earlier.</p>

Today, employees of NetEase Games working on <em>Marvel Rivals</em> have shared that they have been laid off, and the Seattle studio is being shut down.</p>

<p>The news broke on LinkedIn as employees began sharing their stories about being laid off. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/thadsasser_this-is-such-a-weird-industry-my-stellar-activity-7297672154060361729-xYIX?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAWFcNgBTnKdYM4ShDjI2C0H2DackkNIFLU" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Thaddeus Sasser LinkedIn">Game Director Thaddeus Sasser wrote</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"This is such a weird industry...</p>

<p>My stellar, talented team just helped deliver an incredibly successful new franchise in Marvel Rivals for NetEase Games...</p>

<p>...and were just laid off!</p>

<p>Oh well! Times are tough all over - Let's find these incredible people new jobs, because we all need to eat, right? :D"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He went on to share a profile of Garry McGee, a level designer who is one of the many people now looking for a job. Another level designer, Jack Burrows <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jack-burrows-b7896399/recent-activity/all/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Jack Burrows LinkedIn">wrote on LinkedIn</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Hey folks!<br>
Welp, just got laid off from my job working on Marvel Rivals with NetEase.</p>

<p>Was an enormous pleasure to work with my American coworkers who join me in this sad culling.<br>
Just couldn't dodge that big boot I guess, no matter how big the success of the gig.</p>

<p>So now I’m seeking a new role and would appreciate your support. If you hear of any opportunities or just want to catch up, please send me a message or comment below. I’d love to reconnect. hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#YaCantWinThemAll"</p>

<p>Released last year, <em>Marvel Rivals</em> has been a huge success as a hot hero shooter that has taken on the behemoth of Blizzard and the <em>Overwatch</em> franchise. It picked up <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-10m" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Marvel Rivals Player Count Reaches 10 Million in &quot;Just 72 Hours&quot;">10m players in its first 72 hours</a>, and it has been going strong since with players flocking to the hero shooter featuring some of their favorite super heroes.</p>



<p>The move comes as Netease has been downsizing a lot of its operations outside of China, and studios it has backed. It has impacted a number of other studios that they previously backed such as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/liquid-swords-layoffs-just-cause-creator" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Just Cause Creator's Studio Liquid Swords Announces Layoffs">Liquid Swords </a>(from the creator of <em>Just Cause</em> ), <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/visions-of-mana-layoffs-netease-report" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Visions of Mana Studio Hit by Huge Layoffs on Release Day Per Report">Ouka Studios</a> (released <em>Visions of Mana</em>), and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/worlds-untold-netease-pause-shutdown" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" BioWare Veteran's NetEase Studio Worlds Untold to &quot;Pause Operations&quot;">Untold Worlds </a>(from Bioware alumni Mac Walters)</p>

<p>This continues a trend over the last few years where we've been seeing massive layoffs. In this case, it seems that even a commercially, massively successful hit isn't enough to stop a company from deciding that they might be able to get people working on it cheaper somewhere else.</p>
