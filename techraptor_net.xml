            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-10m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has announced that&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>sales have hit yet another milestone, cementing the game's legacy as the studio's fastest-selling game and breaking another company record in the process.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e250331.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a> issued earlier today,&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>has passed 10 million sales, a milestone that also sets a first-month sales record for Capcom. The game already broke franchise and company records earlier this month, hitting <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-8m" rel="nofollow">eight million sales in just three days</a>.</p>

<p>As for how&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>achieved this goal, Capcom puts its performance down to the introduction of crossplay for the first time in series history, as well as "the fusion of numerous new elements with&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter</em>'s appeal" creating "significant excitement".</p>

<p><em>Monster Hunter World</em>, meanwhile, took over two months to achieve eight million sales, although again, the game was initially only released for PS4 and Xbox One, with a PC version subsequently launching in August 2018.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>still clearly stands as the series' most successful entry to date, although it's still currently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sitting at a Mixed rating</a> on Steam, thanks in large part to what appear to be ongoing performance issues for many players' PCs.</p>

<p>Hopefully, Capcom will address those performance issues in future updates.&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-1-release-date" rel="nofollow">first Title Update</a> is due to land later this week, and it's bringing a big new monster to fight, plus lots of other goodies.</p>
