            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's not Universes Beyond, no&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering</em>&nbsp;has gone to outerspace, with&nbsp;<em>Edge of Eternities</em>. A science-fantasy type of set with a take on the Space Opera, it's a very different set than what we've seen in the Magic universe before. As a new set, it means there's plenty of new options for players, and here we'll be ranking all the new&nbsp;<em>Edge of Eternities</em>&nbsp;Commander options.</p>

<p>With&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/mtg-edge-of-eternities-preview-cards-revealed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" MTG Edge of Eternities Preview Cards Revealed"><em>Edge of Eternities</em>&nbsp;comes a rule change to Commander</a>: any legendary card with power and toughness in the bottom right corner can be your commander. Practically this means that legendary vehicles from past sets (there are none in this set), and legendary spacecrafts in this set are also commander options, along with legendary creatures.</p>

<p>After going over all of the over <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/ranking-all-of-magic-gathering-final-fantasy-legendary-creatures-part-1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Ranking ALL of Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy Legendary Creatures Part 1">150 Legendary Creatures in&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a>, I'm relieved to say that there are a few less legendary options in&nbsp;<em>Edge of Eternities.&nbsp;</em>There are in fact only 22 cards capable of being your Commander in the set, as the high amount of legendaries in Universes Beyond sets has Wizards of the Coast pulling back some on in-universe sets. Unlike the&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy</em>&nbsp;list, this list is Commander specific, and is not considering other Constructed (like Standard or Modern) or Limited play.</p>

<h3>22. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/225/sami-ships-engineer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Sami, Ship’s Engineer">Sami, Ship’s Engineer</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sami-ship-engineer.jpg?itok=I9jkvhP- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sami-ship-engineer.jpg?itok=OXkPcUkF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Someone has to come last, and it's perhaps no surprise that it's one of the uncommon legendary creatures. Sami in this form is pricey, undersized, and makes modestly sized tokens if you jump a couple of hoops. While Sami synergizes with vehicles and spacecraft, that isn’t near enough for the cost in commander.</p>

<h3>21. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/232/syr-vondam-the-lucent" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Syr Vondam, the Lucent">Syr Vondam, the Lucent</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/syr-vondam-the-lucent.jpg?itok=zmh43CcN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/syr-vondam-the-lucent.jpg?itok=cyBjRjRW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>A&nbsp;5 Mana go wide leader, Syr Vondam is worse in his role than many other commanders who provide pumps for the team. Clearly designed for limited, this iteration of Syr Vondam will have trouble breaking the 99 in general, but if you need to give deathtouch to your creatures in white and black there are worse options.</p>

<h3>20. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/218/haliya-ascendant-cadet" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Haliya, Ascendant Cadet">Haliya, Ascendant Cadet</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/haliya-ascendant-cadet.jpg?itok=eNARFukE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/haliya-ascendant-cadet.jpg?itok=mjaO1-KO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>We continue our stroll through the uncommon legends with Haliya, Ascendant Acolyte. Haliya in this version is clearly aimed at limited play as a 5 mana 3/3 who brings a +1/+1 on enter or attack. Paired with a minor card draw ability, overall this is a card left out of your deck in commander.</p>

<h3>19. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/212/alpharael-dreaming-acolyte" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Alpharael, Dreaming Acolyte">Alpharael, Dreaming Acolyte</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/alpharael-dreaming-acolyte.jpg?itok=b2hVEuOo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/alpharael-dreaming-acolyte.jpg?itok=lTLfQ0Hq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Alpharael, Dreaming Acolyte provides a decent enters&nbsp;card draw, especially for artifact decks, and can load up a graveyard for future turns. The deathtouch on your turn is situationally useful, but Alpharel isn’t that impressive, but in a blinking artifact deck it might have some use.</p>

<h3>18.&nbsp;<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/19/haliya-guided-by-light" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Haliya, Guided by Light">Haliya, Guided by Light</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/haliya-guided-by-light.jpg?itok=2Et0GGD9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/haliya-guided-by-light.jpg?itok=A3SvKqi1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Each of the uncommon legends also has a rare iteration of them later in life, and Haliya is the first of them we're seeing. Haliya is essentially <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ltc/12/the-gaffer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="The Gaffer">The Gaffer</a> + a <a href="https://scryfall.com/search?q=otag%3Asoul-warden-ability+type%3Acreature" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Soul Warden Ability Creatures">Soul Sister </a>in a creature, but somewhat worse than either. The combination is useful, and card draw is important, but I think this is likely to be in the 99, and only after The Gaffer has made a list.</p>

<h3>17.&nbsp;<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/231/syr-vondam-sunstar-exemplar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Syr Vondam, Sunstar Exemplar">Syr Vondam, Sunstar Exemplar<strong> </strong></a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/syr-vondam-sunstar-exemplar.jpg?itok=k5NjuQQX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/syr-vondam-sunstar-exemplar.jpg?itok=V2-JaM7f 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Probably better in the 99 of aristocrat decks then at the helm of his, but this iteration of Syr Vondam is a payoff for killing your own guys and there are some neat things you can do with ‘scam’ type cards and removing opposing permanents.</p>

<h3>16. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/238/dawnsire-sunstar-dreadnought" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Dawnsire, Sunstar Dreadnought">Dawnsire, Sunstar Dreadnought</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dawnsire-sunstar-dreadnought.jpg?itok=v7fO6jR4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dawnsire-sunstar-dreadnought.jpg?itok=V8aJlC8G 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As we reach 16, we get our first legendary Spacecraft, and it's a doozy of a ship. The Dawnsire is undeniably splashy with that potential 20/20 size and 100 damage to creatures, but Its high station count is a challenge. As your Commander, Dawnsire's colorless identity is another major limitation, but in the 99 of a Spacecraft deck it can be a flashy, if pricey top end.</p>

<h3>15. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/233/tannuk-memorial-ensign" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Tannuk, Memorial Ensign">Tannuk, Memorial Ensign</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tannuk-memorial-ensign.jpg?itok=L3nJhVXi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tannuk-memorial-ensign.jpg?itok=oEoyoefS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>A new Landfall commander, Tannuk isn’t going to challenge the higher tier of landfall commanders, even in its own colors but the damage pinging and card draw will make him an acceptable budget option. In many ways, Tannuk is a color shifted and appropriately weakened take on <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fdn/247/tatyova-benthic-druid" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Tatyova, Benthic Druid">Tatyova, Benthic Druid</a>. Also he is the first and only legendary Kavu other than his other version (changeling things excluded).</p>

<h3>14. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/35/the-seriema" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="The Seriema">The Seriema</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-seriema.jpg?itok=lrVRbqFp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-seriema.jpg?itok=fploQVMO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>With a lower mana cost of 3, and a lower station cost of only 7, the Seriema provides value at all stages. At the start it is a legendary creature tutor and points you in a direction for the deck. Once it gets 7 station points, it’s a 5/5 flying that protects all your other legendary creatures when they are tapped and lets them rule in combat. Still, it feels likely to be better in the 99 of other legendary matters commanders, which is why it's up here.</p>

<h3>13. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/127/xu-ifit-osteoharmonist" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Xu-Ifit, Osteoharmonist">Xu-Ifit, Osteoharmonist</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xu-ifit-osteoharmonist.jpg?itok=57R0v8RG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xu-ifit-osteoharmonist.jpg?itok=l17K0IaS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>An odd commander, Xu-ifit wants you to have interesting creatures without abilities or that you can do something else with, as they become skeletons without anything else. This also makes him an interesting leader for a skeleton deck, or a way of taking advantage of creatures with significant downsides.</p>

<h3>12.&nbsp;<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/87/alpharael-stonechosen" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Alpharael, Stonechosen">Alpharael, Stonechosen</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/alpharael-stonechosen.jpg?itok=AinVn1J0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/alpharael-stonechosen.jpg?itok=tfGKWgcq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Alpharael might be a bit undersized, but the ability to chop off half someone’s life on an attack trigger is highly potent, becoming a killer move along with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/2xm/113/wound-reflection" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Wound Reflection ">Wound Reflection </a>and others. Ward isn’t hexproof, but a random discard may discourage people from dealing with Alpharael before they have to.</p>

<h3>11. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoc/4/szarel-genesis-shepherd" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Szarel, Genesis Shepherd">Szarel, Genesis Shepherd</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/szarel-genesis-shepherd.jpg?itok=QVYq4TYR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/szarel-genesis-shepherd.jpg?itok=YlUq9lsg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Our first card from the <em>Edge of Eternities</em>&nbsp;Commander decks is this jund-colored land and aristocrats bug who's in competition with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/c18/43/lord-windgrace" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Lord Windgrace">Lord Windgrace</a> for fighting over jund land decks. The need to buff his power to get the most does make this a three things to do commander, making it busy and it’s not as novel as you have other cards like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoc/117/the-gitrog-monster" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="The Gitrog Monster">The Gitrog Monster</a> that also play around with lands and sacrificing.</p>

<h3>10. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoc/1/hearthhull-the-worldseed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Hearthhull, the Worldseed">Hearthhull, the Worldseed</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hearthhull-the-worldseed.jpg?itok=eYX9JiWv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hearthhull-the-worldseed.jpg?itok=PCgx5Mtb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>We enter the top 10 with the alternate commander for the RGB (jund) deck, which is a spacecraft. Like Szarel, Hearthhull is a jund-colored land aristocrat's commander, but it comes down cheaper, albeit with the need to be stationed before you can do much with it. The ability to sacrifice and payoff the land sacrifice in and of itself make it really good, and I think I slightly prefer the spacecraft over the insect.</p>

<h3>9. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/219/infinite-guideline-station" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Infinite Guideline Station">Infinite Guideline Station</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/infinite-guideline-station.jpg?itok=kTxoyl0s 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/infinite-guideline-station.jpg?itok=3ob20Z_S 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>A five color Spacecraft commander, that also rewards playing a lot of multicolored permanents. Even before you charge it up, the Infinite Guideline Station will provide you with Robots for your gold board, and then it can give you a lot of cards once it starts firing its lasers.</p>

<h3>8.&nbsp;<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/216/dyadrine-synthesis-amalgam" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Dyadrine, Synthesis Amalgam">Dyadrine, Synthesis Amalgam</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dyadrine-synthesis-amalgam.jpg?itok=FsWv4s-E 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dyadrine-synthesis-amalgam.jpg?itok=GOfEpeBb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>An interesting +1/+1 counter commander, Dyadrine takes advantage of any and all mana you have to spend on it, avoiding the issue with X costs. Dyadrine wants a friend with counters as well, so that it can make tokens and draw cards for you, though note it can work from get go, not needing to attack itself.</p>

<h3>7. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/221/mmmenon-uthros-exile" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Mm’menon, Uthros Exile">Mm’menon, Uthros Exile</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mmmenon-uthros-exile.jpg?itok=E1WGDgOm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mmmenon-uthros-exile.jpg?itok=6ZwUvvXK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The final uncommon commander option makes a run deep into the top 10, as this version of Mm’menon is an interesting commander, because you can grow any of your creatures when you have artifacts enter. It notably lacks any of the restrictions we see sometimes on cards like this like ‘once per turn’ or ‘non-token’ which would stop it from being able to go crazy. Instead the Uthros Exile invites all the treasure craziness, all the artifact shenanigans and everything else for even a potential voltron approach.</p>

<h3>6. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoc/2/inspirit-flagship-vessel" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Inspirit, Flagship Vessel">Inspirit, Flagship Vessel</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/inspirit-flagship-vessel.jpg?itok=f1uPXkDi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/inspirit-flagship-vessel.jpg?itok=RiL7uHet 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>A strong commander for Spacecrafts, Inspirit lets you put charge counters on other artifacts or grow creatures so they can station (or attack) better. The 3 mana cost is low, and the single point needed to get the base station level up is very little. Later on, it becomes a 5/5 flying protector for all your other artifacts, putting it in play to lead your fleet to victory.</p>

<h3>5. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/68/mmmenon-the-right-hand" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Mm’menon, the Right Hand">Mm’menon, the Right Hand</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mmmenon-the-right-hand.jpg?itok=Dp1-atDo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mmmenon-the-right-hand.jpg?itok=wVrytzJZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Starting off our top 5, we have a far fairer example of a blue artifact commander than Urza, Lord High Artificer. Mm’menon lets you cast artifacts from the top of your deck, and use artifacts to fuel casting them from the top, or with other cards from spots other than your hand.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>4. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/224/ragost-deft-gastronaut" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Ragost, Deft Gastronaut">Ragost, Deft Gastronaut</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ragost-deft-gastronaut.jpg?itok=rdRXhdM8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ragost-deft-gastronaut.jpg?itok=m8mI0jnF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>A cheap and effective food commander in different colors then we often see food running in (red food decks aren’t common!) Its ability to lob food at opponents, while untapping each turn if you gained life gives it a fair amount of strength. It can fuel off any artifacts you have, letting you make them in many ways and take advantage of various death triggers and other neat tricks in his spicy restaurant.</p>

<h3>3. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/296/tannuk-steadfast-second" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Tannuk, Steadfast Second">Tannuk, Steadfast Second</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tannuk-steadfast-second.jpg?itok=mBvUcsGx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tannuk-steadfast-second.jpg?itok=rol6g0Eu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As the only character to ever be a legendary Kavu, Tannuk had some pressure to carry, and while his earlier rated uncommon form is serviceable, the Steadfast Second is a very strong card. Granting everything haste is something red already wants to do, and is often willing to pay 3 mana to do that and nothing else, while the Warp ability for any red and artifact cards is just begging for abuse as cost cheating is very powerful.</p>

<h3>2. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoc/3/kilo-apogee-mind" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Kilo, Apogee Mind">Kilo, Apogee Mind</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kilo-apogee-mind.jpg?itok=eV3rrjIM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kilo-apogee-mind.jpg?itok=XOK_Ws_c 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This kilogram pound robot (that’s why it’s Kilo right?) can do all sorts of crazy things, and while the easiest way to tap is attacking, there are plenty of other ways to do so, and many, many, many payoffs to proliferate that it opens up to be abused and played with. Blue is also the color of untapping, and letting you do this more than once a turn.</p>

<h3>1. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/301/sami-wildcat-captain" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Sami, Wildcat Captain">Sami, Wildcat Captain </a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sami-wildcat-captain.jpg?itok=pJiH1Med 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sami-wildcat-captain.jpg?itok=A5ylnjXC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>I never expected for this list to go full circle, but here we are at number 1, and we're in a way just back where we started with Sami. While Sami's uncommon card was highly unimpressive for commander play, the mythic rare version backs quite a wallop. While the body is a touch undersized, the double strike makes up for that, but it's really the ability after that which is most interesting. Granting all your spells affinity for artifacts is something that is highly breakable, and something with which many an interesting, or distinct thing can be done with across a variety of power levels.</p>

<p>And that's how I saw the&nbsp;<em>Edge of Eternities&nbsp;</em>Commander options. Some of them have me quite interested to build around or try out different decks, including seeing how spacecrafts play in reality.</p>

<p>Are there any <em>Edge of Eternities&nbsp;</em>commanders that interest you particularly or disagree with a placement on this list? Tell us in the comments below!</p>

Ravening hordes of inhuman creatures biding their time, plotting the downfall of every ordered kingdom, salivating in anticipation of the bountiful slaughter soon to come.&nbsp;In this dark and bloody age, bold deeds and great courage are called for.</p>

<p>You have chosen to take up a hopeless fight, to stand when the coward would flee and the wise would kneel. You must oppose the swelling tide of strife and war, of flame and fury, or be smothered by it. Let others wallow in their false peace, let them hate you trying to drag them from it. For if you are skilled and lucky, if you choose worthy allies, take up stalwart arms or master perilous magics, you may even live to see your grim work done. Welcome to <em>The Old World RPG</em>, and your journey starts with the&nbsp;<a href="https://cubicle7games.com/warhammer-the-old-world?utm_campaign=Reviewer+&amp;utm_content=+&amp;utm_id=The+Old+World&amp;utm_medium=Reviewer+&amp;utm_source=Reviewers+" rel="nofollow"><em>Warhammer The Old World RPG</em> Player's Guide</a>.</p>

<p>This is the first release planned for the <em>Warhammer The Old World RPG</em>, but we have covered several of Cubicle 7's other <em>Warhammer</em> RPGs in the past, including the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-fantasy-roleplay-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow">Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay Starter Set</a>, and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/age-of-sigmar-soulbound-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow">Warhammer Age of Sigmar Soulbound Starter Set</a>.</p>




<h2>The Older World</h2>

<p>For those new to the setting, it's worth noting the differences between the various Cubicle 7 fantasy <em>Warhammer</em> RPGs, for which there are now 3. <em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar Soulbound</em>&nbsp;is set in the latest edition of <em>Warhammer, Age of Sigmar, </em>or<em> AoS </em>for short, the current setting of Games Workshop's fantasy wargame. Here things are slightly different from the original <em>Warhammer</em>, and the narrative has moved on, and some race names have changed (along with some new races added, and some races removed).</p>

<p><em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay</em>, <em>WFRP</em> for short, is set in the original <em>Warhammer</em> fantasy setting, which no longer has an active wargame supported by Games Workshop. <em>The Old World</em>&nbsp;is set 300 years before the original <em>Warhammer Fantasy</em> setting, prior to the rise to power of some races. This makes it a prequel setting for <em>Warhammer</em>, like the <em>Horus Heresy</em> is to <em>Warhammer 40,000</em>. Both the <em>Horus Heresy</em> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-old-world-review-hit-refresh" rel="nofollow">The Old World</a> have wargames currently produced by Games Workshop, and Cubicle 7 has announced an upcoming RPG set in the <em>Horus Heresy</em>.</p>

<p>The <em>Warhammer The Old World RPG</em> Player's Guide provides players with the background for life in the Old World, with a focus on the Empire, and in particular, Talabecland, and within it, the town of Talagaad, which is the core setting for the initial <em>Old World</em> products. It details the other provinces of the empire, and the lands beyond, as well as a large section on religion and magic, but the core focus is character creation and the rules, and if it's going to be anything like <em>Soulbound</em> or <em>WFRP,</em> there will be plenty of supplements detailing the various areas of the Old World.</p>

<p><em>Warhammer The Old World RPG</em> uses a D10 system, which is entirely different from the D6 system that <em>Soulbound </em>and<em> Wrath and Glory</em> use, or the D100 percentile system that <em>Imperium Maledictum </em>and<em> WFRP</em> use. In<em> The Old World RPG,&nbsp;</em>players&nbsp;roll a number of 10-sided dice (D10) equal to their characteristic, like weapon skill, reason, strength, etc. Each score that rolls under their skill number is a success. So if you had a melee skill of 5 and a weapon skill characteristic of 3, you would roll 3 dice, and each score of 5 or less would be a success.</p>

<p>What I like most about the system is that there's a load of Lore skills that your character can take, and each can provide bonuses to tests if the lore can be leveraged. This can be as simple as knowledge of a city when making an athletics or a stealth test. You can use your knowledge of the city to your advantage when trying to outrun or sneak up on an opponent. Some skills are also dependent on lore. The use of blackpowder weapons is one example, where you need the lore skill to use the physical skill.</p>

<p>Tests are modified by adding or removing dice. If a fellow player uses their action to help you, for each success on their roll, you get an additional dice, or if you're firing a bow at someone who's in cover, you'll lose dice from your roll. Tests can also be grim or glorious, depending on whether the dark gods are working against you or if the odds are substantially in your favor. For glorious rolls, you can reroll all your failed rolls in your test, and if the test is grim, you have to reroll all of your successes.</p>

<p><i>The Old World RPG </i>character creation has a lot of options for variety in the player's guide. You can play 1 of 6 races, a human, from either the Empire or Bretonnia, a dwarf, a halfling, or a Wood or High Elf. There are then 30 careers to choose from, some of which are locked to races. Only Wood Elves can be Waywatchers, only Empire Humans can be Priests, and only Dwarves can be Brewguards, for example.</p>

<p>You can then add further detail to your character with 59 available talents. Some of these have prerequisites, like race, characteristics, or other talents. These are initially gained during character creation by rolling on a table associated with your chosen race, but they can also be bought with experience points at the final stages of character creation or during play.</p>

<p>Status also plays a huge part in the game, and each class has a tier associated with it, Brass, Silver, or Gold. This tier details your starting equipment options and assets, how much money you have to spend during game sessions, and also how other characters will interact with you. Brass NPCs may respect or fear a Gold character, but they will struggle to blend in, just as Brass characters will find Gold settings awkward.</p>

<p>Your life beyond the adventure is also featured in games, and every few sessions, players take part in endeavors, such as learning skills and spells, resting, or wandering the wilds. If you test a skill during an endeavor, each failed roll is marked on your character sheet, and when those marks are higher than your skill, your skill goes up and the marks are removed. Experience points are also gained during play, and these can be used to gain talents or increase skills, but I like the endeavor system for grounding characters and showing what their lives are like between their glorious adventures.</p>

<p>The <em>Old World RPG</em> Player's Guide is entirely aimed at the players of the game. To play the game, you will also need a Gamemaster, who will run the game, and they need the Gamemaster's Guide, which details how sessions work and provides a whole host of details on the setting and rules, and stats for NPC adversaries and monsters.</p>

<p>A big part of creating a group of characters is how they are all connected, and a Grim Portent session shows how they are and what they are facing. It's mentioned in the Player's Guide, but the Gamemaster's Guide shows how to run this session and how to tie it in to your campaign.</p>

<p>Cubicle 7 has a whole host of releases planned for the initial wave of <a href="https://cubicle7games.com/warhammer-the-old-world?utm_campaign=Reviewer+&amp;utm_content=+&amp;utm_id=The+Old+World&amp;utm_medium=Reviewer+&amp;utm_source=Reviewers+" rel="nofollow">Warhammer The Old World RPG</a> physical products. Anyone purchasing the Player's Guide now will get access to the PDF, and those purchasing the Gamemaster's Guide will get a digital copy later this month. Other physical products planned for a Q1 2026 release include character sheets, maps of the Grand Duchy of Talabec, where the initial releases are planned, and several reference card packs to save you looking through the rulebooks mid-action in-game. There are also several bundles available, including a Collector's Edition for those who want to go all in.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Critical Role has announced an official videogame partnership. The multimedia company has announced it will be collaborating with AdHoc Studio on several upcoming videogame projects. One of them is an official Critical Role videogame.</p>

<h2>The AdHoc Studio Critical Role Videogame Announcement</h2>

<p>In an official press release, Critical Role's CEO Travis Willingham discussed the reasoning behind their collaboration with AdHoc Studio. According to Willingham, he was auditioning for a role in the studio's upcoming narrative-driven superhero workplace drama game, <em>Dispatch.&nbsp;</em>Afterwards, more in-depth talks happened, resulting in a partnership which includes official Critical Role videogame development.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dispatch-game-dialogue-screenshot.jpg?itok=8hZ74aQ7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dispatch-game-dialogue-screenshot.jpg?itok=zeL7O1ub 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><blockquote>
<p>"Just from looking over the audition and game materials, I knew there was something special about what AdHoc was creating and I immediately reached out,” said Willingham. “The design, tone, style and storytelling of DISPATCH jumped off the page, and I knew given the pedigree of the folks at AdHoc, this was a team we wanted to collaborate with. Critical Role is always looking to build with people who are innovating around new ways to deliver story, character and worldbuilding, and AdHoc fits that perfectly.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As part of this partnership, Critical Role will collaborate with AdHoc on future Dispatch brand development. This will include merchandise, tabletop gaming, and more. In addition, both AdHoc and Critical Role will help co-develop the first videogame set in Critical Role's fantasy setting of Exandria, showcasing AdHoc's design strengths in deep, player choice-driven storytelling.</p>

<p>AdHoc's pedigree in videogame narrative cannot be understated. The studio was founded by several veterans of Telltale Games, the studio responsible for their critically-acclaimed videogame adaptations of <em>The Walking Dead</em> and <em>The Wolf Among Us</em> set in the <em>Fables</em> universe.</p>

<p>Considering the voice cast of Dispatch includes two other key members of Critical Role, Matt Mercer and Laura Bailey, there is clear vested interest in AdHoc from a creative and design perspective.</p>

<p>A Critical Role videogame has been something the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-confirms-video-game-is-coming" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">has wanted to do</a> for a while. Given breadth of the world of Exandria, told throughout <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-concludes-campaign-3-with-epic-8-hour-finale-new-godly-exu-announced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">three major campaigns</a> and several spin-offs spanning ten years, there is plenty of material to pull from.</p>
