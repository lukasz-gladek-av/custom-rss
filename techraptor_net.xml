            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>3D Realms has announced the release date for its upcoming&nbsp;<em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>reboot, and if you've been waiting for the chance to try this one out, you'll be able to do so later this year.</p>

<p>First <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/painkiller-revival-fall-2025" rel="nofollow">announced back in March</a>, the&nbsp;<em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>reboot, which is developed by Anshar Studios, will be arriving across PC and consoles on October 9th. No mention of a Switch or Switch 2 version of the game has been made.</p>

<p>Since the release date has been announced, pre-orders for&nbsp;<em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>are now also open, and if you pre-order the game, you'll get yourself a set of Iron Crusade character and weapon skins into the bargain.</p>

<p>The game was developed by People Can Fly, the studio that's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gears-of-war-e-day-people-can-fly" rel="nofollow">currently helping out The Coalition</a> with development on the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Gears of War: E-Day&nbsp;</em>(and, sadly, also the studio that recently had to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/people-can-fly-layoffs-projects-canceled" rel="nofollow">cancel two projects and lay off staff</a>).</p>

<p>Unlike the original&nbsp;<em>Painkiller</em>, the new version will revolve around co-op play, and it'll contain hero shooter elements as well; you'll play as one of four characters, each of whom has their own unique perks with which to slay demons.</p>

<p>Make no mistake, though; this version of&nbsp;<em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>is still all about killing hordes of rampaging monsters, and it looks like the outlandish weapons and over-the-top feel of the original&nbsp;<em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>have made it across to the reboot intact.</p>




<p><em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>arguably shares some challenges with Bungie's upcoming&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>, another shooter that's turned a beloved single-player classic into a multiplayer-focused title. Last week, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shocking-no-one-bungies-marathon-delayed" rel="nofollow">Bungie delayed&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em></a>, citing a need for extra development time to make the game shine.</p>

<p>Whether or not that happens to&nbsp;<em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>remains to be seen, but for now, the game is set to launch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2300120/Painkiller/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10013491" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/painkiller/9NMSW622HWNH" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on October 10th.</p>
