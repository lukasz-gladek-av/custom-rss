            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trade-tokens<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has announced that it's gifting free Trade Tokens to all&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>players by way of an apology for the way in which the game's trading feature launched last week.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1887035219351368102" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, the company says it's giving 1,000 Trade Tokens to every player via the game's Gifts menu as it "continue[s] investigating ways to improve the [trading] feature", commending players' "patience".</p>

<p>Just in case you need a reminder, the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>trading feature <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-update-new-expansion-release-date" rel="nofollow">launched on January 29th</a>, quickly attracting ire from players for what they see as overly strict restrictions on the ways in which they can trade cards with others.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-free-trade-tokens-leafeon-honchkrow-cards.jpg?itok=mprEzzaq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-free-trade-tokens-leafeon-honchkrow-cards.jpg?itok=neip40CR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>players are being gifted Trade Tokens thanks to the trading feature's poor reception.</figcaption></figure><p>Common <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon/518217/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-changes" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">criticisms</a> include poor conversion rates for Trade Tokens, as well as complaints about which cards can be traded. It's currently not possible to trade any card beyond a one-star rarity level, for instance, and only cards from the Genetic Apex and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mythical-island-expansion" rel="nofollow">Mythical Island</a> sets can currently be traded.</p>

<p>Criticism of the trading feature became so fierce that the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>devs <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1885447974094070090" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">responded</a> to it on X a few days ago, acknowledging that while trading restrictions were put in place to "prevent abuse from bots and other prohibited actions", they were "preventing players from being able to casually enjoy the feature".</p>

<p>As such, the devs are "actively investigating ways to improve the feature", and multiple ways to get Trade Tokens will also be offered in future, "including through event distributions".</p>




<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>is, it's essentially a mobile app version of the popular&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG&nbsp;</em>card game, albeit one that's been significantly streamlined and simplified compared to its tabletop counterpart.</p>

<p>The game allows you to collect, trade, and battle Pokemon cards, some of which are exclusive to the app. New sets are due to be added over time, too; just a day after the trading update, the game's latest set, Space-Time Smackdown, was released.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.pokemon.pokemontcgp&amp;hl=en_GB" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pok%C3%A9mon-tcg-pocket/id6479970832" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">iOS</a> devices.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-has-already-surpassed-a-million-sales.1100913/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-1m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Warhorse Studios has announced that&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>sales have already topped a major milestone, even though the game has only been available for a day.</p>

<p>The Czech developer's latest action RPG <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-moved-forward" rel="nofollow">launched yesterday</a> across PC and consoles, but it's already managed to hit a million sales, according to a <a href="https://x.com/WarhorseStudios/status/1887155255130866099" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the official Warhorse X account.</p>

<p>In the post, Warhorse thanks&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>players for "stepp[ing] into our world" and says it's "beyond grateful" for the support it's received so far, calling its game a "triumph". With sales numbers like that, it's hard to disagree.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-1m-artwork.jpg?itok=rmcvlmQ3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-1m-artwork.jpg?itok=-nUN7D57 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>has already sold a million copies.</figcaption></figure><p>The popularity of&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>probably shouldn't come as much of a surprise; Warhorse has clearly put a lot of effort into the game, especially if the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-script-words" rel="nofollow">sheer size and density of its script</a> is anything to go by.</p>

<p>Despite its impressive sales figures, <i>Deliverance 2&nbsp;</i>hasn't been without its fair share of controversy. Prior to release, the game was subject to rumors that it would be banned in Saudi Arabia due to "unskippable" gay romance scenes, claims that game director&nbsp;Daniel Vávra <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-rumors-director" rel="nofollow">shot down in no uncertain terms</a>.</p>

<p>Nevertheless,&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>has attracted a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1771300/Kingdom_Come_Deliverance_II/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Very Positive rating</a> on Steam so far across 5,660 reviews (at time of writing), with players praising the game's presentation, narrative, and improvements over its predecessor.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>is, it's the sequel to 2018's medieval action RPG&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em>. Like its predecessor, the game is an open-ended RPG set in 15th-century Bohemia.</p>




<p>You'll once again play as blacksmith's son Henry of Skalitz, navigating a (relatively) historically accurate world of political intrigue. Since&nbsp;<em>Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>emphasizes realism and historical detail, don't expect to see any dragons or goblins around Bohemia.</p>

<p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1771300/Kingdom_Come_Deliverance_II/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/9n4w31hsmvvd" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.
