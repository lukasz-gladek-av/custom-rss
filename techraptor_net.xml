            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/io-interactive-007-first-light<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>IO Interactive has finally revealed its upcoming&nbsp;<em>James Bond&nbsp;</em>game, which will officially be titled&nbsp;<em>007 First Light</em>,&nbsp;and more information is coming later this week.</p>

<p>The game's name and artwork were revealed in a <a href="https://x.com/007GameIOI/status/1929553749963350144" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post on X</a> earlier today, and although there's not much to go on, it's nice to know that IO is still working on the game, given how long it's been since the initial announcement.</p>

<p><em>First Light&nbsp;</em>will be an origin story for Bond, detailing how he earned his 007 designation. In case you need a reminder, in the world of Bond, the 007 classification grants whichever agent carries it a license to kill in the field.</p>

<p>We don't yet know where&nbsp;<em>First Light&nbsp;</em>will be set, nor do we know much about the gameplay, although given that it's IO Interactive on development duties, we can assume it'll at least be a little similar to the&nbsp;<em>Hitman&nbsp;</em>games.</p>

<p>It's been quite some time since&nbsp;<em>007 First Light&nbsp;</em>was first teased. We first got wind of IO's intent to make a&nbsp;<em>James Bond&nbsp;</em>game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/developers-of-hitman-franchise-are-making-james-bond-game" rel="nofollow">all the way back in late 2020</a>, and with not much info coming between then and now, you'd have been forgiven for thinking the game had been quietly canned.</p>

<p>That is, until July 2023, when IO <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/io-interactive-new-studio" rel="nofollow">opened up a new studio in the UK</a>. At that point, it was also confirmed that&nbsp;<em>Project 007</em>, as it was then known, was still in development, along with something known as&nbsp;<em>Project Fantasy</em>&nbsp;(which still hasn't officially been revealed).</p>

In October last year, it was revealed that the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/io-interactive-publishing-ex-rockstar-thriller" rel="nofollow">would be publishing&nbsp;<em>MindsEye</em></a>, the upcoming action-adventure game from ex-Rockstar head Leslie Benzies.</p>

<p>More info on&nbsp;<em>007 First Light&nbsp;</em>is coming later this week, so stay tuned for that as soon as we get it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/giant-skull-wizards-of-the-coast-dungeons-and-dragons<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has announced that it will publish a&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;</em>game currently in the works at&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor&nbsp;</em>director Stig Asmussen's studio Giant Skull.</p>

<p>Per a VentureBeat <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/wizards-of-the-coast-signs-publishing-agreement-with-giant-skull/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, the game is a "single-player action-adventure game with an immersive story set in the&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;</em>universe". Asmussen and Giant Skull haven't revealed more details about the project yet.</p>

<p>In a statement to VentureBeat, Asmussen says the goal with the studio's&nbsp;<em>D&amp;D&nbsp;</em>game is to "craft a rich new&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;</em>universe filled with immersive storytelling, heroic combat, and exhilarating traversal that players will fully embrace".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-jedi-survivor-giant-skull-wizards-of-the-coast.jpg?itok=msBqu285 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-jedi-survivor-giant-skull-wizards-of-the-coast.jpg?itok=uYnA61gM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Stig Asmussen's previous works include&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>For his part, Wizards of the Coast president John Hight says Giant Skull is full of "exceptionally talented creators", and that the collaboration between the two companies represents a new development in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hasbro-unveils-new-playing-to-win-strategy-expanding-their-reach-to-more-players" rel="nofollow">"Playing to Win strategy"</a>.</p>

<p>The description of the&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;</em>game in the works at Giant Skull isn't particularly specific, but it does rather sound like Asmussen's M.O.; he's previously served as the director on games like&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;God of War III</i>.</p>

<p>Asmussen first announced the founding of Giant Skull <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stig-asmussen-giant-skull-star-wars-jedi" rel="nofollow">in March last year</a>, following his departure from Respawn and its parent company EA in late 2023. At the time of Giant Skull's founding, Asmussen said his philosophy was simple: the world "need[s] video games, and [it needs] people to make them".</p>

<p>At the time, Giant Skull simply said that development on its first project was underway, but now, it looks like we know what that project is going to be (unless there's a second game in development at Giant Skull, which is perhaps unlikely).</p>

There's also a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gameloft-dungeons-dragons-game" rel="nofollow">life sim-survival hybrid</a> in the works at&nbsp;<em>Disney Dreamlight Valley&nbsp;</em>studio Gameloft, as well as a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-dnd-game-2026" rel="nofollow">live-service multiplayer game</a> from&nbsp;<em>Payday&nbsp;</em>developer Starbreeze.</p>

<p>If you want solo thrills, though, it sounds like Giant Skull's game will be your jam. Stay tuned for more info on this one as and when we get it.</p>
