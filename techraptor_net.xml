            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sales analysis firm Circana has released its US gaming industry sales data for June, and it looks like FromSoftware and Bandai Namco can continue their celebrations from last month.</p>

<p>In May, multiplayer spinoff experiment&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/may-gaming-sales-data-elden-ring-nightreign" rel="nofollow">topped the charts</a>, and despite the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">release of the Nintendo Switch 2 in June</a>, it hit the number one spot on the all-format chart for last month as well, according to the ever-reliable <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lun37lnhg22k" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Mat Piscatella</a>.</p>

<p>The Switch 2's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">flagship launch title&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">Mario Kart World</a>&nbsp;</em>didn't manage to scrape second place, either; that honor went to&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em>, a particularly impressive achievement given that Hideo Kojima's latest is only available on PS5.&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart&nbsp;</em>did come in third, though.</p>

<p>Second place still goes to <i>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</i>, and&nbsp;Ubisoft's&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>brings up third, which may come as something of a balm to the studio following its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-creative-houses-q1-financials" rel="nofollow">disappointing Q1 financial results</a>.</p>

<p>In hardware terms, June 2025 set a new record for hardware spending by Circana's reckoning, beating out previous record-holder 2008. Spending hit $978m in June, bolstered by the release of the Switch 2.</p>

<p>The console managed to sell 1.6 million units in June in the US, breaking records for launch month unit sales and shattering the previous record set by Sony's PlayStation 4, which hit 1.1 million units in November 2013.</p>

Standalone digital sales weren't counted as part of Circana's data.</p>
