            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-sales-1m-48-hours<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA and Hazelight Studios' new co-op action-adventure platformer&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>has reached a major sales milestone, the two studios have announced, and it only took the game a measly two days to get there.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hazelightgames.bsky.social/post/3ljztto3sws2v" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Hazelight's Bluesky page,&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>managed to sell a million copies within its first 48 hours, which is a pretty impressive milestone. Hazelight says it's "beyond happy" with the result and that it "can't stop enjoying [fans'] amazing reactions".</p>

<p><em>Split Fiction</em>'s strong performance probably shouldn't come as a surprise given that it was EA's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-ea-second-most-played-game-steam" rel="nofollow">second most-played game of all time on Steam</a> just a day or so after its release, losing out only to battle royale shooter&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends&nbsp;</em>(and I can't exactly blame it on that score).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/split-fiction-sales-1m-sci-fi.jpg?itok=kYAo-5hT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/split-fiction-sales-1m-sci-fi.jpg?itok=EV7NyvLS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>has done pretty well for EA and Hazelight sales-wise.</figcaption></figure><p>For context, it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/it-takes-two-sales-hit-1-million-copies-in-month" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">took around a month</a> for&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two&nbsp;</em>to reach the same milestone. That game would go on to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hazelight-josef-fares-new-ip-it-takes-two-sales" rel="nofollow">sell more than 20 million copies</a> at last count, so it's entirely possible that&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>will do even better for itself.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>, it's the latest game from&nbsp;<em>A Way Out&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two&nbsp;</em>developer Hazelight Studios.</p>

<p>Like the studio's previous games (with the exception of&nbsp;<em>Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons</em>),&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>can only be played as a co-op game; there's no single-player mode here, since the story and gameplay both revolve heavily around two individuals.</p>

<p>However, if you do happen to want to try out the game, the Friend's Pass <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-friends-pass-crossplay" rel="nofollow">means you can play it with anyone on any platform</a>, whether they own the game or not (as long as you do, of course).</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/creature-caravan-review-what-a-ride.1129989/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/creature-caravan-review-what-ride<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As the wooden wheels of your cart rumble along the dusty earth, you look back in wonder at the caravan you’ve assembled. Strange beasts flap heavy wings in the air, a frog-man ambles along peaceably, someone’s riding a giant snail? Sure, why not! This is the wonderful world of <i>Creature Caravan</i>, a brand new board game designed by <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/11854/ryan-laukat" rel="nofollow">Ryan Laukat</a>, and published by <a href="https://www.redravengames.com/" rel="nofollow">Red Raven Games</a>.</p>

<p>Red Raven Games provided me with a review copy of the game when I visited their booth at PAX Unplugged, and now that the game’s back in stock I thought it would be the perfect time to dive in and see what it’s all about!</p>



<blockquote>
<p><i>Creature Caravan</i> Stats:</p>

<ul><li>1 - 4 Players</li>
	<li>Est. Game Time: 60 Minutes</li>
	<li>Game Genre: Tableau Building, Dice Assignment</li>
	<li>Complexity: Medium</li>
</ul></blockquote>

<p><i>Creature Caravan</i> tasks players with competing to score the most points as they trek across a varied landscape full of strange creatures and dangerous Ember Zombies. As the name implies, players will slowly build up their caravan in the form of creature cards that they place by their board.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/creature-caravan-full-game-setup.jpg?itok=EMWnirWD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/creature-caravan-full-game-setup.jpg?itok=bGAGFTN7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Trek across the plains in Creature Caravan!</figcaption></figure><p>After playing through multiple rounds of the game, players will accumulate points by traversing the land, defeating zombies, trading in goods for points, and adding creatures to their caravan. The player who scores the most points wins after 12 rounds wins.</p>

<h2>How Do You Play <i>Creature Caravan</i>?</h2>

<p>To play the game, you’ll roll five dice and assign those dice to actions on your board. When you start the game, you’ll only have a few options available on your tableau. You can assign dice to gain creature cards to your hand, gain resources, or battle Ember Zombies.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/creature-caravan-board-and-cards.jpg?itok=PSQrBrrL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/creature-caravan-board-and-cards.jpg?itok=t9CCVtka 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The game board offers places to assign dice you roll each turn.</figcaption></figure><p>Where the complexity comes in is with the introduction of those creatures cards. As you add them to your tableau by paying resources to play their cards, you’ll unlock new slots to place your dice.</p>

<p>Placing dice in new slots unlocks additional benefits, like the ability to travel faster/further on the board, more attack to fend off Zombies, more card draw, etc.</p>

<h2>How Does It Feel To Play <i>Creature Caravan</i>?</h2>

<p><i>Creature Caravan</i> is one of my favorite types of games: the kind that starts fairly simply, and slowly gets more crunchy and complex as you play. Because of this, it’s easy to introduce new players right into the action.</p>

<p>I really like the mechanic of rolling dice and assigning them to spots on your caravan (you can assign dice of a matching number or higher to its associated spot - in other words, a die roll of a 4 could be placed on a 4, 3, 2, or 1 spot on your board).&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/creature-caravan-player-board.jpg?itok=X_qGNULZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/creature-caravan-player-board.jpg?itok=Kes1QWuX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>What starts simply with the above options soon blossoms into many different ways to spend your dice</figcaption></figure><p>I never spent a turn without at least a few interesting options in front of me, and as the game grew in complexity I ended up having <i>too many</i> cool things I wanted to do in a turn.</p>

<p>The only area of the game that feels a little less-baked than the rest of the game are the mechanics around Ember Zombies. These zombies show up when you arrive at various spots on the map, and place tokens on your board.</p>

<p>You can then add dice to slots to attack the zombies, which is really just another place to score points on your board. Of all the elements in the game, this feels least intuitive - though for my opponents who went all-in on attacking beat me pretty squarely, so maybe shows how much I know!</p>

<h2><i>Creature Caravan</i> Stuns With Its Art and Creature Design</h2>

<p>As usual, Ryan Laukat doesn’t <i>just</i> shine as a game design, but puts his artistic talent on display by illustrating all of the artwork for the game as well. It’s this artwork, I think above all else, that gives the game so much personality.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/creature-caravan-map.jpg?itok=KC1iMi5v 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/creature-caravan-map.jpg?itok=CwXk-nWe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Move along the board with your caravan!</figcaption></figure><p>Set in the world of Arzium, which also includes Laukat’s games <i>Above and Below</i>, <i>Near</i> <i>and Far, Now and Then</i>, and the all-new <i>Arzium RPG</i>, this is a setting full of bright colors, quirky characters, an internal logic that pulls it all together.</p>

<p>Without knowing all the in’s and out’s of the world, I can tell this game is illustrated by a creator who knows his universe down to the smallest bug and largest lumbering dinosaur.</p>

<h2><i>Creature Caravan - </i>Let the Cards Surprise You!</h2>

<p>I have a hot take for new players: I do <i>not</i> recommend going through and looking at all the character cards before you start playing. I know some of you might be screaming right now about “open information,” “optimal gameplay,” and “combo effects,” but it’ll be okay! Hear me out:</p>

<p>I don’t think your first play through is likely to be optimized for the best combing of creature effects anyway, so going into the game and letting each new flip of a character&nbsp;card surprise you will add a whole layer of brilliant discovery to the game!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/creature-caravan-creature-cards_0.jpg?itok=cIbi9I_6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/creature-caravan-creature-cards_0.jpg?itok=izmtjD9j 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The creature cards add so much personality to the game!</figcaption></figure><h2><i>Creature Caravan - </i>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>There’s a cleanness of design on display in <i>Creature Caravan</i> that allows the player to truly settle into the game before adding creatures to your tableau expands the horizon of options. As I’ve mentioned above, the length this goes to welcoming players into the game cannot be overstated.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for a game that let’s you roll dice (which we love, of course), plot movements carefully, collect a cadre of cool characters, and sink into evocative illustrations, <i>Creature Caravan</i> is the game for you!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steel-seed-release-date-close-to-the-sun<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher ESDigital Games and developer Storm in a Teacup have announced the release date for their stealth-action game&nbsp;<em>Steel Seed</em>, and it's coming next month.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Steel Seed&nbsp;</em>arrives on PC and current-gen consoles on April 10th. It's Storm in a Teacup's next major project after <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-store-exclusive-close-to-sun-launches-may-2nd-on-pc" rel="nofollow">2019's&nbsp;<em>BioShock</em>-inspired horror adventure <i>Close to the Sun</i></a>, although&nbsp;<em>Steel Seed&nbsp;</em>isn't related to that game in terms of story or setting.</p>

<p>Instead, it's a post-apocalyptic stealth-action game in which you play as Zoe and her drone companion Koby as they explore a massive underground facility filled with hostile machines. It'll play out in a third-person perspective, too, as opposed to&nbsp;<em>Close to the Sun</em>'s first-person viewpoint.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steel-seed-release-date-stealth.jpg?itok=XbPpKfGJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steel-seed-release-date-stealth.jpg?itok=Huwt-bP5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Steel Seed&nbsp;</em>is a stealth-action game from the makers of&nbsp;<em>Close to the Sun</em>.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Steel Seed</em>'s world is "hand-crafted", according to Storm in a Teacup, and it'll present plenty of opportunities to discover the game's "immersive narrative" and "environmental storytelling".</p>

<p>While stealth looks to be the main tool in your arsenal, Storm in a Teacup is also promising "dynamic combat" against a range of enemies, as well as "challenging bosses" and three different skill trees containing 40 upgrades between them.</p>

<p>Koby serves as both Zoe's narrative companion and a helper for&nbsp;<em>Steel Seed</em>'s puzzles, so I'm very much hoping this isn't a&nbsp;<em>God of War Ragnarok</em>-style situation where everything's solved for me. At the very least, if it is, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-puzzle-hints" rel="nofollow">let me turn down the hint frequency</a>!</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Steel Seed</em>, which gives a sense of the game's story and the world in which it takes place, right here.</p>




<p><em>Steel Seed&nbsp;</em>boasts the involvement of BAFTA winner Martin Korda, a writer and consultant in the industry who's worked on projects like&nbsp;<em>Destiny: The Taken King&nbsp;</em>and several&nbsp;<em>FIFA&nbsp;</em>(now known as&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC</em>) career modes.</p>

<p>Storm in a Teacup says the game will feature "an intriguing main character's evolution" and "a compelling and deep narrative experience" thanks to Korda's involvement. We'll have to wait and see whether those promises ring true.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Steel Seed&nbsp;</em>when it launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/458430/Steel_Seed/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10010794/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and Xbox Series X|S on April 10th.</p>
