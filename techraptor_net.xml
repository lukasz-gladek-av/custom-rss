            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Enhance has announced the&nbsp;<em>Lumines Arise&nbsp;</em>release date, and if you're still on the fence about checking out the studio's latest rhythm-puzzler, then there's a PS5 demo available for you to try out right now.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/26/lumines-arise-launches-nov-11-ps5-demo-available-now/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on the PlayStation Blog, Enhance's Tetsuya Mizuguchi reveals that you can expect to check out&nbsp;<em>Lumines Arise&nbsp;</em>in full on November 11th, and that the PS5 demo is up for download. Sadly, it doesn't seem to be available on Steam, or at least not yet at time of writing.</p>

<p>The demo contains three single-player stages for you to try, and it's got just one difficulty level on offer, namely Easy mode. The full game will add three extra difficulties to keep you on your toes no matter what your rhythmic proficiency may be.</p>

<p>According to Mizuguchi, the game is "incredibly easy for anyone to get into" thanks to its "excellent interactive tutorial", which also means it's ideal for anyone who's never played a&nbsp;<em>Lumines&nbsp;</em>game before, as well as those who are just getting back into the series after a break.</p>

<p>If you're not the kind of person who loves the time pressure that&nbsp;<em>Lumines</em>' default modes bring, you can switch off the timer using the No Stress&nbsp;<em>Lumines&nbsp;</em>option in the game's accessibility menu, and there are tons of other tweaks to help you reach the experience you want to have.</p>




<p><em>Lumines Arise&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2370000/Lumines_Arise/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10011885" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a> on November 11th, and if you're playing on PS5, you can download the demo right now.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and Arrowhead Game Studios have revealed Into the Unjust, the next major&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>update, and it's time for you and your squad to take the fight to the mysterious Terminid Hive Worlds.</p>

<p>As revealed in a PlayStation Blog <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/26/helldivers-2-into-the-unjust-launches-september-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, Into the Unjust arrives on September 2nd, and its big new addition is the aforementioned Hive Worlds, where you'll find new Terminid dangers both above ground and beneath it.</p>

<p>When Into the Unjust lands, you'll be delving underground as part of its new missions, and while you're down there, you'll encounter new Terminid enemies. You'll also be unable to call in your Super Destroyer for support, so it's just you and your team against whatever horrors lurk in the tunnels.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-into-the-unjust-dragonroach.jpg?itok=3qM2rmN3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-into-the-unjust-dragonroach.jpg?itok=58pzFwQz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>will introduce new enemies and more in its Into the Unjust update.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Arrowhead, the update's new Terminid enemies will "burrow underground" and begin moving towards you when they detect you. Once they're close enough, they'll emerge from the ground and launch a surprise attack.</p>

<p>You'll also be able to encounter new enemies like the Dragonroach, a flying enemy that zeroes in on you and spits bile at you once it spots you. As if&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>'s existing flying enemies weren't already annoying enough to deal with.</p>

<p>New mission types will be added as part of Into the Unjust, too; one has you escorting a mobile oil rig and defending it from Terminid attacks, for instance, while delving underground will see you tasked with destroying the Hive Lung to stop the ever-encroaching Gloom.</p>

<p>You can check out a developer deep dive on the Into the Unjust update right here. It should give you a bit more info on what you're up against.</p>




<p>Following the release of&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-halo-3-odst-warbond" rel="nofollow">first Legendary Warbond</a>&nbsp;(which also happens to be a <em>Halo 3: ODST </em>crossover) today, a new Dust Devils Premium Warbond has also been announced.</p>

<p>It comes complete with new weapons, including the AR-2 Coyote assault rifle, the S-11 Speargun, and the MS-11 Solo Silo stratagem, as well as new armor, new capes, and plenty more. It's launching just two days after Into the Unjust on September 4th.</p>

<p><em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/helldivers-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/helldivers-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.
