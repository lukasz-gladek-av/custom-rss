            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splitgate-2-open-beta-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher 1047 Games has announced that the open beta for portal-based first-person shooter&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>will be starting next month.</p>

<p>Per a press release, you'll be able to head into the world of&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>on May 22nd, and the beta will be available across PC, PlayStation, and Xbox, with full crossplay also being enabled between all three platforms.</p>

<p>There's no time period listed in the press release, which seems to indicate that the open beta for&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>will be closer in spirit to an Early Access release rather than a limited-time stress test.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/splitgate-2-open-beta-date-portal-shooting.jpg?itok=YfTfEvrY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/splitgate-2-open-beta-date-portal-shooting.jpg?itok=4WUwVmb2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll be able to try out&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>on May 22nd.</figcaption></figure><p>Tons of stuff will be available for you to try out when&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2</em>'s open beta lands in May. You'll have access to over 15 maps, including "two new massive 24-player Onslaught maps" in the form of Drought and Fracture.</p>

<p>Over 25 weapons will be available for you to try out, including&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2</em>'s new Borealis energy carbine, and 10-plus modes will be available at launch as well, including the "fan favorite" Takedown mode.</p>

<p>Rather tantalizingly, 1047 also says&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>will feature something called "infinite" maps, over footage of what looks rather like a level editor, so perhaps you'll be able to make your own mind-bending portal levels as well.</p>

<p>It's all accompanied by a rather brief, but nonetheless exciting, teaser trailer that shows off some of&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2</em>'s frantic action. You can check out that (admittedly very short) trailer right here.</p>




<p>First announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splitgate-2-announced" rel="nofollow">in July last year</a>, <i>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</i>is the sequel to 2022's&nbsp;<em>Splitgate</em>. Developer 1047 Games is putting all of its eggs into the sequel's basket, too; at the same time that it announced the sequel, the studio also revealed it would cease future development on the original game.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2</em>'s open beta when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2918300/Splitgate_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10010012" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/splitgate-2/9pf5q1b0fhsl" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a> on May 22nd.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Borderlands 4 Release Date Apparently Moving Forward, Per Randy Pitchford]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/borderlands-4-release-date-moving-forward-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It looks like&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>might be coming out sooner than you think, if a now-deleted post on X by Gearbox head honcho Randy Pitchford is anything to go by.</p>

<p>The post, which was <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1917223361622508015" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">handily salvaged</a> by Wario64, shows Pitchford excitedly claiming that development on&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>is going great; in fact, he says that where the team is at with the game right now is "the best-case scenario".</p>

<p>As a result, Pitchford says the&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>release date is being moved forward to September 12th. He also reiterates that there will be a&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em>-focused PlayStation State of Play show "imminently", with PlayStation subsequently <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/29/watch-the-borderlands-4-gameplay-deep-dive-state-of-play-on-april-30/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">confirming that show for tomorrow</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/borderlands-4-release-date-moving-up-shooting.jpg?itok=UmCwTRJP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/borderlands-4-release-date-moving-up-shooting.jpg?itok=wcEW7tx0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It looks like&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>is coming sooner than you think.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, Pitchford is framing&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em>'s sooner release as a positive for Gearbox, but it's equally likely that the team has moved the release date forward to avoid clashing with some big games that are due out this fall.</p>

<p>There's Sony's&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yōtei</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ghost-of-yotei-release-date" rel="nofollow">due to arrive on PS5 in October</a>, as is Paradox and The Chinese Room's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-october-2025" rel="nofollow">long-awaited&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-october-2025" rel="nofollow">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a>&nbsp;</em>(at time of writing, at least).</p>

<p>Perhaps the biggest elephant in the room, however, is&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em>, which Rockstar (and Gearbox) parent company Take-Two says is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gta-6-still-on-track-for-fall" rel="nofollow">still on track to arrive sometime this fall</a>. No release date has been revealed yet, of course, but it is possible&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>was moved to avoid clashing with&nbsp;<em>GTA VI</em>.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em>, it's the fourth mainline entry in the&nbsp;<em>Borderlands&nbsp;</em>series (although not the fourth overall, thanks to the existence of games like&nbsp;<em>Tiny Tina's Wonderlands&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel</em>).</p>

<p>The game features four all-new Vault Hunters with new abilities and skills to master, plus lots and lots of new weapons to collect. According to its narrative director,&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>will also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/borderlands-4-toilet-humor-narrative-director" rel="nofollow">feature less "toilet humor"</a> than its predecessors.</p>

<p>Assuming Pitchford's deleted post was accurate,&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>will launch on September 12th for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/borderlands-4/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/borderlands-4/9MX6HKF5647G" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and it's also coming to <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/Borderlands-4-2792057.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/sniper-elite-board-game-and-eagles-nest-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><i>He's there. You know he's there. Even before you found the bodies, it's almost like you felt his presence. Always watching. You feel like you're under a constant crosshair. But to save yourself from going mad, you've fallen back on your orders. Guard the facility, patrol the routes, but he's still there. You know he's there.</i></p>

<p><i>Sniper Elite the Board Game </i>is based on the popular <a href="https://techraptor.net/series/sniper-elite" rel="nofollow"><em>Sniper Elite</em></a> video game series. In this review, we'll look at how it plays and how it stacks up against the video game it's based on, and we'll also check out what the Eagle's Nest expansion adds to games. <em>Sniper Elite the Board Game</em> was a successful crowdfunding campaign in 2020, and another expansion, <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/projects/rebellionunplugged/sniper-elite-operation-kraken" rel="nofollow">Operation Kraken</a>, is planned on Gamefound.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sniper-elite-the-board-game-3.jpg?itok=FFSOzB3L 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sniper-elite-the-board-game-3.jpg?itok=bOUJS-PW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The sniper miniature in <em>Sniper Elite the Board Game</em> actually only shows your last known location. You could be long gone as the guards close in.</figcaption></figure><h2>Hidden Sniper Moving Target</h2>

<p><i>Sniper Elite the Board Game </i>is a hidden movement 1 vs many board game. What that means is that 1 player takes the role of the Sniper, and up to 3 players (or an AI card deck if playing solo) take on the role of the guards. The guards are split into 3 teams of 3, and their miniatures are placed on the map. During their turn, they can move and search areas, looking for the sniper.</p>

<p>The sniper, using a smaller separate copy of the game board, uses a dry-erase marker to track their movement, as they try and complete 2 objectives. Their miniature is kept off the board and secret, creating noise if they move too fast, which the defenders can track, narrowing their search area. The sniper miniature is only placed on the board if the defenders discover them, they complete an objective, or if they create too much noise when taking a shot.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sniper-elite-the-board-game-4.jpg?itok=wdhT5_Ms 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sniper-elite-the-board-game-4.jpg?itok=1GEhJogp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Sniper Elite the Board Game</em> uses radomly drawn tokens for shooting.</figcaption></figure><p>Shooting in <em>Sniper Elite the Board Game</em> uses an interesting, unique mechanic. It's an almost completely diceless board game (except a single die for solo play), and instead, when making a shot, players draw tokens from a bag. A number of aim tokens is required, equal to the number of spaces between you and your target (including your target's space). The number of tokens you draw is up to you, but if you draw 2 or more noise tokens, then your position is revealed, and if you draw a combination of 5 or more noise and recoil tokens, then you miss your shot regardless of how many aim tokens you draw. Tokens are added to the bag as the game progresses, such as more noise tokens for being spotted, or more aim tokens for taking out enemies.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sniper-elite-the-board-game-2.jpg?itok=Jc9wdOx9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sniper-elite-the-board-game-2.jpg?itok=1EjQwmPP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Sniper Elite the Board Game </em>has a map where the action takes place, and a seperate map for the hidden sniper to track their movements.</figcaption></figure><h2>Boom Headshot</h2>

<p>There are only 2 maps in the core game box, but the variety comes from the random objectives, keeps the game varied for the sniper and the guards guessing. There are also 6 specialist abilities that each one of the guard commanders can choose 1 of, and 10 items that the sniper can choose 2 of. This combination of objectives, specialists, and items means that rarely will a game be the same.</p>

<p>The hidden nature of the game also keeps things fresh, and playing the guards made me super anxious. It's much simpler to have one player playing all 3 guard units, as they can work overlapping search areas, but having 3 makes it as complicated as 3 independent units would, each with their own ideas for where the sniper might be.</p>

<p>For the sniper player, I honestly thought going into the game that I would be blasting away the enemies of the Allied campaign as you do in the game, but it's actually better to fire no shots at all, and when you do fire, shoot an irrelevant target to confuse your opponents. Moving a target out of your way alerts them to your rough area and possible objective.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sniper-elite-the-board-game-5.jpg?itok=c8bCYrBl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sniper-elite-the-board-game-5.jpg?itok=Xi0ABjmG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Sniper Elite the Board Game Eagle's Nest </em>expansion adds a load of new variety with new snipers and new maps.</figcaption></figure><h2>Where Eagles Dare</h2>

<p>The <em>Sniper Elite the Board Game Eagle's Nest </em>expansion adds a lot more variety to games. It includes 2 new maps, with solo defender control cards and new objective cards for them. It also includes some new equipment cards to help you navigate the cliffs and water of the Heavy Water map. The other map is set entirely inside Eagle's Nest, a challenging, claustrophobic room-to-room mission.</p>

<p>Eagle's Nest also includes 4 new sniper miniatures and stat cards to go with them, offering a variety of special abilities. Karl, the original <em>Sniper Elite</em> character, starts with the most aim tokens in the bag and can fire twice a turn. Rosa from <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/sniper-elite-4" rel="nofollow"><em>Sniper Elite 4</em></a> can only target enemies 5 spaces away, but only starts with 1 noise token. Jun, from <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/zombie-army-4-dead-war" rel="nofollow"><em>Zombie Army 4: Dead War</em></a> can remove multiple adjacent targets with a single shot, at the cost of adding noise tokens to the bag, and Major Eazy, from Battle comics, and starts the game with 3 noise and 3 aim tokens, but noise tokens count as aim tokens for him, so you can freely blast away.</p>

<h2>Sniper Elite the Board Game Final Thoughts?</h2>

<p>I honestly thought that I would have a completely different experience going into <em>Sniper Elite the Board Game</em>. I thought shooting would be a lot more prevalent than it is, and I didn't expect the hidden movement element to be so much fun. It captures an element of the video game perfectly, with the sniper having a feeling of such control, until things go wrong, and then things can deteriorate quickly. It is 2 vastly different experiences playing the guards or the sniper, both fun and challenging in their own right. The token bag for shooting plays into it all perfectly, and the risk/reward element is a pivotal focus of the game.</p>

<p>The Eagle's Nest expansion adds a lot more variety, with the extra maps doubling the number in the core set, and the extra snipers adding some very different styles of play. The core game stands alone as a great experience out of the box, and while the Eagle's Nest is a great addition, it is simply adding more variety on top of an already great and varied game.</p>
