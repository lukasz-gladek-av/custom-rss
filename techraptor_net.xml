            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ryan Burns, the developer behind psychological horror game <em>The Oily Depths</em>, has slashed the game's price permanently in response to player feedback, so now's your chance to get it much, much cheaper.</p><p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3113030/view/542256414786060359" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">news post</a> on the game's Steam page, Burns says he's been "listening closely" to player feedback following the release of <em>The Oily Depths</em>, which happened earlier this week.</p><p>After reviewing player comments and "taking a hard look at where the game stands right now", Burns decided to cut <em>The Oily Depths</em>' price from $8 down to just $3. That's a price cut of over 60%, and it's not a temporary sale, either; that's a permanent cut.</p><figure role="group">

<p>Burns says he wants every player to feel as though "they got a great value out of their experience" with <em>The Oily Depths</em>, and that he believes the new price "better reflects the scope and length of the game".</p><p>If you did buy <em>The Oily Depths </em>at its original price, Burns says that given the game's short length, you should still be within the Steam refund window, so you can ask for a refund "and repurchase at the new price if you'd like".</p><p>As a quick reminder, Steam refunds are offered to players with fewer than two hours' playtime in a game, as long as they've owned that game for less than two weeks. Since <em>The Oily Depths </em>came out on February 9th, the latter, at least, applies to every player right now.</p><p>If you're wondering exactly what <em>The Oily Depths </em>is, it's a short horror adventure <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-oily-depths-ex-blizzard-ubisoft-dev" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9d7b5677-68b0-4a7b-8a7c-8bf4bc8cb7eb" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">created by ex-Blizzard staffer Ryan Burns</a>, and it combines a lo-fi, chunky art style with gameplay that revolves around examining and maintaining machines abord a deep-sea submarine.</p>
<p>You can check out <em>The Oily Depths </em>at its new price on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3113030/The_Oily_Depths/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC via Steam</a> right now.
