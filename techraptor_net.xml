            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Monte Cook Games has announced a new edition of their award-winning TTRPG system. Their new Cypher RPG system, which will provide a streamlined experience, complete with GM narrative and creative freedom, will be arriving via crowdfunding campaign.</p>

<h2>The New Cypher RPG System Announcement</h2>

<p>In an <a href="https://www.montecookgames.com/announcing-cyphers-new-evolved-edition/" rel="nofollow">official post</a> on Monte Cook Games' website, Charles Ryan explains the reasoning behind introducing the new Cypher RPG system.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cypher-rpg-rulebook-artwork.jpg?itok=Bl3pyJqO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cypher-rpg-rulebook-artwork.jpg?itok=vSTi3_MW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Ryan mentions that the Cypher system has been around for twelve years, garnering a passionate fanbase thanks to its accessible but rewarding gameplay system. He even mentions the game's malleability, bringing to life games like the far future fantasy of <em>Numenera</em>, the existential far fantasy of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/return-to-actuality-with-invisible-sun-electric-and-indigo-by-monte-cook-games" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Invisible Sun</em></a>, and the disturbing cosmic horror of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/magnus-archives-roleplaying-game-review-leitner-worthy" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>The Magnus Archives Roleplaying Game</em></a>.</p>

<p>But with all TTRPG systems, feedback from players has led to certain parts of the system being streamlined or changed. Certain changes or additions may have been featured in certain licensed products and are being grandfathered into this new system. Furthermore, a new edition allows a studio to reformat their core rules for readability and clarity.</p>

<p>Some of the changes coming to the new Cypher RPG system have been long requested. Damage will no longer drain the player character's different stat pools. An armor system is being introduced, granting players more defensive options. New, genre-specific character generation options will be available, and there will be a greater focus on subtle cyphers: the imperceptible aids players can call upon in times of crisis.</p>

<p>But the pillars of the Cypher RPG system will still in place. Characters are still created with a combo of a Type, Descriptor, and Focus. Tasks are still assigned in difficulty from 1-10 and can be eased with a mix of Effort, Assets, and Skills. Also, enemy statblocks will remain easily readable and quick to implement for GMs.</p>

<p>The new Cypher RPG system will be released as two books. The first is the Cypher Character Rulebook, which will contain rules for making characters in a wide variety of genres, including high-fantasy, space opera, cyberpunk, and post-apocalyptic future. The second book, the Cypher GM's Guide, will contain rules and aids to help GMs run the game.</p>

<p>Both of these books will be available through a crowdfunding campaign that will launch in late summer, with a retail release set for mid-2026.</p>
