            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Blackbird Interactive has announced that it has acquired the full rights to the&nbsp;<em>Hardspace: Shipbreaker&nbsp;</em>IP from original publisher Focus Entertainment, and that "multiple" projects related to the property are currently in development.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1161580/view/836099892906557718" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on the game's Steam page, Blackbird Interactive now "fully owns and controls" the IP, and it's "going to become a core part" of the studio's business strategy in the future. If you've been hoping for followups to the game, this seems like pretty great news for you.</p>

<p>In fact, Blackbird says that "multiple&nbsp;<em>Hardspace&nbsp;</em>projects are already in development", and that while the studio isn't ready to share specifics for those projects yet, Blackbird is focused on making sure the next <i>Hardspace&nbsp;</i>games "expand on the original game in all the right ways".</p>

If you spot an update for your game, now you know what it is.</p>

<p>Blackbird is quick to reassure players that this won't mean anything in terms of access for&nbsp;<em>Hardspace: Shipbreaker</em>; you'll still be able to play it if you own it on Steam or anywhere else.</p>

<p>If you want your say on how future&nbsp;<em>Hardspace&nbsp;</em>projects should go, as well as the chance to potentially playtest new games as and when those tests become available, Blackbird recommends you sign up for something it's calling the <a href="https://blackbirdinteractive.com/lynxpioneerprogram/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">LYNX Pioneer Program</a>.</p>

<p>The program will offer "exclusive playtests" of new <i>Hardspace&nbsp;</i>games, as well as "behind-the-scenes development updates" and "opportunities to help shape Blackbird Interactive's next generation of games".</p>




<p>According to Blackbird, the split with Focus Interactive isn't acrimonious. The studio thanks Focus for its "partnership and willingness" to work alongside Blackbird in order to transfer IP ownership smoothly.</p>
