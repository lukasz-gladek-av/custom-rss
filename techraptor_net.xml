            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sakuna-chronicles-kokorowa-and-gears-of-creation-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin&nbsp;</em>developer Edelweiss has announced&nbsp;<em>Sakuna Chronicles: Kokorowa and the Gears of Creation</em>, a spinoff that also officially inaugurates what must now be known as the&nbsp;<em>Sakuna&nbsp;</em>franchise.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Kokorowa and the Gears of Creation&nbsp;</em>will be published in the West by Marvelous' indie brand XSEED, the company behind games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/loop8-summer-of-gods-gameplay-walkthrough-shows-off-xseeds-coming-of-age-rpg" rel="nofollow">Loop8: Summer of Gods</a>&nbsp;</em>and potion shop sim&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/potionomics" rel="nofollow"><em>Potionomics</em></a>, among many others.</p>

<p>As you might expect from the title, the game will revolve around the titular Princess Kokorowa, a "high-ranking goddess presiding over wheels and inventions from her heavenly home". The debut trailer describes Kokorowa as "the tireless Goddess of Invention".</p>

<p>We don't know a heck of a lot about&nbsp;<em>Sakuna Chronicles: Kokorowa and the Gears of Creation&nbsp;</em>yet. Edelweiss and XSEED say they'll announce more info, including platforms and release timing, at a later date.</p>

<p>It looks like the game will largely utilize a 3D art style rather than the mixture of 2D and 3D favored by&nbsp;<em>Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin</em>, although it could just be that we're yet to see any of the game's 2D sections.</p>

<p>In any case, you can take a look at the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Sakuna Chronicles: Kokorowa and the Gears of Creation&nbsp;</em>right here.</p>




<p>Released in 2020,&nbsp;<em>Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin&nbsp;</em>is a farming sim-action RPG hybrid that sees protagonist Princess Sakuna exiled to a distant island and tasked with clearing it of its monster infestation.</p>

<p>The game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sakuna-of-rice-and-ruin-breakout-hit-stop-stock-trading" rel="nofollow">proved a surprise hit at launch</a>, halting the stock trading of publisher Marvelous (XSEED's parent company) after share prices skyrocketed owing to the game's success.</p>

<p>If you want to get caught up before the launch of&nbsp;<em>Sakuna Chronicles: Kokorowa and the Gears of Creation</em>, then you can grab&nbsp;<em>Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1356670/Sakuna_Of_Rice_and_Ruin/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1023-CUSA09130_00-SAKUNA0000000000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS4</a> (and therefore also PS5 via backwards compatibility), and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/sakuna-of-rice-and-ruin-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atomfall-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/atomfall-release-date-brings-post-nuclear-survival-in-march.1035807/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atomfall-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rebellion has announced the release date for its post-apocalyptic survival-action game&nbsp;<em>Atomfall</em>, and the UK-set game is set to arrive on PC and consoles in spring next year.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/801800/view/6491470391966433300" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a Steam post</a>,&nbsp;<em>Atomfall&nbsp;</em>arrives on March 27th, and it's also coming to Game Pass on day one, so if you're a subscriber, you'll get to check it out at no additional cost on Xbox consoles.</p>

<p>Rather unusually, this one's coming to Xbox One and PS4 as well as current-gen machines, too. Let it never be said that Rebellion doesn't provide for those who are still attached to their last-gen consoles.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/atomfall-release-date-gunman.jpg?itok=mstIcy2k 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/atomfall-release-date-gunman.jpg?itok=mURP-yNj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Atomfall&nbsp;</em>should provide succor for those who feel underserved by more recent Bethesda&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>fare.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Atomfall&nbsp;</em>is, it's a post-apocalyptic action-RPG inspired by real events but with a decidedly fictional bent.</p>

<p>The game is set five years after the very real Windscale nuclear disaster, a 1957 fire that caused radioactive material to leak from the eponymous Windscale nuclear site. In&nbsp;<em>Atomfall</em>'s universe, though, that disaster had much more far-reaching consequences than it did in real life.</p>

<p>As you explore&nbsp;<em>Atomfall</em>'s quarantine zone, you'll scavenge for resources, meet the locals, and contend with "bizarre characters, mysticism, cults, and rogue government agencies". In real life, of course, most of us Brits just apologized profusely, as is our wont.</p>

<p>You can check out the&nbsp;<em>Atomfall&nbsp;</em>release date trailer, which also gives a glimpse into the game's peculiarly British post-nuclear landscape (although it's not quite the blasted hellhole of&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>or <em>Stalker</em>), right here.</p>




<p><em>Atomfall&nbsp;</em>will give you the chance to use both ranged and melee weapons, but ammunition is scarce, so you'll have to blend firearms with melee weapons in order to create viable combat strategies.</p>

<p>If you're partial to the likes of the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-london-mod-million-downloads" rel="nofollow"><em>Fallout: London&nbsp;</em>mod</a> or the British dystopian vibes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/we-happy-few" rel="nofollow"><em>We Happy Few</em></a>, then&nbsp;<em>Atomfall&nbsp;</em>should definitely be on your wishlist. The game is coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/801800/Atomfall/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10007896" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/atomfall/9nc4wdl5kzbl" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a> on March 27th.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Thunderful Hit by Yet More Layoffs as Studio Refocuses on Publishing]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/thunderful-layoffs-development</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/thunderful-hit-by-yet-more-layoffs-as-studio-refocuses-on-publishing.1035759/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/thunderful-layoffs-development<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>SteamWorld&nbsp;</em>studio Thunderful has announced another round of layoffs in a further "strategic restructuring program" that's set to affect dozens of employees, mostly focused across the company's development divisions.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://thunderfulgames.com/thunderful-doubling-down-on-game-publishing-scaling-back-internal-development/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post on its official website</a>, Thunderful says these layoffs are intended to reflect "a greater focus on third-party game publishing and a reduction in investments in internally-developed projects".</p>

<p>Company CEO Martin Walfisz says announcing Thunderful's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/thunderful-layoffs-restructuring" rel="nofollow">second "restructuring" wave this year</a> is "unfortunate", but that the company "see[s] no other alternatives in order to ensure the Group's long-term sustainability".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steamworld-heist-2-thunderful-layoffs.jpg?itok=nrjCFLcx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steamworld-heist-2-thunderful-layoffs.jpg?itok=4D4NpPWP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You might know Thunderful's name from the&nbsp;<em>SteamWorld&nbsp;</em>franchise.</figcaption></figure><p>According to the news post, Thunderful's latest round of layoffs will "result in the termination of a large portion of the development team", although the layoffs won't exclusively be restricted to developers.</p>

<p>Between 80 and 100 employees will be affected by these layoffs. Thunderful says that its subsidiary Coatsink won't be in the firing line, but it seems like the company's other development divisions are all in the crosshairs, so to speak.</p>

<p>News of Thunderful's second layoff wave this year follows on from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/thunderful-closes-studio-financials" rel="nofollow">closure of&nbsp;<em>Last Kids on Earth and the Staff of Doom&nbsp;</em>developer Stage Clear Studios</a> back in May, at which point Thunderful also reported a 28% drop in revenue on a year-on-year basis.</p>

<p>While Thunderful hasn't released official sales figures for its recent game launches, we do know that city-builder&nbsp;<em>SteamWorld Build&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/thunderful-says-steamworld-build-underperformed-reveals-it-s-looking-to-sell-headup" rel="nofollow">fell short of company expectations</a>, and it seems the release of tactical RPG&nbsp;<em>SteamWorld Heist 2&nbsp;</em>earlier this year wasn't enough to recover things.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lost-in-random-the-eternal-die-thunderful.jpg?itok=2l9OONUD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lost-in-random-the-eternal-die-thunderful.jpg?itok=Cs_cjM5e 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Upcoming Thunderful releases include&nbsp;<em>Lost in Random: The Eternal Die</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Thunderful's news post doesn't make any suggestion that the company will be canceling upcoming releases, so you can expect recently-announced projects like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-in-random-eternal-die-roguelike-announced" rel="nofollow">the roguelite&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-in-random-eternal-die-roguelike-announced" rel="nofollow">Lost in Random: The Eternal Die</a>&nbsp;</em>to go ahead.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Thunderful isn't the only company being subjected to what companies would likely call "challenging market conditions" in recent times.</p>

<p>Big companies like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Sony</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-interactive-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Take-Two</a> are also being hit by layoffs and studio closures, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-nod-employees-strike" rel="nofollow">smaller studios</a> aren't escaping unscathed either. These are truly difficult times for the gaming industry, it seems, although of course, that's not stopping <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-ceo-25-million-income-layoffs" rel="nofollow">C-suite execs</a> reaping <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-ceo-payrise-layoffs" rel="nofollow">rewards galore</a>.</p>
