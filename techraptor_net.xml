            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has released its financial statement for the first quarter of the fiscal year, and shockingly enough, the company's revenue is up when compared to the previous year, while Switch 2 sales are looking pretty solid overall.</p>

<p>As revealed in its accompanying financial <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250801_2e.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">presentation</a>, Nintendo's sales jumped by 132% between April and June when compared to the same period a year prior. This is, of course, largely down to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">the release</a> of the Switch 2 in early June.</p>

<p>Net profits rose by around 18.6% when compared to last year, but as Nintendo points out, the Switch 2 has a smaller profit margin than the original Switch, which accounts for what might be a smaller number than you expected to see, given the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-fastest-selling-nintendo-console" rel="nofollow">console's success</a>.</p>

Aww.</figcaption></figure><p>It's fair to say the Switch 2 has been a success, too. According to Nintendo, the console managed to sell over six million units within its first seven weeks, and since we're nowhere near the holiday season yet, those numbers are only likely to increase by the end of the year.</p>

<p><em>Mario Kart World</em>, which was the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">main launch title</a> for the Switch 2 where Nintendo is concerned, managed to sell 5.62 million units in the weeks leading up to June 30th as well. Technically, though, that figure refers to "sell-in" rather than "sell-through", which includes both copies Nintendo sent to business partners and those bought by customers either directly through the Nintendo site or as downloadable software.</p>

<p>As Nintendo points out, it's also got more than a few games in the pipeline for the Switch 2. This month will see the release of wheelchair basketball sim&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/drag-x-drive-release-date" rel="nofollow"><em>Drag x Drive</em></a>, and hotly-anticipated games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-release-date-pokemon-presents" rel="nofollow">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a>&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metroid-prime-4-beyond-2025" rel="nofollow">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>&nbsp;</i>(both also coming to the original Switch) will arrive later in the year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-financials-q1-2026.jpg?itok=8k2241Sr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-financials-q1-2026.jpg?itok=rNRuUP-_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond&nbsp;</em>is just one of Nintendo's holiday titles (we assume).</figcaption></figure><p>In any case, things are looking up for Nintendo right now, although whether the Switch 2 can replicate the original console's long-term success remains to be seen.</p>

<p>Nintendo's financial statement for the first quarter follows <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">yesterday's Partner Showcase Direct</a>, during which we learned about new releases like Square Enix's HD-2D action RPG&nbsp;<em>The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales&nbsp;</em>and Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Stories 3</em>.</p>
