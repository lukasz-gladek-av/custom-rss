            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-outlaws-new-creative-director<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has announced that&nbsp;it has appointed a new&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>creative director, and he'll be helming what will be the game's biggest update yet.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/7n2akTSlEV3Wk1aRRwONFZ/star-wars-outlaws-dev-update-1-pushing-into-hyperdrive" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a blog post</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>website, Drew Rechner will be stepping up to the plate as the game's new creative director. Whether previous directors Julian Gerighty and Mathias Karlson will still be playing a role in the game's ongoing development remains to be seen.</p>

<p>In the blog post, Rechner says he's identified "three key areas" in which he and the team would like to improve&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, namely combat, stealth, and character control.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-outlaws-creative-director-new-combat.jpg?itok=G116zB68 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-outlaws-creative-director-new-combat.jpg?itok=YZ6CPU3O 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ubisoft still wants to improve&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>across the board, it seems.</figcaption></figure><p>With regards to combat, Rechner says the studio is looking to add "more depth and excitement to the experience" in order to further reward players' "tactics and precision".</p>

<p>When it comes to stealth, the plan is to improve the "readability and consistency of enemy detection" and to provide more "choice" in how you want to approach encounters.</p>

<p>Finally, character control improvements will apparently involve "improving the reliability of cover, increasing the responsiveness of climbing and crouching, and generally improving the consistency of the controls".</p>

<p>These are areas in which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-outlaws-update-112">previous</a>&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>updates have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-outlaws-update-130-stealth-speeder">sought to make improvements</a> as well, particularly in the case of stealth, but Rechner says the forthcoming update 1.4 will be&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>' "biggest yet" when it lands on November 21st.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, it's an open-world action-adventure game developed by Ubisoft and set, believe it or not, in the&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>universe.</p>

<p>You play scoundrel Kay Vess, who must wheel and deal her way through the underworld's crime syndicates as she plans the heist of a lifetime. The game mixes shooter-style combat, stealth, and open-world exploration.</p>

<p>Despite the popularity of its IP,&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-february">underperformed for Ubisoft financially</a>, leading to the company rethinking some of its strategies; Ubisoft games will be released on Steam on day one from now on, and the company is also dropping the season pass model for future releases.</p>

<p><em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/star-wars/outlaws" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S</a>, and it's also coming to Steam on November 21st, the same day the next update arrives.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/enshrouded-souls-of-frozen-frontier-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Open-world survival-crafter&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded&nbsp;</em>has received a brand new update, and it's being described by developer and publisher Keen Games as the game's biggest update yet.</p>

<p>The Souls of the Frozen Frontier update follows on from other major content drops like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/enshrouded-melodies-of-mire-update">Melodies of the Mire</a> and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-major-enshrouded-update-hollow-halls">Hollow Halls</a>, and it's seemingly on a similar scale, introducing a whole new biome, a new dynamic weather system, and more.</p>

<p>First up, the Albaneve Summits, a "breathtaking new mountain region", are now yours for the exploring. They're packed with "fresh challenges, discoveries, and opportunities", according to Keen Games, so you should have plenty to keep you busy.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/enshrouded-souls-of-the-frozen-frontier-update-snow.jpg?itok=m-ss7dI_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/enshrouded-souls-of-the-frozen-frontier-update-snow.jpg?itok=msiYLG7J 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Enshrouded</em>'s new update has a whole new biome for you to explore.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as the new biome, you can also look forward to a brand new dynamic weather system that sees weather patterns change as you explore. The higher you go, the more snow and cold you'll encounter, and you'll need to accommodate that change with food and clothing.</p>

<p>You can also now tame non-hostile animals and take them back to your base, and just in case you're wondering, it is possible to pet non-hostile animals as well. That alone should be reason enough to head back into&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded</em>.</p>

<p>The game's level cap has been increased to 35, and new crafting resources have been added as part of the new biome's appearance, along with new crafting stations and new armor sets.</p>

<p>In short, there's lots to discover as part of the&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded&nbsp;</em>Souls of the Frozen Frontier update. You can read the full list of changes (which, as you'd expect from a large update like this, is extensive) <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1203620/view/4461471496628338725" rel="noopener" target="_blank">right here</a>.</p>




<p>In case you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded</em>, it's an open-world survival-crafting game which sees you exploring a vast world, gathering resources to craft a base, and venturing into dangerous mist in order to collect powerful rewards from dangerous enemies.</p>

<p>The game is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1203620/Enshrouded/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>, and if you want to know what we think of this ambitious survival-crafter, you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/enshrouded-final-preview-survival-progression-at-its-finest">check out our preview here</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metal-slug-tactics-review-turn-based-tedium.1027860/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/metal-slug-tactics-review-turn-based-tedium<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Like some sort of elusive cryptid, we've been given bits and pieces of gameplay and screenshots of <em>Metal Slug Tactics</em> throughout the years. With fans chomping at the bit to see more, it was a surprise to see this highly-anticipated <a href="https://techraptor.net/genre/turn-based-tactics">turn-based tactics</a> game launching in 2024. Finally, <em>Metal Slug </em>and strategy fans alike can get their hands on this title.</p>

<p>I went into <em>Metal Slug Tactics</em> very excited -- after all, its superb pixel art style and retro-inspired soundtrack really speaks to the care <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/leikir-studio">Leikir Studio</a> put into crafting this game. And indeed, while it looks and sounds great, I'm a bit more lukewarm on the gameplay. There's a solid tactics game mechanics-wise, but well... the rest of it feels like a slog.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metal-slug-tactics-gameplay.jpg?itok=xlemNZ1P 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metal-slug-tactics-gameplay.jpg?itok=mMmvlSf0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This minigun guy has got to go.</figcaption></figure><h2>Going the Distance in <em>Metal Slug Tactics</em></h2>

<p>As a veteran of turn-based tactics titles, I tend to play on the defensive with my units. Let enemies come to me, and I'll pick them off as they clash against my hardy frontline and have the backline of ranged units pick them off. I'll tell you right now, slow and steady is <em>not</em> going to fly in <em>Metal Slug Tactics</em>, and the gameplay is designed to rewire the way you think of this genre.</p>

<p>In this regard, <em>Metal Slug Tactics</em> stands out among other turn-based tactics titles, as it incentivizes speed. Leikir Studio makes a valiant effort in attempting to replicate the running and gunning that's so iconic to the series.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metal-slug-tactics-city.jpg?itok=XjptimU5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metal-slug-tactics-city.jpg?itok=TjPH-JPZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Settin' up a sync with my boy Tarma.</figcaption></figure><p>Here's the rundown: players gain dodge the more they move, and gain even more damage mitigation if they position units behind cover. Ordering units to stay still will very likely end with their doom, since they're out in the open with no protection whatsoever. I'm constantly on the move in <em>Metal Slug Tactics</em>, since your units only have 10 HP.</p>

<p>This is a fresh concept and introduces challenges in a natural way. Constantly being on the move means you'll come across more enemies within range, so positioning is vital. So yes, maximizing your dodge and cover is essential, but so is the proximity of your own units to each other.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metal-slug-tactucs-vehicle.jpg?itok=PY9SxUdv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metal-slug-tactucs-vehicle.jpg?itok=cLGUwytM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You can drive a Metal Slug!</figcaption></figure><p>There are sync attacks that allow your units to attack units in unison, allowing you to deal more damage. This is something that <em>needs</em> to be used throughout or, even on the lowest difficulty, you'll run into trouble. So when we combine the damage mitigation mechanics (dodge and cover) with sync attacks, combat flows pretty well and is very fast-paced.</p>

<p>The more you move, the more adrenaline you get, as well. That's your primary resource to activate abilities unique to your character. Fio, for example, excels at buffing allies with shields, or she can even move enemy or friendly units around the battlefield to gain an advantage. Ally units definitely have their niche, so there's a range of support, DPS, and tank-like archetypes.</p>

<p>Units also stand out with a set of different loadouts, featuring different primary and secondary weapons, as well as abilities. So as you progress and unlock more and more with currency gained from missions, you can tune your team to a decent degree.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metal-slug-tactics-ui.jpg?itok=kPmz93m2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metal-slug-tactics-ui.jpg?itok=hRJIqpDh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This UI realllly isn't helping.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Metal Slug Tactics</em> Gets Lost in the Sauce</h2>

<p>I tried my best to explain the mechanics in a concise way, but <em>Metal Slug Tactics </em>is actually quite overwhelming, even for someone like me who is used to the genre. The intro frontloads all the mechanics in a short, five-minute or so tutorial. It's far too much information in such a short time, so the first few hours can feel like a struggle.</p>

<p>There are dozens of too-similar terms like "special action", "bonus action", "bonus move" and... <em>so</em> much more. The developers added a way to read more about highlighted terms, but these tutorials branch out into even more tutorials. It's truly a case of information overload.</p>

<p>It doesn't help that the user interface is exceedingly messy and disorganized. <em>Metal Slug Tactics</em> doesn't really help you learn to navigate through various menus to upgrade and unlock new gear, and it's displayed in a generally unpleasant and disjointed way -- this is both during and outside of combat.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metal-slug-tactics-stages.jpg?itok=41bEtT8p 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metal-slug-tactics-stages.jpg?itok=_AdxHwvv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Conquer up to three different zones, then make it to the final boss in the final area.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Metal Slug Tactics</em>: Part Strategy, Part Roguelite</h2>

<p>Let's address the elephant in the room: <em>Metal Slug Tactics</em> is a roguelite. At least, it incorporates roguelite elements into its gameplay, but it feels needlessly tacked on. This leads to a repetitive, RNG-fueled gameplay loop. I can't help but think that a linear campaign would have been a <em>much</em> better choice.</p>

<p>Here's how the roguelite elements come into play: <em>Metal Slug Tactics</em>' overworld is split into four separate regions, and you must complete at minimum one of three to move onto the final area. Within these regions are missions that grant a random pair of awards by completing a random set of objectives, up until the boss level spawns.</p>

<p>Levels are hand-crafted and not generated, so there's some decent level design that'll challenge players. Levels are generally compact in size, but those are usually exclusively for missions that task you with wiping out all enemies or eliminating certain targets. Those are the best missions, by the way.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metal-slug-tactics-boss.jpg?itok=b5ARS1nv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metal-slug-tactics-boss.jpg?itok=BdIxZmhk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>One of four bosses, and that's all you're getting.</figcaption></figure><p>If there's a mission that asks you to escort Rumi, run away and don't look back. Escort missions suck, and that's no different in <em>Metal Slug Tactics</em>. Rumi's AI is not great and enemies will kill her in no time, meaning you fail your entire run instantly.</p>

<p>There isn't a great deal of variety in objectives and maps are used over and over again, so you'll come across the same scenarios each and every run you make in <em>Metal Slug Tactics</em>. This creates a very repetitive gameplay loop that grows stale quite fast.</p>

<p>Adding even more repetition are bosses. There are only four bosses in <em>Metal Slug Tactics</em>, and no matter what difficulty you play on, they're basically the same fight. I'd get this impending feeling of dread knowing I would have to fight them at the end of the zone since these are easily the least enjoyable enemies to fight.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metal-slug-tactics-stages-1.jpg?itok=01bcsI64 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metal-slug-tactics-stages-1.jpg?itok=NP2p91iX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Choose your path wisely, as your rewards depend on it.</figcaption></figure><p>Throughout your run, you're able to gain mods to your weapons and level up your characters for new abilities, which makes things only a tad more engaging. There is an overabundance of passive abilities that all seem to be the same exact thing, perhaps because of how confusing the jargon is. As a result, abilities feel the same, and mods only slightly change the behavior of your weapons.</p>

<p>You're given a currency that can be used after each run to unlock more character abilities, weapon loadouts, and more, and that's <em>Metal Slug Tactics</em>' way of adding metaprogression. There's nothing super exciting about unlocking these since, again, most abilities and even weapons feel similar to one another. Unlocking new characters is fun, sure, but there is a limited roster.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metal-slug-tactics-story.jpg?itok=Mcvec5_z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metal-slug-tactics-story.jpg?itok=tKm6DxM0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There <em>is</em> a story in <em>Metal Slug Tactics, </em>but it is very much an afterthought.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Metal Slug Tactics</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>I also came across a surprising number of bugs during my time with <em>Metal Slug Tactics</em>. The most annoying was one that made me unable to use buttons on my controller for certain actions. Calling in a Metal Slug you can hop in and drive around is cool and all, but it sucks when doing so means I can't use my Xbox controller to fire or select abilities for the rest of the battle.</p>

<p>At one point during dialogue, I had to completely exit my game because, for whatever reason, it wouldn't let me progress. A funny glitch that was pretty consistent throughout my entire time playing was that reviving characters brings them back without their arms. It doesn't affect the gameplay, it just looks goofy.</p>

<p>While I'm critical of <em>Metal Slug Tactics</em>, it's still a fun game. Once you understand the obtuse mechanics and make your way into higher difficulties, there's some real strategy and planning required to succeed. Unfortunately, it doesn't change things up enough to stay consistently enjoyable, and the roguelite elements and the same four bosses are the chief offenders of this.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-sales-nintendo-financials<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has released its financial figures for the second quarter of the fiscal year, and they give us some interesting insights into how the company's games and hardware are doing as Switch 2 speculation ramps up.</p>

<p>According to Nintendo's financial report, net sales are down 34.3% this quarter compared to the same period last year, while operating profit is down a whopping 56.6%. In general, Nintendo's numbers aren't looking too great this quarter, but there's arguably a good reason for that.</p>

<p>Last year, Nintendo was riding high on the release of a new tentpole&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>game in&nbsp;<em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, which was a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-has-shipped-13246-million-units-tears-of-kingdom-sold-almost-20-million">phenomenal sales success</a> for the company. We're also getting closer to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation">news of the Switch 2</a>, and so many gamers are probably being cautious with regards to buying new hardware.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-nintendo-financials-combat.jpg?itok=8IwiAy2g 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-nintendo-financials-combat.jpg?itok=dU4Sp25p 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em>&nbsp;has done pretty well for Nintendo.</figcaption></figure><p>It could be argued that a new&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>game was also released within the operating period for this report, which ends on September 30th, but&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>isn't on the same budget and marketing scale as&nbsp;<em>Tears of the Kingdom&nbsp;</em>was.</p>

<p>Even still,&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>did pretty well for Nintendo, it seems. The financial report confirms that the game had sold 2.58 million units by the end of the operating period, which means it achieved that milestone within just four days.</p>

<p>Elsewhere,&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&nbsp;</em>sold 2.31 million units within the operating period, the&nbsp;<em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door&nbsp;</em>remake sold 1.94 million, and the&nbsp;<em>Luigi's Mansion 2&nbsp;</em>remaster sold 1.57 million.</p>

<p>Hardware sales dropped 31% year-on-year, although sales of the base Switch and its Lite model were actually slightly up. In general, it's probably not a surprise that Nintendo's numbers are down given its position in the market right now, although things are perhaps slightly more gloomy than the company expected.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-nintendo-financials.jpg?itok=V5CXkunB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-nintendo-financials.jpg?itok=wd_Xky3K 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door&nbsp;</em>hasn't sold too badly for Nintendo either.</figcaption></figure><p>Technically speaking, from a hardware perspective, sales increased from Q1 to Q2, but overall, on a six-monthly basis, hardware was down. Nintendo attributes this quarterly increase to a&nbsp;<em>Zelda</em>-themed Switch Lite bundle, as well as "releases of hardware bundled with software titles".</p>
