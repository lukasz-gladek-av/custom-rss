            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It looks like the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Pokopia&nbsp;</em>release date has been leaked ahead of a new trailer that's set to arrive for the cozy&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>life sim on Thursday.</p>

<p>As spotted by&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>news platform <a href="https://x.com/SerebiiNet/status/1988245459807113647" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Serebii</a>, what looks like a Japanese-language thumbnail for the upcoming trailer apparently reveals the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Pokopia&nbsp;</em>release date to be March 5th next year.</p>

<p>At time of writing, the front <a href="https://www.serebii.net/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">page</a> of Serebii's official website also confirms that the game's physical version will be a Game Key Card and will require 10GB of memory to install, so if you're planning on picking up&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Pokopia</em>, make sure you've got at least that much space.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-pokopia-release-date-leak-charmander.jpg?itok=H60ZkLFA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-pokopia-release-date-leak-charmander.jpg?itok=fxLNqQB5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It looks like the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Pokopia&nbsp;</em>release date may have been leaked.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that the Japanese release date for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Pokopia&nbsp;</em>may not be the same as its Western launch date, but simultaneous worldwide releases have been the norm for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>for a while now, so it's likely the game will launch around the world on the same day.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Pokopia&nbsp;</em>is, it's an upcoming&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>-themed&nbsp;life sim. Revealed during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-september-2025-recap" rel="nofollow">September's Nintendo Direct</a>, the game casts you as "a Ditto transformed into a human". It's up to you to "shape an empty land into a beautiful home for Pokemon".</p>

<p><em>Pokemon Pokopia&nbsp;</em>looks to resemble games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch-2-edition-free-update" rel="nofollow"><em>Animal Crossing</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Hello Kitty Island Adventure</em>, and HoYoverse's upcoming&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/petit-planet-preview-hoyoverses-foray-into-life-sims" rel="nofollow"><em>Petit Planet</em></a>. It'll feature Pokemon like Squirtle, Charmander, and Bulbasaur, and you'll be able to use their abilities to shape the world around you.</p>

<p>The game will serve as a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive, so if you want to check it out, you'll have to make the leap to Nintendo's new machine. Hey, at least you'll be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-financials-q1-2026" rel="nofollow">far from alone in doing so</a>!</p>




<p><em>Pokemon Pokopia&nbsp;</em>is set to arrive on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/pokemon-pokopia-switch-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch 2</a> on March 5th next year, assuming this Serebii leak is correct, of course. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Arc Raiders Sales Reach 4m in Less Than Two Weeks]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/arc-raiders-sales-4m</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders-sales-reach-4m-in-less-than-two-weeks.1349905/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Embark Studios has announced that its post-apocalyptic extraction shooter&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders&nbsp;</em>has passed a major sales milestone in less than two weeks.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://prtimes.jp/main/html/rd/p/000000421.000014847.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a> (which is entirely in Japanese, so we're using machine translation),&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders&nbsp;</em>sales have shot past four million, and the game seemingly continues to grow in popularity, too, having reached a record 700,000 concurrent users across all platforms this week.</p>

<p><em>Arc Raiders&nbsp;</em>is still the <a href="https://steamdb.info/stats/globaltopsellers/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">best-selling</a> piece of software on Steam at time of writing, too. The game is beating popular rivals like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dispatch-sales-1m-10-days" rel="nofollow">Telltale-style adventure&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dispatch-sales-1m-10-days" rel="nofollow">Dispatch</a>&nbsp;</em>and FPS&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-6-sales-7m" rel="nofollow">Battlefield 6</a>&nbsp;</em>to the (second from) top spot, something about which Embark is no doubt thrilled.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/arc-raiders-sales-4m-hiding.jpg?itok=m-kr2njn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/arc-raiders-sales-4m-hiding.jpg?itok=_0K8qbnf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Arc Raiders&nbsp;</em>is really making a name for itself.</figcaption></figure><p>It's an impressive feat for a game that has had a somewhat lengthy and complex development history. Originally revealed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-announcement-from-game-awards-2021" rel="nofollow">back in 2021</a>, Embark's game was originally intended to be a co-op third-person shooter set for release in 2022, but it was subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/arc-raiders-delay-pushes-release-date-to-2023" rel="nofollow">delayed into 2023</a>.</p>

<p>Following that delay, Embark revealed that the game's scope had been changed, and that it would now be a PvPvE extraction shooter along the lines of&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov&nbsp;</em>or Bungie's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shocking-no-one-bungies-marathon-delayed" rel="nofollow">upcoming&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>reboot</a>.</p>

<p>The game was released on October 30th to a positive reception, although it garnered some criticism for its use of generative AI to create some voice lines (and it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/examining-generative-ais-usage-in-steam-next-fest-2025" rel="nofollow">far from the only game</a> on Steam to use that technology).</p>

<p><em>Arc Raiders&nbsp;</em>sees players descending into a post-apocalyptic landscape in order to do battle with both lethal ARC machines and roving squads of other players, gathering loot and attempting to survive until extraction.</p>




<p>If you're interested in giving&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders&nbsp;</em>a go, you can pick it up right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1808500/ARC_Raiders/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/arc-raiders/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/arc-raiders/9ndf1f263rz4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> (and it sounds like now really is the time to do so, judging by the size of the player base). Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sony Sales Up but Income Down as Bungie and Destiny 2 Disappoint]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-q2-2025-26-destiny-2-bungie</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-sales-up-but-income-down-as-bungie-and-destiny-2-disappoint.1349902/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has released its financial statement for the second quarter of the 2025-26 fiscal year, and it looks like Bungie and&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2&nbsp;</em>aren't doing the business the Japanese tech giant had hoped for on acquisition.</p>

<p>As revealed in Sony's <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/25q2_sonypre.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">latest financial presentation</a>, sales in the company's gaming sector increased by 4% when compared to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-financials-q1-2025" rel="nofollow">previous quarter</a>, but operating income fell by 13% across the same period, and Sony puts this down largely to "impairment losses" relating to&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2&nbsp;</em>and Bungie.</p>

<p>In an accompanying <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/25q2_sonyspeech.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">document</a>, Sony says that&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>'s "sales and user engagement" haven't reached "the expectations [Sony] had at the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-is-acquiring-destiny-2-developer-bungie" rel="nofollow">time of the acquisition of Bungie</a>". The publisher therefore "downwardly revised" its "business projection" as a result of this underperformance.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/destiny-2-bungie-sony-financials-q2-2025.jpg?itok=kxbQ7xl6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/destiny-2-bungie-sony-financials-q2-2025.jpg?itok=XSw5znDZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Destiny 2&nbsp;</em>hasn't proven the golden goose Sony apparently hoped it would be.</figcaption></figure><p>Sony contrasts&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>'s disappointing performance with that of&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>, which it says is performing "extremely well", with sales of the game "significantly increas[ing]" due both to its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-xbox-series-xs-august" rel="nofollow">release on Xbox Series X|S</a> and "increased engagement from existing users on PS5 and PC".</p>

<p><em>Ghost of Yotei</em>, which was released in October, has apparently already surpassed the three-million sales mark as well, which makes it "a major hit like its predecessor", according to Sony.</p>

<p>Exactly why&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;Bungie have disappointed Sony isn't clear from this presentation, but the game's player numbers have <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1085660/charts/#6m" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">plummeted</a> in recent months (although it is worth noting that the game hasn't received a major expansion since July).</p>

<p>This will almost certainly be making Sony anxious about&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>, Bungie's next major project, which still doesn't have a release date after being <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shocking-no-one-bungies-marathon-delayed" rel="nofollow">delayed indefinitely back in June</a>.</p>




<p>That decision was made following the revelation that some of the artwork in&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-marathon-art-stolen" rel="nofollow">had been stolen</a> from an online artist, as well as the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marathon-director-fired-report-bungie" rel="nofollow">firing of the game's director</a> last spring after he was hit with misconduct allegations.</p>

<p>Despite Sony's disappointment in Bungie and&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>, the company says that over 40% of its revenue this quarter came from live-service games, so this isn't likely to mark a return to single-player shooters on Bungie's part. Stay tuned for more.</p>
