She was sure of it. The huge monster of a man wielding a machete had hacked Ranger Sandy to pieces right in front of her eyes, and she had been running for what felt like hours ever since. Even if they had survived, they wouldn't have left her. Would they? She had heard the car start, and she did wonder why the others had sent her a different way to the car. Maybe they would come back for her once they had found a safe place to hide? Hopefully, before that killer found her.</em></p>

<p>Welcome to <em>Don't Look Back 2nd Edition</em>! We covered the original <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dont-look-back-core-game-review" rel="nofollow">Don't Look Back</a></em> box set a few years ago, and recently we covered the awesome <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/hametsu-core-rulebook-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Hametsu</em></a>, also by Black Site Studios.</p>



<p><i>Don't Look Back </i>is a horror miniatures tabletop game that can be played cooperatively against an AI-controlled killer, or with the latest edition, a player can take control of the killer and try to slay their friends. The 1st edition of the game released in 2021, which you can read our review of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dont-look-back-core-game-review" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and the 2nd edition update is essentially the same, but with a lot more content in the rulebook.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dont-look-back-2nd-ed-2.jpg?itok=iQw3udLo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dont-look-back-2nd-ed-2.jpg?itok=6zXylbO6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Don't Look Back</em> captures the horror genre superbly with its mechanics [Photo credit: Black Site Studio].</figcaption></figure><h2>What Is The Difference Between The Don't Look Back 1st and 2nd Edition Rulebooks?</h2>

<p>The core rules for <em>Don't Look Back</em> are the same as they were in the 1st edition, with a focus on the layout and presentation of the rules to make them as clear as possible. What the 2nd Edition <em>Don't Look Back</em> core rulebook now contains is a lot more options and background, which includes:</p>

<ul><li>2 new characters (on top of the 6 original 1st edition)</li>
	<li>Rules for randomly generating your own plots&nbsp;(in addition to the five classic&nbsp;core plots)</li>
	<li>Optional rules for vehicles&nbsp;and companions</li>
	<li>Trilogies - Originally a separate book, the new rulebook includes these rules for creating a series of 3 linked games</li>
	<li>Final Call - The 2nd edition core rulebook includes rules for creating your own character, playing as the killer, and also running the game as a games master</li>
	<li>Pack Hunt - It also includes the rules for including multiple killers, and hordes of enemies in your games</li>
	<li>Large background section - The book includes a lot of background, maps, and images on North Wood to help you flesh out your games</li>
	<li>Two complete trilogies - It also includes 2 complete sets of 3 linked adventures, Visions and Corporate Casualties</li>

<p>The core rules for <i>Don't Look Back</i> are very simple, which is essential for a narrative and theme-driven game as it allows you to focus on what's going on, rather than flipping back and forth through a rulebook, ruining the immersion.</p>

<p>With each turn in <em>Don't Look Back</em>, fright tokens are generated to represent noises, shadows, and eerie effects. The killer can randomly appear from fight tokens, or they might just generate terror for nearby characters. When characters gain terror points, they increase the movement and combat skill of the killer targeting that character, and also reduce a character's rolls, making it more difficult to achieve tasks. If a character ever has double the amount of terror points of their fright value, they are removed from the game, succumbing to panic.</p>

<p>During the game, players need to complete the scenario objective while avoiding the killer and controlling the terror points on their character. Players do this each turn by working together to search areas and removing fright tokens by investigating and shining light tokens on them. They can also lure the killer to an area to allow other characters the freedom to search with the 7 Minutes in Heaven action with another consenting character, in a true horror trope.</p>

<p>As with all miniatures games, you will need a few items on top of the <i>Don't Look Back</i> core rulebook to play:</p>

<ul><li>Three types of dice (D20s, D10s and D6s)</li>
	<li>A measuring tool</li>
	<li>A 3x3 playing area with an assortment of terrain</li>
	<li>A miniature to represent The Killer</li>
	<li>A hero/character miniature for each player</li>
</ul><p><em>Don't Look Back</em> is a miniatures agnostic system, which means you can use any miniatures from any system you want to represent the killer and characters, but <a href="https://blacksitestudio.com/en-gb/pages/dlb" rel="nofollow">Black Site Studios</a> have a whole range of killers (and their rules) and character miniatures, along with scenery that's perfect for the North Wood setting.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dont-look-back-2nd-ed-4.jpg?itok=ZsM24WHh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dont-look-back-2nd-ed-4.jpg?itok=OLz716zH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Black Site Studios have a multipart Killer miniature to create the enemy you want for<em> Don't Look Back</em>&nbsp;[Photo credit: Black Site Studio].</figcaption></figure><h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On Don't Look Back 2nd Edition?</h2>

<p>We loved <i>Don't Look Back </i>1st edition, it's simple rules let you explore the theme very well without distracting, allowing full immersion. The mechanics complimented the theme perfectly, and nothing has changed in this edition, other than giving you a huge amount of content in a single book. Everything that made <em>Don't Look Back</em> great is still there, only now there's more of it. The added scenario generator, character generator, and ability to play as the killer, or run it with a GM make this an incredibly varied system with a huge amount of replayability, built of a simple set of core mechanics that get it done.</p>

<h2>Should I Buy Don't Look Back 2nd Edition?</h2>

<p>Even if you own the first edition of <em>Don't Look Back</em>, this updated rulebook has a huge amount of content, all between the same covers to stop you from carrying multiple books around. It's all presented better, with a great opening chapter on the setting and the North Wood area. If you're not a horror fan though, then you won't find much else in <em>Don't Look Back</em> as it's entirely built around the theme.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideo-kojima-od-physint-strikes</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hideo-kojima-says-upcoming-projects-od-and-physint-heavily-impacted-by-strikes.1071807/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideo-kojima-od-physint-strikes<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Metal Gear&nbsp;</em>and <i>Death Stranding&nbsp;</i>creator Hideo Kojima has provided a year-end update on his upcoming projects, currently codenamed&nbsp;<em>OD&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Physint</em>, and it sounds like SAG strikes heavily impacted both games.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1873951232764895628" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post on social media platform X</a>, Kojima says that during 2024,&nbsp;his studio Kojima Productions "developed [<em>OD</em>] and had actor and environment scanning", but that during the second half of the year, "scanning and filming were suspended due to the SAG strike".</p>

<p>Of&nbsp;<em>Physint</em>, Kojima says that "casting was also suspended" for the game owing to the strike. It sounds like&nbsp;<em>Physint&nbsp;</em>is currently a lot earlier in development than&nbsp;<em>OD</em>, which makes sense given that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideo-kojima-announces-new-game-od-in-partnership-with-xbox-and-filmmaker-jordan-peele" rel="nofollow">the latter has an official trailer</a> (albeit a brief one) and the former <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideo-kojima-announces-next-generation-espionage-action-game" rel="nofollow">does not</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hideo-kojima-games-impacted-strikes-od.jpg?itok=DLlPabeQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hideo-kojima-games-impacted-strikes-od.jpg?itok=OptHfXK5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hideo Kojima's upcoming games&nbsp;<em>OD&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Physint&nbsp;</em>have been impacted by strikes this year.</figcaption></figure><p>In case you're not aware, Kojima is likely referring to the July SAG-AFTRA strike, which saw voice actors and mocap artists going on strike after negotations regarding generative AI protections broke down.</p>

<p>The strike is technically still ongoing; at time of writing, <a href="https://aftermath.site/sag-aftra-video-game-voice-actor-strike-the-game-awards-2024" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">no overarching agreement</a> has been reached, although a number of gaming companies have signed agreements with SAG in order to protect its members from generative AI exploitation.</p>

<p>Indeed, in Kojima's message, he says that he and his studio "hope to resume next year", which evidently means that the filming, capture, and casting processes haven't restarted for either&nbsp;<em>OD&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Physint</em>.</p>

<p>Kojima also recaps the rest of his year in the message, as well as providing an update on the upcoming live-action&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>film, which is being produced in conjunction with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-movie-a24" rel="nofollow">movie production company A24</a>. He says preparations for the movie, as well as "other adaptations", are underway.</p>

<p>Kojima's message also comes just under two months after the surprise Xbox release of the original&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding</em>, which also saw Kojima Productions <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-xbox-release-kojima-ip" rel="nofollow">acquiring the rights to the IP</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1337100/view/523078230806103089" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an announcement post on Steam</a>, Carbon says that it's delisting the game "as our license reaches its conclusion", and that it'll no longer be available on any storefront. That means you won't be able to buy it on Steam, Meta, or Viveport.</p>

<p><em>Tempestfall&nbsp;</em>will first be removed from Steam on January 10th, which is also when support for the game on that platform will be rescinded. Carbon says the timeline for delisting on Meta and Viveport is "still under review" and that an update will be provided "as soon as more information becomes available".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-tempestfall-delisted-skeleton.jpg?itok=gchsYOoK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-tempestfall-delisted-skeleton.jpg?itok=NKFe6LmA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar: Tempestfall&nbsp;</em>will soon...well...fall.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that you'll still be able to play the game on your chosen platform if you've already bought it; as is usually the case with delisting, you simply won't be able to buy <i>Tempestfall&nbsp;</i>if you don't already own it.</p>

<p>Carbon says it understands that news of&nbsp;<em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar: Tempestfall</em>'s delisting "may come as a disappointment". It sounds like the studio had no choice but to pull the game from stores since the license holders (likely Games Workshop in this case) were unwilling to renew said license.</p>

<p><em>Tempestfall&nbsp;</em>isn't the only game based on a major fantasy license being pulled from stores soon.&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance&nbsp;</em>is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dungeons-dragons-dark-alliance-delisted-february" rel="nofollow">also making its exit from digital storefronts</a> in February, although I imagine that's probably less sad news than&nbsp;<em>Tempestfall</em>'s demise for many.</p>

<p>To combat games being delisted and support being removed from said games, digital storefront GOG recently launched its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gog-preservation-program-warcraft-delisting" rel="nofollow">Preservation Program</a>, which guarantees that any game belonging to the Program will be supported forever, regardless of whether its developers or publishers support it.</p>

<p>If you want to buy <i>Warhammer Age of Sigmar: Tempestfall&nbsp;</i>before it's delisted, you can do so via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1337100/Warhammer_Age_of_Sigmar_Tempestfall/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/pcvr/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-tempestfall/4617889574904734/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Meta</a>, or <a href="https://www.viveport.com/apps/8e1e49fc-e4df-4c3e-8387-df8cca8a8890?hl=en-US&amp;srsltid=AfmBOoq3HWS0qANSe2mG4MZJk1fg5WhBIm24ZN04WPak9As-Q9oUaIjK" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Viveport</a> right now.

            <title><![CDATA[Legless in London Brings Accessible Victorian Ambition]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/legless-in-london-brings-accessible-victorian-ambition</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/legless-in-london-brings-accessible-victorian-ambition.1071624/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/legless-in-london-brings-accessible-victorian-ambition<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new board game is bringing more visibility to the disabled community. Focus Games has partnered with an accomplished humanities professor to produce <em>Legless in London</em>, a board game about playing as an amputee in Victorian London.</p>

<h2>The <em>Legless in London</em> Announcement</h2>

<p>According to the game's <a href="https://www.leglessinlondon.com/" rel="nofollow">official page</a>, <em>Legless in London</em> is a nuanced board game about disability.</p>

<p>It is a game where players face challenges, opportunities, and choices at every turn. They will navigate the workplace, the marriage market, property ownership, medicine, and the prosthesis market while aiming to achieve their character's personal goals.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/legless-in-london-character-card.jpg?itok=KiLoYxbx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/legless-in-london-character-card.jpg?itok=G8FuaE5x 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The playable characters in Legless in London are all inspired by Victorian amputees and fictional characters from 19th-century literature. Everyone from beloved poet William Ernest Henley to <em>Moby Dick's</em> Captain Ahab are represented here.</p>

<p>In addition to being designed for fun, Legless in London encourages players to think about the various barriers that disabled people face in real life and the different hurdles they confront. Furthermore, the designers hope players will reflect on how disabled people are represented in fiction and popular culture.</p>

<p><em>Legless in London</em> was designed in collaboration with Focus Games and Dr. Ryan Sweet, a Senior Lecturer in Humanities at Swansea University, alongside a focus group of members of the disabled community.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Disability and disability history are underrepresented in culture—and especially in tabletop gaming. Many mainstream tabletop games also present accessibility problems for disabled players (for example, wordy and/or complex rules, which can be troublesome for neurodivergent users). Legless in London addresses both representational and accessibility concerns as it provides a balanced, researched-informed, positive, and fun portrayal of disability in an inclusive format.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That consideration for disability also extends to the game's design. It will launch with a smartphone app, providing a digital alternative to the game's physical components including dice rolls, event cards, health tracker, and in-game money.</p>

<p>As for the physical components, the game will ship with large accessible font text, screen reader-friendly resources, easy-read rules, and more.</p>

<p><em>Legless in London</em> will launch in February 2025.</p>
