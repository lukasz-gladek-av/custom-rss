            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Quite a few survival crafting games take place in a tropical setting, and they each have their own spin on the formula — whether it's aiming for realism or leaning more toward a fantasy adventure. In this&nbsp;<em>Voyagers of Nera</em>&nbsp;preview, I'll go over the good (and the bad) of this latest survival crafting experience from Treehouse Games.</p>

<p><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="733ce2a9-3d2e-4af6-88be-c6f61d51c3a1" href="https://techraptor.net/games/voyagers-of-nera" rel="nofollow"><em>Voyagers of Nera</em></a>&nbsp;is the first title from Treehouse Games, a remote-first game developer. Players take on the role of an "Echo," a long-dormant guardian who has awoken to a world in chaos. Now, it's up to you and your friends to rescue lost spirits and defeat monstrous creatures of all sizes across the land.</p>

<p><em>Voyagers of Nera</em>&nbsp;is fairly light on story, at least in its Early Access launch version. You've been hibernating for a long time, and the world has gone to hell in a handbasket in your absence; now it's up to you to rescue lost <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="534397b6-4f38-40c6-ae79-440c3d125e7c" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/voyagers-of-nera-spirits-guide-locations-and-unlocks" rel="nofollow">"Guide Spirits"</a> and set things right.</p>

<p>The first hour or so of&nbsp;<em>Voyagers of Nera</em>&nbsp;is standard fare for a survival crafting game tutorial; you learn basic movement and combat as you rescue a Guide Spirit from enemies. Once that's done, you emerge from the temple to find yourself on a beach with a massive stone arm lying in the distance — welcome to The Embrace.</p>

<p>Your first step is to <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="56fa317b-b55f-42a0-9cbf-d09be5ab7c39" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/voyagers-of-nera-crafting-guide" rel="nofollow">craft</a> some basic tools and build a <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="be6a37b3-059c-47bf-8104-2c8465fec5ab" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/voyagers-of-nera-spirit-anchor-guide" rel="nofollow">Spirit Anchor</a>. The Spirit Anchor is a massive stone monument that protects the area around <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3851694e-9f68-40f0-81ae-37d0afb04802" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/voyagers-of-nera-building-guide" rel="nofollow">your base</a> and gives rescued Guide Spirits a safe haven from the forces of darkness.

<p>The Early Access launch version of&nbsp;<em>Voyagers of Nera</em>&nbsp;has <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="695708b2-0456-4bfc-aca7-983b8bff8b6b" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/voyagers-of-nera-map-and-locations-guide" rel="nofollow">a map</a> that is split into three distinctive regions: The Embrace, The Reef, and The Greatwood. These areas are separated by masses of rocks known as "The Deep," filled with a corrupting aura and stalked by a massive sea monster that can tear you to pieces.</p>

<p>You can travel from island to island within a region by running, swimming, or using a <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="02803ce6-aafd-4617-8ce2-79760299d79c" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/how-to-get-skimmer-in-voyagers-of-nera" rel="nofollow">Skimmer</a>&nbsp;(which is essentially a magical surfboard), but you'll almost certainly need a proper boat to travel between the major regions.</p>

<p>Both of the available <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fe7167a1-adba-4d35-bc38-08e684a14e7e" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/how-to-get-boat-in-voyagers-of-nera" rel="nofollow">boats</a> are fairly large, and it can be difficult to navigate some of the tighter waterways. It's especially challenging to use a boat as a solo player since you'll need to raise the sail to gain speed and then move to the rudder to steer it. It appears that the bigger boats are intended to be piloted by a crew of two people.</p>

<p>Fortunately, you only really <em>need</em>&nbsp;boats for traveling between regions or moving large amounts of cargo; you can get by traveling within a region using your Skimmer and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6e1baf40-feae-4feb-a2a1-0a7c3829dbba" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/how-to-get-glider-in-voyagers-of-nera" rel="nofollow">glider</a>. Still, it would have been nice to have a larger boat with some cargo space that could be piloted by a solo player more easily.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/voyagers-of-nera-preview-fighting-a-construct-in-ruins-in-voyagers-of-nera.jpg?itok=_YVXYzdw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/voyagers-of-nera-preview-fighting-a-construct-in-ruins-in-voyagers-of-nera.jpg?itok=E1jmxzW8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Each region has 3 ruins that must explore to free a fragment of an Elder Spirit, usually by defeating a "Construct" in combat.</figcaption></figure><h2>Swimming in Circles</h2>

<p>However you travel, your ultimate goal is to rescue the Guide Spirits of the world one by one. Each rescued Guide Spirit powers up your base just a little more, allowing you to use new crafting stations to better equip you for the more difficult zones.</p>

<p>You can explore the world to find Guide Spirits on your own. You'll get a warning message that a nearby spirit is in danger when you're close, but it can be difficult to find them sometimes. Fortunately, the Spirit Anchor can be used to point you to a Guide Spirit in the region that you have not yet rescued.</p>

<p>Regrettably, it appears that the Spirit Anchor can only point you to one unrescued Guide Spirit at a time, and that results in a somewhat predictable gameplay loop: find a Guide Spirit, rescue it, return home, and use the Spirit Anchor to find the location of the next Guide Spirit to rescue.</p>

<p>Your quest to rescue the Guide Spirits is dragged out by a lack of useful fast travel. You can build an <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="35964fa7-4053-43a1-87dc-1661b562379a" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/voyagers-of-nera-ancients-gate-guide" rel="nofollow">Ancient's Gate</a> to easily travel between two bases, but you can only have a handful of bases total. As far as I can tell, there is no item to quickly teleport you back to your base in the game yet, either.</p>

<p>There isn't much preventing you from building a boat and sailing all the way to the last region, although that's ill-advised; as you might expect, enemies get progressively tougher as you move to each subsequent region. You can't rescue most Guide Spirits if you're not equipped to kill the enemies holding them hostage.</p>

<p>You're also limited to only one base until you level up your Spirit Anchor. Currently, you're limited to a maximum of four Spirit Anchors; that's just enough for one base in each region, plus a spare. You can build wherever you like, but the functionality of a base is hamstrung without the multitude of buffs a Spirit Anchor provides.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Although Voyagers of Nera's world is fairly wide, it feels seomwhat shallow with a lack of side activities for you to take on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The meat of the game is rescuing Guide Spirits, leveling up your Knowledge Tree to craft more gear, and eventually progressing to more difficult regions. Each region introduces new enemies and new obstacles for you to face, so there's a serviceable amount of variety in the combat challenges you'll encounter.</p>

<p>That said, there isn't much beyond the core gameplay loop of alternating between rescuing Guide Spirits and crafting better gear. Although <i>Voyagers of Nera's</i>&nbsp;world is fairly wide, it feels somewhat shallow with a lack of side activities for you to take on.</p>

<p>I enjoyed my time exploring the world of&nbsp;<em>Voyagers of Nera</em>. I had fun exploring the islands and rescuing Guide Spirits, but the lack of things to do between those core gameplay objectives made it feel a little light on meaningful, engaging content.</p>

<p><em>Voyagers of Nera</em>&nbsp;could be a great survival game once it has matured a bit, expanded on its features, and added a little more variety in its gameplay. Unless you're dead set on playing it, it's probably best to hold off on playing this game&nbsp;until it has a couple of major content updates under its belt.</p>

<hr><p><strong>Voyagers of Nera</strong><em>&nbsp;was previewed over approximately 99 hours of gameplay on PC via&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2686630/Voyagers_of_Nera/" rel="nofollow">Steam</a>&nbsp;with a key provided by the publisher.

            <title><![CDATA[Sega Playfully Revives Nintendo Rivalry in New Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Trailer]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sega-sonic-racing-crossworlds-ad-nintendo</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sega-playfully-revives-nintendo-rivalry-in-new-sonic-racing-crossworlds-trailer.1299105/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega has released a brand new trailer for&nbsp;<em>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</em>, and it contains some not-so-subtle jabs at racing rival&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>, as well as Sega's general history of rivalry with Nintendo.</p>

<p>In the trailer (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/sega-references-its-past-feud-with-nintendo-in-shady-ad-comparing-sonic-racing-crossworlds-and-mario-kart-world/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Automaton Media</a>), we see a TV, on which a heavily pixelated kart racing game is being played. It's pretty obviously&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>, and the camera quickly pans to a much more sophisticated TV, on which&nbsp;<em>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds&nbsp;</em>appears.</p>

<p>Quickly, the&nbsp;<em>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds&nbsp;</em>TV is attached to a sleek, speedy racing car, while the&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>TV, as seemingly befits its low-tech status, is hitched to a juddering RV. Just in case you needed some extra help, the RV is pictured next to a tortoise.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sonic-racing-crossworlds-ad-rv.jpg?itok=BvrNJDPW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sonic-racing-crossworlds-ad-rv.jpg?itok=haSK0OWi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The new&nbsp;<em>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</em>&nbsp;ad isn't exactly subtle.</figcaption></figure><p>The ad closes with an invitation to players to "come race on our level", and in the trailer's description, Sega recommends players "leave the open road behind", which seems to me to be a pretty obvious jab at&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-nintendo-direct" rel="nofollow">open...well, world</a>.</p>

<p>It seems that Sega is poking fun at the old rivalry between itself and Nintendo, which primarily existed throughout the fourth and fifth console generations (and, partially, the sixth, before the Dreamcast sank without a trace and the PS2 ascended into the heavens).</p>

<p>It's the beef that gave rise to the legendary "Genesis does what Nintendon't" slogan, and while there's nothing quite so direct on offer here, it's fun to see Sega back to its old prickly self, even if it is just for a few moments.</p>

<p>You can check out the playful and fun new&nbsp;<em>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds&nbsp;</em>ad right here. Just don't write any hate mail to Sega about how Nintendo is clearly better (or vice versa) once you're done, OK?</p>




<p><i>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds&nbsp;</i>is due to launch for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2486820/Sonic_Racing_CrossWorlds/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/sonic-racing-crossworlds/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/sonic-racing-crossworlds/9NMR17QTLC33" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/sonic-racing-crossworlds-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> on September 25th, and a release for Switch 2 is also planned for this year. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/valheim-coming-to-playstation-5-next-year-crossplay-confirmed.1299048/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Valheim&nbsp;</em>developer Iron Gate Studios has announced that its Viking survival game is heading to PlayStation 5 sometime next year, and what's more, it'll fully support crossplay as well.</p>

<p>This news was revealed in <a href="https://valheim.com/news/valheim-is-coming-to-playstation-/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a blog post</a> on the game's official website, where Iron Gate also announces that it's collaborating with support studio Piktiv (which also helped out with the PC Game Pass and Microsoft Store versions of the game) for the PS5 release.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Iron Gate doesn't disclose a release date for the PS5 version of&nbsp;<em>Valheim</em>, but the studio does say that Piktiv's work will allow it to "continue to focus on developing the Deep North and 1.0", so perhaps the PlayStation 5 launch will coincide with one of those updates.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/valheim-playstation-5-2026.jpg?itok=rZKbM5ZF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/valheim-playstation-5-2026.jpg?itok=3NWEYxV9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Valheim&nbsp;</em>is making its way to PS5 next year.</figcaption></figure><p>The Deep North biome may not be ready for primetime yet, but&nbsp;<em>Valheim</em>&nbsp;did receive a fairly major update in the form of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/892970/view/529856925490219058" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Call to Arms</a> last week. It brought numerous changes to combat and Forsaken Powers, as well as new trinkets, new creatures, and more.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Valheim</em>, it's an open-world survival-crafter set in the titular Norse realm, which is an invention created specifically for the game. Together with your friends (or solo if you dare), you must prove to Odin that you're fit to join him in the halls of Valhalla.</p>

<p>To do so, you'll need to carve out a life for yourself in the realm of Valheim, slaying its various denizens and surviving by gathering the resources you find across its varied biomes. You'll be crafting weapons, exploring the world around you, and taking advantage of the game's "flexible building system" to construct bases.</p>




<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Valheim&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/892970/Valheim/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/valheim-game-preview/9ncbl78cg9n7" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and it's also available as part of a Game Pass subscription. The game is due to land on PS5 sometime next year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Only a few months after the lackluster ending of<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c9d86c47-b86e-43a2-bfe0-a023f6d37eee" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-story-attempting-to-hit-word-limit" rel="nofollow"><em> Assassin's Creed Shadows</em></a>, it's time for us to return to Japan again for the<em> Claws of Awaji DLC</em> with a continuation of Naoe and Yasuke's story. With the promises of a new island, a new story, and a new weapon, was it worth it to hop back into <em>Shadows </em>for one more adventure?</p>

<p>The story of the <em>Claws of Awaji</em> opens with a mysterious message from Hattori Hanzo about a puppetmaster telling the story of an assassin that travelled to the island of Awaji with a hidden blade on her arm. Still on the hunt for her mother, Naoe begins her investigation of the island to try to confirm whether this mysterious assassin is indeed Tsuyu.</p>

<p>I was a big fan of the beginning of <em>Claws of Awaji</em>. A brief amount of time spent on the mainland with an emotional setup for Naoe and a good reason for you to visit the island. That, coupled with the linear storytelling, made it clear that there was more focus and direction.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-puppet-show.jpg?itok=aJfBQWFW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-puppet-show.jpg?itok=9qmfU8Zx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Playing the puppeteer's story was a nice addition</figcaption></figure><h2>A Story That's Good For A Bit… Until It Isn't</h2>

<p>These first few missions are a focused experience with a mix of missions you can play as Naoe or Yasuke, or character-specific missions where you hop between the two. This also lent to the strength of this DLC. I appreciated the linear nature of the story and how there were valid reasons for why I might approach a mission with Yasuke instead of Naoe.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, after about an hour of this more refined experience, the DLC took a page from the base game. After identifying your primary target, you then identify their primary lieutenants and characters who support the lieutenants. From there, you're dropped into the open world, working on your hit list from the bottom to the top.</p>

<p>All of that sense of direction, narrative, and progression flew out the window as I was just checking off boxes on my to-do list. Each major milestone, I'd look forward to some big enhancement of the plot, only to be met with additional newly revealed subordinates that were a horse ride and a quick assassination away.</p>

There can be no references or callbacks to defeating a different powerful enemy, because there's no way to know if the player has experienced that yet. The alternative would be planning for every permutation, but the amount of additional work that would be required for that just wouldn't make sense.</p>

<p>Another aspect of the full game that this DLC also carries forward with is a lack of a worthwhile resolution. Much like how the base game just… ends, this DLC does the same. I don't want to spoil the plot, but the resolution felt more like a reminder that there was more to do in the open world rather than reaching the conclusion of a major milestone in a story.</p>

<h2>A Boss Battle Head And Shoulders Above The Rest</h2>

<p>The standout setpiece from this DLC is the boss fight against an antagonistic shinobi. Set in a mysterious arena with trapped statues meant to look like your foe, you complete this boss battle by hunting after the sounds of your opponent, creeping up on them, and chipping away at their health.</p>

As a player you're pushed to not rely on stats or what the best weapon in your arsenal is, but instead the stereo audio, keeping an eye out for traps, and watching for your target.</p>

<p>This was an incredible boss battle from start to finish and really showed off the 'Assassin' aspect of <em>Assassin's Creed</em>.</p>

<h2>A New Weapon For Technical Fighting</h2>

<p>In addition to the new adventure, the <em>Claws of Awaji DLC</em> also introduces a new weapon for Naoe. A core aspect of the combat in <em>Shadows</em> is down to not just attacking your opponents, but also reading their movements.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The new Bo weapon takes this a step further by providing you with a weapon where you can attack in a basic combo with light hits, but also very selectively use heavy attacks to push enemies back, attack them high to stun them, or drop low to take them out at their feet.</p>

There's a lot more to think about in terms of movement and strategy, but it does mean that when you do successfully read your opponent and pull off a technical play it can be very satisfying.</p>



<p>I think the best way that I can summarize my experience with <em>Claws of Awaji</em> is that it is a very faithful continuation of the base game. That means that the portions of the game when it's the strongest, like when the narrative can be focused or leaning into stealth, really shine.</p>

<p>Alternatively, the vast open world and "complete it in whatever order you want" mission style weakens the overall narrative, which is really what a lot of people come to an <em>Assassin's Creed</em> game for. A story that should have narratively wrapped up two of the largest plot threads from the original game with a bang, just ended up fizzling out…</p>

<p>If you were a fan of<em> Assassin's Creed Shadows</em> then you'll likely enjoy the ~8-hour experience that is <em>Claws of Awaji</em>. Otherwise,&nbsp;you'll likely want to let this DLC pass you by.</p>
