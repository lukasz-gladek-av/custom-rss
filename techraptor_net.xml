            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-version-1-5-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has announced the release date for&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 1.5, and it'll include an in-game concert for you to attend, plus two new S-rank characters to recruit and more.</p>

<p>The concert will take place to mark the new year and will see Astra Yao performing at the "iconic" Starloop landmark in New Eridu. However, all is not as it seems, and there's a conspiracy brewing that may threaten Astra.</p>

<p>Naturally, Astra Yao is one of the two new S-rank Agents you can recruit in&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 1.5. She's an Ether Support Agent who can provide damage bonuses to your squad, and she's also the game's "first healing character", with her Ultimate restoring HP to your team.</p>

She's a Fire Attack Agent who can unleash a Chain Attack by herself, so she's a pretty powerful addition to your lineup.</p>

<p>In addition to the above two characters, you can also expect reruns of Ellen and Qingyi in Version 1.5's banners, as well as a new S-rank Banbgoo in the form of Snap, which comes complete with a camera.</p>

<p>Version 1.5 also brings with it new minigames, including a new parkour-based arcade game by the name of Mach 25, which allows you to "race with various vehicles". Plenty of other new gameplay changes and features are coming in Version 1.5 too, so make sure you add January 22nd to your calendar.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero</em>, it's part of HoYoverse's live-service gacha RPG lineup, alongside&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/genshin-impact" rel="nofollow">Genshin Impact</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/honkai-star-rail" rel="nofollow">Honkai: Star Rail</a>&nbsp;</em>(and also&nbsp;<em>Honkai Impact 3rd</em>).</p>

<p>The game is more overtly action-oriented than its stablemates, and it's less fantasy-inspired too, taking place in an urban setting reminiscent of the likes of&nbsp;<em>Persona&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Jet Set Radio</em>.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>right now for free on <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/en-us/main" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices</a>. Version 1.5 lands on January 22nd.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-sales-200k<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Dragami Games has announced that&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw RePop&nbsp;</em>sales have passed a new milestone almost four months after the remaster's initial release.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Dragami_Games/status/1877626459386212769" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on social media platform X (for which we're using machine translation), Dragami confirms that&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw RePop&nbsp;</em>has sold over 200,000 copies worldwide since its release on September 12th.</p>

<p>While it's true those aren't exactly sales on the level of triple-A hits like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-9m" rel="nofollow">Resident Evil 4</a>&nbsp;</em>or indie smashes like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-hit-3-5m" rel="nofollow"><em>Balatro</em></a>, <i>Lollipop Chainsaw RePop&nbsp;</i>is a remastered version of an already-niche action game from 2012, so 200,000 isn't a bad figure at all to reach.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-sales-combat.jpg?itok=0zu3GJbv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-sales-combat.jpg?itok=Lku5SkXH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Lollipop Chainsaw RePop&nbsp;</em>has hit the 200,000 sales mark.</figcaption></figure><p>The&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw&nbsp;</em>remaster was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lollipop-chainsaw-remake-as-close-as-possible-to-original-say-devs" rel="nofollow">announced as a remake</a> back in 2022, with producer Yoshimi Yasuda assuring fans at that point that the game would remain "as close as possible" to the original.</p>

<p>It was officially named&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw RePop&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lollipop-chainsaw-remake-officially-titled-lollipop-chainsaw-repop-delayed-to-2024" rel="nofollow">the following year</a>, at which point its release was also pushed back to 2024. Following that, Yasuda proved himself true to his word when it turned out that&nbsp;<em>RePop&nbsp;</em>would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-remaster-remake" rel="nofollow">serve as a remaster</a> rather than a full remake.</p>

<p>Back in June, the remaster's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-release-date" rel="nofollow">release date was set for September</a>. It's one of two 2012 action-adventure games involving auteur Goichi Suda, otherwise known as Suda51, to get itself a remaster this year, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shadows-of-damned-hella-remastered-release-date" rel="nofollow">the other being&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned</em></a>.</p>




<p><em>Lollipop Chainsaw RePop&nbsp;</em>is a remastered version of the 2012 action game, which was originally developed by Suda51's company Grasshopper Manufacture.</p>

<p>Maintaining the original game's story and atmosphere,&nbsp;<em>RePop&nbsp;</em>features upgraded visuals, "faster action", and plenty of other quality-of-life improvements to bring cheerleader Juliet Starling's zombie-slaying adventure into the modern era.</p>

<p>You can check out <i>Lollipop Chainsaw RePop&nbsp;</i>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2658450/LOLLIPOP_CHAINSAW_RePOP/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010519" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/lollipop-chainsaw-repop/9NTPB0C2028V/0010" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>. Here's hoping all this renewed interest in 2012 action games leads to some kind of remaster for&nbsp;<em>Binary Domain</em>. Come on, Sega.</p>
