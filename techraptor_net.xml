            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/mezen-board-game-inspired-by-siberian-artisans-announced-by-arcane-wonders<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Arcane Wonders has announced the launch of the <em>Mezen</em> board game. This puzzle tile-based tabletop game is based on the art style developed by traditional Siberian artisans, providing players a hands-on learning experience of this part of the world.</p>

<h2>The Mezen Board Game Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, the <em>Mezen</em> board game is inspired by the meze style of painting, which emerged in the mid-eighteenth century. This style is characterized by distinct shades of red and white and imagery centered on fire, water, creatures and plants found in nature, the sun, the moon, and protective symbols.</p>

Players will take turns flipping tiles and earning points. Whoever earns the most points by the end of the final round is declared the winner.</p>

<p>These tiles are maneuvered over a 5x5 board. Each round starts with the active player choosing one of the animals on the tiles. All players then choose a group of one or more tiles with that animal to remove from their grid and flip over. Next, they slide the tiles above the open spaces down and place the newly flipped tiles back in the open spaces at the top.</p>

<p>Once this is done, everyone will score the current round's scoring objective. These objectives include revealing symbols or completing the image of an animal. These objectives are dealt to players through a deck of cards. Once five rounds are done, players get one point per black tile shown on their board. After the 10th and final round, players score one point per white tile&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <em>Mezen</em> board game was created by Nikita Sorokin and Maria Stahkevich and developed by Hobby World. It is the latest board game to join Arcane Wonders' diverse tabletop catalog which includes <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/arcane-wonders-announces-onstage-trick-taking-game-about-theater-troupe" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Onstage</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/video-game-champion-brings-retro-game-collecting-fun-to-gaming-tables" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Video Game Champion</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/ito-card-game-getting-western-localization" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Ito</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>
