            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has hired a new Senior Designer for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>. James Haeck, whose body of work includes many acclaimed supplements and modules for the world's most popular fantasy TTRPG, will now help shape that game for the future.</p><p>In a report from EN World, James Haeck announced on Ghostfire Games' Eldritch Lorecast podcast that he would be joining Wizards of the Coast's as a senior <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> designer. Haeck will join other writers who have been similarly promoted, including Game Design Director Justice Ramin Arman (<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/journeys-through-radiant-citadel-review" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Journeys Through the Radiant Citadel</em></a>), Makenzie de Armas (<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/vecna-eve-of-ruin-dd-5e-review-culmination-of-years-of-work" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Vecna: Eve of Ruin</em></a>), and James Wyatt (<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/van-richtens-guide-to-ravenloft-review" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft</em></a>).</p><picture>

  </picture><p>Like his peers, James Haeck has had a prolific career within the TTRPG space. He has written official <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> material for several years as a freelancer and is an Ennie Award-winning game designer. This work includes acclaimed modules like <em>Waterdeep: Dragon Heist</em> and <em>Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus</em>.</p><p>In addition, Haeck has contributed to other publications. These include <em>Draw Steel</em> developer MCDM and Ghostfire Games. His biggest contribution was to Darrington Press' Critical Role. He has written for <em>Explorer's Guide to Wildemount</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/taldorei-reborn-now-available-on-dd-beyond" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Tal'Dorei Reborn</em></a>, and was a co-writer on the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/critical-role-call-of-netherdeep-review" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Call of the Netherdeep</em></a> module.</p><p>The hiring of James Haeck by Wizards of the Coast appears to be an attempt to retain developer talent after the departure of creative leads Jeremy Crawford and Chris Perkins.&nbsp;</p><p>It can also be speculated that this new creative team may be working on a new wave of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> supplements in the style of the recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-forgotten-realms-heroes-of-faerun-and-adventures-in-faerun-review" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Forgotten Realms</a> books and <em>Eberron: Forge of the Artificer</em>. While Wizards of the Coast has been quiet, rumor has it that future books may include the debut of a new core class, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dungeons-dragons-2024-psion-ua-update-refines-new-psychic-casting-class" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Psion</a>, and potentially a return to the controversial post-apocalyptic <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-dungeons-dragons-unearthed-arcana-may-hint-at-return-to-dark-sun-setting" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Dark Sun</em></a> setting.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
