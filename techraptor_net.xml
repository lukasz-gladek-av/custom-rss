            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/konami-financials-2024-25<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Konami has released its financial statement for the fiscal year ending in March 2025, and revenue and profit are both up for the&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>publisher.</p>

<p>Per the company's latest presentation, revenue across all sectors jumped by 17% this year, while operating profit rose by 27%. In the "Digital Entertainment" sector (which covers Konami's video game business), revenue was up by 22.5%, while profit grew by 24.7%.</p>

<p>In an accompanying <a href="https://img.konami.com/ir/en/ir-data/statements/2025/en0508_28h9rg.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">document</a>, Konami attributed its success this year to the successful release of Bloober Team's&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake, which had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">sold two million copies</a> at last count. The two studios are currently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloober-team-konami-new-game-ip" rel="nofollow">working together on another new game</a> based on a Konami IP, although it's unclear whether that IP is&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/silent-hill-2-konami-financials.jpg?itok=juKP9QPx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/silent-hill-2-konami-financials.jpg?itok=SVOnP7Z7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>has contributed to a strong year for Konami.</figcaption></figure><p>The company also points to the recent release of remasters of the first two&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>games, as well as the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/yu-gi-oh-early-days-collection-pc-and-switch-release-date" rel="nofollow">launch of retro museum title&nbsp;<em>Yu-Gi-Oh! Early Days Collection</em></a>, which features 14 "nostalgic classic digital titles", as Konami says.</p>

<p>Sadly, Konami doesn't reveal any sales figures for these collections, so we don't know how well they're doing. We do, however, know that a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suikoden-star-leap-announced" rel="nofollow">brand new&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>game is in development</a>, albeit a mobile RPG that will almost certainly feature gacha mechanics.</p>

<p>As regards the future, it's looking like a pretty packed year by Konami's standards. In the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-release-date-leak-playstation" rel="nofollow">next few months</a>, the studio will release&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em>, an Unreal Engine 5 remake of the 2004 stealth-action classic with a new visual makeover and some hefty gameplay improvements.</p>

<p>Konami also says it's "committed to the development" of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-f-officially-revealed-konami" rel="nofollow">upcoming survival horror title&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f</em></a>, although the studio stops short of revealing a release date or even a release window for the game.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bandai-namco-sales-2024-25</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bandai-namco-sales-up-this-year-as-profits-nearly-double.1184454/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bandai-namco-sales-2024-25<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has released its financial summary for the 2024-25 fiscal year, and things are looking up for the Japanese publisher when compared to last year.</p>

<p>In its statement, Bandai Namco reveals that its net sales have risen by 18% this year, and that operating profits are up by nearly 100%, having risen from 90 billion yen in the 2023-24 period to 180 billion this year.</p>

<p>The company's success comes after a couple of big hitters performed very well indeed. Fighting game&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</em>, for instance, hit <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-sales-5m" rel="nofollow">five million sales</a>&nbsp;within around four months, while&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>DLC expansion&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-sales" rel="nofollow">reached the same milestone in under a week</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-giant-bandai-namco.jpg?itok=ZWv0V6jQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-giant-bandai-namco.jpg?itok=wwjY4CwV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>DLC contributed to a good year for Bandai Namco.</figcaption></figure><p>Indeed,&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>itself <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-30m" rel="nofollow">passed the 30 million sales mark</a> recently, and while this was revealed too late to be part of the 2024-25 fiscal year, it still indicates that the base game has been selling steadily over the past twelve months or so.</p>

<p>These figures have helped to compensate for what was a pretty egregious failure on Bandai Namco's part in the form of&nbsp;<em>Unknown 9: Awakening</em>, which sold poorly on release last year, causing developer Reflector Entertainment (which is a Bandai Namco subsidiary) to be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unknown-9-awakening-layoffs-cancellation-reflector" rel="nofollow">hit by layoffs</a>.</p>

<p>In terms of what lies in Bandai Namco's future, the company has reason to be optimistic about the next twelve months as well. Later this month, the studio will release&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>alongside FromSoftware, and if the base game's sales figures are anything to go by, Bandai Namco could well have another hit on its hands.</p>

<p>A third game in the&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares&nbsp;</em>series is also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/little-nightmares-3-delayed" rel="nofollow">due to be released this year</a>, and it'll be the first title in the series not to be developed by Tarsier Studios, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/tarsier-studios-reanimal-introduces-tense-and-terrifying-journey" rel="nofollow">working on its own horror game</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Mafia: The Old Country Release Date Confirmed for August]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mafia-old-country-release-date-confirmed</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mafia-the-old-country-release-date-confirmed-for-august.1184397/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mafia-old-country-release-date-confirmed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>2K and Hangar 13 have revealed the&nbsp;<em>Mafia: The Old Country&nbsp;</em>release date, and just as we suspected, the latest entry in the long-running crime drama saga will be arriving in summer.</p>

<p>Per a new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Mafia: The Old Country&nbsp;</em>arrives on August 8th, which is the release date that was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mafia-old-country-release-date-seemingly-leaked" rel="nofollow">mistakenly leaked via Steam</a> back in April before being hastily removed from the page. Who'd have thunk it would turn out to be real?</p>

<p>In any case, the release date was revealed alongside a brand new gameplay trailer, and...well, yep,&nbsp;<em>Mafia: The Old Country&nbsp;</em>sure does look like a&nbsp;<em>Mafia&nbsp;</em>game, so you probably already know whether you'll like it or not.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mafia-the-old-country-release-date-driving.jpg?itok=yVeTyffj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mafia-the-old-country-release-date-driving.jpg?itok=E5nul8aN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Mafia: The Old Country&nbsp;</em>has plenty of activities that you'll be familiar with if you're a series fan.</figcaption></figure><p>Over the course of the trailer (which, disappointingly, does feature people speaking in thick Italian-accented English rather than Italian), we see plenty of the usual action-adventure staples; stealth, driving sequences, shootouts, and, of course, squeezing through narrow passageways.</p>

<p>We also see the player engaging in a knife fight with an opponent, as well as riding on horseback, so it looks like you won't just be traversing the Sicilian countryside in your ye olde 1900s car.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Mafia: The Old Country</em>, it's a prequel to the first three&nbsp;<em>Mafia&nbsp;</em>games. Taking place in 1900s Sicily, it sees you playing as Enzo Favara, a man looking to make good with the Torrisi crime family after "a brutal childhood of forced labor".</p>

<p>Like previous&nbsp;<em>Mafia&nbsp;</em>games, it looks like&nbsp;<em>The Old Country&nbsp;</em>is emphasizing its cinematic credentials, so don't expect any&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/second-grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer" rel="nofollow"><em>GTA</em>-style</a> emergent open-world shenanigans here. In fact, this one <a href="https://mafia.2k.com/the-old-country/faq/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">won't be open-world</a> like previous games in the series.</p>




<p><em>Mafia: The Old Country&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1941540/Mafia_The_Old_Country/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/mafia-the-old-country/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/mafia-the-old-country/9P834N9S4LL0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on August 8th. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Expects to Sell 15m Switch 2 Units in First Year]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-15m-switch-2-first-year</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-expects-to-sell-15m-switch-2-units-in-first-year.1184340/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-15m-switch-2-first-year<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has revealed the number of Switch 2 consoles it expects to sell within the machine's first year on sale, and it's safe to say the Japanese gaming giant isn't underselling its newest hardware.</p>

<p>In the company's financial summary for the 2024-25 fiscal year, Nintendo reveals that it expects to shift a staggering 15 million Switch 2 units before April next year, which gives the console around nine months to achieve that figure.</p>

<p>Software-wise, Nintendo says it expects to sell around 45 million software units in that time as well. It's worth noting that this figure doesn't include original Switch games; Nintendo is expecting to sell a staggering 105 million of those before April.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-first-year-15m-docked.jpg?itok=ZbR9Ycrd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-first-year-15m-docked.jpg?itok=ndeuZnOP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nintendo is expecting to sell a heck of a lot of Switch 2 units.</figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo's prediction is in line with a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-20m-shipments-report" rel="nofollow">Bloomberg report</a> earlier this year, which stated that the company was preparing to ship "more than 20 million units" in the console's first year. That would give the Switch 2 an additional three months to reach the 20 million figure, which sounds about right.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, Nintendo also says it expects to sell about 4.5 million original Switch consoles this financial year. I suppose not everyone is going to flock to buy the newest machine, and there are still a few people left in the world who don't own a Switch.</p>

<p>Nintendo will no doubt be hoping that its predictions about the Switch 2 are correct, because sales aren't looking great. They're down 30% on last year, with profit falling 43% as well.</p>

<p>It is, of course, worth noting that the last twelve months haven't exactly seen a slew of high-profile first-party Nintendo releases to bolster sales, although&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Party Jamboree&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</i>have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-sales-nintendo-financials" rel="nofollow">certainly attempted to pull their weight</a> in this regard.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-switch-2-15m-units.jpg?itok=IHVDvREQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-switch-2-15m-units.jpg?itok=N-w02qgM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>wasn't able to save Nintendo from falling sales this year.</figcaption></figure><p>Since Nintendo is at the end of a console's life cycle, a drop in sales is also to be expected, and I'm sure the company isn't exactly quaking in its boots when the Switch 2's launch is just around the corner.</p>
