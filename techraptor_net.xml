            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/aardman-pokemon-collaboration<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Stop-motion animation studio Aardman, best known for the&nbsp;<em>Wallace and Gromit&nbsp;</em>series and movies like <em>The&nbsp;</em><em>Pirates! In an Adventure with Scientists!</em>, has announced a collaboration with&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>&nbsp;that's set to debut in a couple of years.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.aardman.com/latest-news/2024/december/pokemon-aardman-team-up-for-exciting-collaboration-coming-2027/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an announcement on its website</a>, Aardman says its collaboration with The Pokemon Company will consist of "a special project" that'll arrive in 2027, and that the project will involve Aardman "bringing its unique style of storytelling to the <em>Pokemon</em> universe in brand-new adventures".</p>

<p>Aardman managing director Sean Clarke says that the collab will bring together&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>and Aardman's "love of craft, character and comedic storytelling", so it sounds like Aardman will be given at least a degree of creative control over the project, although The Pokemon Company isn't likely to let the studio do whatever it wants.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wallace-and-gromit-aardman-pokemon.jpg?itok=n1NjTG5f 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wallace-and-gromit-aardman-pokemon.jpg?itok=KFSuT0G- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Aardman is perhaps best known for the&nbsp;<em>Wallace and Gromit&nbsp;</em>series.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>marketing and media VP Taito Okiura, meanwhile, says that the teamup between Aardman and&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>is "a dream partnership", describing Aardman as "masters of their craft" and teasing that "global <em>Pokemon</em> fans are in for a treat".</p>

<p>This won't be&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>'s first dalliance with stop-motion animation. Back in February 2023, The Pokemon Company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-dlc-hidden-treasure-of-area-zero-revealed" rel="nofollow">announced&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Concierge</em></a>, a stop-motion series that was then in production for Netflix. It aired in December last year, attracting <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/pokemon_concierge/s01" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">strongly positive reviews</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, we don't yet know whether&nbsp;the Aardman collaboration will be another series or a movie, but the announcement refers to "brand-new adventures", so we'll seemingly be getting more than one of whatever the two companies are cooking up.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-concierge-wooper.jpg?itok=Azy1sRY- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-concierge-wooper.jpg?itok=IihTiqJF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>has dabbled in stop-motion animation before.</figcaption></figure><p>As for what's next for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>, the next game in the series <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-a-announced" rel="nofollow">will be&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em></a>, which is supposedly currently in development for Switch and which is intended to land next year, although we haven't heard much about the game since its announcement back in February.</p>

<p>Otherwise, the next major mainline installments in the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>series will probably be appearing on the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation" rel="nofollow">long-awaited Switch 2</a>, so much like the Aardman collab, we'll probably be waiting a while for more news on that one. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/golf-with-your-friends-2-brings-more-golf-madness-next-year.1057887/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/golf-with-your-friends-2-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Team17 has announced&nbsp;<em>Golf With Your Friends 2</em>, a followup to the 2020 multiplayer minigolf game&nbsp;<em>Golf With Your Friends</em>, and it's due out sometime next year.</p>

<p>While the first game was developed by Australian studio Blacklight Interactive, development work on the sequel will be handled by UK-based developer Radical Forge. As you'd expect from a sequel,&nbsp;<em>Golf With Your Friends 2&nbsp;</em>will bring new courses, new gameplay mechanics, and more.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://x.com/GolfWYF/status/1866845983797022820" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement post on social media platform X</a>, Team17 and Radical Forge say the game will introduce cross-platform multiplayer, so you'll be able to play it with your friends no matter where they're playing, as well as a "cross-platform level editor" to help you share your crazy golf creations.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/golf-with-your-friends-2-announced-course.jpg?itok=seuMr0kW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/golf-with-your-friends-2-announced-course.jpg?itok=_QwGfoK0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Golf With Your Friends 2&nbsp;</em>will bring new courses and more next year.</figcaption></figure><p>In addition to these features,&nbsp;<em>Golf With Your Friends 2</em>&nbsp;will also bring a new "hazardous weather system" that sounds like it'll throw a spanner in the works, as well as "improved physics" and more. It sounds like this'll be exactly the kind of sequel you've been expecting if you're a fan of the first game.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to new customization options for your golf balls, as well as rewards you can accrue through the game's XP system. It doesn't sound like it'll be a live-service game, though, so it's unlikely you'll need to pay real money to unlock anything.</p>

<p>You can take a look at the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Golf With Your Friends 2&nbsp;</em>right here. It doesn't give much away, but it should get you hyped to play another installment in this franchise.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/toem-2-announced</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/toem-2-promises-more-monochrome-photography-shenanigans.1057851/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/toem-2-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Swedish studio Something We Made has announced&nbsp;<em>Toem 2</em>, a followup to its 2021 monochromatic photography puzzler, and it's currently in the very early stages of development.</p>

<p>We don't know too much about the game right now, but Something We Made is promising a "brand new adventure" that's all about "documenting the world's little wonders", so it sounds very much like the sequel will be following in <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/toem" rel="nofollow">the original game</a>'s footsteps.</p>

<p>It looks like <i>Toem 2</i>'s visual style will also be an upgrade over the original; while it'll sport the same monochromatic color scheme, the graphics seem to have been improved, and it seems as though the new game will adopt a more traditional 3D perspective as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/toem-2-announced-square.jpg?itok=BFcetWiX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/toem-2-announced-square.jpg?itok=-z3YFmQt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Toem 2&nbsp;</em>looks like it's taking a slightly different visual direction to the original.</figcaption></figure><p>Like the first game,&nbsp;<em>Toem 2&nbsp;</em>will revolve around "uncovering little details" in the game's world, and you'll also be "helping friends along the way", so it sounds like you'll be taking on photography requests just like in&nbsp;<em>Toem</em>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we don't have a release date or even a release window for&nbsp;<em>Toem 2&nbsp;</em>yet; Something We Made says the game is in very early development right now, so it could be a few years before we hear from this one again.</p>

<p>While you wait, you can check out the teaser trailer for&nbsp;<em>Toem 2&nbsp;</em>right here. It shows off what the game's art style will be like, but (understandably given the game's stage of development) it doesn't give too much away beyond that.</p>




<p>If you didn't check out the original&nbsp;<em>Toem</em>, it was a low-key cozy photography game in which you took on a variety of tasks given to you by a range of quirky characters.</p>

<p>The original game is available to check out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1307580/TOEM_A_Photo_Adventure/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/toem/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/toem/9n7zcllr01b3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/toem-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>, and you can wishlist&nbsp;<em>Toem 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2900640/TOEM_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a> if you want to keep up with its progress.</p>
