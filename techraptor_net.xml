            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Limited Run Games has shadowdropped a version of remastered platformer <em>Tomba! Special Edition </em>on Switch 2, and it comes complete with a host of improvements specific to the platform as well.</p><p>As revealed by Limited Run on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/limitedrungames.com/post/3mboiujxgzj2x" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Bluesky</a>, <em>Tomba! Special Edition</em>'s Switch 2 version features "increased resolution", "improved performance", and "higher quality assets", as well as a "downsampled display mode". If you've got a Switch 2, this sounds like the perfect way to experience the game.</p><p>Unfortunately, it doesn't look like owners of the game on Switch 1 will get any kind of upgrade or even a discount, at least according to a <a href="https://x.com/Senator_Cthulu/status/2008168415274385672" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">couple</a> of <a href="https://x.com/TheOnlyGamerLP/status/2008168668165734542" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">users</a> in Limited Run's replies on X. Limited Run itself has been quiet about whether there's an upgrade or not, so it's safe to assume you'll have to buy this one again.</p><figure role="group">

<p>If you're not familiar with <em>Tomba!</em>, it's a rather curious game from the halcyon days of the original PlayStation, having launched in Japan in 1997, followed by a release in America and Europe the following year.</p><p>The game is essentially a Metroidvania platformer that follows the titular Tomba, a feral child who must defeat a battalion of pigs in order to recover a sacred bracelet belonging to his grandfather.</p><p>To do so, he'll have to explore a large non-linear map filled with areas to explore in both the foreground and background, as well as quests to complete in the course of exploration.</p><p>Since release, <em>Tomba!</em>, which was released as <em>Tombi! </em>in Europe, has attracted a cult following, leading to the launch of a sequel, <em>Tomba! 2: The Evil Swine Return</em>, in 1999. The sequel netted itself a release for modern systems, including the Switch 2, in December last year.</p>
<p>You can check out <em>Tomba! Special Edition </em><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/tomba-special-edition-switch-2/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">right now on Switch 2</a>. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Steam has rung in the new year by breaking concurrent player count records once again, and it's not just one, either. I'm sure Valve will be thrilled.</p><p>As spotted by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/morwull.bsky.social/post/3mbm57ds7yk27" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Bluesky user Alejandro LL</a>, Steam has broken its concurrent user (CCU) count record again, managing to reach a whopping 41.816 million users online at the same time and leaping past <a href="https://www.kitguru.net/gaming/joao-silva/steam-smashes-concurrent-player-record-with-over-41-million-users-online/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">October's record high</a> into the bargain.</p><p>Not only that, but a new record of users concurrently in games on Steam has been set as well, with that figure reaching almost 13.4 million as compared to March's 13.2 million record. Admittedly, these numbers aren't huge jumps, but they're still the highest on record.</p><figure role="group">

<p>As for why the record has been smashed, Valve almost certainly owes that to the ongoing Steam Winter Sale, which ends today at 10am Pacific and which features huge discounts on a number of popular games (as well as smaller discounts on newer or more evergreen titles).</p><p>Since many of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steam-best-of-2025" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="506dd7fd-a10c-4745-bcb4-ef7cfe0636c8" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">2025's best-selling games</a> on Steam are live-service titles as well, it's not unreasonable to assume that players are flocking to those games over the holiday period, which is probably why the concurrent in-game player count record has been broken too.</p><p>This news comes after what has been a rather checkered year for Steam, with Valve facing challenges from the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/horses-steam-ban-indie-horror" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a4a11cd5-8771-4a5c-86ba-ff196e272f59" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Horses </em>developer Santa Ragione</a>, No More Robots' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-more-robots-review-flag-rejection-valve" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5b8f68ae-5137-4e39-9011-498f4b4b7c21" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Mike Rose</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vile-exhumed-steam-removed-sexual-content" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3d619c44-1572-4d4c-9fdf-64af4c3b37db" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Vile: Exhumed</em>'s Cara Cadaver</a> over what appear to be contradictory censorship policies that seem to ignore important context.</p><p>With that said, legendary <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rance-series-coming-to-steam" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7bdd01fa-043a-41f0-af9b-a0305684ffa0" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">eroge series <em>Rance</em></a><em> </em>is about to make its Steam debut, albeit in what will probably end up being a heavily censored form subsidized with a patch downloadable from its publisher's website. Suffice it to say Steam is a successful, yet strange beast.</p><figure role="group">
