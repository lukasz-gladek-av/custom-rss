            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Valve has announced that Steam will soon stop supporting 32-bit Windows operating systems, but if you're worried that might mean you, don't fret: it almost certainly doesn't.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/49A1-B944-48B8-FF00" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a>, Valve says that it will end support for systems running 32-bit Windows instances on January 1st next year. Essentially, that means if you're somehow still running a 32-bit version of Windows 10, it won't be supported from New Year's Day.</p>

<p>However, Valve quickly qualifies this announcement by clarifying that according to its Steam Hardware Survey, this decision will only apply to around 0.01% of systems, so it's very unlikely that the end of 32-bit Windows support is going to affect you (although not impossible!).</p>

You'll see whether you've got a 64-bit or 32-bit Windows version there.</p>

<p>Windows 11 users need not fret; there is no 32-bit version of Windows 11, so if you've already upgraded to Microsoft's latest operating system, then this move definitely won't affect you.</p>

<p>Valve says that even when support ends, Steam will continue to function on 32-bit Windows 10 machines, but updates and support will no longer be available, so if some critical flaw appears that renders Steam unusable on Windows 10's 32-bit version, you'll have no recourse.</p>

<p>If you're wondering why this is happening, Valve says it's because core Steam features "rely on system drivers and other libraries that are not supported on 32-bit versions of Windows".</p>

<p>Prior to that, the storefront saw itself mired in controversy when it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vile-exhumed-steam-removed-sexual-content" rel="nofollow">removed certain adult games</a> from its store, responding to pressure from payment processors (which also saw fellow digital storefront Itch.io <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/itch-io-deindexes-adult-pages" rel="nofollow">make similar changes</a>).</p>
