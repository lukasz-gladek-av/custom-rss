            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-vr-spring-meta-quest<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Firaxis and Meta have announced that&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>is coming to VR, with a version of the upcoming 4X grand strategy game heading to Meta Quest 3 and 3S devices in spring.</p>

<p>The game is available to wishlist in VR form right now, and it marks the first time the&nbsp;<em>Civilization&nbsp;</em>series has been available in VR. Naturally, the VR version of the game will feature a redesigned interface, too.</p>

<p><em>Civilization 7 - VR&nbsp;</em>revolves around something the developers are calling the Command Table, which is a sort of zoomed-out view of the action that makes everything look as though you're playing it as a tabletop game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/civilization-7-vr-command-table.jpg?itok=v9zRev6f 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/civilization-7-vr-command-table.jpg?itok=0XJKTp4q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>will look a little different in VR.</figcaption></figure><p>World leaders will stand around the Command Table, reacting when you make decisions like forging alliances with them or declaring war on their nations.</p>

<p>You'll also be able to "bring the Command Table into your surroundings with dynamic mixed reality", according to Meta, so it sounds like you'll be able to superimpose&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>into the real world if you so desire.</p>

<p>The VR version of the game will support solo play and multiplayer for you and up to three others, although they will need to be playing the Meta Quest version of the game; you won't be able to play this one with regular&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>players, unfortunately.</p>

<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7 - VR&nbsp;</em>right here. It's set for a spring 2025 release, although no more specific release date has been revealed yet.</p>




<p>Elsewhere in&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>news, the non-VR version of the game launched into its advanced access period last week and immediately <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-early-access-mixed-reviews-50k-players" rel="nofollow">met with criticism from players</a>, who highlighted its user interface and a perceived paucity of game features as particular sticking points.</p>

<p>Following those criticisms, Firaxis <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-ui-problems-fixes-coming" rel="nofollow">promised to fix players' problems</a> with&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7</em>, highlighting three areas to address (namely UI, community-requested features, and polish) without committing to specific timings.</p>

<p><em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>is due out on February 11th for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1295660/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_VII/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/sid-meier-s-civilization-vii/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-for-xbox-series-xs/9N23HJHSC6BL" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>. The VR version arrives in spring for <a href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-vr/5781689118524197/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Meta Quest 3 and 3S</a>.</p>
