            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/virtua-fighter-5-steam-release<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega has announced that 2006 fighting game&nbsp;<em>Virtua Fighter 5&nbsp;</em>is getting a Steam release, and it comes complete with a number of enhancements, including one that's very important to the fighting game community.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://x.com/SEGA/status/1859960222493671731" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>,&nbsp;<em>Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O.</em>, as the Steam version is called, will be coming sometime this winter, although the studio isn't specific about exactly when we can expect the game to arrive on PC.</p>

<p>It'll feature support for up to 4K resolution and 60fps, as well as a host of gameplay balance adjustments. Perhaps most importantly, however, the game will also feature rollback netcode at launch, without which it arguably wouldn't be a viable online title for fighting game enthusiasts.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/virtua-fighter-5-steam-jacky-lau.jpg?itok=MEwGlO27 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/virtua-fighter-5-steam-jacky-lau.jpg?itok=DqXUR5Q5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Virtua Fighter 5&nbsp;</em>is coming to Steam with a very important feature.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with rollback netcode, it's essentially a feature in fighting games by which if an online connection is dropped, each player's game state will try to predict what the player was about to do.</p>

<p>It's a little more complicated than that, but suffice it to say that rollback netcode significantly improves the online experience in fighting games. It's used in the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-fighterz-rollback-netcode-ps5-xbox" rel="nofollow"><em>Dragon Ball FighterZ</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/street-fighter-6-rollback-netcode-will-be-better-open-worlds-detailed" rel="nofollow"><em>Street Fighter 6</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/will-tekken-8-have-crossplay-and-rollback-netcode-katsuhiro-harada-responds" rel="nofollow"><em>Tekken 8</em></a>, so&nbsp;<em>Virtua Fighter 5&nbsp;</em>including it at launch on Steam makes a lot of sense.</p>

<p>Sega says it will be sharing more information about&nbsp;<em>Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O.&nbsp;</em>in the future, so presumably, we'll be getting a release date in the next couple of weeks. I wouldn't be surprised if this year's Game Awards included that info.</p>




<p>News of&nbsp;<em>Virtua Fighter 5</em>'s impending Steam release comes just a few weeks after Sega revealed that a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sega-new-virtua-fighter-game" rel="nofollow">new installment in the franchise is in development</a>, although we don't yet know what it'll look like or when we can expect it to arrive.</p>

<p>It's part of a wider initiative on Sega's part to revive some of its classic franchises, with that initiative also yielding the likes of a&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shinobi-movie-announced" rel="nofollow"><em>Shinobi&nbsp;</em>movie</a>, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crazy-taxi-reboot-open-world-mmo" rel="nofollow">new&nbsp;<em>Crazy Taxi&nbsp;</em>game</a>, and several more classic Sega IPs <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sega-super-game-old-ip-revived" rel="nofollow">getting new games as well</a>.</p>

<p><em>Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O.&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3112260/Virtua_Fighter_5_REVO/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> sometime this winter. The game is also currently available <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0177-CUSA27065_00-9558212560709500" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on PS4</a> (and on PS5 via backwards compatibility).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-27-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 2.7 release date has been revealed, so get ready to bid farewell to Penacony and embark on a new adventure to lands unfamiliar.</p>

<p>Version 2.7 of the turn-based gacha RPG officially arrives on December 4th. In&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-26-release-date" rel="nofollow">Version 2.6</a>, you brought the events of a "trailblazing silkpunk saga" to their climax, but now, you'll be wrapping things up in Penacony before heading off to the mysterious land of Amphoreus.</p>

<p>As HoYoverse tells it, you'll be making new memories with your friends in Penacony while Miss Himeko gathers information about Amphoreus in preparation for moving the story to the Eternal Land.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/honkai-star-rail-version-2.7-release-date-fugue.jpg?itok=OMjGirLk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/honkai-star-rail-version-2.7-release-date-fugue.jpg?itok=LkBMdQK4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>As ever, you'll have new characters to add to your team in&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail</em>'s latest update.</figcaption></figure><p>As you'd probably expect if you're a&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>fan, you'll have two new characters to add to your roster in Version 2.7.</p>

<p>Your first new character is Sunday, a five-star Imaginary fighter who provides powerful buffs to his team and allows other characters to immediately take action. You'll want to add him to your team if you're looking for some solid support.</p>

<p>Joining Sunday in this update is Fugue, a foxian girl who applies a powerful debuff to enemies. When said debuff reaches zero, enemies take damage, and Fugue's abilities also allow her party members to dish out some extra pain, so she's a valuable addition to any lineup.</p>




<p>Two additional characters will feature in reruns for Version 2.7. In the first half of the update, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-gameplay-trailer-celebrates-release-of-new-character-jing-yuan" rel="nofollow">Jing Yuan</a> will make a return, while the second half will see Firefly once again up for grabs.</p>

<p>A number of other major additions and improvements are set to arrive as part of this update as well, including customizable quarters for the Trailblazer. As HoYoverse prepares for&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.0, you'll also get&nbsp;the new Path of Remembrance system and updates to Relics, plus lots more.</p>

<p><em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>is available to play for free right now on PC, PS5, and mobile devices. Version 2.7 arrives on December 4th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizkids-announces-new-monster-manual-2024-miniatures-for-dungeons-dragons<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizkids has announced a new line of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> miniatures. These miniatures aren't based on a setting like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/wizkids-planescape-whirlwyrm-and-adult-time-dragon-minis-review-not-in-faerun" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Planescape</em></a> or on a module like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/wizkids-vecna-eve-of-ruin-dd-miniatures-review-miska-wolf-spider-is-ready-to-fight" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Vecna: Eve of Ruin</em></a><em>, </em>but are based on new monsters found in the upcoming <em>Monster Manual 2024</em>.</p>

<h2>The Wizkids <em>Monster Manual 2024</em> Miniatures Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, the first wave of the <em>Monster Manual 2024</em> miniatures being produced by Wizkids are two adult dragons. Those two dragons are Adult Black Dragon Corruptor and Adult Red Dragon Tyrant.</p>

<p><em>Monster Manual 2024</em> is the last of three updated rulebooks for <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. All three books include updated foundational rules for the fantasy TTRPG, essentially updating the game's rules from 2014's Fifth Edition to <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024</em>.</p>

<p>Those changes have included glow-ups to player classes such as the Monk and making the game's complex rules and charts easier to parse for <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-dungeon-masters-guide-review-true-dms-best-friend" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Dungeon Masters</a>. In that vein, <em>Monster Manual 2024</em> will update classic monsters alongside new entries for players to face.</p>

<p>While this updated <em>Monster Manual</em> isn't available yet, the press release did provide some screenshots of these new dragon miniatures. Screenshots that may provide some insight into how these dragons have changed.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-manual-2024-black-dragon-corruptor-miniature.jpg?itok=OferQ6JM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-manual-2024-black-dragon-corruptor-miniature.jpg?itok=LaNgdi3E 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>First, the Adult Black Dragon Corruptor. At first glance, the visual design of the black dragon appears unchanged from <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Fifth Edition. Black scales, bull-like horns, acid breath weapon.</p>

<p>But look a bit closer and this dragon has some new attachments. The first is its wings, which have a gnarled design. The tips look like boney claws or talans, which may imply a nastier wing attack in its repertoire. Second is the tail which is now pointed like a scorpion's stinger.</p>

<p>This may hint at a more aggressive use of acid or debilitating tactics, it is called a Corruptor after all. This is a possibility considering disease and poison appears to be getting more focus in the new 2024 ruleset.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-manual-2024-red-dragon-tyrant-miniature.jpg?itok=9S5-a5So 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-manual-2024-red-dragon-tyrant-miniature.jpg?itok=MBXHrO8J 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As for the Adult Red Dragon Tyrant miniature, there is less information to gleam. Red dragons in Dungeons &amp; Dragons are characterised as vain, prideful, condescending, and covetous of treasure. In that context, Tyrant seems like redundant statement.</p>

<p>But the new design does have some new traits. There's a secondary color of charcoal black running across the entire body, which adds some variety to the dragon's look. It also invokes molten rock or burnt forests, which does make it more menacing at a glance.</p>

<p>The press release corroborates this. It states that Red Dragon Tyrants are drawn to volcanic mountaintops and burning wastelands. Places where they don't just build up their treasure hoards, but their armies as well.</p>

<p>Both of the dragon miniatures in the <em>Monster Manual 2024</em> product line will be available both painted and unpainted. Each dragon takes up a 75 mm base and has an impressive 8-inch wingspan. They will be available in stores July 2025 at an MSRP of $79.99 (Prepainted) and $59.99 (Unpainted) respectively.</p>
