            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've been able to dive into <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/deadpool-vr-review-merc-with-headset" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="12ddfe5a-7798-4d72-9058-9b474607a06e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Deadpool</em> </a>and<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/men-in-black-most-wanted-review-once-you-go-worm" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="8f5e286b-3833-487f-a7f5-e19a75067d5e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em> Men In Black</em></a> recently, so I was more than excited when the opportunity was presented to me to slip into a turtle shell and get hands-on with the opening sequence of <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Empire City</em> for Quest 3.</p><p>Developed by Cortopia Studios, <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Empire City</em> is a co-op action adventure game where you can swap between each of the different turtles to protect the city streets (and roofs, and sewers, etc) from the Foot Clan.</p><p>The gameplay demo began immediately as I was able to look down and see my three-fingered green hand and a blue wristband. The games opening immediately introduces you to a number of the core features of the game; movement, stealth, and how to draw your weapon.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Heroes In A Half Shell</h2><p>A brief amount of story was set up in this opening. With a call from April O'Neil, which was frequently interrupted by Master Splinter and Casey, it is established that the Turtles have been gone from New York City, exploring the world for some time.</p><p>In their absence, the Foot Clan has started to make moves, raising the crime rate in the city. An off comment about having to defeat Shredder all over again tells us that this isn't the first time that the turtles have had to kick Shredder from power.</p><p>Later in the gameplay demo, when I had some time to explore the Turtles' Lair, I was presented with a number of screens showing 10-12 different regions with a high crime rate. I'm sure that will evolve into the level system of the full game when it releases in 2026.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>There was no immediate sign or any of the other larger than life characters from TMNT, like Bebop, Rocksteady, or Krang… but I wouldn't be surprised if they weren't far away from the rest of the criminals.</p><h2>Run, Jump, And Attack Like A Ninja Turtle</h2><p>There's a lot here that you'd expect, moving with the left stick, a UI system built into your wristwatch, and drawing your weapons over your shoulder.</p><p>For the most part, the melee combat was as you'd expect for a VR game, while you can come into an encounter with precision, it's not too long before you learn the most efficient way to attack is just by flailing your arms. The most fun weapons to handle were Mikey's nunchucks and Donatello's bo-staff.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-empire-city-nunchuk.jpg?itok=PWpc8Ffh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1069" height="1079">

  </picture><p>The physics of the nunchucks were a lot of fun to flail around with, and even better, the faster you spun them, the more powerful they'd become. The bo-staff is unique in that you cain wield it with one hand as a long pole to hit with, or with both hands to move it quickly around. The nunchucks let you go crazier, while the bo-staff makes you feel like you need to be a bit more deliberate with your actions.</p><p>Outside the turtle's standard weapons, there are a few smoke and electricity grenades that you come across, but those seem pretty situational. There are teases of additional weapons, but I'll have to see how they play out in the full game.</p><p>An interesting change to exploring the world is having looking left and right mapped to the right stick, but that up is jump and down is to crouch.</p><p>It took a bit to initially get into, at that point I'd been pressing buttons and just rationalized that there was no jump, but after spending some time practising moving and jumping in quick succession, it did feel easy to have it all in one place, as opposed to having to quickly swap between looking and jumping with a button.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Throw Yourself Into The Air</h2><p>The freeform movement is enhanced further by the ability to propel yourself off different fixtures like window frames, lightpoles, and ledges. Holding onto one of these with a hand you can throw yourself, propelling yourself through the air.</p><p>Leaping from rooftop to rooftop was immediately a fun experience, running and jumping, and even if you missed, you could quickly throw yourself back up onto the rooftop using the environment.</p><p>One accidental downside of this freedom of movement that I did experience was that I missed a trigger in the game that meant enemies didn't spawn correctly, and I got stuck in an alleyway with nowhere to go. It took me a while to realize I hadn't done anything wrong… I just needed to retrace my footsteps and take the 'correct' path through the city.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Hints Of The Full Edition</h2><p>After completing the brief tutorial, I got to return to The Lair, the Turtle's sewer hideout. Complete with a common space, a dojo, and personalized rooms for each of the Turtles. There were a number of good hints about just how much there will be to do in the full game.</p><p>A few collectibles leaned into skill points that will be able to be used to upgrade the turtles, an old-school TMNT Arcade Cabinet was the mechanism to change between the four Turtles, and a vending machine showed a variety of sillouetted items.</p><p>It's clear the team at Cortopia studios is going for a lot of replayability, reasons to swap between the turtles, and reasons to replay levels hunting down goodies.</p><p>While I didn't get to get too far in my <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Empire City</em> preview, what was there I did like. The use of the control stick to handle turning, crouching, and jumping at the same time did a good job to free up other buttons, and I look forward to seeing how your options expand.</p><p>I do feel like this will suffer from the 'VR Melee' combat issue with no weight behind the objects and no collision, but if you're fine to flail in VR for a TMNT power fantasy, then you'll be just fine.</p><hr><p><em><strong>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Most Wanted </strong>was previewed on Meta Quest 3 with a copy provided by the Developer over the course of 30 minutes of gameplay - all screenshots were taken during the process of review.</em></p></div><div><p><span><div>
