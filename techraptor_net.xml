            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>producer Yoshi-P has declared that while he wants to keep supporting the MMORPG on PS4 for "as long as possible", technical limitations might mean the game drops support for the platform eventually.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://feed4gamers.com/game-news/317170/final-fantasy-xiv-s-next-chapters-an-exclusive-talk-with-yoshi-p.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an interview</a> with Feed4Gamers, Yoshi-P says that his "basic stance" is to continue supporting hardware "which has grown old", but that Sony's "hardware regulations" might make it difficult for&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>to remain on the last-gen console.</p>

<p>According to Yoshi-P, the game's continuous updates mean that Square Enix has been asking Sony to increase its data limits for&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>specifically, and while Sony has been happy to oblige, the company has told Yoshi-P and his team that "they are also reaching their limits", he says.</p>

<p>However, when that time comes, Yoshi-P promises that he will "provide clear reasoning for that decision", so if and when PS4 support does end for&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>, you'll know about it.</p>

<p>This discussion comes after a couple of prominent games recently ended support for the PS4; earlier this month, HoYoverse declared that PS4 support for gacha RPG&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-ps4-support-ending" rel="nofollow">will end next year</a>, and&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>publisher Krafton <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pubg-ps4-and-xbox-one-support-ending-in-november" rel="nofollow">subsequently followed suit</a> for its battle royale shooter.</p>

<p>In both cases, the studios said they wanted to focus on current-gen hardware for their games, and that's something for which Yoshi-P seems grateful too; in the aforementioned interview, he says current-gen hardware is "quite high spec" and that working with it is "easier...compared to back in the days".</p>




<p>This interview comes shortly after the release of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-patch-73-august" rel="nofollow">Patch 7.3</a> for&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>, which brought a brand new story dungeon, the second part of the&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XI</em>-themed 24-person raid, and more earlier this month.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Replaced&nbsp;</em>developer Sad Cat Studios has revealed that work on the game is still very much underway, and that it's now due to launch sometime in spring next year.</p>

<p>In a new development update, project lead Yura Zhdanovich acknowledges that&nbsp;<em>Replaced</em>&nbsp;has "seen a couple of delays", but he says that he and his team have always "been trying to do what's best for the project".</p>

<p>Zhdanovich says that he and Sad Cat Studios are "really close to finishing production" on&nbsp;<em>Replaced</em>, and that the next phase is "intense testing and polishing of the game", although he doesn't say exactly how long he expects that phase to take.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/replaced-spring-2026-gas-station.jpg?itok=ETJFF9v8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/replaced-spring-2026-gas-station.jpg?itok=21MHZPpp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Replaced&nbsp;</em>is now due in spring 2026.</figcaption></figure><p>To tide you over until spring, Zhdanovich reveals that Sad Cat has "improved every aspect of the game" since it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-announcement-from-xbox-bethesda-e3-2021" rel="nofollow">initially revealed back in 2021</a>. He says the team's goal was to make the game with "no shortcuts", and so everything has been made "in a classic way", with "handcrafted pixel art".</p>

<p>The rest of the trailer delves into&nbsp;<em>Replaced</em>'s animation and development processes. It's worth a look if you're interested in the story behind the game, and you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPoyEkQePA4&amp;ab_channel=IGN" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">check it out here</a> courtesy of IGN.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Replaced</em>, it's an upcoming action platformer that blends chunky 2.5D-style pixel art with gameplay that "combines cinematic platforming...and free-flow action combat".</p>

<p>Set in an alternative 1980s,&nbsp;<em>Replaced&nbsp;</em>casts you as an artificial intelligence known as R.E.A.C.H., who's trapped inside a human body. You'll have to adjust to life as a human, all while discovering that "everything comes at a price", according to Sad Cat.</p>




<p>When it does finally arrive,&nbsp;<em>Replaced&nbsp;</em>is set to launch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1663850/REPLACED/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, as well as on Xbox Series X|S, and it'll be a day one Game Pass title as well. A specific release date will be announced later this year.</p>
