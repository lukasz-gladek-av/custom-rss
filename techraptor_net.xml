            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has released its financial results for the first quarter of the 2025-26 fiscal year, and both sales and profits for the publisher are up, driven largely by strong sales for&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>and its associated titles.</p>

<p>As revealed in its <a href="https://www.bandainamco.co.jp/files/ir/financialstatements/pdf/20250805_en_Result.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">latest financial statement</a>, Bandai Namco's net sales have risen by 7% when compared to the same period last year, and its operating profit is up by 18%. These rises are more modest than those of last year, but that's to be expected given that the&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>DLC&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-sales" rel="nofollow">landed in that period</a>.</p>

<p>In an accompanying <a href="https://www.bandainamco.co.jp/files/ir/financialstatements/pdf/20250805_Presentation.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">presentation</a> (which is in Japanese, so we're using additional reporting by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/elden-ring-nightreigns-strong-sales-drive-bandai-namcos-game-sector-profits-in-first-quarter/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Automaton Media</a>), Bandai Namco attributes this quarter's success at least partly to&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, which was revealed last month to have sold <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-nightreign-sales" rel="nofollow">over five million copies</a>.</p>

<p>With regards to the future, meanwhile, Bandai Namco has a number of big releases on the horizon. These include the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/blood-of-dawnwalker-ex-witcher-devs" rel="nofollow"><em>The Blood of Dawnwalker</em></a>, a major RPG developed by ex-<em>Witcher&nbsp;</em>staffers, and&nbsp;<em>Code Vein II</em>, a followup to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/code-vein" rel="nofollow">anime-inflected 2019 Soulslike</a>.</p>

<p>Another big Bandai Namco release coming in the next few months is, of course,&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares III</em>, the third major installment in the&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares&nbsp;</em>series of side-scrolling horror platformers. It's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/little-nightmares-iii-release-date" rel="nofollow">currently due to land in October</a>.</p>

<p>That's despite <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/supermassive-games-layoffs-directive-8020-delayed" rel="nofollow">layoffs at developer Supermassive Games</a>; when said layoffs were announced, the studio made it clear development on&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares III&nbsp;</em>would be unaffected, although sci-fi adventure&nbsp;<em>Directive 8020&nbsp;</em>has been delayed.</p>
