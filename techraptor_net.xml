            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/smite-2-new-gods-august-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hi-Rez Studios has revealed that it intends to release a new god for action MOBA&nbsp;<em>Smite 2&nbsp;</em>every week between now and "at least August 2025".</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/SMITEGame/status/1881059855307313664" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on social media platform X, the studio says that the schedule is part of "keeping up with a steady pace of god releases in&nbsp;<em>Smite 2</em>". The "at least" in the post also seems to indicate that this schedule may well continue beyond August, which is exciting.</p>

<p>It is worth pointing out that the term "new" might be doing a lot of heavy lifting here; as pointed out by Hi-Rez QA analyst <a href="https://x.com/Kitten0fDoom/status/1881065342778434015" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">KD</a>, many of these gods will be ported over from the original&nbsp;<em>Smite</em>, with four entirely new gods set to debut in the next 32 weeks.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/smite-2-new-god-every-week-cabrakan.jpg?itok=WZCNkdfd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/smite-2-new-god-every-week-cabrakan.jpg?itok=k0hHo_9i 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Smite 2</em>'s Cabrakan is available to play right now.</figcaption></figure><p>Several new gods were also introduced as part of the&nbsp;<em>Smite&nbsp;</em>World Championship event, which aired over the weekend. Two of those gods, Vulcan and Hun Batz, will be arriving in the game's next update, while the third, Cabrakan, is available to try out right now.</p>

<p>In case you need a mythology refresher, Vulcan is the Roman god of fire. He's analogous to the Greek god Hephaestus. Hun Batz and Cabrakan are both Mayan gods; the former is a howler monkey god, while the latter is the god of earthquakes.</p>

<p>Hi-Rez also introduced the <a href="http://smite2.com/news/wandering-market/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Wandering Market</a> during the event. It's essentially a seasonal battle pass system with free and premium tiers, and you can unlock all kinds of goodies through the pass, just as you'd expect.</p>

<p>Originally, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/smite-2-revealed" rel="nofollow">the plan</a> was to support both&nbsp;<em>Smite&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Smite 2&nbsp;</em>simultaneously, but after layoffs back in October, the studio decided to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/smite-2-hi-rez-layoffs" rel="nofollow">shift its focus</a> mainly to&nbsp;<em>Smite 2</em>, with "light updates" continuing for the original game.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Smite 2&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2437170/SMITE_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/smite-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/smite-2/9NV8W1KJSQLL" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-director-shoots-down-wild-claims.1086927/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-rumors-director<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>director&nbsp;Daniel Vávra has taken to social media in order to address what he calls "wild claims" surrounding the game, including a ban in Saudi Arabia, unskippable cutscenes, and more.</p>

<p>In a lengthy <a href="https://x.com/DanielVavra/status/1881081082612944935" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">thread</a> on social media platform X,&nbsp;Vávra points to claims that have been circulating in recent days. He says these claims are "based just on one screenshot and a poorly translated tweet", likely pointing to <a href="https://x.com/VGA4A/status/1879150290680893691" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">this post</a> from Saudi Arabian outlet VGA4A.</p>

<p>When machine translated, the post seems to say that&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>has been banned in Saudi Arabia due to "unskippable gay scenes in story mode", and it's likely that this is the claim&nbsp;Vávra wants to address.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-ban-rumors-battle.jpg?itok=QI1P_6G4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-ban-rumors-battle.jpg?itok=wLFVadf6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Recent rumors surrounding&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>are, according to its director, unfounded.</figcaption></figure><p>According to&nbsp;Vávra,&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>will feature "NO unskippable cutscenes", a claim he extends to the entirety of his studio Warhorse's output.</p>

<p>He then says that his studio's game is not, nor ever was, banned in any country, "at least not that we know of". It is, of course, possible that the game was banned in Saudi Arabia without&nbsp;Vávra's knowledge, but since he's the head of Warhorse, that seems unlikely.</p>

<p>Vávra then goes on to say that while he doesn't like "forced diversity", he and his team were not forced to do anything, nor are they "forcing anyone to do certain things".</p>

<p>Again pointing to the rumors of "unskippable gay scenes" propagated by the aforementioned post,&nbsp;Vávra says gay characters were already present in&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em>, and that "you are responsible for your decisions".</p>

<p>He says that if you want Henry to have a "same-sex adventure", you can, but "if you don't want to, you don't have to".</p>




<p>The rest of&nbsp;Vávra's thread contains some story details for&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>, as well as historical context explaining some of the creative decisions behind the game.</p>

<p>Vávra says, for instance, that the city in which the game takes place was "one of the richest" in Europe and was "besieged by a massive foreign army", which is why it's "more diverse than the life in the villages which were featured in the first game".</p>

<p>He closes by saying that he doesn't want his game to "be used as clickbait by people who didn't even play it yet", and that some followers have been "turned into exactly the same narrative they pretend to be fighting against".</p>

<p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>is set to launch for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1771300/Kingdom_Come_Deliverance_II/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/9N4W31HSMVVD" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-moved-forward" rel="nofollow">February 4th</a>.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-roadmap-january-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/palworld-roadmap-includes-co-op-new-pals-and-more.1086891/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-roadmap-january-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Pocketpair has shared a brand new&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>roadmap to celebrate the game's first anniversary, and it includes some pretty major features, although it's not clear exactly when these features are set to debut.</p>

<p>In a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1623730/view/596264277969469557" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, Pocketpair celebrates&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>'s first birthday by announcing a number of initiatives related to the game, only one of which is the aforementioned roadmap. The studio will also be holding a "worldwide Pal popularity poll", and a soundtrack has been released for free, too.</p>

<p>The roadmap promises a number of new "future" features without committing to timeframes, including major new features and miscellaneous improvements alike.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-roadmap-2025-full.jpg?itok=4YxKjWvl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-roadmap-2025-full.jpg?itok=q5EYRdU4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Lots of new features are coming to&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>this year.</figcaption></figure><p>The roadmap promises the likes of co-op crossplay between different platforms, as well as being able to transfer Pals between worlds and "further ways to strengthen and improve Pals". You can also look forward to new Pals and technologies, as well as a new "ending scenario".</p>

<p>Pocketpair also promises "game collaborations", including the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-terraria-crossover-2025" rel="nofollow">upcoming&nbsp;<em>Terraria&nbsp;</em>collab</a>, so it sounds like there will be more&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>crossovers in the future. Just <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-lawsuit-patents-demands-nintendo" rel="nofollow">don't expect a&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>crossover</a> anytime soon.</p>

<p>Improvements coming to&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>in the future include tweaks for "world object placement", Pals, game optimization, and UX, so&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>should be a smoother experience overall once those have been applied.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this roadmap doesn't commit to even a vague time window for when we can expect these improvements to arrive. Pocketpair simply pledges to "continue updating <i>Palworld&nbsp;</i>as we prepare for the official release".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-roadmap-2025-1st-anniversary-artwork.jpg?itok=WVQPoUeA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-roadmap-2025-1st-anniversary-artwork.jpg?itok=JYUDmmg2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Pocketpair shared this cute artwork to celebrate&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>'s first anniversary.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not au fait with&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>, it's a survival game that mashes up the creature collecting of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>with the base-building and exploration of games like&nbsp;<em>Ark: Survival Evolved</em>.</p>

<p>Often distilled (perhaps unfairly) down to "<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>with guns",&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>was a breakout hit when it was released, attracting <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-25-million-players-matching-pokemon-scarlet-violet" rel="nofollow">tens of millions of players</a>&nbsp;during the first month or two of its release.</p>

<p>Those&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>comparisons might not be fair, but Nintendo clearly doesn't think so; the Japanese gaming giant is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-palworld-pocketpair-lawsuit" rel="nofollow">currently suing Pocketpair</a> over some rather arcane patents, a situation which led to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-ps5-release-japan" rel="nofollow">delay of the game's PS5 release</a> in Japan.</p>
