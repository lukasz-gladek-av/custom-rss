            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rust-steam-player-count-new-record<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Open-world survival-crafter&nbsp;<em>Rust&nbsp;</em>has managed to hit a new all-time player count record on Steam, despite the fact that the game is nearing its seventh anniversary (and it's been out for even longer if you count Early Access).</p>

<p>According to the ever-reliable <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/252490/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>,&nbsp;<em>Rust&nbsp;</em>managed to hit 262,284 players within the last 24 hours, which is also the game's all-time peak. Even at time of writing, it's sitting at 200,694 players, so it's not like that spike was a fluke.</p>

<p>Of course, these numbers probably won't come as a surprise if you're a&nbsp;<em>Rust&nbsp;</em>player or if you've been following the game. After all,&nbsp;<em>Rust</em>'s player count has been <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/252490/charts/#max" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">slowly climbing</a> since its 2013 release, although the 262,284 jump is impressive even within that context.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rust-player-count-record-fortress.jpg?itok=QHXBbycJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rust-player-count-record-fortress.jpg?itok=4Ezc9Q0T 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Rust&nbsp;</em>has hit a new all-time player record on Steam.</figcaption></figure><p>So, what's driving this player count increase? It's likely that the Steam Winter Sale, during which&nbsp;<em>Rust&nbsp;</em>was available at a 50% discount, contributed hugely to the game's surge in popularity.</p>

<p>We're also just moving out of the holiday season, during which many players will have had more time to play games. Both of these are likely contributing factors to&nbsp;<em>Rust</em>'s newfound (extra) success, although content creators on platforms like YouTube and Twitch likely also shouldn't be discounted.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Rust</em>, it's an open-world survival-crafting game in which "the only aim" is to survive.&nbsp;<em>Rust</em>'s world is also unapologetically hostile; it's one in which "everything wants you to die", according to developer and publisher Facepunch.</p>

<p>Since release,&nbsp;<em>Rust&nbsp;</em>has received a number of updates bringing new features to the game, including the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rust-update-adds-military-bases-to-raid-for-goodies" rel="nofollow">military bases</a> to raid for goodies, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rust-above-ground-trains-update-rolls-out-today" rel="nofollow">above-ground trains</a> to ride, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rust-september-2021-update-improves-underwater-labs" rel="nofollow">improvements to existing features</a>, among other things.</p>




<p>Sadly, you're a little late to check out&nbsp;<em>Rust&nbsp;</em>as part of the Steam Winter Sale, but you can still grab it right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/252490/Rust/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, as well as on <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4415-CUSA14296_00-D11PROJECTRUST01" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 4</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/rust-console-edition/BRPVTJKWHBR7" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox One</a> (and current-gen machines via backwards compatibility).</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/selaco-sales-100k</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/indie-fps-selaco-hits-100k-sales-four-times-its-original-goal.1073259/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/selaco-sales-100k<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Altered Orbit Studios has announced that ambitious FPS&nbsp;<em>Selaco&nbsp;</em>has already crossed a major sales milestone that represents a fourfold increase on the studio's original goal for the game.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/SelacoGame/status/1874873018637603201" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message on social media platform X</a>, Altered Orbit reveals that&nbsp;<em>Selaco&nbsp;</em>has sold 100,000 copies, a figure the studio says it "never expected to reach", especially during the Early Access period (which began back in May this year).</p>

<p>Altered Orbit <a href="https://x.com/SelacoGame/status/1874873021556736150" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">follows up</a> by saying that its original intention was to sell 25,000 copies of&nbsp;<em>Selaco&nbsp;</em>in the game's first twelve months on release, but that "somehow", this figure was quadrupled in "just half the time".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/selaco-sales-100k.jpg?itok=2Inn0I7B 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/selaco-sales-100k.jpg?itok=-37znJFg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Selaco</em>'s mixture of retro nostalgia and ambitious thinking has resulted in a very respectable sales milestone within its first six months or so on sale.</figcaption></figure><p>The developer says that it decided to go publisher-free and place all its faith "in the game itself", as well as "the community to help spread the word", and it looks like those strategies worked.</p>

<p>Still, Altered Orbit <a href="https://x.com/SelacoGame/status/1874873023557480935" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">does acknowledge</a> that others played a role in&nbsp;<em>Selaco</em>'s success too. Specifically, the studio thanks New Blood's Dave Oshry for doing "more for us than I could fit in an entire Twitter thread", as well as "other developers" who are "always ready to offer help and see their peers succeed". Aww.</p>

<p>Amusingly, Altered Orbit closes its thank-you statements by <a href="https://x.com/SelacoGame/status/1874873025470107948" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">suggesting</a> that players only bought&nbsp;<em>Selaco&nbsp;</em>to play its "Burger Flipper" minigame. If that minigame isn't significantly expanded in the full release, I expect boycotts.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Selaco</em>, it's a throwback first-person shooter that promises to offer "thrilling action set pieces, destructibility, smart enemies, and a fleshed-out story" within what Altered Orbit calls an "immersive game world".</p>




<p>The game owes a debt to the likes of&nbsp;<em>Duke Nukem 3D</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/genre-advancing-shooters-half-life" rel="nofollow">genre-advancing classics like <i>Half-Life</i></a>, and more recent titles like&nbsp;<em>F.E.A.R.&nbsp;</em>for its action set pieces. That's a pretty heavy cross of influences to bear.</p>

<p>If you're interested, you can check the game out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1592280/Selaco/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>, and if you're still not convinced, perhaps our very own Austin's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/selaco-sets-new-standard-for-fps-genre" rel="nofollow">glowing preview</a> will do the trick.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Indie Platformer Antonblast Is Already Profitable, Developer Says]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/antonblast-already-profitable</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/indie-platformer-antonblast-is-already-profitable-developer-says.1073244/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/antonblast-already-profitable<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Antonblast&nbsp;</em>developer Summitsphere has announced that the game has already recouped all of its costs related to development, marketing, and production, officially making it a profitable endeavor less than a month after release.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tonycomputerentertainment.com/post/3lesqbhu4ys2y" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post on social media platform Bluesky</a>, Summitsphere's Tony Grayson reveals the happy news and says it "looks like Summitsphere is going to be making a lot more games for a lot longer", thanking&nbsp;<em>Antonblast&nbsp;</em>players for their support.</p>

<p>Just in case you aren't familiar with&nbsp;<em>Antonblast</em>, it's a 2D "explosive action platformer" with a visual style that owes a heavy debt to&nbsp;<em>Wario Land</em>. You can think of it as a cousin to&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2231450/Pizza_Tower/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Pizza Tower</em></a>, although the two are developed by different studios.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/antonblast-profitable-boss.jpg?itok=M1d8LByN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/antonblast-profitable-boss.jpg?itok=KTiKLFyv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Antonblast</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Wario</em>-style shenanigans are already profitable, developer Summitsphere says.</figcaption></figure><p>Playing as either the titular Anton or his "cranked-out coworker Annie", you must do battle with Satan in order to retrieve Anton's prized collection of spirits.</p>

<p>Along the way, you'll explore "bizarre worlds", battle "screen-filling bosses", and experiment with what Summitsphere calls a "totally dynamic playstyle" that allows you either to rush through stages at speed or explore them at your leisure.</p>

<p>All of this is wrapped up in what the developer calls an "urban graffiti-inspired art style", which is certainly true, although it's also quite clearly a&nbsp;<em>Wario Land</em>-inspired art style as well (no shade; I love that art style).</p>

<p>Screenshots don't quite do&nbsp;<em>Antonblast&nbsp;</em>justice, so check out the trailer below to see what the game looks like in motion.</p>




<p>A game like&nbsp;<em>Antonblast&nbsp;</em>achieving profitability in just under a month is no mean feat. It's not quite&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>becoming profitable <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-2-profitable-sales-350k" rel="nofollow">just a few days after its launch</a>, but hey, maybe Summitsphere's next game will achieve that lofty goal.</p>

<p>In the meantime, you can check out&nbsp;<em>Antonblast&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1887400/ANTONBLAST/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/antonblast-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>. There's no word yet on whether the game is coming to other consoles, but given that it's already profitable, I wouldn't be surprised if it did.</p>
