In fact, you don't have any longer to wait at all!</p><p>That's right: <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance </em>is coming to current-gen consoles today, and if you already happen to own the game on PS4 or Xbox One, then you'll get a "next-gen" upgrade for free.</p><p>The upgrade will allow you to experience the game's realistic rendering of early 15th-century Bohemia at "up to 60fps", which presumably means it will come with performance and fidelity modes on the newer consoles, a feature that doesn't exist on previous-gen machines.</p><figure role="group">

<p>As well as the increased frame rate option, you'll also be able to take advantage of sharper visuals and smoother performance across the board on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, making the current-gen versions of the game the best way to play if you're on console.</p><p>News of <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em>'s appearance on current-gen consoles comes after Warhorse and parent company Embracer announced that sequel <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 </em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-embracer-group" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fe50d517-d627-4fd8-90a9-f33dfd15cfc7" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">has sold five million copies</a> since launching last year.</p><p>The first game is no slouch in the sales department either; it's sold over ten million copies at time of writing, a figure that will no doubt increase further now that more people are able to access it.</p><p>If you're unfamiliar with <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em>, it's an action RPG that emphasizes realism and historical accuracy over the usual dragons-and-wizards malarkey (which has its place!). The game is set in 15th-century Bohemia and follows the story of blacksmith's son Henry as he gets embroiled in political intrigue.</p>
<p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance </em>is available to buy right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/379430/Kingdom_Come_Deliverance/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, and it's dropping on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S today as well.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The first two <em>Dino Crisis </em>games are now available on Steam, and if you pick them up in the next couple of weeks, you'll get a hefty discount on them as well.</p><p>Announcing the games' release <a href="https://x.com/CapcomUSA_/status/2022113977564590098" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">on X</a>, Capcom also revealed that until February 26th, both <em>Dino Crisis </em>and <em>Dino Crisis 2 </em>will be available at a whopping 50% off, which means you'll only be paying $5 for each game instead of $10. I reckon that's a steal.</p><p>This isn't the first time these games have been made available on modern PC hardware; back in January last year, both <em>Dino Crisis </em>and its sequel <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dino-crisis-1-2-gog-rerelease" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9a82244a-daae-4a5c-94f2-821248b6e6ac" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">were released via GOG</a>, but if you're a Steam hound who likes all of your games to be in one place, then today's your lucky day.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>The first two <em>Dino Crisis </em>games are now on Steam. Rejoice!</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Just like in the GOG version, you can expect some modernizations and improvements as part of the Steam release of <em>Dino Crisis </em>and <em>Dino Crisis 2</em>, including increased rendering resolution, modern controller support with "optimal button binding", and an improved internal renderer, plus lots more.</p><p><em>Dino Crisis</em>' Steam release rather puts paid to Shinji Mikami's comments about <em>Dino Crisis </em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shinji-mikami-dino-crisis-monster-hunter-comments" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="dda2b172-c260-4104-9653-3c47ee717026" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">no longer being relevant thanks to <em>Monster Hunter</em></a>; it seems there's room for both to exist in this storied world of ours.</p><p>These re-releases are nice on their own, but it's even more tantalizing to imagine that they might represent a revival for the <em>Dino Crisis </em>franchise as a whole. Perhaps that long-awaited <em>Dino Crisis </em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dino-crisis-remake-was-almost-made-by-capcom" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d29800e1-8fb3-4b0a-8fbf-042577dbe659" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">remake</a> might finally materialize now? Wishful thinking, I know, but let me dream, eh?</p><p>If you're not familiar with <em>Dino Crisis</em>, the first game is a survival horror experience akin to <em>Resident Evil </em>(but with dinosaurs, of course), while the second takes a more action-oriented approach with nods to arcade scoring and other more high-octane mechanics.</p><figure role="group">
