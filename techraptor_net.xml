            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-go-niantic-saudi-rumor<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report has emerged which claims that Niantic, the developer behind hit games like&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Go&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Now</em>, is in talks to sell its gaming business to a company backed by the Saudi Public Investment Fund.</p>

<p>According to a Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-19/-pokemon-go-maker-nears-3-5-billion-deal-to-sell-games-unit" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">article</a>&nbsp;(which, as ever, cites the old "several people familiar with the discussions" chestnut), a deal between Niantic and the PIF-backed Scopely Inc "could be announced in coming weeks".</p>

<p>Bloomberg reporters Michelle Davis and Cecilia D'Anastasio say that the deal could be worth "about $3.5 billion", and that the agreement between Niantic and Scopely would include&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Go</em>&nbsp;as well as other games developed by the studio.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/niantic-saudi-deal-rumor-monster-hunter-now.jpg?itok=Qlce0fml 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/niantic-saudi-deal-rumor-monster-hunter-now.jpg?itok=YtxcAIbm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Niantic is responsible not only for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Go</em>, but also for games like&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Now</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>However, Davis and D'Anastasio also emphasize that "there's no assurance an agreement will be reached", so it's entirely possible Niantic will remain independent.</p>

<p>If the deal does go through, Niantic will become one of many video game pies in which the Saudi PIF has its fingers. Others include Nintendo, of which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/saudi-pif-becomes-nintendos-largest-outside-shareholder" rel="nofollow">the PIF is now the largest external shareholder</a>, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/saudi-arabia-pif-adds-stakes-in-capcom-nexon" rel="nofollow">Capcom</a>&nbsp;and <em>King of Fighters&nbsp;</em>studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/saudi-arabian-crown-prince-to-buy-controlling-stake-in-snk" rel="nofollow">SNK</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, rumors are currently swirling that new&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Mirage&nbsp;</em>DLC is on the way courtesy of Saudi PIF funding sent Ubisoft's way, although Ubisoft itself <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-mirage-dlc-report-ubisoft" rel="nofollow">declined to comment on these rumors</a> back in late January.</p>

<p>As Bloomberg points out, while&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Go&nbsp;</em>remains a major hit for Niantic, the company's other games have had some trouble replicating that success. Niantic <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-go-creator-niantic-cancels-4-projects-lays-off-staff" rel="nofollow">canceled four in-development projects</a> and laid off a number of staff back in 2022.</p>

<p>Of course, we'll have to wait and see what happens; the deal is far from confirmed, after all. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things Niantic-related.</p>
