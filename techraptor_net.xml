            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-extradimensional-crisis<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has revealed a brand new&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>themed booster pack, with Generation VII's cosmic Ultra Beasts headed to the digital card game next week.</p>

<p>Landing on May 29th,&nbsp;<em>Extradimensional Crisis&nbsp;</em>follows on from other themed booster packs like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mythical-island-expansion" rel="nofollow">Mythical Island</a>&nbsp;</em>or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-expansion-shining-revelry" rel="nofollow"><em>Shining Revelry</em></a>; it's not a full expansion like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-celestial-guardians-set" rel="nofollow"><em>Celestial Guardians</em></a>, but it'll still come with plenty of new cards for you to collect.</p>

<p>As revealed in a brand new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Extradimensional Crisis&nbsp;</em>will bring a number of new Ultra Beasts for you to collect, including the ultra-jacked Buzzwole, the all-consuming Guzzlord, and the ethereal jellyfish-like Nihilego.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-extradimensional-crisis-buzzwole.jpg?itok=pzm2HdDB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-extradimensional-crisis-buzzwole.jpg?itok=-fiEAP6j 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>'s new&nbsp;<em>Extradimensional Crisis&nbsp;</em>themed booster pack is coming next week.</figcaption></figure><p>You can also expect other stars of Generation VII to make an appearance in&nbsp;<em>Extradimensional Crisis</em>, including the likes of the legendary Pokemon Tapu Koko, the experimental creature Type: Null, and Alolan Diglett.</p>

<p>The trailer also gives a glimpse of an adorable full-art Rowlet card, in which everyone's favorite little spherical owl has situated himself in a hanging basket. I wish it was possible to be as comfortable as that Rowlet is in real life.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>, it's essentially a mobile version of the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>trading card game. You can collect cards, trade them with your friends (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trade-tokens" rel="nofollow">up to a point, at any rate</a>), and battle to see who's the better trainer.</p>

<p>While the tabletop card game has some rather complex mechanics,&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket </em>is designed for mobile, so it streamlines things to allow you to get into and out of games quickly.</p>




<p>Released in October,&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-dena-revenue" rel="nofollow">an instant success</a> for The Pokemon Company and for developer DeNA, so you can expect to see new booster packs and expansions appearing in the game for the foreseeable future, at least.</p>

<p><em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.pokemon.pokemontcgp&amp;hl=en_GB" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pok%C3%A9mon-tcg-pocket/id6479970832" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">iOS</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/embracer-renaming-to-fellowship-entertainment-coffee-stain-to-spin-off-this-year.1196214/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-fellowship-entertainment-coffee-stain<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Embracer Group has announced that it plans to spin out Coffee Stain into its own entity by the end of the year, and that the group itself will also be undergoing a name change by that time.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-to-spin-off-coffee-stain-group-remaining-business-to-be-renamed-fellowship-entertainment/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a> on the official Embracer website, Coffee Stain Group will be spun off "into a standalone group of community-driven game developers and publishers" by the end of the 2025 calendar year.</p>

<p>By that same time, Embracer Group will be renamed Fellowship Entertainment, completing the company's plan to spin itself off into three separate companies, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-splitting-three-companies" rel="nofollow">originally announced last year</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/satisfactory-coffee-stain-embracer-group.jpg?itok=L6LnZdIB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/satisfactory-coffee-stain-embracer-group.jpg?itok=JBm-3Fs2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Coffee Stain will soon become its own entity.</figcaption></figure><p>Coffee Stain CEO Anton Westbergh says the move to become its own entity will give the company "the clarity and control" to navigate a "competitive" industry landscape. He goes on to say the goal is still "supporting our developers, staying close to our communities, and building an even brighter future for Coffee Stain".</p>

<p>For his part, Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors says Westbergh's "strategy and leadership" will help Coffee Stain in "attracting and enabling partnerships with like-minded independent game developers and talents".</p>

<p>As for Embracer itself, despite its new name, Fellowship Entertainment won't just be stewarding the&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings&nbsp;</em>IP (although that'll certainly be a major part of its mission statement).</p>

<p>The company will take with it other IPs like&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em>,&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor</em>,&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Dead Island</em>, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/4a-games-zen-studios-embracer" rel="nofollow">the&nbsp;<em>Metro&nbsp;</em>series</a>, for which a new game is currently in the works from developer 4A.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metro-embracer-group-coffee-stain.jpg?itok=D6GIwXz- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metro-embracer-group-coffee-stain.jpg?itok=x_vBraWs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Fellowship Entertainment, formerly Embracer Group, will take properties like&nbsp;<em>Metro&nbsp;</em>with it to its new name.</figcaption></figure><p>Studios under Fellowship Entertainment's stewardship include the aforementioned 4A Games, as well as porting studio Aspyr, publishers Plaion and THQ Nordic, and&nbsp;<em>Remnant&nbsp;</em>developer Gunfire Games, among many others.</p>

<p>Embracer isn't technically going away, however; CEO Lars Wingefors will establish a new privately-owned company by the name of Embracer AB, which will hold shares in the three entities spun off from the former Embracer Group (<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/asmodee-group-saddled-with-eu900-million-debt-by-embracer-group" rel="nofollow">Asmodee</a>, Coffee Stain, and Fellowship).</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what Embracer's business strategy means for the studios under its wing, but for now, it looks like nothing in the immediate term will be changing. Stay tuned for more.</p>
