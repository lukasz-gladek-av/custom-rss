            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Summer Games Done Quick 2025 has concluded, and the annual charity speedrunning event has racked up an impressive amount of money for medical charity Doctors Without Borders, otherwise known as&nbsp;Médecins Sans Frontières.</p>

<p>Per a press release, SGDQ 2025 raised over $2.4 million for the charity, with over 2,600 people attending the event in person and watching speedruns for games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/sekiro-shadows-die-twice" rel="nofollow"><em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/blue-prince" rel="nofollow"><em>Blue Prince</em></a>.</p>

<p>The amount raised this year is comparable to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/summer-games-done-quick-2024" rel="nofollow">last year's total</a>, which came to around $2.5m, so it looks like SGDQ is just as popular as it's ever been, which will no doubt put a smile on the faces of the Games Done Quick folks.</p>

<p>A number of new stalls and features were also present during this year's SGDQ, including a new "artist alley", in which attendees could wander booths set up by indie developers and try out those devs' games, which is a neat touch.</p>

<p>If you were lucky enough to attend SGDQ in person, you may also have caught the live performance by gaming-themed band The Megas, who performed pieces based around games like&nbsp;<em>Mega Man&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Castlevania</em>. Nerd heaven, right?</p>

<p>As for what lies in GDQ's future, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gdq-flame-fatales-118k-malala" rel="nofollow">Flame Fatales showcase</a> is set to air in September. It's a celebration of all things female and femme in gaming, and it starts on September 7th.</p>

Of course, Awesome Games Done Quick will be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/awesome-games-done-quick-2025" rel="nofollow">coming back in January</a> as well.</p>
