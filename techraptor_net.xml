            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/another-crabs-treasure-new-game-plus-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Another Crab's Treasure&nbsp;</em>developer Aggro Crab has announced that the game is getting a major update later this month, and it'll bring some oft-requested features like New Game Plus, a new boss, and more.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1887840/view/507324341817443971" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Steam, Aggro Crab says the update, which is "slightly earlier than our 1 year anniversary", will finally add a New Game Plus mode to last year's cartoony Soulslike adventure when it lands on April 21st.</p>

<p>Aggro Crab goes on to say that the mode doesn't "just lazily scale up enemy stats and call it a day", but instead adds new moves to certain bosses, new items, and remixes to "almost every enemy encounter in the game", plus a higher threshold for upgrading your fork and stowaway weight.</p>

<p>A new Boss Rush mode will also be made available, allowing you to take on bosses in "a variety of themed sequential fights" and win rewards like new costumes.</p>

<p>You'll also now find a Bestiary within the newly-reopened Museum, allowing you to see the range of enemies you've taken on as part of your journey through&nbsp;<em>Another Crab's Treasure</em>'s underwater kingdom.</p>

<p>Excitingly, a new boss fight has also been added. Aggro Crab stops just short of revealing said boss, but does say it'll be a "well deserved fight". Hmm.</p>




<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Another Crab's Treasure</em>, it's a Soulslike that melds the genre's classic third-person lock-on combat with 3D platforming elements and a greater emphasis on a linear narrative.</p>

<p>The game, which sees you playing as timid hermit crab Kril, was popular following its release, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/another-crabs-treasure-sales" rel="nofollow">racking up 150,000 sales</a> within just a couple of weeks of its launch.</p>
