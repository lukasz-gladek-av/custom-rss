            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/return-to-actuality-with-invisible-sun-electric-and-indigo-by-monte-cook-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Monte Cook Games has launched another Invisible Sun crowdfunding campaign: Invisible Sun: Electric and Indigo. The campaign includes another physical printing of the surreal fantasy TTRPG, a new supplement, and official VTT support.</p>

<h2>The <em>Invisible Sun: Electric and Indigo</em> Backerkit Campaign</h2>

<p>According to its Backerkit campaign page, <a href="https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/monte-cook-games/invisible-sun-indigo" rel="nofollow"><em>Invisible Sun: Electric and Indigo</em></a> contains two new products for Monte Cook Games' iconic, acclaimed TTRPG.</p>

This is a re-envisioned version of the physical game with redesigned books and game pieces. If you own a copy of the game via the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/invisible-sun-return-of-black-cube-live-now-on-backerkit" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Return of the Black Cube</a> campaign, you already have everything you need to play. Furthermore, the campaign includes the Vislae Companion, a book meant to give players a primer of the setting and gameplay basics.</p>

<p>The campaign's FAQ page further explains the difference between <em>Indigo</em> and the Black Cube. For <em>Indigo</em>, all core rulebooks are softcover, The Path of Suns is a mat instead of a game board, and the elaborate Testament of the Suns is gone. This was done to make <em>Invisible Sun: Indigo</em> a more affordable version of the game. This is reflected in this campaign's (slightly) lower prices compared to the last campaign.</p>

<p>For those already familiar with the game, <em>Invisible Sun: Electric and Indigo</em> includes a new sourcebook. Titled, <em>The Electric Sun</em>, it details a new emerging form of magic and its effect on the planes of existence beyond our own. It includes new magic, new characters, and new prewritten adventures.</p>

Full game support, including compendium, character sheets, cards, and more, will be coming both to Roll20 and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/alchemy-rpg-vtts-and-focus-on-roleplaying" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Alchemy</a>. Considering how complex and dense this RPG is, the introduction of VTT support considerably lowers the barrier to entry for new players.</p>

<p>The different pledge levels for the campaign are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>The Electric Sun (Digital) for $19:</strong> A PDF of <em>The Electric Sun</em> supplement</li>
	<li><strong>Invisible Sun: Indigo (Digital) for $35:</strong> A PDF of <em>Invisible Sun: Indigo</em></li>
	<li><strong>Electric and Indigo (Digital) for $50:</strong> PDFs of both <em>Invisible Sun: Indigo</em> and <em>The Electric Sun</em> supplement</li>
	<li><strong>Invisible Sun: Indigo VTT for $80:</strong> Access to <em>Invisible Sun: Indigo</em> on either Roll20 or Alchemy</li>
	<li><strong>The Electric Sun for $54:</strong> Physical and PDF copies of <em>The Electric Sun</em> supplement</li>
	<li><strong>Invisible Sun: Indigo for $179:</strong> Physical and PDF copies of <em>Invisible Sun: Indigo</em></li>
	<li><strong>Electric and Indigo for $199:</strong> Physical and PDF copies of <em>Invisible Sun: Indigo</em> and <em>The Electric Sun</em> supplement</li>
	<li><strong>The Breadth of the Actuality for $287:</strong> Everything in the Electric and Indigo pledge level, digital and physical game props and character tokens, a Testament of Suns, a set of physical Wicked Keys, and five Vislae Companion books</li>
</ul><p>Lastly, the <em>Invisible Sun: Electric and Indigo</em> campaign addresses how the company will address trade tariffs. Simply put, Monte Cook Games will be decentralizing the production of their products in areas not subject to tariffs. The books will be printed in Canada, the games will be assembled in the US, etc.. Lastly, potential tariff costs have already been factored into the pledge tiers.</p>

<p>Essentially, Monte Cook are they are doing everything possible to address these unwelcome costs to production with this campaign and are maintaining transparency with their users. Given the stated intention of <em>Invisible Sun: Indigo</em> to provide a cheaper experience, this makes sense.</p>

<p>At time of writing, the Backerkit campaign has raised $135,999, overtaking its funding goal of $100,000. The campaign ends June 5.</p>
