            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-season-2-emma-frost-ultron<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>NetEase has confirmed that&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>season 2 will begin next week, and the developer has also confirmed two new playable characters for the game.</p>

<p>As revealed in a new trailer, Emma Frost and Ultron will be joining the ranks of the Marvel-themed hero shooter when its second season begins on April 11th. It's not yet clear what role either character will play in terms of mechanics.</p>

<p>The debut trailer welcomes players to the Hellfire Gala, which is hosted on the mutant-led island of Krakoa. However, during the opening ceremony of the gala, Ultron interferes and essentially declares war on the gathered heroes. Exciting stuff!</p>

<p>NetEase hasn't yet revealed what else lies in wait for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>players when season 2 arrives, but if <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-modding-clampdown" rel="nofollow">season 1</a> is anything to go by, you can expect new events, a new battle pass, and perhaps even some more playable characters arriving later in the season.</p>

<p>Several heroes coming to the game have already <a href="https://www.si.com/esports/news/x-men-heroes-leak-for-marvel-rivals" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reportedly been leaked</a>, including the likes of Cyclops, Gambit, and Rogue, as well as a number of other X-Men-related characters (and, of course, Deadpool).</p>

<p>It is, of course, worth noting that we're simply assuming Emma Frost and Ultron will be playable; it's possible only one of them will be, or maybe even neither of them, unlikely as that may be. Nevertheless, you can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>season 2 right here.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>, it's an<em>&nbsp;Overwatch</em>-style hero shooter that lets you play as some of your favorite Marvel heroes (and villains!) across a series of objective-based gameplay modes.</p>

<p>The game managed to reach <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-40m" rel="nofollow">40 million players</a> within its first few months on release, but despite that success, NetEase still elected to shut down the Seattle studio responsible for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' creation <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-studio-shockingly-closed-by-netease-laying-off-everyone" rel="nofollow">back in February</a>.</p>

<p><em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>is available to play for free right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2767030/Marvel_Rivals/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/marvel-rivals/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-dlss-ray-tracing</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/switch-2-uses-dlss-and-supports-ray-tracing-nintendo-confirms.1154190/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-dlss-ray-tracing<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has revealed that the Switch 2 uses some form of Nvidia's DLSS upscaling technology, and that the console will also support ray tracing, although the Japanese gaming giant is being a little cagey with details.</p>

<p>IGN got the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-confirms-switch-2-uses-dlss-and-ray-tracing-but-is-being-super-vague-about-the-details" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">chance</a> to talk to Nintendo reps about the Switch 2 during a roundtable yesterday, and in that discussion, Nintendo exec Takuhiro Dota said the Switch 2 "use[s] DLSS upscaling technology", which he describes as "something that we need to use as we develop games".</p>

<p>Apparently, it'll be up to individual developers how the Switch 2's DLSS capabilities are used; Dohta said that "the software developer can choose" whether a game outputs in 4K natively or whether upscaling is used.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-dlss-ray-tracing-tabletop.jpg?itok=fR5sy10m 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-dlss-ray-tracing-tabletop.jpg?itok=HNoS0d7p 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Nintendo Switch 2 will support DLSS and ray tracing, apparently.</figcaption></figure><p>Dohta went on to say that the Switch 2's GPU "does support ray tracing", and that like DLSS, it'll be up to developers whether or not to implement it in games.</p>

<p>As for the GPU's specs, tech exec Tetsuya Sasaki says Nintendo "doesn't share too much on the hardware spec" and that the company prefers to focus on "the value that we can provide to our consumers".</p>

<p>He did, however, say that Nvidia, which is providing the Switch 2's graphics tech, "will be sharing some information", so we may well get to know more about the specifics of the Switch 2's capabilities soon.</p>

<p>If you missed yesterday's Direct, it was revealed during the show that the Switch 2's handheld screen <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-specs-revealed" rel="nofollow">will be a 1080p LCD with HDR support</a> and that the console's dock will be able to support up to 4K resolution. The console will also feature 120fps support in certain games.</p>




<p>We also got a first glimpse of the Switch 2's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-launch-lineup" rel="nofollow">launch lineup</a>, which will include the likes of first-party game&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a>, as well as a number of third-party ports and new releases.</p>

<p>The Switch 2 launches <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">on June 5th for $449.99</a> (up to $499.99 if you want the console bundled with&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>). Stay tuned for more.</p>
