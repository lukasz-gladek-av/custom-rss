            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/undaunted-normandy-north-africa-and-reinforcements-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Undaunted</em> by Osprey Games, is a series heralded as perfectly blending a deck-building game with wargaming elements. The series of games first started in 2020 with <em>Undaunted Normandy</em>, and rather than start with a review of the original game, we're working backwards from the latest game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/undaunted-2200-callisto-old-mechanics-new-tricks" rel="nofollow"><em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto</em></a>,&nbsp;and we're finally back at the start, in this article looking at <em>Undaunted Normandy</em>, <em>Undaunted North Africa</em> and <em>Undaunted Reinforcements</em> in our mega review! Be warned though, my grandfather won the Military Cross in North Africa so I'm super passionate about the campaign.</p>

<p>Although we've only just started covering&nbsp;<em>Undaunted</em> on the site, we have previously covered several of Osprey Games' titles, including the brand new <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bolt-action-3rd-edition-review-snapping-into-action" rel="nofollow">Bolt Action 3rd Edition</a></em>, copublished with Warlord games, and also some of their awesome supplements for their miniatures agnostic system,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/frostgrave-wildwoods-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Frostgrave</em></a>.</p>

<p>In games of <em>Undaunted</em>, as was the case in&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/undaunted-2200-callisto-old-mechanics-new-tricks" rel="nofollow"><em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto</em></a>, players draw 4 cards from their deck each turn and then use those cards to play actions from the tokens they have on the board, such as moving and attacking. Certain cards also allow you to draw more cards from your supply, or move cards from your hand to your supply, allowing you to tailor your deck as you play.</p>

<p>New tokens can also be added to the game board as you draw new units into your deck. Some tokens have multiple cards that can activate them, with the cards having the same unit or squad name, but representing a different individual in that unit or vehicle.</p>

<p>This card system, as well as working for actions, also controls a unique damage system. As a unit takes hits, you must discard a matching card from your hand. If you don't have a matching card in your hand, you discard one from your discard pile, and if there isn't one there too, you discard it from your deck. If you can't find the card at all, the unit is eliminated.</p>

<p>This can put real pressure on going first in the turn and focuses you on picking your targets. If a unit you have the card for in your hand is hit, then you discard the card and you might not be able to activate it this turn. It also adds a nice hidden element as you and your opponent try to determine how many cards units have left, and which is the optimum target to hit.</p>

<p><em>Undaunted Normandy</em> and <em>Undaunted North Africa</em>, aside from the different historical campaigns and the factions they contained, which we'll discuss below, are essentially the same game mechanics-wise. <em>Undaunted North Africa</em> has the addition of vehicles, thematically fitting with the campaign. Your troops can enter and exit vehicles (some are restricted to specific troop types), and then maneuver and use the armaments attached to them.</p>

<p>I really like the vehicle rules, especially the missions that use either all of the vehicles on both sides or the ones where only one side has them. It changes the dynamic from the original <em>Undaunted</em> games (which I also still really like), and makes it feel thematically in keeping with the campaign.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/undaunted-normandy-and-north-africa-6.jpg?itok=a4cPLcFf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/undaunted-normandy-and-north-africa-6.jpg?itok=YJT3NkKp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Undaunted Reinforcements</em> adds several new units to <em>Normandy</em> and <em>North Africa</em>.</figcaption></figure><h2>What Does <em>Undaunted Reinforcements</em> Add To Games?</h2>

<p><em>Undaunted Reinforcements</em> is a weighty box, coming in much heavier than either <em>Normandy</em> or <em>North Africa</em>&nbsp;core boxes, and it adds solo, multiplayer, and new rules and units to both.</p>

<p>For <em>Undaunted Normandy</em>, <em>Reinforcements</em> adds tanks, but they operate as normal units and don't have the vehicle cards that <em>North Africa</em> has that allows troops to climb in and out. It also adds 2 new unit types, Grenadiers for the US forces and Submachine Gunners for the Germans. For North Africa, it includes Sappers, Grenadiers, and Submachine Gunners for the Long Range Desert Group, and Submachine Gunners, Mechanics, and Snipers (to combat the pesky LRDG snipers) for the Italians.</p>

<p>Reinforcements also adds 4-player and solo games to both <em>Normandy</em> and <em>North Africa</em>, including scenarios for both, and the AI control card for the solo games. Each scenario has a specific AI control card for each troop type, which means that the enemy acts specifically for that scenario, rather than being restricted to a single set of commands for each troop type.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/undaunted-normandy-and-north-africa-5.jpg?itok=WWP04-c- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/undaunted-normandy-and-north-africa-5.jpg?itok=45lhrHCQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Undaunted Reinforcements</em> adds solo play to both <em>Normandy</em> and <em>North Africa</em> with AI control unit cards for each scenario.</figcaption></figure><h2>Does <em>Undaunted Normandy</em> and <em>North Africa</em>&nbsp;Have Different Factions?</h2>

<p>Both<i> Undaunted Normandy and North Africa</i> have forces unique to that campaign. <em>Normandy</em> sees the forces of the US facing the German defense in the early stages of the push into France. <em>North Africa</em> has the&nbsp;Long Range Desert Group working covert operations against the forces of the Italians.</p>

<p>Both forces out of the <em>Normandy</em> box have exactly the same stats and mechanics, and the scenarios see equal units deployed each game. <em>Reinforcements </em>mixes that up with different units and scenario setups. The forces in <em>North Africa</em> are very different, with the Italians being made up of traditional forces, and the clandestine forces of the LRDG focusing on demolitions and concealment (and big guns for when they need to go noisy).</p>

<p>The similarities of the forces in <em>Normandy</em> and the differences in those of <em>North Africa</em> are what make the 2 sets stand out uniquely on their own, and really capture the feel of each campaign. <em>Undaunted Reinforcements </em>emphasize what's already great about the forces in each.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/undaunted-normandy-and-north-africa-3.jpg?itok=XRkuFb15 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/undaunted-normandy-and-north-africa-3.jpg?itok=lG3E1h5Q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The units in <em>Undaunted Normandy</em> are matched and balance, and those of <em>Undaunted North Africa</em> represent the cover war fought by the LRDG.</figcaption></figure><h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On <em>Undaunted </em><strong><em>Normandy</em>, <em>North Africa</em>, and <em>Reinforcements</em></strong>?</h2>

<p>What I love most about&nbsp;<i>Undaunted Normandy and Undaunted North Africa </i>is that they capture the theme so well. <em>North Africa</em> especially in the incredible covert operations of the LRDG. There's a lot of replayability out of both sets, and <em>Reinforcements</em> adds some great detail to both, along with the solo and 4-player game modes. As with all the <em>Undaunted</em> games we've looked at, the solid mechanics make it a rewarding challenge.</p>

<p>Both<i> Undaunted Normandy and Undaunted North Africa </i>still stand out as incredible games, even working backwards through the series, <em>Undaunted</em> feels like a concept that was done incredibly well from the off, which has been able to carry through to multiple games, adding in minor tweaks and additions to capture the theme in each.</p>



<p>If you like the <em>Undaunted</em>&nbsp;games, then <em>Normandy</em> and <em>North Africa</em>&nbsp;are both excellent. If you have to choose between them, then <em>Normandy</em> offers a more balanced campaign, whereas <em>North Africa</em> sees different forces facing off, with the addition of vehicles.</p>

<p><em>Undaunted Reinforcements</em> offers a decent amount to both games and is still worthwhile, even if you only own one. The addition of the solo and multiplayer rules makes it a stellar box with a lot of content to add to your <em>Undaunted Normandy</em> and <em>North Africa</em> games.</p>

<p>If the WWII theme isn't your thing, then consider&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/undaunted-2200-callisto-old-mechanics-new-tricks" rel="nofollow">Undaunted 2200 Callisto</a>, which has the same great mechanics, with a sci-fi theme.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wartales-roadmap-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Shiro Games has revealed the&nbsp;<em>Wartales&nbsp;</em>roadmap for 2025, and if you thought updates and DLC would slow down for the gritty mercenary RPG this year, then it's safe to say you can think again.</p>

<p>While 2024 has been, in Shiro's words, "packed with updates and DLCs" (including a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wartales-dlc-the-tavern-opens-release-date" rel="nofollow">tavern management DLC</a> and lots of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-wartales-roadmap-july-2024" rel="nofollow">free updates</a>), there's more on the way to the game this year.</p>

<p>First up, in the first quarter of 2025, Shiro will release&nbsp;<em>Wartales</em>' fifth Community Update, bringing features like AI improvements (that's game AI, not generative AI), balancing adjustments, and new road battle maps, plus bug fixes and more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wartales-roadmap-2025-combat.jpg?itok=UAKuWQp- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wartales-roadmap-2025-combat.jpg?itok=4IjiOA0h 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Wartales&nbsp;</em>is getting plenty of new stuff in 2025.</figcaption></figure><p>Following that update, in the second quarter, Shiro will release&nbsp;<em>The Beast Hunt</em>, a new DLC pack that will offer a new storyline for you to follow, as well as a minor region to explore, gear to find, and a new profession to try out.</p>

<p>The third quarter will bring a sixth Community Update for&nbsp;<em>Wartales</em>, introducing a new notification log to the game, as well as the usual quality-of-life improvements and bug fixes.</p>

<p>As for the rest of the year, two more DLC packs are planned. One will let you manage your own fief; that one's planned for sometime around the third or fourth quarter. Finally, in Q4, another DLC will be released, adding a new region to&nbsp;<em>Wartales</em>.</p>

<p>Shiro is also promising "regular roadmap updates throughout the year", so while the roadmap isn't tremendously detailed right now, you'll get to learn more about what's coming to&nbsp;<em>Wartales&nbsp;</em>over the next few months.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Wartales</em>, it's an open-world RPG in which you must guide a band of mercenaries through a harsh and unforgiving world in search of wealth and glory. The game is available to check out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1527950/Wartales/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/wartales/9nwq686jb33g" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/wartales-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ultrakill-ultra-revamp-update</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ultrakill-ultra-revamp-update-sees-player-count-surge.1118439/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ultrakill-ultra-revamp-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Arsi Patala and publisher New Blood have released the&nbsp;<em>Ultrakill&nbsp;</em>Ultra Revamp update, and its impressive visual and performance improvements appear to have resulted in a player count surge for the ultraviolent shooter.</p>

<p>Released yesterday, the update is described by its developer as "a complete visual and technical overhaul of&nbsp;<em>Ultrakill</em>". The game's eighth layer is still in development, but Patala and artist Victoria Holland decided to use that time to bring previous layers' visuals up to par with the latest as well.</p>

<p>Patala acknowledges that "you won't notice a lot of the technical work that's been done under the hood", but he does say that the game's performance has been vastly improved, bragging that he and Holland have "improved the visuals of the entire game while also improving performance in each and every level". Fair play.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ultrakill-ultra-revamp-update-encore-levels.jpg?itok=ahQ5kwvr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ultrakill-ultra-revamp-update-encore-levels.jpg?itok=pwp1V3-a 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Two new Encore Levels have also been added to&nbsp;<em>Ultrakill</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as the performance and visual improvements,&nbsp;<em>Ultrakill</em>'s Ultra Revamp update has also introduced two new Encore Levels, in addition to reworking the way Encore Levels work across the board.</p>

<p>While they were previously "mere replayable levels with radiant enemies", they're now essentially new stages that don't look or play "anything like the levels they're based on", as well as being "about 10x harder" than those levels.</p>

<p>Not only that, but if you're a fan of Australian psych-prog band King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard (and you should be, because they're great), you'll now find three of the band's songs in the game, including certified banger "Robot Stop" from the excellent 2016 album&nbsp;<em>Nonagon Infinity</em>.</p>

<p>If you want to see how the visuals for&nbsp;<em>Ultrakill&nbsp;</em>have changed in the Ultra Revamp update, you can check out a before-and-after comparison video right here. It's the only way to do the update justice.</p>




<p>The update has resulted in a huge player upsurge for&nbsp;<em>Ultrakill</em>, too. According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1229490/charts/#1y" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, while the game has been averaging around 3-4,000 players per day for the last year or so, its 24-hour peak shot up to 23,011 at the time of the update's release, and at time of writing, 12,055 players are enjoying&nbsp;<em>Ultrakill</em>.</p>

<p>It's been a busy old time for&nbsp;<em>Ultrakill&nbsp;</em>recently. Back in December, the game got itself a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/free-mullet-madjack-update-features-ultrakill" rel="nofollow">crossover with fellow ultraviolent shooter&nbsp;<em>Mullet MadJack</em></a>, bringing a brand new&nbsp;<em>Ultrakill</em>-themed boss fight to developer Hammer95's game.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Ultrakill&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1229490/ULTRAKILL/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>.
