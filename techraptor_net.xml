It refines the foundation the series has been built on for decades: fight monsters, make gear from monster parts, rinse, repeat. It also tries to bring in new players with some creative swings. This is admirable since the series is notoriously impenetrable to those not already onboard, even with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/monster-hunter-world-review-hunt-worth-going-on" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Monster Hunter World</em></a> finding mainstream success.</p>

<p>While some of these decisions are hit and miss, <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> still provides that exciting dopamine rush when tearing through a dragon with some friends.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-desert-trek.jpg?itok=pIew5JMf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-desert-trek.jpg?itok=G6AdXIOc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A herd straight out of a National Geographic. Here's hoping a predator doesn't show up.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> Review – By Order of the Guild</h2>

<p>For the longest time, every <em>Monster Hunter</em> story was told in brief, impersonal text on a quest select menu. If you were lucky, there were worldbuilding details peppered in the environment or in supplemental material. That story usually amounted to, “Some monsters are attacking some people, go stop them,” or “Some monsters are acting odd, go deal with it.” Serious storytelling was never this franchise's strong suit; the narrative has always been a vehicle for the next hunt.</p>

<p>I bring this up because <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> manages to bring a conventional cinematic narrative into this franchise. The Hunter's Guild has sent your character to investigate the Forbidden Lands. What was believed to be an untamed frontier of monsters is home to a secret tribe of people with ties to the land's ancient roots.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-lala-barina-hunt.jpg?itok=YXqJDRjU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-lala-barina-hunt.jpg?itok=A51AYZoE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>That's it, breaking out the flaming sword for this thing!</figcaption></figure><p>But something has gone wrong in the Forbidden Lands. Monster outbreaks are threatening the populace and the environment is suffering for it. This means your job is to gather research data, hunt what is in your way, and figure out the cause of these monster attacks.</p>

<p>It's a familiar set-up, but the difference with <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is the presentation. Every story mission in this game has extensive cutscenes leading up to the hunt. These cutscenes involve multiple recurring characters, all with unique voices and personalities. In a franchise first, the player character and their palico companion talk. They're characterized as broadly taciturn, but it's something.</p>

<p>This guided narrative approach extends to the game's opening hours. Whenever you start in a new area, you get a guided tour. Rising and falling water levels in a forest. Mysterious ruins that act as lightning rods in the middle of the desert. Caverns with sludgy deposits of flammable oil. The list goes on.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-village-meal.jpg?itok=6gYowTtz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-village-meal.jpg?itok=WmmLz9-X 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The meal was good. The buffs were better.</figcaption></figure><p>I am of two minds about this new approach. It is a concerted effort by Capcom to bring the worldbuilding of <em>Monster Hunter</em> from the margins into the spotlight. In addition, it puts one of the franchise's greatest strengths center stage: making every monster feel like one part of a living ecosystem.</p>

<p>If you have never played a <em>Monster Hunter</em> game before, <em>Wilds</em> does a great job bringing you in with this cinematic presentation.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you are a longtime fan like me, this approach has reined the series' sillier side. The tone is less playful and certain parts of the game lack the series' campier elements.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A good example is cooking a meal. Instead of meals being prepared by a goofy band of palicos at a canteen, complete with the kind of showmanship you'd see at a Benihana, you just cook your meals yourself over a small grill. The presentation of the food still makes your mouth water, but how it is delivered to your table is more forgettable.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-ajarakan-hunt.jpg?itok=vTDHUMHe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-ajarakan-hunt.jpg?itok=gZxOjQm6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Go ahead, move forward. See what happens.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> Review – Sharpening Old Blades</h2>

<p>In the gameplay department <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is a refinement across the board. The 14 different weapon types are still here and play exactly as you expect but with some notable quality-of-life improvements. Certain weapons that require charging like the Switch Axe or Charge Blade, will automatically do so the first time you try to use a relevant ability. No more impotently hitting a dragon's flank here.</p>

<p>In addition, the Long Sword and Dual Blades have gotten faster and more acrobatic. Attack animations are packed with fluid spins and twirls, giving you more control over your positioning during a battle. As for Hunting Horn mains, the old support buff system from <em>Monster Hunter World</em> has returned.</p>

<p>A new wrinkle to these monster hunts is the introduction of wounds. If you hit a certain body part enough times, that monster will gain a wound. These are represented as red glowing spots on the monster. Hit this area with a focused attack and you'll deal a bunch of damage, stagger the monster, and get a monster part for your trouble. It is a fantastic addition to the hunt gameplay since it allows you to strategically stagger your target, giving you more control over the battlefield.</p>

<p>Complimenting this are new creative ways the environment is affected as you hunt. Fighting a monster in the desert can lead to sinkholes forming. Vines of jungle trees can be struck down for improvised net traps. Some of these elements were in place in <em>Monster Hunter World</em>, but they feel more fleshed out in <em>Wilds</em>, leading to some stellar setpieces.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-uth-duna-mount.jpg?itok=C22nI_i9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-uth-duna-mount.jpg?itok=bqCTMcyZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Time to break this thing's face open.</figcaption></figure><p>These are welcome additions that bring more tactility to the <em>Monster Hunter</em> experience. But the trade-off is a lack of hunt variety. There are no alternate hunt challenges like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/monster-hunter-rise-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Monster Hunter Rise's</em></a> Rampage hunts or any unique weapon stances or abilities to figure out. There is meaty endgame material here as well as some arena hunts, but they are few and far between.</p>

<p>As for the new player experience,<em> Monster Hunter Wilds</em> does its best not to overwhelm. From the start, the game gradually introduces mechanics and systems. It slowly rolls out tutorials for whatever weapon you are using, how to sharpen your weapons, certain item crafting recipes, the importance of honey, etc. The game even has friendly NPC hunters you can call in for help, and their AI behavior is rock solid.</p>

<p>These are welcome concessions, but Capcom's answer to teaching new players still amounts to some text boxes. If you're starting out you will need to intuit some things. Things veteran players take for granted like focusing more on consistent combos than giant kill-shots, navigating the map, using the environment to your advantage, or applying poison or paralysis status effects.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-rey-dau-hunt.jpg?itok=LFUPwhbO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-rey-dau-hunt.jpg?itok=F6o1dWFZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Wearing metal armor to fight this thing in the middle of a lightning storm. Not one of my best moments.</figcaption></figure><p>This is not a failing on Capcom's part. <em>Monster Hunter</em> as a whole is a very hands-on experience. You are expected to get your hands dirty, get smacked around, and even fail at your first handful of hunts. In addition, the cadence of the combat is heavier than other action RPGs out there. While this makes the core gameplay experience unique, it is something you click with or not.</p>

<p>As always, the real stars of <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> are the monsters. The Forbidden Lands does feature some returning beasts like the Nerscylla and the iconic Rathalos, but the new creatures also make a good impression. Highlights include the Nu Udra, a giant octopus monster covered in flaming oil, and the Rey Dau, the result of someone combining a dragon with a railgun.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-rompopolo-artwork.jpg?itok=GAVEH3br 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-rompopolo-artwork.jpg?itok=acdVKC1- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A few more of these and I'll have a viable support set.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> Review – Grab Your Friends</h2>

<p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is the first entry in the series to introduce cross-platform play. And on paper, a lot of the endgame content highly encourages you to play with friends.&nbsp; You will need a crew to get the most bang for your buck.</p>

<p>On the technical side, <em>Monster Hunter Wilds'</em> multiplayer works. When I finally got a group together, it gave me flashbacks to playing <em>Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate</em> on my 3DS back in the day. Didn't matter if we were on PC or console, everything worked. Connections were smooth, shenanigans with bombs happened, and good times were had. On a less formal note, getting random help from sending up an SOS Flare never gets old.</p>

<p>What sours the experience a bit is how finding groups or matchmaking is handled. You can't just search for players on your Friends List or jump into a hunt in progress. Instead, there is a cumbersome code system alongside the same confusingly laid-out lobby used in past entries. It isn't as bad as Nintendo's Friend Code system, but it gave me flashbacks.</p>

<p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is a great entry in a beloved series. If you're a longtime fan, the gameplay improvements and new monsters are more than enough to pick this up. Alternatively, if you haven't touched the series before and are willing to get through a steep learning curve, the cinematic narrative presentation and imaginative monster designs will welcome you with open teeth and claws.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/why-there-should-never-be-bloodborne-remake<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Just before February's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-state-of-play-recap-february-2025" rel="nofollow">State of Play presentation</a> aired, rumors began to swirl that a&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>remake, or at the very least a remaster, could be imminent.</p>

<p>Those rumors were aided by Sony's move to DMCA two major&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>fan projects, namely a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloodborne-60fps-patch-dmca" rel="nofollow">60fps patch</a> created by modder Lance McDonald and a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloodborne-psx-demake-dmca-sony" rel="nofollow">PlayStation-style demake</a> made with love by the very talented Lilith Walther.</p>

<p>Of course, the State of Play came and went, yielding nothing in the way of PS4 revivals barring the frankly bizarre&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/days-gone" rel="nofollow">Days Gone</a> </em>remaster. Most other&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>fans breathed a sigh of frustration, but mine was one of relief.</p>

<p>Let me lay my cards on the table.&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>is probably my favorite game of all time. I've got its platinum trophy, and I've spent close to 200 hours in Yharnam, breathing in its eerie atmosphere and battling its deranged, skeletal beasts. I know that doesn't sound like a lot, but trust me, it is for me.</p>

<p>Here's the thing. There should never, ever be a&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>remake. I'm not even convinced there should be a remaster, although that's an argument I'd be far more ready to come around on. Here's why a&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>remake or sequel is a terrible idea and why Sony should never do it.</p>

<h2>The&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls&nbsp;</em>Conundrum</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bloodborne-remake-article-demons-souls.jpg?itok=UGjTxGi2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bloodborne-remake-article-demons-souls.jpg?itok=0qajyxqX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bluepoint's&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls&nbsp;</em>remake serves as an excellent cautionary tale.</figcaption></figure><p>In 2020, when Sony released the PlayStation 5, one of the console's launch titles was a remake of the 2010 action RPG (for there were no "Soulslikes" back then)&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls</em>.</p>

<p>Developed by Bluepoint, the remake garnered critical acclaim, with many praising its faithfulness to the original. This is a take that has always baffled me. Bluepoint's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bluepoints-remake-of-demons-souls-coming-to-ps5" rel="nofollow"><em>Demon's Souls&nbsp;</em>remake</a> is certainly shinier and more "presentable" than the original, but it has none of the trademark strangeness and atmosphere of FromSoftware's effort.</p>

<p>Much of that is down to creative choices that I'm sure were made in order to sell the power of the PS5. The land of Boletaria is now one of much higher detail, much shinier surfaces, and much slicker animations, but it has completely lost the creeping, misty dread of the 2010 original.</p>

<p>The music choices, too, are irritatingly tone-deaf. Listen to Flamelurker's boss theme. Composer Shunsuke Kida wrote a theme that sounded like a long-forgotten demon "lurking" in the darkest recesses of the world. Bluepoint's remake, by contrast, drowns the boss in the kind of bombastic orchestral arrangement that Hollywood would kill for.</p>

<p>Like many other gaming companies, Sony's attitude towards game preservation is occasionally commendable but usually selective. While the company has made an effort to add many PlayStation classics to its modern store, there are also a lot of games - many of which are exclusives - that remain unavailable.</p>

<p>A lot of the games featured as little collectible robots in Sony's celebratory platformer&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/astro-bot-review-90s-platformer-done-right" rel="nofollow"><em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>(which is great, by the way)</a>, including major titles like&nbsp;<em>Ico</em>,&nbsp;the original&nbsp;<em>Killzone</em>, and even the first few&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>games, are unplayable on modern hardware despite being hugely celebrated and beloved landmarks in the medium of gaming's history.</p>

<p>Sure,&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Colossus&nbsp;</em>has its Bluepoint remake, but here, we run into the same issue as&nbsp;the studio's&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls&nbsp;</em>work. What if I don't like the Bluepoint version? What if I want to play the original? Well, it's tough luck for me in that regard, I suppose.</p>

<p>In short, I don't think Bluepoint's&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls&nbsp;</em>remake gets close to the original for atmosphere and feel, but more to the point, Sony's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/sony-playstation-3-psp-vita-store" rel="nofollow">slipshod approach</a> to game preservation means that for many - myself included - it is now impossible to legally source the original without resorting to the second-hand market.</p>

<h2>The&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>Remake Game Preservation Problem</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bloodborne-remake-article-doors.jpg?itok=MHjUIds1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bloodborne-remake-article-doors.jpg?itok=CF1VOclL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sony's attitude towards game preservation has me worried about a&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>remake.</figcaption></figure><p>Sony has seemingly decided that nobody would ever want to play the original&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls</em>, and that the only legitimate version is the remake. This is a terrible attitude to take; even if you prefer the shinier, more "AAA-feeling"&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls</em>, this attitude leaves no room for those like me who prefer the 2010 version.</p>

<p>Should Sony ever make the decision to remake&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne</em>, there's every chance that just like the 2020&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls</em>, original director Hidetaka Miyazaki, as well as many of the other creative personnel who originally worked on the game, wouldn't be asked to return.</p>

<p>In the worst-case scenario, this would result in a remake that utterly butchers FromSoftware's original vision for&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne</em>, ruining the game's subtle, creeping journey from beast-strewn, blood-soaked horror to something altogether darker and more eldritch.</p>

<p>Now, I know what you're thinking. There's no guarantee Sony would ruin a&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>remake. Maybe it would be better! Perhaps that's true, but&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>is a work of art born (no pun intended) of its particular time and circumstances. Any remake produced by Sony would inevitably be a different product, because of course it would.</p>

<p>Remaking&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>would be an act of monumental arrogance on several levels, and one that would only be slightly lessened by ensuring that the original remains available to play in perpetuity. Given Sony's previously demonstrated selective approach to game preservation, I don't have confidence this will happen.</p>

<p>In fairness to Sony, one of the reasons the original&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls&nbsp;</em>may not have been preserved has to do with the PS3's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps3-emulation-playstation-plus" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">notoriously difficult hardware</a>. Other games, like Konami's&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid 4&nbsp;</em>and Sucker Punch's&nbsp;<em>inFamous</em>, also remain unplayable on modern systems (although I note the latter doesn't seem to have been considered for a remaster).</p>

<p>The point, though, is that the ball, as with many other companies, is very much in Sony's court here. It's not so much that Sony definitely will decide to replace&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>with a remake (although I think I've demonstrated prior for that), but that it could, and if it does, the artistry of the original, like&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls</em>, could be lost forever.</p>

<h2><em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>Isn't Perfect, but It's Perfect to Me</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bloodborne-remake-article-cleric-beast.jpg?itok=XCMY3LNM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bloodborne-remake-article-cleric-beast.jpg?itok=9szq5DO1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I think&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>does everything it set out to do artistically.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, there's also the artistic argument for why&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>shouldn't be remade.</p>

<p>Let's go back to&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls&nbsp;</em>for a moment. It's not just a product, a piece of entertainment to be consumed and thrown away. It's a work of art. To remake it largely without the involvement of the original creative team and then proudly stamp the original name on the remake with no embellishments seems to me to be a little insulting.</p>

<p>By doing so, Sony is essentially saying "this is our new definitive version of&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls.</em>" I don't think Sony has, or should have, the artistic authority to do so. I'm fully aware it has the corporate authority, but I don't find arguing for or against remakes from a corporate perspective particularly interesting or illuminating.</p>

<p>For reasons we've already been over, a&nbsp;remake would probably be given to people who may well be huge fans of&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne</em>, but who didn't make it, and whoever would end up making the&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>remake, they probably wouldn't have been heavily involved in the creation of the original.</p>

<p>Miyazaki <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/elden-ring" rel="nofollow">has moved on</a>. Sony's Japan Studio, which helped out with the development of&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-japan-studio-reportedly-shutting-down-this-year" rel="nofollow">has been closed down</a>. The team that came together to create the singular vision of&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>no longer exists in its original form.</p>

<p>If you love&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>like I do, and I really, really love&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne</em>, then you should rage against the concept of a remake for this reason.</p>

<p>To me,&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>is a beautiful, precarious marriage of everything I want from both an action game and a horror game. I'm aware of how precious I sound here, but if just one element was pushed out of alignment, the whole house of cards could come crashing down.</p>

<p>I can't imagine a realistic scenario in which&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>is remade and some beautiful, wonderful element of the original experience isn't carelessly tossed aside for some redundant quality-of-life improvement or gameplay tweak because someone didn't realize how important it was to the full picture.</p>

<p>Perhaps that's a failure of my imagination, but I'll offer you this guarantee (which is audacious, I know). If&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>is ever remade, it will not live up to the remake you're currently imagining in your head. Not even close. Better to close that book and wait, likely in vain, for the remaster that barely does anything besides touch up the game's minor technical problems.</p>

<h2>Okay, So Why Not Remaster&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne</em>?</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bloodborne-remake-article-alfred.jpg?itok=CBQpQ25q 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bloodborne-remake-article-alfred.jpg?itok=DPr2RgmS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Beast hunting is a sacred practice, and so is leaving&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>alone.</figcaption></figure><p>This is a thornier question, and it's one I grapple with from time to time. When I revisited&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>for this article, I found myself occasionally wishing it ran a little more smoothly or that its resolution was just a touch sharper.</p>

<p>A remaster could, in theory, fix these problems, but remasters aren't exactly perfect solutions either, at least not all the time. Let us remember the tragic, terrible story of Rockstar's&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto&nbsp;</em>remasters and how they <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rockstar-games-apologizes-for-gta-trilogy-launch" rel="nofollow">desecrated the classic originals</a>.</p>

<p>Ah, but it wasn't just technical glitches that marred those particular remasters, was it? Fans also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/remaster-fatigue-ballad-of-gta-definitive-edition-failures" rel="nofollow">complained</a> about odd-looking character models and newly introduced migraine-inducing rain effects. Proof, if proof were needed, that remasters also have the potential to ruin a game's artistic vision, even if they seem initially innocuous.</p>

<p>What about&nbsp;<em>Sonic Colors: Ultimate</em>, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-colors-ultimate-shadow-dropped-today-on-pc-via-steam" rel="nofollow">remaster that dropped back in 2021</a>? At launch, it ran horribly, leading to widespread criticism from players. Blizzard's&nbsp;<em>Warcraft 3: Reforged&nbsp;</em>led to the company dropping support for the original RTS, but it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warcraft-3-reforged-developer-update-does-little-to-satisfy-irate-fans" rel="nofollow">hated by fans</a>. No matter, though; to the best of my knowledge, you still can't easily play the originals.</p>

<p>Again, in fairness to Sony, its own remasters and ports are generally well-received (with some <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/spider-man-2-pc-port-bad-reviews" rel="nofollow">notable exceptions</a>). All it would take, though, is one careless screw-up like the ones outlined above, and a game I consider to be one of the greatest of all time suffers as the result.</p>

<p>Of course, there are always updates and patches to fix issues, but, well... why not just play the original&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne</em>, which doesn't need any of those things to play well?</p>

<p>This may be a heretical statement, but I also think&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>still runs just fine. Sure, it's not 60fps, but guess what? Your eyes will adjust. Mine did after just a few minutes, and if you allow yourself to be immersed in&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne</em>'s peerless atmosphere and excellent storytelling, yours will too. I can almost guarantee it.</p>

<p>No, I think I've found my perfect solution. Let's just leave&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>alone. No remakes, no remasters, and for the Moon Presence's sake, absolutely no sequels.&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>came, kicked all kinds of ass, did what it came to do, and left. Why, in our era of constant unnecessary corporate franchise revivals, can that not be enough?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nier 15th Anniversary Livestream Revealed for April]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nier-15th-anniversary-livestream-april</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nier-15th-anniversary-livestream-revealed-for-april.1117086/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nier-15th-anniversary-livestream-april<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has announced that it will hold a&nbsp;<em>Nier&nbsp;</em>15th anniversary livestream in April, and that the stream will feature appearances from key franchise figures.</p>

<p>Per the description for the stream on YouTube (for which we're using machine translation), the presentation will last for around two and a half hours, and will feature "the latest information on events and merchandise" commemorating the franchise's 15th anniversary.</p>

<p>Additionally, developers will hold "talks", and a "mini live performance" will be featured as well, with pianist Shotaro Seo and guitarist Takanori Goto seemingly set to perform, although we don't know what they'll be performing.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nier-15th-anniversary-livestream-replicant.jpg?itok=suwFcq76 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nier-15th-anniversary-livestream-replicant.jpg?itok=EKYTcq45 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Nier&nbsp;</em>franchise will be celebrated in the upcoming 15th anniversary livestream.</figcaption></figure><p>Naturally, the question on every&nbsp;<em>Nier&nbsp;</em>fan's lips is whether or not a new game will be announced during the stream. Square Enix hasn't given any indication that this is the case, but the franchise's 15th anniversary seems to me to be the ideal time to reveal a new game, assuming such a thing is in the works.</p>

<p>We're also nearing (or perhaps that should be&nbsp;<em>Nier</em>ing) the eighth anniversary of Square Enix and PlatinumGames'&nbsp;<em>Nier: Automata</em>, which remains the last major tentpole franchise release, discounting <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nier-replicant-release-date-and-editions-announced" rel="nofollow">2021's&nbsp;<em>Nier Replicant</em>&nbsp;remaster</a>.</p>

<p><em>Nier: Automata&nbsp;</em>has proven to be a solid little seller for Square Enix; the game has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nier-automata-sales-9m" rel="nofollow">racked up over nine million sales</a> since launching back in 2017, although whether that's enough to match Square Enix's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-16-rebirth-profits-square-enix" rel="nofollow">notoriously high targets</a> is anyone's guess.</p>

<p>As well as&nbsp;<em>Automata&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Replicant</em>, the&nbsp;<em>Nier&nbsp;</em>franchise also got itself a mobile action RPG in the form of&nbsp;<em>Nier Reincarnation</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nier-reincarnation-has-opened-pre-registrations-for-ios-and-android" rel="nofollow">launched in 2021</a>&nbsp;and ran for a few years before <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nier-reincarnation-shutting-down" rel="nofollow">shutting down in April last year</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nier-15th-anniversary-livestream-engels.jpg?itok=YOq7M7oz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nier-15th-anniversary-livestream-engels.jpg?itok=-b5d2mGB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hopefully,&nbsp;<em>Nier: Automata&nbsp;</em>won't be the last major&nbsp;<em>Nier&nbsp;</em>game.</figcaption></figure><p>Two and a half hours is a mighty long time, but it's entirely possible Square Enix intends to use that time simply having&nbsp;<em>Nier&nbsp;</em>personnel reminisce about the franchise, which still wouldn't be a bad way to spend the stream.</p>

<p>In any case, the&nbsp;<em>Nier&nbsp;</em>15th anniversary livestream is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/3FQD3gUBShw" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">set to air on April 19th</a> at 6pm Japanese time, which works out at around 5am Eastern or 2am Pacific. Looks like you're going to have to wake up early for this one.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/katamari-creators-to-a-t-gets-may-release-date.1117044/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/to-a-t-release-date-katamari-creator<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Keita Takahashi, the creator of games like&nbsp;<em>Katamari Damacy&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Wattam</em>, has revealed the release date for his latest game&nbsp;<em>To a T</em>. It's scheduled to hit Xbox and PC later this year.</p>

<p>Per a new trailer,&nbsp;<em>To a T&nbsp;</em>will launch across Xbox Series X|S and PC on May 28th. It sounds as though the Xbox One version, which was apparently revealed back when the game was <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2023/06/annapurna-interactive-uvula-and-keita-takahashi-announce-to-a-t-for-xbox-series-xbox-one-and-pc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">unveiled in 2023</a>, is no longer happening.</p>

<p>Takahashi and his team describe&nbsp;<em>To a T&nbsp;</em>as "a narrative adventure game...with a strong focus on character, interaction, story, and exploration". You will play the role of Teen, a teenager permanently stuck in a T-pose trying to live a normal life. Hey, at least nobody will challenge Teen's dominance.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/to-a-t-release-date-katamari-creator-teen.jpg?itok=X6bxnQjO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/to-a-t-release-date-katamari-creator-teen.jpg?itok=Us_jC-kL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>To a T&nbsp;</em>turns T-posing into a plot element.</figcaption></figure><p>You'll have to help Teen try and live as best they can, controlling them in "a variety of different scenarios" like moving their arm to eat, petting their dog, and more.</p>

<p>As well as helping Teen with their everyday life, you'll also be able to explore the town in which they live, meeting its inhabitants and collecting coins scattered around the streets. <em>To a T</em> will offer a "free mode" that will allow you to explore at your leisure.</p>

<p>Not only that, but you'll also be able to customize Teen in whatever style you like, purchasing clothing from stores you'll find around town. Don't worry, though; I'm pretty sure you won't need to buy those clothes with real currency.</p>

<p>You can check out the (frankly adorable) release date trailer for&nbsp;<em>To a T&nbsp;</em>right here. It features an original song, "Giraffe Song", sung by none other than&nbsp;<em>Steven Universe</em>'s Rebecca Sugar, as well as exactly the kind of visual style you'd expect from the creator of&nbsp;<em>Katamari&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/wattam" rel="nofollow"><em>Wattam</em></a>.</p>




<p><em>To a T&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1875320/to_a_T/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/to-a-t/9NM6NMBJ7ZK4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on May 28th. It'll also be available as part of Xbox Game Pass on day one, although you'll <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-price-hike-new-tier" rel="nofollow">need to be subscribed</a> to either PC Game Pass or Game Pass Ultimate to play it.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortal-kombat-1-t-1000-dlc-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mortal-kombat-1-t-1000-dlc-release-date-revealed.1117041/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortal-kombat-1-t-1000-dlc-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Warner Bros and NetherRealm Studios have revealed the release date for&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>'s upcoming T-1000 DLC, and it won't be long before you get to slice your opponents apart as Robert Patrick's intimidating automaton.</p>

<p>Per a new trailer showing off the T-1000's moves, the character, who is the latest crossover fighter to appear as part of the game's&nbsp;<em>Khaos Reigns&nbsp;</em>expansion, will be released for owners of that expansion on March 18th and for everyone else on March 25th.</p>

<p>The T-1000 wears his (its?) iconic police officer uniform from&nbsp;<em>Terminator 2: Judgment Day</em>, and since the newer model is a shapeshifter, it can be seen transforming its arms into weapons like blades and Kabal-esque hookswords.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/t-1000-johnny-cage-mortal-kombat-1.jpg?itok=JBwFNUZO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/t-1000-johnny-cage-mortal-kombat-1.jpg?itok=1Xpp0kqp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The T-1000 will fit into&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>'s violent world perfectly.</figcaption></figure><p>During the closing moments of the DLC fighter's teaser trailer, after he's beaten Johnny Cage to a pulp, we see him using his Fatality, in which he uses&nbsp;<em>Terminator 2</em>'s infamous truck to pulverize his opponent before hopping out of the driver's seat and finishing the job with a submachine gun.</p>

<p>It's not just the T-1000, either. The trailer also teases a little of new Kameo fighter Madam Bo, who appears in&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>'s main story mode as the owner of the Fengjian Teahouse and a friend to Raiden and Kung Lao.</p>

<p>In the trailer, she can be seen leapfrogging over the T-1000 to deliver some pretty impressive martial arts moves of her own, so it looks like she'll be a formidable ally.</p>

<p>You can check out the release date trailer for the T-1000 right here, with&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat&nbsp;</em>head honcho Ed Boon <a href="https://x.com/noobde/status/1893814056609263619" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">promising</a> that a longer trailer will be on the way "soon".</p>




<p>The T-1000 is just the latest crossover fighter to appear in&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>. He's preceded by the likes of&nbsp;<em>The Boys</em>' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortal-kombat-1-homelander-first-look" rel="nofollow">Homelander</a>, DC antihero&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortal-kombat-1-peacemaker-gameplay" rel="nofollow">Peacemaker</a>, and&nbsp;<em>Invincible</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-mortal-kombat-1-dlc-omni-man-gets-gameplay-reveal-november-release-window" rel="nofollow">Omni-Man</a> (are you sensing a pattern emerging here?).</p>

<p>The game's roster has also been expanded with fighters from previous&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat&nbsp;</em>games, including telekinetic ninja <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortal-kombat-1-ermac-release-date" rel="nofollow">Ermac</a> and Netherrealm sorcerer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/john-cena-will-voice-peacemaker-in-mortal-kombat-1-while-quan-chi-gets-release-date" rel="nofollow">Quan Chi</a>.</p>

<p>Patrick's single-minded automaton, as well as the upcoming Conan the Barbarian DLC, won't be the only crossover in&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat</em>'s future, either; Lin Kuei ninja Sub-Zero recently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-lawless-update-chapter-6-season-2" rel="nofollow">found his way into&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em></a>, and it's been rumored that his rival Scorpion will be appearing later in the game's newest season as well.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1971870/Mortal_Kombat_1/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/mortal-kombat-1/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/mortal-kombat-1/9N7271QN4SGB" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/mortal-kombat-1-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>. The game's T-1000 DLC launches on March 25th for general players and March 18th for&nbsp;<em>Khaos Reigns&nbsp;</em>owners.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bossa-studios-layoffs-restructuring</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bossa-studios-layoffs-restructuring<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Surgeon Simulator&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>I Am Bread&nbsp;</em>developer Bossa Studios has announced it will lay off an undisclosed number of employees, and that it will restructure its operations to focus on smaller projects.</p>

<p>In a LinkedIn <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bossa-games_activity-7298367748902912001-h4lt/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/surgeon-simulator-developer-bossa-games-confirms-layoffs-amid-industry-turmoil-" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Game Developer</a>), Bossa co-CEO Henrique Olifiers says that the "disruption" brought to the games industry in the past couple of years has seen "treasured studios, teams, and games being <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-shuts-down-saints-row-developer-volition" rel="nofollow">shut down</a> or significantly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sumo-group-layoffs-refocus" rel="nofollow">scaled back</a>".</p>

<p>Olifiers calls this a "fundamental transformation" of the industry and says that Bossa isn't immune to it; his studio has made the "painful decision" to scale itself back, which means "saying very difficult goodbyes to extremely talented and treasured colleagues", although he doesn't say how many or in which areas of the studio.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/surgeon-simulator-2-bossa-studios-layoffs.jpg?itok=PYbTtKDg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/surgeon-simulator-2-bossa-studios-layoffs.jpg?itok=o6vevPkx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bossa Studios is to lay off an undisclosed number of employees.</figcaption></figure><p>Olifiers goes on to say that Bossa will be focusing on the upcoming launch of open-world survival-crafter&nbsp;<em>Lost Skies</em>, which is currently in "late-stage production". The game does not yet have a release date.</p>

<p>He says that once&nbsp;<em>Lost Skies&nbsp;</em>is out and "enjoying live operations", Bossa will "reshape into small teams working independently on novel game ideas", with a view to releasing those games "as early as possible".</p>

<p>In closing, Olifiers says he and his team wish they had "found a way of navigating [industry] turmoil without resorting to the decision of scaling back [their] teams", but that they "failed" to do so.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time in the last year or so that Bossa has laid off employees. Back in January, the studio said that it had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bossa-studios-and-archiact-hit-by-layoffs" rel="nofollow">laid off around a third of its workforce</a>, with Olifiers putting those layoffs down to increasing costs, delayed funding, and the troubles faced by smaller games in the market.</p>

In recent weeks, we've seen the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/oxenfree-night-school-layoffs" rel="nofollow"><em>Oxenfree&nbsp;</em>studio Night School</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Killer Instinct&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rumbleverse-and-killer-instct-studio-iron-galaxy-suffers-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Iron Galaxy</a> reducing staff.</p>

<p>It's not just smaller studios, either; NetEase recently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-studio-shockingly-closed-by-netease-laying-off-everyone" rel="nofollow">laid off the entire team</a> responsible for developing&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>in Seattle, despite the fact that the game had 40 million (admittedly not necessarily active) players <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-40m" rel="nofollow">at last count</a>.</p>
