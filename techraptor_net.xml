            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has revealed that it intends to undergo a major internal restructuring into new units called "Creative Houses", following disappointing first-quarter financial results for the company.</p>

<p>As part of its latest <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/5wMXD5U7aP5imdxB186rmg/d3ffd32ed3c2821d7e89d3c48d0ade35/Ubisoft_FY26_Q1_Sales_EN_vf.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">financial statement</a>, Ubisoft says these "Creative Houses" will help to "enhance quality, focus, autonomy, and accountability" across the company. The new entity Ubisoft <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft--report-new-gaming-entity-core-ip" rel="nofollow">created earlier this year</a> to shepherd its core IP will serve as the first Creative House, but we don't know what the others will be yet.</p>

<p>In terms of financials, Ubisoft reported a 3.9% drop in sales when compared to the previous year, as well as a 2.9% drop in net bookings. The studio blames "a lower-than-expected performance for&nbsp;<em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>", as well as "a partnership that is now expected to materialize in Q2".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rainbow-six-siege-ubisoft-financials-reorganization.jpg?itok=Ac_wXmMA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rainbow-six-siege-ubisoft-financials-reorganization.jpg?itok=lAS_EreS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ubisoft blames&nbsp;<em>Rainbow Six Siege&nbsp;</em>for its poor first-quarter results.</figcaption></figure><p>Despite these underwhelming figures, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot reveals that recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-circana-march-2025-sales" rel="nofollow">tentpole release</a>&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>now has "more than 5 million unique players". Presumably, that translates to sales as well, given that the game isn't available on subscription services.</p>

<p>This performance, Ubisoft says, is "in line with expectations", so while the game hasn't been disappointing, it also hasn't exceeded Ubisoft's predictions. The studio also looks forward to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-release-date-dlc-2" rel="nofollow">release of&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>on Switch 2</a>, which it expects will help the game "reach a broader audience".</p>

<p>It hasn't been the best couple of years for Ubisoft. In May, the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-financials-layoffs-possible" rel="nofollow">released its summary</a> for the preceding fiscal year, which showed that both sales and profits were down compared to the previous year despite the release of&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>.</p>

<p>Prior to that, in December last year, Ubisoft announced it would&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing" rel="nofollow">shut down the live-service shooter&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing" rel="nofollow">XDefiant</a>&nbsp;</em>and close two of its studios, with the French gaming outfit going on to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-layoffs-leamington-closure" rel="nofollow">close another location in January</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutdown-reorganization.jpg?itok=m-k6Xl8D 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutdown-reorganization.jpg?itok=QY_pKjgK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ubisoft shut down its live-service shooter&nbsp;<em>XDefiant&nbsp;</em>in February.</figcaption></figure><p>Aside from the aforementioned Switch 2 release of&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, it must be said that Ubisoft's release slate is looking a little barren for the next few months, so I wouldn't be surprised if the studio registers another drop in the second quarter. We'll have to wait and see what happens.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/splitgate-2-to-go-back-to-beta-as-layoffs-loom.1250925/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>developer and publisher 1047 Games has announced that the portal-based first-person shooter will be going back into beta, and that several staff members will be losing their jobs as a result.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Splitgate/status/1947717804364353641" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on social media, 1047 acknowledges that&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splitgate-2-1-0-release-date" rel="nofollow">"launched too early"</a>, and that in releasing the game, the studio "bit off more than [it] could chew", making <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splitgate-2-director-refuses-to-apologize-for-make-fps-great-again-hat-then-apologizes-anyway" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">"boneheaded mistakes"</a> along the way.</p>

<p>As a result,&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>will be "going back to beta", 1047 says, which means that "major parts" of the shooter will be rebuilt "to capture the spirit of what made&nbsp;<em>Splitgate&nbsp;</em>special".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/splitgate-2-beta-layoffs-rework.jpg?itok=rQ5j7Fn6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/splitgate-2-beta-layoffs-rework.jpg?itok=TnZ4toCq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>is going back to the beta drawing board, so to speak.</figcaption></figure><p>While in its new beta period,&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2</em>'s progression will be reworked, more portals will be added to its maps, and monetization will be simplified, according to 1047 Games. Not only that, but the studio will be "refocusing on classic game modes" the community has "been asking for".</p>

<p>As part of "rebuilding the core experience" of&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2</em>, which 1047 Games says is not a "quick fix", the studio says it'll be laying off employees to "shift [its] resources to focus" on the rework. 1047 Games doesn't state how many employees will be losing their jobs.</p>

<p>The studio does, however, say that it intends to "retain as many team members as possible", and that as a result of doing so, the servers for the original&nbsp;<em>Splitgate&nbsp;</em>will be shut down next month. As a reminder, updates for that game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splitgate-updates-ending-as-1047-focuses-on-new-project" rel="nofollow">ended back in September 2022</a>.</p>

<p>If you're an avid&nbsp;<em>Splitgate&nbsp;</em>player, however, you'll be pleased to know 1047 says it's "exploring the possibility of supporting offline or peer-to-peer matches", so while nothing has been decided yet, it's not necessarily over for&nbsp;<em>Splitgate</em>.</p>




<p>Despite dropping back into beta,&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>isn't going away; it'll still be available to play, and Chapter 3 will be released as planned. However, it sounds like more big updates won't be released until&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>is ready for release (again).</p>

<p>In the meantime, you can check out&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2918300/Splitgate_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010012" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/splitgate-2/9pf5q1b0fhsl" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New PS5 Software Beta Makes Multi-Device DualSense Switching Easier]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-system-software-beta-dualsense-switching</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-ps5-software-beta-makes-multi-device-dualsense-switching-easier.1250865/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has announced a new PS5 system software update beta, and if you like to use your DualSense controller across other devices besides your console, then you're in luck.</p>

<p>As revealed in a new PlayStation Blog <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/23/new-ps5-system-update-beta-previews-dualsense-wireless-controller-pairing-across-multiple-devices/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, the beta will start rolling out tomorrow. The main feature being introduced in this update is the ability to pair your DualSense with multiple devices, making it easier to switch between them whenever you like.</p>

<p>At the moment, if you want to switch from using your DualSense on your PS5 to using it on a PC, for instance, you need to pair the controller with the new machine every time you want to swap, but when the new update lands, that won't be the case anymore.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ps5-software-update-beta-dualsense-close-up.jpg?itok=rrVWxFet 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ps5-software-update-beta-dualsense-close-up.jpg?itok=rXL7004g 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you like to use your DualSense on other devices, the new PS5 system software beta is for you.</figcaption></figure><p>The new update will allow you to register your DualSense with up to four compatible devices at once, and all you need to do in order to switch from one device to another is press the PlayStation button and one of the face buttons.</p>

<p>Once you've assigned a device to one of the face buttons, switching to that device will show a different number of player indicator lights on your controller, corresponding to the device you have connected. It's that simple!</p>

<p>Of course, you can also continue to use your DualSense via wired USB connection if your device supports it as well, but it's nice to know that switching between wireless connections will get easier.</p>

<p>As well as the new DualSense switching feature, Sony has also revealed a new Power Saver feature as part of its Road to Zero <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/csr/eco/RoadToZero/gm_en.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">environmental plan</a>. It won't be live in this update, but when it does arrive, you'll be able to cut performance in certain PS5 games in order to reduce power consumption.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ps5-system-software-update-beta-console.jpg?itok=PFnruA7N 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ps5-system-software-update-beta-console.jpg?itok=Kf1MJb58 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The PS5 is getting a new Power Saver feature in future.</figcaption></figure><p>We don't yet know which games will support this feature, nor do we know when it'll land, but with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-ps5-release-date-enhancements" rel="nofollow">many</a>&nbsp;potentially&nbsp;demanding <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-ps5-version-late-2025" rel="nofollow">games</a> on the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gears-of-war-reloaded-announced" rel="nofollow">horizon</a> in terms of performance, it's probably better for Power Saver to land sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>In any case, the new PS5 system software beta begins rolling out in certain territories tomorrow. We don't know when the full release is coming yet, so stay tuned for more.</p>
