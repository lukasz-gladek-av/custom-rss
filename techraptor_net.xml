            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-edition-carts-games-upgrades<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has clarified that Switch 2 Edition cartridges will contain both the original Switch version of the game in question and the Switch 2 upgrade, meaning you won't have to download anything extra to play them.</p>

<p>In a statement provided to Australian Nintendo news platform <a href="https://www.vooks.net/nintendo-confirms-no-download-codes-needed-for-physical-switch-2-edition-games/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Vooks</a>, Nintendo said that physical Switch 2 Edition games will "include the original Nintendo Switch game and its upgrade pack all on the same game card".</p>

<p>Nintendo goes on to say that "no download code" will be included in Switch 2 Edition packs and that the cartridges therein will be "exclusively Nintendo Switch 2 game cards". Good news if you were hoping to resell your Switch 2 Edition games at some point, or if your internet connection is spotty.</p>

<p>In essence, then, first-party Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games will always contain both the original game and the upgrade code, but that might not be the case for third-party publishers. Caveat emptor, I suppose.</p>

<p>Just in case you've somehow missed the hubbub, the Nintendo Switch 2 was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">announced in full last week</a>, with a worldwide release date of June 5th and a US price (for now, at least) of $449.99, jumping to $499.99 with a copy of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">launch title&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em></a>.</p>

<p>Though the console is still on track to launch on June 5th, pre-orders have been delayed in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/us-switch-2-pre-orders-delayed-tariffs" rel="nofollow">the US</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-pre-orders-delayed-canada" rel="nofollow">Canada</a> due to President Donald Trump's sweeping economic tariffs. Nintendo also appears to be weighing up whether releasing the Switch 2 in China <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-delayed-in-china-thanks-to-government-regulations-and-demand" rel="nofollow">will be worth its while</a>.</p>




<p>Games confirmed to be getting Switch 2 Editions so far include&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, as well as&nbsp;<em>Kirby and the Forgotten Land</em>,&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>. Not all of them are <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-launch-lineup" rel="nofollow">launching alongside the console</a>, though.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloodborne-producer-teruyuki-toriyama-sirius-studio<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Producer Teruyuki Toriyama, who worked on the likes of&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>and 2020's&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls&nbsp;</em>remake has opened up a brand new studio, and it sounds like he's going big right out of the gate.</p>

<p>According to an Automaton Media <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/bloodborne-demons-souls-producer-establishes-new-game-company-sirius-studio-following-departure-from-sie-japan-studio/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, Toriyama's new venture will be called Sirius Studio, and it's been opened under the auspices of Osaka's Gz Group, which is usually focused on creating games in the PC and mobile spaces, as well as VR games.</p>

<p>Despite that, Automaton says Toriyama's Sirius Studio will be focusing on making "high-end console" games, as well as VR and XR (virtual and extended reality) titles. Sirius' efforts will span a range of both new and existing IPs as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/demons-souls-producer-teruyuki-toriyama-new-studio.jpg?itok=b1M0IGME 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/demons-souls-producer-teruyuki-toriyama-new-studio.jpg?itok=5-MKMlV7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Teruyuki Toriyama's name is on games like 2020's&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls</em>&nbsp;remake.</figcaption></figure><p>Per Automaton, Toriyama says that it's going to take a while before Sirius Studio is ready to announce its first project, but that the company is looking to start with a major project rather than easing itself in through a smaller effort.</p>

<p>Toriyama's time as a producer with Sony's Japan Studio includes credits on the likes of&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls&nbsp;</em>(both in its original form and its remade version),&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne</em>, and the PS Vita game&nbsp;<em>Freedom Wars</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/freedom-wars-remastered-announced" rel="nofollow">got a remaster earlier this year</a>.</p>

<p>He left Japan Studio, as well as Sony as a whole, in 2020, and his former outfit was subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-japan-studio-reportedly-shutting-down-this-year" rel="nofollow">shut down in 2021</a>&nbsp;(which may be a significant contributing factor in the lack of a&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>remaster or remake).</p>

<p>After working with Sony, Toriyama moved to&nbsp;<em>Soul Covenant&nbsp;</em>developer Thirdverse, but according to a Famitsu <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202504/38560" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">interview</a> (with Automaton's translation), he left when it became clear Thirdverse was shifting away from higher-end console and PC game development.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/teruyuki-toriyama-soul-covenant-sirius-studio.jpg?itok=kEcz4bBA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/teruyuki-toriyama-soul-covenant-sirius-studio.jpg?itok=Y5pYAc2r 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Soul Covenant&nbsp;</em>studio Thirdverse wouldn't prove to be Teruyuki Toriyama's permanent home.</figcaption></figure><p>What Toriyama will do with Sirius Studio remains to be seen, but the studio enters the industry at a time when <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/spectre-divide-mountaintop-studios-shutting-down" rel="nofollow">many</a> are finding it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ballistic-moon-closed-report-until-dawn" rel="nofollow">difficult</a> to secure or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/worlds-untold-netease-pause-shutdown" rel="nofollow">maintain funding</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, layoffs are still sweeping across the industry, affecting <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-studio-shockingly-closed-by-netease-laying-off-everyone" rel="nofollow">bigger</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bossa-studios-layoffs-restructuring" rel="nofollow">smaller</a> studios alike. Toriyama certainly faces a challenge in founding a new studio and creating a high-budget game in this climate, so let's hope he and Sirius can surmount that challenge.</p>
