            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/squad-22-zov-russian-military-propaganda<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Squad 22: ZOV</em>, a tactical RTS that appears to have the official support of the Russian military, has appeared on Steam, and although it's free to play, that very fact is arguably pretty concerning.</p>

<p>As spotted by the folks at <a href="https://simulationdaily.com/news/steam-russian-military-propaganda-game/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Simulation Daily</a>, the game claims to be based on the "real wartime experience of living Russian veterans of war in Ukraine". Not only that, but&nbsp;<em>Squad 22: ZOV</em>'s developers say it's "officially recommended by the Russian military" as a basic training tool.</p>

<p>In gameplay terms,&nbsp;<em>Squad 22: ZOV&nbsp;</em>is a tactical strategy game in which you must issue orders to your squad, presumably as they invade Ukrainian towns and villages and ransack the homes of innocent civilians. It's not the best look in the world for Steam, I'd argue.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/squad-22-zov-russian-propaganda-game-tactical-view.jpg?itok=Jq7mTYWj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/squad-22-zov-russian-propaganda-game-tactical-view.jpg?itok=zAnI1JS9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Squad 22: ZOV&nbsp;</em>aims to depict the Russia-Ukraine war from, er, the Russian side. Right.</figcaption></figure><p>Tellingly, developer SPN Studio and publisher Zarobana Entertainment say that the game offers the chance to "delve into the complexities of the 2014 and 2022-2024 events through compelling campaigns". I'm not sure if it's deliberate that the date range doesn't include the current year.</p>

<p>In case you're not aware, those dates refer to the 2014 <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26686949" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">annexation of Crimea</a> by Russia, then 2022's <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/world-europe-60454795" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">full-scale invasion</a> of Ukraine, referred to by Russian leader Vladimir Putin as a "special military operation". It's not exactly the most creative euphemism in the world.</p>

<p>Said invasion led to various studios voicing their opposition to Russia in several ways, with companies like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/games-workshop-suspends-warhammer-sales-in-russia" rel="nofollow">Games Workshop</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloober-team-halts-sales-in-russia-and-belarus-over-invasion" rel="nofollow">Bloober Team</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cd-projekt-red-halts-sales-with-russia-and-belarus" rel="nofollow">CD Projekt</a> halting sales in Russia and Belarus owing to the event.</p>

<p>The two studios say the game gives you the opportunity to "gain insight into the perspectives of those who lived through these periods, understanding how these events shaped their lives and opinions".</p>

<p>Of course, I highly doubt that&nbsp;<em>Squad 22: ZOV&nbsp;</em>includes any Ukrainian viewpoints on the situation; given that it's endorsed by the Russian military, I can't imagine that organization condoning any kind of game that attempts to be that even-handed.</p>

<p>SPN Studio says "some 2D images in game where [sic] pre-rendered with usage of AI as a base for work of our 2D artists", with those images "later drawn-over in order to make them geniue [sic] art". I don't think that's how "genuie" art works.</p>

<p>We've reached out to Valve for comment on this story and will let you know as soon as we hear anything back.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cd-projekt-profits-cyberpunk-sequel-pre-production<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>CD Projekt has announced that the tentatively-titled <i>Cyberpunk 2</i>, the upcoming sequel to the hit RPG&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, has officially entered the pre-production phase.</p>

<p>This news comes via CD Projekt's latest <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2025/05/cd-projekt-group-presentation-q1-2025.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">financial presentation</a>, in which it's also revealed that the company's profits are down when compared to last year, although sales revenue has remained largely the same and gross profit is actually up.</p>

<p>Last year, CD Projekt raked in around $26.6 million in profits, while this year, that figure fell to about $22.9 million, a drop of roughly 14%. It's likely not a figure CD Projekt will be losing sleep over, but it's less than ideal.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-cd-projekt-financials-phantom-liberty.jpg?itok=dySG16ih 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-cd-projekt-financials-phantom-liberty.jpg?itok=vuHvA9Mi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>'s sequel has officially entered pre-production.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, given that the company hasn't released any major games since&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Phantom Liberty&nbsp;</em>DLC <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-release-date-revealed" rel="nofollow">back in 2023</a>, it's essentially coasting on back catalog sales and revenue from its GOG.com digital storefront, so a drop isn't necessarily unexpected.</p>

<p>Those back catalog sales are still pretty strong, though, it seems. Back in November, CD Projekt revealed that&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>sales have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-2077-sales-witcher-production" rel="nofollow">passed the 30 million mark</a>, with the game managing to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-2077-generated-752-million-in-revenue-as-cd-projekt-shares-update-on-its" rel="nofollow">generate $752 million in revenue</a> for its publisher in the 2023 fiscal year alone.</p>

<p>As for the&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk&nbsp;</em>sequel entering pre-production, it could still be a while before we hear anything more about the game, unfortunately. Pre-production is a pretty early stage; it involves prototyping, conceptualizing, and other tasks necessary to get a game ready for full production.</p>

<p>Still, the fact that the sequel is moving ahead is encouraging in and of itself, and given the extensive problems&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>faced at launch, it's probably a good thing if the sequel has a more protracted development process.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-cd-projekt-red-financials-cars.jpg?itok=TEcX6JM2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-cd-projekt-red-financials-cars.jpg?itok=tU5KW9uC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>CD Projekt's profits may be down, but I doubt the company is panicking.</figcaption></figure><p>As for what else lies in CD Projekt's future, the studio is currently working on&nbsp;<em>The Witcher 4</em>, which it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/witcher-4-official-reveal" rel="nofollow">officially unveiled in December</a>. The game will star Ciri as its protagonist, although it's probably a few years off yet, so we don't know too much else about its setup.</p>

<p>Not only that, but a full remake of the original&nbsp;<em>Witcher&nbsp;</em>is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/witcher-remake-announced-by-cd-projekt-red" rel="nofollow">also in the works</a>, with Polish outfit Fool's Theory (which itself counts several ex-<em>Witcher&nbsp;</em>developers among its staff) handling the game's development.</p>
