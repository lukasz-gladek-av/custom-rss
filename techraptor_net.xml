            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/tales-of-valiant-players-guide-2-graces-kickstarter-today<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Kobold Press has launched a new crowdfunding campaign for <em>Tales of the Valiant</em>. The aptly named <em>Tales of the Valiant</em> Player's Guide 2 campaign introduces expanded player options for the studio's fantasy TTRPG, including new subclasses and spells.</p>



<p>According to its <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/deepmagic/players-guide-2-new-power-for-5e-and-tov-players/description" rel="nofollow">Kickstarter page</a>, <em>Tales of the Valiant</em> Player's Guide 2 offers players more customization options for their characters. This includes over 40 subclasses for pre-existing classes alongside three new classes: the Vanguard, Witch, and Theurge. Since <em>Tales of the Valiant</em> uses the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> 5e <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-releasing-updated-dungeons-dragons-2024-srd-at-end-of-month" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SRD</a>, that means all material in the book is also compatible with Wizards of the Coast's TTRPG.</p>

This preview showcases the Vanguard, which can be described as a support martial character. They can deploy banners and use stratagems to protect and aid their allies. An example stratagem is Close Ranks, which makes your group immune to critical hits and from being forcibly moved for a turn.</p>

<p><em>Tales of the Valiant</em> Player's Guide 2 is a 250+ page supplement that includes the three new classes, 48 subclasses, 150 new spells, a magical tattoo system, rules on new downtime activities, customizable base-building rules, and new vehicle upgrades. Additionally, the campaign features a 32-page character journal, custom dice bags and luck tokens, and VTT support for Shard, Fantasy Grounds, Foundry, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/alchemy-rpg-kickstarter-fully-funded-in-one-day" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Alchemy</a>.</p>

</ul><p>The campaign for <em>Tales of the Valiant</em> Player's Guide 2 addresses the concern of US <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/adjusted-us-trade-tariffs-to-china-still-poses-problems-to-board-game-industry" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">trade tariffs</a>.
