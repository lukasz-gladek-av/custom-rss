      <div><p>Official Netflix Catan adaptations may be on the horizon. The popular streaming platform has announced it has secured the global rights for film, TV, and unscripted formats of Asmodee's signature resource-gathering board game.</p>

<h2>The Netflix <em>Catan</em> Rights Acquisition</h2>

<p>In an official post on <a href="https://corporate.asmodee.com/news/netflix-scores-10-victory-points-winning-rights-to-global-phenomenon-catan-r-with-wide-ranging-deal" rel="nofollow">Asmodee's website</a>, they announced Netflix had secured the rights to produce live-action and animated projects based on <em>Catan</em>.</p>

It is a wildly popular board game. It has sold over 45 million copies, is currently up to its <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/asmodee-group-announces-catan-sixth-edition-is-out-now" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sixth edition</a>, as well as artisanal, bespoke game piece collections such as <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/catan-masterpiece-kickstarter-fully-funded-within-hour-promoting-bespoke-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Catan Masterpiece</em></a>.</p>

<p>That straightforward set-up will be the focus of these adaptations. Settlers on the fictional island of Catan navigating landscapes, shifting alliances, managing their limited resources, and dealing with robbers and bandits.</p>

<p>The producers for these projects will include Vertigo Entertainment's Roy Lee, Catan Studio's Pete Fenlon, Asmodee's Darren Kyman, and Guido and Benjamin Teuber.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<div><p>Millions of people are enjoying CATAN since it was created and for many, it remains a gateway to modern board gaming. I am thrilled to see the game expanding to a larger audience who will discover the richness of its universe, I find it exciting for the future of the brand.” said Thomas Koegler, CEO of asmodee. “It’s also a testament that board gaming is truly part of pop culture and a popular form of entertainment in everyone’s homes, and I am delighted to continue asmodee’s relationship with Netflix.”&nbsp;</p><p>
&nbsp;
Anyone who has played CATAN knows that the intense strategy at the core of the game has endless opportunities for some serious drama,” said Jinny Howe, Head of Scripted Series, US and Canada, Netflix. “We're thrilled to partner across series, features, animation, and games to bring this world to life for hardcore 'Settlers' and new fans alike.</p></div>

<p>The Netflix <em>Catan</em> announcement seems to be part of the trend of modern Hollywood leveraging recognizable IP for content. This has included turning the board game Clue into a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/clue-tv-show-has-been-greenlit-by-netflix" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">competitive game show</a>, and feature <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-movie-screenwriters-have-been-summoned" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">film adaptations</a> of Wizards of the Coast's popular card game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a>.</p>

<p>This also isn't the first time one of Asmodee's board games got a Netflix adaptation. As part of their <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/asmodee-gets-into-movies-with-radar-films" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">2021 deal</a> with Radar Films, the movie <em>Family Pack</em> released on Netflix in 2024. This adaptation of <em>The Werewolves of Miller's Hollow</em> currently sits at a <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/family_pack_2024" rel="nofollow">38% rating</a> on Rotten Tomatoes.</p>
