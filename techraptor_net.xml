<p>Per a press release, the medieval FPS will be getting a firepit display at the Chelsea Flower Show from May 20th to May 24th, thus "seamlessly blending the game's take on medieval stylings with cutting-edge craftsmanship".</p>

<p>The display will see several elaborately-designed firepit globes set among lush greenery, with the central firepit being built around the Doom Slayer himself and a number of other globes featuring designs of "intricate demons and elaborate adversaries" from&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>.</p>

You'll also find a pedestal with the Slayer's symbol carved into it.</p>

<p>Bethesda communications director Steve Merrett says it's "amazing" to see how&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>has been "adapted into a centerpiece worthy of any outdoor area", while The Firepit Company's Jason Andre describes the display as "iconic" and a "pleasure" to work on.</p>

<p>If you want to see the displays, you'll be able to do so in London <a href="https://www.rhs.org.uk/shows-events/rhs-chelsea-flower-show" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">between May 20th and 24th</a>, although tickets <a href="https://www.rhs.org.uk/shows-events/rhs-chelsea-flower-show/ticket-options" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">aren't cheap</a>&nbsp;and are limited in availability at time of writing.</p>




<p><em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>is the latest game in the&nbsp;<em>Doom&nbsp;</em>franchise, and the third game in the reboot series, which began with 2016's straightforwardly-titled&nbsp;<em>Doom</em>.</p>

<p>A prequel to that game,&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>sees the Doom Slayer battling back the forces of Hell in order to save humanity. It introduces a number of new weapons and combat mechanics to the series, including parrying, a throwable shield that can also be used to block projectiles, and more.</p>
