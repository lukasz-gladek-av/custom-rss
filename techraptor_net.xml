            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>GreedFall II&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Steelrising&nbsp;</em>developer Spiders has apparently become the latest studio to be swept up in the ongoing wave of industry layoffs.</p>

<p>According to a LinkedIn <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7353013917415079936/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> by lead animator Erwan Perrin (spotted by ResetEra user <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/spiders-greedfall-series-hit-by-layoffs.1249359/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Maxime</a>), Spiders will soon "proceed [with] a layoff plan" which will affect "most of the animation and rig team" at the studio. That's the team that creates character animations and frameworks.</p>

<p>It's not clear exactly how many employees will be hit by the layoffs, but it's not a great sign for Spiders if "most" of an entire team at the studio is being let go.</p>

<p>In many ways, the studio is similar to&nbsp;<em>Gothic&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Elex&nbsp;</em>developer Piranha Bytes, which should probably come as more cause for alarm; that studio, which was based in Germany, was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/piranha-bytes-shut-down-report" rel="nofollow">shut down in 2024</a> by parent company THQ Nordic.</p>

<p>Given that&nbsp;<em>GreedFall II&nbsp;</em>is currently in Early Access, it's not entirely clear what these Spiders layoffs mean for the future of the game. According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1997660/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, however,&nbsp;<em>GreedFall II&nbsp;</em>has a 24-hour peak player count of just 13, so things aren't looking great for the studio.</p>

<p>These layoffs at Spiders are part of a wider industry pattern that has seen multiple studios lay off employees, cancel projects, or shut down entirely, and the phenomenon isn't just limited to smaller studios either.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what these layoffs might mean for Spiders, but I'm concerned about the studio's future. Stay tuned for more.</p>
