            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GSC Game World has released&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>Update 1.5, which brings yet more improvements to the game's much-talked-about A-Life system, as well as new threats to face and more.</p>

<p>Following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-patch-14" rel="nofollow">May's Update 1.4</a>, Update 1.5's main feature is a big boost to the A-Life AI system, which, I think it's fair to say, was released in a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-a-life-20-gsc-game-world" rel="nofollow">fairly incomplete state</a> when the game launched in November.</p>

<p>Per the official <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/525346350588494399" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">patch notes</a>, the A-Life system now means "life in the Zone is now simulated for all characters, not just those in the player's view". This means characters will continue to pursue their goals and live their lives away from what you're seeing, and there are other A-Life changes intended to make the game's AI more immersive as well.</p>

<p>Of course, the new update also brings a ton of bug fixes and balance tweaks with it, so you might want to head back into the Zone if you've been having trouble with glitches. There's obviously no guarantee your particular issue (or "anomaly", hem hem) will have been fixed, but it's worth a go, eh?</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>, it's the long-awaited sequel to 2007's&nbsp;<em>Stalker: Shadow of Chornobyl&nbsp;</em>(which was recently renamed to reflect the Ukrainian spelling of the city upon the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-legends-of-zone-enhanced-edition-release-date" rel="nofollow">release of the remastered version</a>).</p>

<p>Like the original, the game will have you exploring the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone in search of artifacts, and you'll meet a full cast of characters, who have now been even further enhanced by the A-Life system.</p>




<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/stalker-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. No mention of a PS5 version has been made yet, but given the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-ps5-release-date-enhancements" rel="nofollow">friendliness</a> with which Xbox has been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gears-of-war-reloaded-announced" rel="nofollow">approaching</a> PlayStation in recent months, I wouldn't be surprised if a release is on the cards for the future.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-ps5-release-date-enhancements</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Team Ninja and Xbox have announced the PS5 release date for&nbsp;<em>Senua's Saga: Hellblade II</em>, as well as the new enhancements current owners on Xbox and PC can expect.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/06/25/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-enhanced-update/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Xbox Wire, the followup to 2017's&nbsp;<em>Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice&nbsp;</em>will <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-ps5" rel="nofollow">arrive on PS5</a> on August 12th. This won't be the first time the franchise has appeared on PlayStation, of course;&nbsp;<em>Senua's Sacrifice&nbsp;</em>got itself a PS4 release, after all.</p>

<p>Still, the game's release on PS5 marks an increasingly friendly approach to PlayStation on Xbox's part. Many of the studio's games are making their way to PlayStation now, including upcoming titles like&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gears-of-war-reloaded-announced" rel="nofollow"><em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em></a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-ps5-release-date-fight.jpg?itok=SPGvF60J 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-ps5-release-date-fight.jpg?itok=7iihfLaL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Senua's Saga: Hellblade II&nbsp;</em>is finally making its way to PS5.</figcaption></figure><p>In addition to the PS5 release, Xbox has also detailed a number of enhancements coming to the game for Xbox and PC owners, as well as those playing on Game Pass.</p>

<p>Those include a new Performance Mode, which will allow you to play at 60fps on PS5 and Xbox Series X (but not S, unfortunately). The PC version will also include a new Very High graphics preset, allowing you to push more powerful rigs to their limit.</p>

<p>Additionally, Xbox and Team Ninja say that when the enhanced version of&nbsp;<em>Senua's Saga&nbsp;</em>launches, it'll be Steam Deck Verified, so you'll be able to enjoy it on your handheld PC as well.</p>

<p>A new Dark Rot mode, which makes its return from the first game, will also be added to the sequel. Every time you fail, the Dark Rot will advance, and when it reaches Senua's head, you'll fail your run and all of your progress will be lost.</p>




<p>If you pick up the Deluxe Edition of&nbsp;<em>Hellblade II</em>&nbsp;on PS5, you'll also get a version of&nbsp;<em>Senua's Sacrifice&nbsp;</em>enhanced for the PS5, so if you haven't played that game yet, now's your chance.</p>

<p><em>Senua's Saga: Hellblade II&nbsp;</em>is, believe it or not, the sequel to 2017's&nbsp;<em>Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice</em>. It once again follows Senua, who's on a quest to rescue her countrymen from the Northmen.</p>

<p>You can pick the game up right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2461850/Senuas_Saga_Hellblade_II/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/senuas-saga-hellblade-II" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and it's coming to <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012536" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a> on August 12th.</p>
