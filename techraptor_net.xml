            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Several indie game developers have announced that they're moving the release dates of their games in order to avoid clashing with Team Cherry's hotly-anticipated&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>.</p>

<p>Last week, we learned that&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-september" rel="nofollow">will be releasing in September</a>&nbsp;(in fact, it's due next Thursday at time of writing), and a number of indie games have scrambled to move their release dates by a couple of weeks in order to compensate.</p>

<p>Today alone, Devolver Digital's&nbsp;<em>Baby Steps</em>, which was originally due to launch on September 8th, was <a href="https://x.com/devolverdigital/status/1960326361727258824" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">moved</a> to September 23rd, and cozy magical game&nbsp;<em>Little Witch in the Woods&nbsp;</em><a href="https://x.com/SunnySideUp_DEV/status/1960291045528547599" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">will now be launching</a> on September 15th to dodge&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em>'s release date as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/little-witch-in-the-woods-silksong-release-date.jpg?itok=DTFKDC6s 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/little-witch-in-the-woods-silksong-release-date.jpg?itok=Y5NA3PPE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Little Witch in the Woods&nbsp;</em>is just one indie game that has delayed its release date to avoid&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Yesterday,&nbsp;<em>Demonschool&nbsp;</em>publisher Ysbryd Games announced that its&nbsp;<em>Persona</em>-meets-<em>Disgaea&nbsp;</em>tactical RPG <a href="https://x.com/YsbrydGames/status/1960029218055864420" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">would be delayed</a> to November owing to&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em>'s launch, having <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/demonschool-release-date-september-2025" rel="nofollow">originally been planned for a September release</a>.</p>

<p>Developer Necrosoft <a href="https://x.com/necrosoftgames/status/1960035797387870674" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">subsequently said</a> that the delay was "not [its] choice", but that it "understand[s] why the choice was made"; the studio goes on to say that "dropping the <i>GTA&nbsp;</i>of indie games with 2 weeks' notice makes everyone freak out".</p>

<p>As well as the aforementioned games, upcoming Metroidvania&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/aeternathegame/status/1958804217373634579" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Aeterna Lucis</em></a>, "hellish gambling roguelike"&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/PanikArcade/status/1958882570210304059" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>CloverPit</em></a>, and 16-bit throwback adventure game&nbsp;<em><a href="https://x.com/Talegamesnews/status/1958593783161135519" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Faeland</a>&nbsp;</em>have all been delayed to varying degrees owing to&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em>'s release date.</p>

<p>These developers' decisions are understandable;&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>is one of the most hotly-anticipated games of all time, having been in development for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-is-hollow-knight-sequel-youve-been-waiting-for" rel="nofollow">at least six years</a>&nbsp;with very little news trickling down between its announcement and recent developments.</p>




<p>When it does launch,&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>will continue the story of the first game's agile bug Hornet as she explores a brand new kingdom, battles new bosses and regular foes, and platforms her way to the peak of a new Metroidvania map.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1030300/Hollow_Knight_Silksong/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10005908" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/hollow-knight-silksong/9n116v0599hb" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and Nintendo Switch consoles on September 4th.</p>
