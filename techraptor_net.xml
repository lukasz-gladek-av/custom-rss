            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dungeons-dragons-pinball-game-announced-by-wizards-of-coast<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> pinball machine is coming next year. Wizards of the Coast is extending the world's most popular fantasy TTRPG into the realm of old-school time wasters thanks to a deal with Stern Pinball.</p>

<h2>The Dungeons &amp; Dragons Pinball Machine Announcement</h2>

<p>The official <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> account announced the Dungeons &amp; Dragons pinball machine via a <a href="https://x.com/Wizards_DnD/status/1874138499051298872?t" rel="nofollow">social media post</a> on X (formerly Twitter).</p>

<p>The post contained little detail. It was a collection of eyeball emojis followed by a thirty-second teaser trailer. The trailer was barebones, showing illustrations of a dungeon, a battle map, a d20 being rolled, and a blink and you'll miss it face of a red dragon. The name of the pinball machine, <em>The Tyrant's Eye</em>, alongside this imagery strongly implies the machine will involve toppling a red dragon tyrant.</p>

First, there is a limited supply of these pinball machines. Second, the machines will only be shipping to the mainland United States. Sorry, EU and UK fans. Third, purchases of these pinball machines will only be available to All-Access Stern Insider members.</p>

<p>As for the price for one of these maines? The Pro and Premium editions of the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> pinball machines will be sold at an MSRP of $6,999. Furthermore, there is a Limited Edition machine available for $12,999.</p>

<p>This does beg the question as to what these pinball machines contain. What novelty will they bring to the game of pinball? Will certain creatures and characters be showcased like the conniving Xanathar or the magnficent Mordenkainen? Those details will be revealed by Stern on January 3.</p>

<p>The release of a Dungeons &amp; Dragons pinball machine is a natural extension of the game's growing popularity. One that has surged thanks to the rise of actual plays like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-10-year-anniversary-live-show-announced-includes-fjord-and-jester" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Critical Role</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dropout-announces-vod-dates-for-their-actual-play-live-show-dimension20-time-quangle" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dimension 20</em></a> alongside the critical and commercial success of Larian Studios' <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/baldurs-gate-3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a>.</p>
