            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-game-boy-may-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has added four more retro Game Boy classics to the Nintendo Switch Online library, so if you like your cult classics, then you're in for a treat.</p>

<p>Game Boy games, along with games from other systems, are <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-picross-donkey-kong" rel="nofollow">sporadically added</a> to the subscription service's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-game-boy-launch" rel="nofollow">library</a>, and unlike Nintendo 64 games (or the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-gamecube-switch-2-online" rel="nofollow">upcoming GameCube library</a> for Switch 2), you won't need an Expansion Pack for these titles.</p>

<p>First to be added in today's haul is the 1999 Konami game&nbsp;<em>Survival Kids</em>, which features some pretty innovative open-world survival gameplay for its time. It's a forefather of the DS'&nbsp;<em>Lost in Blue&nbsp;</em>series, and a new&nbsp;<em>Survival Kids&nbsp;</em>game is also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-launch-lineup" rel="nofollow">heading to the Switch 2</a>.</p>

If you're a fan of previous (or subsequent)&nbsp;<em>Gradius&nbsp;</em>titles, you'll probably love this one too.</p>

<p>Your third new Game Boy game in today's haul is&nbsp;<em>Kirby's Star Stacker</em>, a&nbsp;<em>Puzzle League</em>-style descending block puzzler that takes&nbsp;<em>Kirby&nbsp;</em>aesthetics and transposes them into a&nbsp;<em>Dr. Mario</em>-style gameplay system.</p>

<p>Finally, today's Nintendo Switch Online Game Boy lineup brings&nbsp;<em>The Sword of Hope&nbsp;</em>to Nintendo Switch Online. It's an RPG developed by&nbsp;<em>Kid Klown&nbsp;</em>studio Kemco, and while it's a little basic by today's standards, it's still got a rough charm to it.</p>

<p>All four of these games were previously available in the West, so none of them are <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-starfy-gba" rel="nofollow">getting a release outside Japan</a> for the first time, but some of them are likely not to have graced your Game Boy shelf in the past given their rarity.</p>




<p>You can play all four of these Game Boy games right now on Nintendo Switch Online if you've got an active subscription, and if you haven't, then you can sign up for one via your console's eShop.</p>
