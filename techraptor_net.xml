            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-mod-support-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizarding RPG&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>is getting official mod support via an update this week, developer Avalanche Studios and publisher Warner Bros. Games have revealed.</p>

<p>Launching on January 30th, the update will not only add modding support to the game, but it'll also bring official modding tools that will allow&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>'s players to create mods even if they don't have much modding experience.</p>

<p>In a new video explaining modding for <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, community manager Chandler Wood explains how modding will work in the game. It turns out you'll be using a tool called the&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>Creator Kit, which will be available via the Epic Games Store.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hogwarts-legacy-mod-support-update-toolkit.jpg?itok=nj3jSR0a 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hogwarts-legacy-mod-support-update-toolkit.jpg?itok=mO0uYwGH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>is getting official modding support soon.</figcaption></figure><p>Wood doesn't specify whether you'll be able to find the Creator Kit on Steam, nor does he say whether you'll be able to use the Epic version of the kit to play mods via the Steam version of <i>Hogwarts Legacy</i>. I can only imagine the game's community will have something to say about it if not.</p>

<p>Mods can range from character cosmetics and "small touches" through to entire dungeons and quests. Wood also confirms that Avalanche has been working with&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>modders to ensure you'll have something to play as soon as the update launches.</p>

<p>You'll only be able to access&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>modding if you're playing on PC, unfortunately. It doesn't seem like mod support or the modding toolkit will be coming to the console versions of the game.</p>

<p><em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>launched back in 2023, and it's proven to be a massive success for Warner Bros. Games, selling over <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-sales-30m" rel="nofollow">30 million copies</a> at last count. Given <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-flop-warner-bros-100m" rel="nofollow">how bad the publisher's 2024 was</a>, that continued success will likely come as a balm.</p>




<p>A sequel for&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>is in the works, and it's also been reported that WB Games is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-directors-cut-report" rel="nofollow">working on a Director's Cut version</a> of the game, with staffers from&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad&nbsp;</em>developer Rocksteady reportedly helping out on the project.</p>

<p>Whatever the case may be, you can grab&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/990080/Hogwarts_Legacy/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/hogwarts-legacy/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/hogwarts-legacy" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/hogwarts-legacy-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>, and the modding update launches on January 30th.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-says-no-comment-on-reported-saudi-funded-assassins-creed-mirage-dlc.1092732/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-mirage-dlc-report-ubisoft<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Over the weekend, a report emerged suggesting that Ubisoft had secured funding from the Saudi Public Investment Fund in order to create more&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Mirage&nbsp;</em>DLC. Now, Ubisoft has responded to that report...sort of.</p>

<p>In a statement provided to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-responds-to-report-claiming-its-signed-a-saudi-deal-for-fresh-assassins-creed-mirage-content" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>, Ubisoft declined to comment on the matter, pointing fans to the imminent release of&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>instead. It's worth noting that declining to comment doesn't constitute a denial.</p>

<p>The statement in full, as Eurogamer relays it, simply reads: "We'll decline to comment. We are focused on finishing&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>and excited for players to get to play it on March 20th."</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-mirage-saudi-funded-dlc-report-fight.jpg?itok=jVENmpim 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-mirage-saudi-funded-dlc-report-fight.jpg?itok=J2JcAe2H 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>More&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Mirage&nbsp;</em>DLC might be on the way.</figcaption></figure><p>The original report came on Friday courtesy of French news platform <a href="https://www.lesechos.fr/tech-medias/hightech/letonnant-deal-dubisoft-avec-larabie-saoudite-2144626" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Les Echos</a>, with YouTuber and strreamer j0nathan subsequently <a href="https://x.com/xj0nathan/status/1882849239434232101" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sharing</a> the story on social media platform X.</p>

<p>In his post (which is in French; we're using machine translation), j0nathan says that Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot reportedly signed a deal with Saudi Arabia's Savvy Games Group to develop extra content for&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Mirage&nbsp;</em>during a meeting last month.</p>

<p>Just in case you're not aware, the Saudi PIF is a national wealth fund backed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. It's been used to buy shares in companies like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/saudi-pif-becomes-nintendos-largest-outside-shareholder" rel="nofollow">Nintendo</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/saudi-pif-buys-1-billion-stake-in-embracer-group" rel="nofollow">Embracer Group</a>, as well as to outright buy up a controlling stake in&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/saudi-arabian-crown-prince-to-buy-controlling-stake-in-snk" rel="nofollow"><em>King of Fighters</em>&nbsp;developer SNK</a>.</p>

<p>The PIF doesn't currently hold any shares in Ubisoft, but this deal could signify an interest on bin Salman and Saudi Arabia's part to invest in the company, especially at a time when Ubisoft's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-strike-investor-letter" rel="nofollow">current shareholders seem unhappy</a> with the direction it's taking.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-mirage-dlc.jpg?itok=vZmjlNCq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-mirage-dlc.jpg?itok=hu7AHUUr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ubisoft says it's currently focused on&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>' impending release.</figcaption></figure><p>As for&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>, the game is currently scheduled for a March 20th release, having been delayed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-february" rel="nofollow">not once</a>, but <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-march" rel="nofollow">twice</a> since its original announcement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ubisoft no doubt has a lot riding on&nbsp;<em>Shadows</em>' success; its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-h1-2024-25-fiscal-results" rel="nofollow">latest financials</a> were very gloomy indeed, with high-profile games like&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing" rel="nofollow">first-person shooter&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing" rel="nofollow">XDefiant</a>&nbsp;</em>proving to be expensive flops for the studio.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see whether more&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Mirage&nbsp;</em>DLC is indeed planned for the future. In the meantime, you can grab the game now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3035570/Assassins_Creed_Mirage/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/assassins-creed-mirage/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/assassins-creed-mirage/9N4096HX1WWQ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/assassins-creed-mirage-review-it-feels-so-good-to-be-back" rel="nofollow">read our review of it here</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[JDM: Japanese Drift Master Release Date Revs Up for March]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/jdm-japanese-drift-master-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/jdm-japanese-drift-master-release-date-revs-up-for-march.1092675/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/jdm-japanese-drift-master-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Gaming Factory has announced the&nbsp;<em>JDM: Japanese Drift Master&nbsp;</em>release date, and the Japan-set "simcade" racer is coming to PC across various storefronts in March.</p>

<p>The game - which is "the most wishlisted racing game on Steam", according to Gaming Factory - launches for Valve's storefront, as well as the Epic Games Store and GOG, on March 26th.</p>

<p>It promises "winding mountain roads, scenic rural streets, and city highways" for you to race along, all of which will be located within the fictional Japanese prefecture of Guntama, an open-world expanse that "spans over 250km in main roads".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/jdm-japanese-drift-master-release-date-racing.jpg?itok=FDw3BrjM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/jdm-japanese-drift-master-release-date-racing.jpg?itok=T2ip4Es4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>JDM: Japanese Drift Master&nbsp;</em>hits the streets in March.</figcaption></figure><p>Rather curiously, despite being a fictional prefecture, Guntama will boast "the most famous tourist landmarks". These will include a recreation of the world-famous Himeji Castle, which is in&nbsp;Hyōgo Prefecture in the real world, and the Daikoku Parking Area, which you can find in Yokohama.</p>

<p>Unlike many other racing games,&nbsp;<em>JDM: Japanese Drift Master&nbsp;</em>also has a story. You'll play as Polish driver Touma, who wants to prove himself on the local Guntama street racing circuit.</p>

<p>As he tries to do so, he'll make friends among the locals, but he'll also make enemies, leading to "drama, action, and even love". It's fairly unusual for a racing game to emphasize its narrative these days, but it's nice to see nonetheless.</p>

<p>Intriguingly, the story in&nbsp;<em>JDM: Japanese Drift Master&nbsp;</em>will be told "through in-game events and a manga" drawn by Gaming Factory's art team.</p>




<p>Of course, it wouldn't be much of a racer without cars, and&nbsp;<em>JDM: Japanese Drift Master&nbsp;</em>has plenty, packing in licensed brands like Nissan, Mazda, and Subaru.</p>

<p>The game will also offer the opportunity to tweak and upgrade your car to your heart's content, and Game Factory says it's "constantly adding presets for driving wheels and the plethora of simdriving hardware available on the market" as well.</p>

<p><em>JDM: Japanese Drift Racer&nbsp;</em>launches for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1153410/JDM_Japanese_Drift_Master/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/japanese-drift-master-b4fd48" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Epic</a>, and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/japanese_drift_master" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a> on March 27th.</p>
