After 28 years of working at Wizards of the Coast on the world's most popular fantasy RPG, Christopher Perkins is stepping away, leaving a rich history behind.</p>



<p>Christopher Perkins announced his retirement from Wizards of the Coast via social media post on X (formerly Twitter). In the post, Perkins states that after 28 years of the company and wrapping up both Dungeons &amp; Dragons' 50th anniversary and new 2024 core rulebooks, that it was the perfect fairytale ending for him.

In a post on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dndbeyond.com/post/3llyx7uz36c2x" rel="nofollow">Bluesky social</a>, the company stated that they were grateful for Perkins' decades of work, stating that the game would not be what it is today without his contributions.</p>

<p>Perkins contributions to <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> are substantial. He joined Wizards of the Coast in 1997 as an editor for <em>Dungeon</em> magazine. He later became a senior producer for the game while developing the <em>Star Wars Saga Edition</em> TTRPG. He also authored a blog, titled "The Dungeon Master Experience" on Wizards' website, openly dispensing sage advice about the challenges of being a DM.</p>

<p>But Perkins's biggest contributions came with <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Fifth Edition. In addition to being the Senior Story Designer for the game, Perkins was also the lead story designer behind two of 5e's most acclaimed modules: <em>Curse of Strahd</em>, the 5e update to the iconic Castle Ravenloft module, and the whimsical Feywild journey of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/wild-beyond-witchlight-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>The Wild Beyond the Witchlight</em></a>.</p>

<p>Perkins was also an active public figure for D&amp;D. He DM'd Penny Arcade's irreverent actual play series, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/discussing-start-of-acquisitions-incorporated-first-actual-play-with-jerry" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Acquisitions Incorporated</em></a>, hosted the Twitch live stream series <em>Dice, Camera, Action</em>, and guest-starred on several episodes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-concludes-campaign-3-with-epic-8-hour-finale-new-godly-exu-announced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Critical Role</em></a>.</p>

<p>The last <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> product credited to Christopher Perkins as product lead is the new <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-player-handbook-review-mixed-messaging-around-strong" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">2024 Dungeon Master's Guide</a>. An admirable update to the game's strong foundation.</p>
