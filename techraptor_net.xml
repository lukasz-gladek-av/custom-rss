You know he's there. Even before you found the bodies, it's almost like you felt his presence. Always watching. You feel like you're under a constant crosshair. But to save yourself from going mad, you've fallen back on your orders. Guard the facility, patrol the routes, but he's still there. You know he's there.</i></p>

<p><i>Sniper Elite the Board Game </i>is based on the popular <a href="https://techraptor.net/series/sniper-elite" rel="nofollow"><em>Sniper Elite</em></a> video game series. In this review, we'll look at how it plays and how it stacks up against the video game it's based on, and we'll also check out what the Eagle's Nest expansion adds to games. <em>Sniper Elite the Board Game</em> was a successful crowdfunding campaign in 2020, and another expansion, <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/projects/rebellionunplugged/sniper-elite-operation-kraken" rel="nofollow">Operation Kraken</a>, is planned on Gamefound.</p>

You could be long gone as the guards close in.</figcaption></figure><h2>Hidden Sniper Moving Target</h2>

<p><i>Sniper Elite the Board Game </i>is a hidden movement 1 vs many board game. What that means is that 1 player takes the role of the Sniper, and up to 3 players (or an AI card deck if playing solo) take on the role of the guards. The guards are split into 3 teams of 3, and their miniatures are placed on the map. During their turn, they can move and search areas, looking for the sniper.</p>

<p>The sniper, using a smaller separate copy of the game board, uses a dry-erase marker to track their movement, as they try and complete 2 objectives. Their miniature is kept off the board and secret, creating noise if they move too fast, which the defenders can track, narrowing their search area. The sniper miniature is only placed on the board if the defenders discover them, they complete an objective, or if they create too much noise when taking a shot.</p>

It's an almost completely diceless board game (except a single die for solo play), and instead, when making a shot, players draw tokens from a bag. A number of aim tokens is required, equal to the number of spaces between you and your target (including your target's space). The number of tokens you draw is up to you, but if you draw 2 or more noise tokens, then your position is revealed, and if you draw a combination of 5 or more noise and recoil tokens, then you miss your shot regardless of how many aim tokens you draw. Tokens are added to the bag as the game progresses, such as more noise tokens for being spotted, or more aim tokens for taking out enemies.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sniper-elite-the-board-game-2.jpg?itok=Jc9wdOx9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sniper-elite-the-board-game-2.jpg?itok=1EjQwmPP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Sniper Elite the Board Game </em>has a map where the action takes place, and a seperate map for the hidden sniper to track their movements.</figcaption></figure><h2>Boom Headshot</h2>

<p>There are only 2 maps in the core game box, but the variety comes from the random objectives, keeps the game varied for the sniper and the guards guessing. There are also 6 specialist abilities that each one of the guard commanders can choose 1 of, and 10 items that the sniper can choose 2 of. This combination of objectives, specialists, and items means that rarely will a game be the same.</p>

<p>The hidden nature of the game also keeps things fresh, and playing the guards made me super anxious. It's much simpler to have one player playing all 3 guard units, as they can work overlapping search areas, but having 3 makes it as complicated as 3 independent units would, each with their own ideas for where the sniper might be.</p>

<p>For the sniper player, I honestly thought going into the game that I would be blasting away the enemies of the Allied campaign as you do in the game, but it's actually better to fire no shots at all, and when you do fire, shoot an irrelevant target to confuse your opponents. Moving a target out of your way alerts them to your rough area and possible objective.</p>

<p>The <em>Sniper Elite the Board Game Eagle's Nest </em>expansion adds a lot more variety to games. It includes 2 new maps, with solo defender control cards and new objective cards for them. It also includes some new equipment cards to help you navigate the cliffs and water of the Heavy Water map. The other map is set entirely inside Eagle's Nest, a challenging, claustrophobic room-to-room mission.</p>

<p>Eagle's Nest also includes 4 new sniper miniatures and stat cards to go with them, offering a variety of special abilities. Karl, the original <em>Sniper Elite</em> character, starts with the most aim tokens in the bag and can fire twice a turn. Rosa from <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/sniper-elite-4" rel="nofollow"><em>Sniper Elite 4</em></a> can only target enemies 5 spaces away, but only starts with 1 noise token. Jun, from <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/zombie-army-4-dead-war" rel="nofollow"><em>Zombie Army 4: Dead War</em></a> can remove multiple adjacent targets with a single shot, at the cost of adding noise tokens to the bag, and Major Eazy, from Battle comics, and starts the game with 3 noise and 3 aim tokens, but noise tokens count as aim tokens for him, so you can freely blast away.</p>

<h2>Sniper Elite the Board Game Final Thoughts?</h2>

<p>I honestly thought that I would have a completely different experience going into <em>Sniper Elite the Board Game</em>. I thought shooting would be a lot more prevalent than it is, and I didn't expect the hidden movement element to be so much fun. It captures an element of the video game perfectly, with the sniper having a feeling of such control, until things go wrong, and then things can deteriorate quickly. It is 2 vastly different experiences playing the guards or the sniper, both fun and challenging in their own right. The token bag for shooting plays into it all perfectly, and the risk/reward element is a pivotal focus of the game.</p>

<p>The Eagle's Nest expansion adds a lot more variety, with the extra maps doubling the number in the core set, and the extra snipers adding some very different styles of play. The core game stands alone as a great experience out of the box, and while the Eagle's Nest is a great addition, it is simply adding more variety on top of an already great and varied game.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/broken-arrow-release-date-finally-revealed-after-four-years.1176246/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/broken-arrow-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Steel Balalaika and publisher Slitherine Games have announced the&nbsp;<em>Broken Arrow&nbsp;</em>release date, just about four years after the fast-paced tactical RTS was initially announced.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1604270/view/537726178354528747" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Steam,&nbsp;<em>Broken Arrow</em>, described by the two studios as "the most wishlisted strategy game on Steam" (although its wishlists do still pale in comparison to the likes of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong" rel="nofollow">still-absent&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em></a>), launches on June 19th.</p>

<p>The game, which was originally revealed all the way back in May 2021, will set you back $49.99 when it's released, but it won't be an Early Access release, unusually; it'll be arriving fully formed.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/broken-arrow-release-date-tank.jpg?itok=aiOoSwq- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/broken-arrow-release-date-tank.jpg?itok=RCCWdcFb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Fast-paced tactical RTS&nbsp;<em>Broken Arrow&nbsp;</em>is finally arriving this June.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as revealing the release date, Slitherine and Steel Balalaika have also unveiled a new edition of&nbsp;<em>Broken Arrow&nbsp;</em>for which pre-orders are now open.</p>

<p>The Vanguard Edition will set you back $10 extra, and it packs in that now-common three-day early access (as opposed to Early Access) period, allowing you to play&nbsp;<em>Broken Arrow&nbsp;</em>three days ahead of everyone else.</p>

<p>You'll also get a digital soundtrack comprising 41 "intense and energetic bangers", as well as nine "beautiful" digital wallpapers representing&nbsp;<em>Broken Arrow</em>'s "specialization decks". On top of that, you'll get exclusive vehicle skins too.</p>

<p>If you want to know more about&nbsp;<em>Broken Arrow</em>, you can tune into Slitherine's <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/slitherinetv/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Twitch channel</a> tomorrow at 10am Eastern, where the studio will be showcasing a "never-shown-before mission" in the form of Kaliningrad.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Broken Arrow</em>, its developers describe it as a "large-scale real-time modern warfare tactics game" that features "a unique army building system and deep unit customization tools".</p>

<p>The game will feature two major factions, the Americans and the Russians, as well as a full-scale campaign. You'll even be able to use the same scenario editor used to create the campaign's missions to make your own scenarios.</p>

<p><em>Broken Arrow&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1604270/Broken_Arrow/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> on June 19th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wuchang-fallen-feathers-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Leenzee and publisher 505 Games have announced the release date for upcoming China-set Soulslike&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>, and it's adding to what will already be a pretty stacked summer.</p>

<p>Per a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2277560/view/498319683381887449" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, the game will be launching on July 24th across PC and current-gen consoles. It joins the likes of shooter&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/robocop-rogue-city-unfinished-business-release-date" rel="nofollow">RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished Business</a>&nbsp;</em>and cozy hobbit life sim&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-of-shire-delayed-july" rel="nofollow"><em>Tales of the Shire</em></a>.</p>

<p>As is customary for modern games, pre-ordering&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers&nbsp;</em>will also get you some extra goodies. You'll receive two outfits, a new weapon, and a Glistening Mercury upgrade item if you place your order before the game's launch.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wuchang-fallen-feathers-release-date-combat.jpg?itok=NnNL2VC0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wuchang-fallen-feathers-release-date-combat.jpg?itok=SwuDFnk9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers&nbsp;</em>lands in July. This guy, on the other hand, looks like he's landing a lot sooner than that.</figcaption></figure><p>A Deluxe Edition of&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers&nbsp;</em>will also be available, and it'll net you four more outfits and four weapons, as well as a Blood of Changhong skill upgrade item. Of course, you'll be able to obtain plenty of those items throughout your journey, but it's nice to have a headstart.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>, it's a Soulslike action RPG set in the Shu kingdom during the late Ming dynasty. You'll play as the titular Wuchang, a pirate "struck by amnesia" who must contend both with her uncertain past and a horrific disease known as the Feathering.</p>

<p>Along the way, you'll face "grotesque abominations", explore "forgotten temples" and "overgrown ruins", and "piece together Wuchang's lost memories". It all sounds pretty much par for the course when it comes to Soulslikes.</p>

<p>You can check out a new trailer for&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>, which shows off a rather unsettling boss by the name of the Perfect Bride, right here.</p>




<p><em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers&nbsp;</em>launches across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2277560/WUCHANG_Fallen_Feathers/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10005853" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/wuchang-fallen-feathers/9nprhd8gqkqs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on July 24th. It'll also be available as part of a Game Pass subscription if you're signed up to the PC or Ultimate tiers.</p>
