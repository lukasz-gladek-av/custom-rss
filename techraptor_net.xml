This prestigious competitive event is one of the biggest in the game's history, and the reason for the player's refusal is political and ethical activism.</p>

<h2>The Warhammer World Championships Boycott</h2>

<p>In a thread of posts on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/darkpips.bsky.social/post/3loi4fpuonc2c" rel="nofollow">Bluesky social</a>, Belgian Warhammer player Quentin Dubus stated that he had received a golden ticket for the Warhammer World Championships after competing at a recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-age-of-sigmar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Age of Sigmar</em></a> tournament. This is an all-expenses-paid invitation to an event where you represent your country on the world stage.</p>

The Warhammer World Championships are being held in the United States, a country currently acting extremely hostile to foreign visitors of all stripes. So hostile that certain indie studios are <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/indie-ttrpg-studio-rowan-rook-and-decard-not-attending-gencon-2025-over-travel" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">cancelling convention</a> plans because they feel unsafe.</p>

<p>Dubus explicitly states the reason for his boycott is because of these authoritarian actions by the US government. He says he refuses to travel to a country lead by someone whose policies harm trans people, marginalized communities, and the environment. The thread even ends on a call to action by Games Workshop, saying the act of hosting the event in the US sends a mixed message of community values.</p>

<p>Current events aside, Games Workshop has had to confront <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/games-workshop-speak-out-against-hate-groups" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">similar criticism</a> in the past. Their vastly popular sci-fi far future franchise, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000</em></a> is routinely expressed with maximalist fascist iconography. While originally intended to be satire, these trappings do attract more bigoted communities to form. So much so that Games Workshop keeps restating a simple tagline, "Warhammer is for everybody."</p>

<p>Dubus is not alone in his boycott of the Warhammer World Championships. In a report by <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/warhammer-age-of-sigmar/golden-ticket-winners-boycott-world-championships" rel="nofollow">Wargamer</a>, other international players have turned down their golden ticket in solidarity with Dubus' decision. These include Australian Kill Team player Emma Hallinan, and Swedish player Konstantinos Kellis.</p>
