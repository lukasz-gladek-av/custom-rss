            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Neil Druckmann, best known for his work as creative lead on Naughty Dog's successful&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us&nbsp;</em>series, has announced he will step down from his "creative involvement" with HBO's adaptation of the games in order to focus on his work with Naughty Dog.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Naughty_Dog/status/1940465773639880781" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message</a> on social media, Druckmann says the decision to step away from the show was "difficult", but that he wants to "transition [his] complete focus to Naughty Dog and its future projects", including the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/naughty-dog-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet" rel="nofollow">upcoming <i>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</i></a>, on which Druckmann serves as writer and director.</p>

<p>Druckmann says that working on HBO's&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us&nbsp;</em>series as a co-creator "has been a career highlight", and that now, after the completion of series two and "before any meaningful work starts on season three", is the "right time" to step away.</p>

<p>When the second season aired earlier this year, the response from audiences, as well as some critics, was decidedly more muted. Our very own Andrew Stretch <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/hbos-last-of-us-season-2-review-skeleton-of-story-no-heart" rel="nofollow">awarded the season a 7 out of 10</a>, praising its set dressing and Pascal's performance but criticizing "pacing issues".</p>

<p>A third season of the show is on the way, and given that the second season didn't conclude the story of&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us: Part II</em>, we can reasonably assume that the upcoming season will do so.</p>




<p>As for the games, as far as we know, there's no third installment in development, although Druckmann has said before that he believes there <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/last-of-us-creative-director-there-is-probably-one-more-chapter-to-this-story" rel="nofollow">could be "one more chapter"</a> to the story the games tell.</p>

<p>Given that Naughty Dog is currently hard at work on&nbsp;<em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</em>, however, and given the sheer amount of time games take to make these days, I wouldn't bank on seeing a third&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us&nbsp;</em>game for quite some time yet.</p>
