Steamforged Games has announced a crowdfunding campaign so that those who missed out on the first campaign can enjoy the board game adaptation of Ubisoft's shooter. The campaign has two new expansions for returning fans.</p>



<p>According to its <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/projects/steamforged-games/6-siege-pre-order" rel="nofollow">Gamefound campaign page</a>, the <em>Rainbow Six: Siege</em> board game reprint will include the base game and all of its expansions. As the name implies, the game is a tabletop adaptation of Ubisoft's competitive tactical shooter.</p>

Each Operator has a unique kit or special ability, allowing you to breach through walls, fortify defenses, or set up special weapons and gadgets. The base game contained 20 Operators with the expansions introducing 40 more.</p>

<p>If you already backed the <em>Rainbow Six: Siege</em> board game, this reprint campaign has two more expansions. One is a map pack, introducing the Skyscraper and Villa environments alongside cardboard obstacles. The second contains eight new Operators: Osa, Grim, Brava, Sens, Fenrir, Thorn, Solis, and Azami.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the Rainbow Six: Siege board game reprint campaign has a pre-order incentive. If you back the game in advance, you'll get an alternate profile and miniature for the Zero Operator at no additional cost.</p>
