            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-witcher-4-officially-unveiled-by-cd-projekt-red.1060827/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/witcher-4-official-reveal<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>CD Projekt Red has officially unveiled&nbsp;<em>The Witcher 4</em>, previously known by its internal project codename Polaris, and it'll star Geralt's ward Ciri as she embarks on her own Witcher Path.</p>

<p>The cinematic reveal trailer for&nbsp;<em>The Witcher 4&nbsp;</em>was shown during yesterday's Game Awards, where we also got reveals for the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/okami-2-hideki-kamiya" rel="nofollow"><em>Okami 2</em></a>, the new <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/naughty-dog-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet" rel="nofollow">Naughty Dog game</a>, and co-op survival spinoff&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-2025" rel="nofollow"><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></a>.</p>

<p>In the trailer, we see Ciri taking on a witcher contract to dispatch a monster "demanding ritual sacrifice", as CD Projekt Red says. A villager attempts to stop her going after the girl who has been chosen for sacrifice, but she angrily retorts that it wasn't the gods who chose the girl, but the villagers themselves.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-witcher-4-announcement-sacrificial-girl.jpg?itok=6N0y8vuU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-witcher-4-announcement-sacrificial-girl.jpg?itok=WzE-luj7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The debut&nbsp;<em>The Witcher 4&nbsp;</em>trailer shows Ciri dealing with a witcher contract in a village where ritual sacrifice is seemingly the norm.</figcaption></figure><p>We see Ciri venture into the forest where the monster lives, dispatching it in a typically&nbsp;<em>Witcher</em>-esque combat scene that feels very weighty and heavy.</p>

<p>She returns to the village with the monster's head, whereupon the girl from the beginning of the trailer apparently dies in her father's arms. The villagers say they only wanted the girl to "go to the gods", whereupon Ciri responds that "there are no gods here, there are only monsters".</p>

<p>It all looks like typically riveting, typically grounded&nbsp;<em>Witcher&nbsp;</em>stuff, and it's nice to see Ciri taking Geralt's role as the protagonist, especially given that she seems to be a less detached and more fiery Witcher than he was.</p>




<p>In <a href="https://press.cdprojektred.com/en/news/1702/the-witcher-iv-revealed-at-the-game-awards" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an announcement post</a>, CD Projekt Red says the trailer was pre-rendered using "a custom build of Unreal Engine 5 on an unannounced Nvidia GeForce RTX GPU", presumably referring to the mooted 50 series, which has yet to be revealed.</p>

<p>Last month, CDPR said production on the new&nbsp;<em>Witcher&nbsp;</em>game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-2077-sales-witcher-production" rel="nofollow">was ramping up</a>, so its announcement during yesterday's Game Awards makes a lot of sense.</p>

<p>The studio is promising "the most immersive and ambitious open-world&nbsp;<em>Witcher&nbsp;</em>game to date", but we still don't have a release window for it yet, unfortunately. We'll likely have to wait a while for more info, so watch this space.&nbsp;</p>

From light family games about dancing lemurs to in-depth strategy games, and some truly exciting surprises, these are the best new games at at PAX Unplugged 2024 - read on for the games you&nbsp;<em>need</em>&nbsp;to keep an eye out for when they release this year!</p>



<h2><b>Zenith</b></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-zenith.jpeg?itok=KfmLvIac 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-zenith.jpeg?itok=p_4iVpTf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><i>Zenith</i>, an upcoming board game from <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamepublisher/54347/playpunk" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayPunk</a>, immediately caught my attention with its innovative, team-based gameplay. In the game, you and a teammate play a sort of tug of war for control of the planets of our solar system against your opponents.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-zenith-board.jpeg?itok=lgHowGKH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-zenith-board.jpeg?itok=INe4xFrU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>With multi-purpose cards that you can play to gain resources, utilize special abilities, and more, I was truly engrossed during my demo play through. There’s a really nice push and pull here. Keep an eye out for <i>Zenith</i>, hitting shelves this Spring.</p>



<h2><b>Butterfly Garden</b></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-butterfly-garden.jpeg?itok=lDvXumye 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-butterfly-garden.jpeg?itok=43p7SLGy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Another entry in the ever-growing genre of calming games about birds, gardens, and bugs, <i>Butterfly Garden</i> from <a href="https://capstone-games.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Capstone Games</a> reimplements the classic tile-laying game Indigo. Wonderfully puzzle-y, you’ll lay down tiles opening up paths for your butterflies to fly along, hoping to guide them through winding lines toward your exits.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-butterfly-garden-board.jpeg?itok=v2SVJac6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-butterfly-garden-board.jpeg?itok=z1Z3Jsxy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Fun, easy breezy, this would be a great game to play with the whole family. This should be releasing within the next few months.</p>



<h2>Crafting The Cosmos</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-crafting-the-cosmos.jpeg?itok=tjyIZHdh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-crafting-the-cosmos.jpeg?itok=tx1SmIh6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><i>Crafting the Cosmos</i>, an upcoming game by <a href="https://www.officedoggames.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Office Dog</a>, Asmodee North America’s developmental studio, is a game about taking the very essence of the universe - namely elements, gravity, and even time itself, and putting it all together to forge your own galaxy. I got the chance to play through a demo round of the game with the game’s designers David Gordon and TAM, and found the gameplay intuitive but think-y at the same time. Each turn, you’re moving colored marbles around a central track, gathering resources, and plotting them on the board. Visually stunning, this has some of the cleanest design of any game I tried at PAX Unplugged. Keep an eye out for <i>Crafting the Cosmos</i> this March!</p>



<h2>Whisker Wars</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-whisker-wars.jpeg?itok=ckqbkEsE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-whisker-wars.jpeg?itok=fIrVp1gN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>When Mike, Sean, and Logan from <a href="https://play.glasshousegames.co/" rel="nofollow">Glasshouse Games</a> reached out to ask if I’d be willing to try out their upcoming <i>Whisker Wars</i>, I didn’t realize I was agreeing to sit down to play a game that would so thoroughly blow me away! In <i>Whisker Wars</i>, you’ll draw cards from a central deck, each depicting adorably angry woodland creatures waging all-out medieval warfare against one another. On your turn, you’ll draw your cards, lay them face-down in front of you, and then reveal. With hidden cards and a tricky decision-tree, I can’t wait to jump back in.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-whisker-wars-cards.jpeg?itok=jjBkwQOE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-whisker-wars-cards.jpeg?itok=t7kfoCIW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This is Glasshouse Games’ first game, and it’s heading to crowdfunding soon - and I’m calling it now, <i>Whisker Wars</i> and Glasshouse Games, are absolutely going to become household names.</p>



<h2>Overgrown</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-overgrown.jpeg?itok=MZk4Zt6v 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-overgrown.jpeg?itok=nWnIHydG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Nature is healing! Another incredible surprise, I stumbled upon <i>Overgrown</i> completely by accident at PAX Unplugged. While my days were full of meetings, each night I walked the gaming hall looking for games to jump into. And on my second night, I happened up <i>Overgrown</i> and its creator Bryan Bell, founder of the new studio <a href="https://goodtimehat.com/" rel="nofollow">Good Time Hat</a>. In <i>Overgrown</i>, players take on the role of - get this - nature, taking over an abandoned city after some horrible disaster.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-overgrown-board.jpeg?itok=OzwXaHBm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-overgrown-board.jpeg?itok=O_QiHrLC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In the game, you’ll lay down a small empty frame upon a grid to collect resources which you’ll lay on your board in combinations to turn them into overgrowth. One of each of the three resources (water, sunlight, and soil) placed next to each other on your board combine to turn into a single tile of overgrowth, opening space back up on your board. And multiple overgrown tiles further combine into a single densely packed patch of greenery. You can also attract wildlife for bonus points. With a nice quick pace, and light puzzle placement, I was completely entranced by the game - and can’t wait for it to hit crowdfunding this year!</p>



<h2>Survivalist</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-survivalist.jpeg?itok=Rdo4g_Fb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-survivalist.jpeg?itok=Ox_p8BXN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>With a gorgeous, stark black-and-white game design, <i>Survivalist</i> is all about surviving in the harsh wilderness. Designed by Ryan Courtney and Bob Hewitt of the newly formed <a href="https://www.homesteadnz.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Homestead Games New Zealand</a>, <i>Survivalist </i>is played over a series of seasons. You’ll spend the early game gathering useful resources, and crafting those into necessary tools, while preparing for a final showdown against the game itself.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-survivalist-card.jpeg?itok=wdYj1hjS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-survivalist-card.jpeg?itok=wBlSVShf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Designed purposefully to be difficult - and therefore show the peril of trying to make it out in the wilds - players will compete not to see who can survival the final encounter, but who can survive <i>the longest</i>. I didn’t get a chance to play through the full game, but in my brief demo I was immediately intrigued by both the seamless gameplay loop <i>and</i> the game’s one-of-a-kind artwork and design. With a planned release for early next year, this will be on my watch-list for sure.</p>



<h2>Disco Island Escape</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-disco-island-escape.jpeg?itok=_IuvTlKD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-disco-island-escape.jpeg?itok=z5ZC9vJp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This is another game I happened upon while wandering the gaming area after the Expo Hall closed, and I’m so glad I did! <i>Disco Island Escape</i> designer April Mitchell taught me how to play this fun family-friendly game about dancing lemurs trying to make it off a volcanic island. In this game, you’ll draw cards and play matching colors to chart a course for yourself around the board. Bump into another lemur and you’ll send them back to the start while your lemur flips to their Groovy side, allowing them to move faster.</p>

<p>Perfect for families with kids who can handle a little bit of strategic thinking (but not too much!), <i>Disco Island Fever</i> invites players to boogie down, with each color card also sporting a dance move to encourage the kiddos to get up and dance while they play (I did not dance, sadly, as it was the end of a long day). Published by <a href="https://playhootenanny.com/products/disco-island-escape" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Hootenanny Games</a>, <i>Disco Island Fever’</i>s very newly available for purchase.</p>



<h2>Malediction</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-malediction.jpeg?itok=XS9LXwQz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-malediction.jpeg?itok=ZJFAb3Wc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Finally, there’s the upcoming <i>Malediction</i>, a new card and miniature game by <a href="https://malediction.gg/" rel="nofollow">Loot Studios</a>. This game is the real deal, and truly one of the best new games at PAX Unplugged 2024. The elevator pitch is, essentially, <i>Magic: The Gathering</i> meets <i>Warhammer</i>. For a certain subset of our readers (myself included), I don’t have to say anything more! In <i>Malediction</i>, you’ll choose one of four factions, and build up a force of miniatures and a deck of cards.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-malediction-miniatures.jpeg?itok=OT3W3oBz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024-malediction-miniatures.jpeg?itok=k_WBvf5s 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>But here’s the fun twist, along with spells and little combat tricks, the cards in your deck also include profile cards for your miniatures - and you can’t bring them out onto the battlefield until you draw their card <i>and</i> pay the resource cost to field them. While the core boxes will come with cardboard cutouts, the game will also include the STL files needed to 3D print some of the most engaging looking models and terrain I’ve ever seen. I played an incredible demo, and took home some samples to try out more fully. Expect a full report before the game launches on GameFound!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Elden Ring Nightreign Is a Survival-Focused Spinoff Coming in 2025]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-nightreign-is-a-survival-focused-spinoff-coming-in-2025.1060797/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>FromSoftware and publisher Bandai Namco have announced&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, a co-op survival action spinoff of the wildly popular open-world action RPG, and it's due out next year.</p>

<p>The game, like the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/okami-2-hideki-kamiya" rel="nofollow">upcoming&nbsp;<em>Okami&nbsp;</em>sequel</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/naughty-dog-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet" rel="nofollow">Naughty Dog's next project</a>, was announced during yesterday's Game Awards, and a followup <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/fromsoftware-and-bandai-namco-reveal-elden-ring-nightreign" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement post</a> on the official Bandai Namco website sheds some more light on this rather odd-looking title.</p>

<p>The publisher describes&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>as a "standalone multiplayer co-op action survival game" in which players must band together to defeat a creature known only as the Nightlord. You will also be able to "go solo" in&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>, although it very much seems to be designed around co-op play.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-giant-spider-boss.jpg?itok=Z33zjmEl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-giant-spider-boss.jpg?itok=36A9FES6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>is a co-op-focused spinoff of the hugely popular&nbsp;action RPG.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>will consist of a "three day-and-night cycle" in which you'll make "split decisions about combat and exploration" while taking down "terrifying bosses", which sounds like par for the course when it comes to&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>.</p>

<p>This time around, however, you won't be making your own characters; rather, you'll choose from an existing pool of eight, each of which has their own "unique abilities and powerful Ultimates".</p>

<p>The game will take place in the parallel realm of Limveld, where you'll face increasingly difficult bosses at the end of each night, with the third night pitting you against the "chosen Nightlord".</p>

<p>Should you fall, you'll still be granted relics that you can use to "customize and upgrade" your characters, so it sounds like <i>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</i>will have more than a whiff of the roguelite about it as well.</p>




<p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>'s announcement comes just days after FromSoftware head Hidetaka Miyazaki said the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-2-not-happening-fromsoftware" rel="nofollow">wouldn't be revisiting the IP</a> anytime soon, which feels like a particularly brazen statement in hindsight.</p>

<p>However, given the massive sales figures of both&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-25-million" rel="nofollow">itself</a> and its&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-sales" rel="nofollow">expansion</a>, another game in the series was perhaps an inevitability.</p>

<p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>is set to arrive for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2622380/ELDEN_RING_NIGHTREIGN/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010877" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and Xbox sometime next year. Stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>Naughty Dog announced&nbsp;<em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet&nbsp;</em>during yesterday's Game Awards ceremony, which is also where we learned that Hideki Kamiya will be returning to direct <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/okami-2-hideki-kamiya" rel="nofollow">a sequel to 2006&nbsp;<em>Zelda</em>-esque action-adventure game&nbsp;<em>Okami</em></a>.</p>

<p>As studio head Neil Druckmann says in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/12/12/announcing-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-a-new-franchise-from-naughty-dog/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">followup PlayStation Blog post</a>, Naughty Dog has been working on this game since it released&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us Part 2&nbsp;</em>in 2020, and it'll be the studio's "wildest, most creative story yet", according to Druckmann.</p>

Mun, a "dangerous bounty hunter" who finds herself stranded on a distant planet known as Sempiria.</p>

<p>The planet's communication with the rest of the universe "went dark" hundreds of years in the past, and Mun will have to find out why if she wants "to be the first person in over 600 years to leave its orbit".</p>

<p>Although the debut trailer does look rather different tonally from&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us&nbsp;</em>(including an appearance by the excellent Pet Shop Boys album&nbsp;<em>Actually</em>, of all things), Druckmann says it'll still offer "an emotional, character-driven epic journey".</p>

<p>He also promises "the deepest gameplay in Naughty Dog's history", with the studio "taking our learnings from our previous franchises and pushing them beyond anything we've ever done before".</p>




<p>Mun will be played by Tati Gabrielle, who you may know as&nbsp;<em>The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina</em>'s Prudence or the <em>Uncharted&nbsp;</em>movie's Jo Braddock. Coincidentally, she'll also be appearing as Nora in the upcoming second season of the TV adaptation of&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us</em>.</p>

<p>It's not clear whether or not this is the project on which Naughty Dog's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/raf-grassetti-naughty-dog" rel="nofollow">new art director Raf Grassetti</a> is working, but we do know that soundtrack duties will be handled by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, also known as Nine Inch Nails.</p>

<p>That wasn't all Naughty Dog revealed during yesterday's show, either.&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us Part 2</em>'s long-awaited PC port was also finally unveiled, and it's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2531310/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_Remastered/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">hitting Steam</a> on April 3rd.</p>

<p>We likely won't hear much from&nbsp;<em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet&nbsp;</em>for a while; Naughty Dog says its staff will "put our heads back down" to work on the game "for now", so stay tuned for more on this.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/okami-2-hideki-kamiya<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>During yesterday's Game Awards, Capcom announced a sequel to cult classic 2006 action-adventure game&nbsp;<em>Okami</em>, and it boasts the involvement of one of the original game's most important figures.</p>

<p>In a brief trailer shown during the Game Awards, Capcom confirmed that&nbsp;<em>Okami 2</em>, which is currently known simply as "<em>Okami&nbsp;</em>Sequel", is officially in the works, and that original director Hideki Kamiya will return to direct the project.</p>

<p>The game's <a href="https://www.capcom-games.com/o-kami_newproject/en-us/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">new official website</a> sheds a little more light on the project too, although it doesn't give much away. According to the site,&nbsp;<em>Okami 2&nbsp;</em>is being developed by "studios that include various staff members of the original&nbsp;<em>Okami</em>", including M-Two, Machine Head Works, and Kamiya's own Clovers.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/okami-2-announced-flower-circle.jpg?itok=MzvqDwD6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/okami-2-announced-flower-circle.jpg?itok=aDf7wS6v 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Okami 2&nbsp;</em>is officially coming.</figcaption></figure><p>In closing, Capcom says it "will be some time" before we get more information about Amaterasu's latest adventure, but that the studio "really hope[s] you look forward to this project". I can only speak for myself, but I'm absolutely hyped for this.</p>

<p>The trailer itself is fairly brief as well. It features Amaterasu herself sprinting across a field while&nbsp;<em>Okami</em>'s distinctive music plays, and she's trailing beautiful flowers behind her, just like in the original game.</p>

<p>We then see a flower with closed petals as a paintbrush traces a thick ink circle around the flower, upon which it suddenly bursts into bloom. It's a reference to a paint gesture in the original&nbsp;<em>Okami</em>, in case you haven't played it.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Okami 2&nbsp;</em>here. I don't know about you, but just seeing this minute or so of footage made me weirdly emotional.</p>




<p><em>Okami 2&nbsp;</em>wasn't all Capcom revealed during the Game Awards, either.</p>

<p>As well as a revival of one classic PS2 franchise, we're also getting another in the form of&nbsp;<em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</em>, a hack-and-slash action game that looks like it owes more than a small debt to FromSoftware's&nbsp;<em>Sekiro</em>.</p>

<p>Reviving&nbsp;<em>Onimusha&nbsp;</em>makes a lot of sense given that the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-onimusha-anime-trailer" rel="nofollow">animated series based on the games</a>&nbsp;debuted late last year. You can check the trailer out for&nbsp;<em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword&nbsp;</em>right here.</p>




<p>We'll bring you more on both&nbsp;<em>Okami 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</em>, as well as everything else Capcom is up to right now, as soon as we get it. Stay tuned.</p>
