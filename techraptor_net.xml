            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has revealed the release date for&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 2.1, and the latest update for the hack-and-slash action RPG is coming very soon indeed.</p>

<p>As revealed during one of the studio's customary livestreams,&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 2.1 arrives on July 16th. That's next Wednesday at time of writing, so you won't have very long to wait for this one.</p>

<p>Just like you'd expect, Version 2.1 represents a continuation from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-version-20-release-date" rel="nofollow">June's massive 2.0 update</a>. Two new areas, the narrative-focused Sailume Bay and the summery Fantasy Resort, will be available for you to explore, with the former serving as the "central stage for Chapter 2's story".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zenless-zone-zero-version-2.1-release-date-agents.jpg?itok=ePyUPVQF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zenless-zone-zero-version-2.1-release-date-agents.jpg?itok=AGp4R8na 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Two new Agents are coming in&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 2.1.</figcaption></figure><p>As ever, you can expect to add new Agents to your lineup as well. The first, Ukinami Yuzuha, is a Support Agent who can empower other attackers and use her tanuki friend to throw candy bombs. Well, why not, eh?</p>

<p>Your second new Agent in&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 2.1 is Alice Thymefield, an Anomaly Agent whose Blade Etiquette resource can be used to unleash devastating attacks on her opponents. A new Bangboo, Miss Esme, joins the two Agents, providing HP and energy replenishments if she's in your squad.</p>

<p>Reruns for Miyabi and Yanagi will also be available as part of Version 2.1's banners, so if you missed your chance to pick up those two Agents the first time around, you'll have another chance in this update cycle.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to new minigames like surfing, sea shooting, and new fishing spots, as well as new outfits to unlock with a summery theme. There's plenty to look forward to as part of&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 2.1, and you can check out the trailer below!</p>




<p><em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 2.1 arrives across <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and mobile devices</a> on July 16th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Say what you will about the genre, but this summer's been quite a time for gacha game releases.&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/umamusume-pretty-derby-western-release-date" rel="nofollow"><em>Umamusume</em></a>&nbsp;is incredibly popular, with even the most unlikely gamers diving into the fray. Hoyoverse continues to dominate the field with updates to&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/genshin-impact" rel="nofollow">Genshin Impact</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/zenless-zone-zero" rel="nofollow">Zenless Zone Zero</a>,</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/honkai-star-rail" rel="nofollow"><em>Honkai: Star Rail</em></a>. I've dabbled with several of these in the past few weeks, but the one consuming most of my time is none other than&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-5-phantom-x-release-date-leaked" rel="nofollow"><em>Persona5: The Phantom X</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That's right,&nbsp;a new&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/series/persona" rel="nofollow"><em>Persona</em></a>&nbsp;game is out, and it's another offshoot of&nbsp;<em>Persona 5</em>. If you're like me and get engrossed in this series' narratives and hooked on the day-to-day, slice-of-life elements&nbsp;it&nbsp;offers,&nbsp;<em>Persona5: The Phantom X&nbsp;</em>can easily grab your attention and pull you in.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/persona-5-the-phantom-x-wonder-2.jpg?itok=2FnLLi8d 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/persona-5-the-phantom-x-wonder-2.jpg?itok=m6f5iyrc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Introducing our protagonist, Wonder.</figcaption></figure><h2>Familiar Combat with a Mobile Twist</h2>

<p>Much to my surprise<em>,&nbsp;Persona5: The Phantom X&nbsp;</em>is quite the ambitious title. It's easy to write it off as being a mobile game, but with&nbsp;<em>Persona 5</em>'s signature art style and gameplay elements, it feels very high quality.</p>

<p>Players take control of a protagonist who, due to certain events, gets involved with the Metaverse, much like Joker from&nbsp;<em>Persona 5</em>. The narrative is front-loaded with exposition to get players up to speed with how the whole Metaverse world works, so it might feel repetitive for players familiar with the series.&nbsp;Due to all this exposition,&nbsp;<em>Persona5: The Phantom X</em>&nbsp;feels very similar to the opening hours of&nbsp;<em>Persona 5.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>This also means it takes quite a while to get into actual gameplay, which comprises day-to-day life elements, making friends, exploring Mementos,&nbsp;using Persona in battle, fusing new&nbsp;Persona, and the like. Once you get into the meat and potatoes of it,&nbsp;<em>Persona5: The Phantom X&nbsp;</em>has quite a bit going on.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/persona5-the-phantom-x-combat.jpg?itok=3euo4RVK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/persona5-the-phantom-x-combat.jpg?itok=1xMvLoAp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Combat should look pretty familiar to you if you've played&nbsp;<em>Persona 5</em>.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Turn-based combat will also click pretty fast for those familiar with&nbsp;<em>Persona</em>&nbsp;mechanics. You'll primarily fight demons from the&nbsp;<em>Megami Tensei</em>&nbsp;franchise, each with their own elemental weaknesses and strengths.<em>&nbsp;</em>Paying attention to demons' weaknesses and exploiting those is essential in order to succeed.</p>

<p>Exploit a weakness, and enemies are downed. Party members can do a "One More" attack (essentially the Baton Pass from&nbsp;<em>Persona 5)</em>, and that character can attack a second time. If all demons are downed in combat, you can do an All-Out Attack and deal massive damage to every enemy on the field.</p>

<p>Characters also have their own special attack gauge that fills up over time. These "Highlights" have a wide range of benefits, like dealing massive damage, buffing allies, debuffing enemies, and more, so there are a lot of tools at your disposal. The tutorials for combat and, well, almost every other mechanic aren't that great, but you'll catch on quickly as a veteran of the series.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/persona-5-the-phantom-x-persona.jpg?itok=oqTh5nOr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/persona-5-the-phantom-x-persona.jpg?itok=ba8X9xnj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Here's a look at how attacks work in the game. This is Yaoling Li's persona.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Attacks also work a little differently in&nbsp;<em>Persona5: The Phantom X.&nbsp;</em>You have your regular melee and gun attacks, but Personas have fixed and unique skills. There's a bit more depth with these abilities, so rather than using "Assault Dive," Ryuji has "Pirate Tactics" which deals a set percentage relative to his attack stat, and is buffed if his "Rebound" mechanic is activated.</p>

<p>My intent is not to bog you down with tons of jargon, but just know that characters' abilities are fixed, and you can't change them around. There is one exception to this rule, and that's the player character Wonder.</p>

<p>Much like Joker, Wonder can command multiple Persona. You're able to fuse new Persona in the Velvet Room, assign new skills to them, and customize them to fit in certain combat situations. It's not quite as deep as base&nbsp;<em>Persona 5</em>'s fusing mechanics, as there are restrictions, but folks will be happy to see the return of this mechanic.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/persona-5-the-phantom-x-lufel.jpg?itok=RV2OnRzA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/persona-5-the-phantom-x-lufel.jpg?itok=pJh462Dd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Lufel! He's actually quite good.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Persona5: The Phantom X --&nbsp;</em>Gacha Hooked?</h2>

<p>To address the elephant in the room,&nbsp;<em>Persona5: The Phantom X</em>&nbsp;is a gacha game. All of these mechanics I mentioned, including fusing Persona as well as upgrading characters and their abilities, are tied behind an absurd amount of in-game currency. I play a lot of gacha games, and these currencies pretty much always confuse me, so there's a learning curve.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, party members are locked behind gacha mechanics. You can pull for either new characters (like Joker from&nbsp;<em>Persona 5)&nbsp;</em>and powerful weapons suited only for them. Everyone has their own limits when it comes to gacha, so just know what you're getting into.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The best characters will, of course, be locked behind limited banners, although you're gradually given currency to pull for new characters, and there are a few characters you gain from the story that will also be helpful.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/persona5-the-phantom-x-the-phantom-thieves.jpg?itok=PZLpK7p9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/persona5-the-phantom-x-the-phantom-thieves.jpg?itok=3sD5_TDM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Limited time events, for example, may include characters you're familiar with.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that&nbsp;<em>Persona5: The Phantom X&nbsp;</em>has a clever way of handling characters like Joker and Morgana being playable. These party members are called "Phantom Idols" and are products of the Metaverse rather than their real-world counterparts. And while&nbsp;<em>Persona5: The Phantom X&nbsp;</em>is technically canon, the ongoing theory is that this game takes place within an alternate universe.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are also so many different modes in&nbsp;this game; after all, you have to find ways to keep the player engaged. So, on top of exploring palaces and living out your daily life, there are various challenges that'll absolutely put your builds to the test. By doing this, of course, you get more currency for gacha pulls.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/persona-5-the-phantom-x-subway-slammer.jpg?itok=Lhv6Kh19 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/persona-5-the-phantom-x-subway-slammer.jpg?itok=3tKACdpW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>He's just standing there... menacingly.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Silly Saga of the Subway Slammer</h2>

<p>I swear, my Twitter feed has been nothing but the Subway Slammer since&nbsp;<em>Persona5: The Phantom X</em>'s launch. If you're wondering who that is, well, you'll learn pretty quick by playing through the story. Like in&nbsp;<em>Persona 5</em>, some characters need a change of heart, and our first target is ex-baseball player Takeyuki Kiuchi, aka the&nbsp;Subway Slammer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Subway Slammer is a guy that just loves slamming into women on the subway. His habits are purposely misogynistic and actually stem from a social issue in Japan. There are reports of people slamming into others on the subway in order to satisfy some sick perversion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even though it's a real-world issue, the Subway Slammer's saga is written in such an unintentionally funny, over-the-top way. Kiuchi is outrageous with his dialogue, so the whole situation turns into something more akin to parody than real-world commentary. And of course, the police can't do anything, despite him severely injuring a high school girl apparently, so of course, The Phantom Thieves are on the case.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/persona5-the-phantom-x-kiuchis-palace.jpg?itok=jXhIYvEj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/persona5-the-phantom-x-kiuchis-palace.jpg?itok=cLwocUhL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>As you can imagine, The Subway Slammer has quite the ego.</figcaption></figure><p>Through Mementos, players infiltrate various rulers' Palaces in order to steal their treasure. This triggers the ruler to confess their crimes and have a change of heart. Again, this is the same deal as&nbsp;<em>Persona 5.</em></p>

<p>The first palace, Kiuchi's domain, is my favorite part of <em>Persona5: The Phantom X.&nbsp;</em>It's the meat and potatoes of&nbsp;this game, so to speak, and the palaces are truly massive. There are puzzles, plenty of enemies, narrative exposition, and more. They're truly enjoyable to explore and find every bit of treasure you can.</p>

<p>Besides changing hearts, much of the story is how you decide to spend your day. You can choose to partake in various activities around the city, like working a part-time job or attending a club at school. These increase your social stats, but I'm still not&nbsp;<em>really</em>&nbsp;sure how these factor into&nbsp;<em>Persona5: The Phantom X'</em>s gameplay.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/persona5-the-phantom-x-city.jpg?itok=VdJ1cWcj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/persona5-the-phantom-x-city.jpg?itok=nxU4FJ0j 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Gettin' myself out of Subway Slammer territory.</figcaption></figure><p>The fact of the matter is, this is a live service title that originally launched in China only, so we're behind on content. Will my social stats come into play later? Who knows. It also remains to be seen if the story picks up beyond The Subway Slammer. The second palace's ruler is a <em>bit&nbsp;</em>more despicable, but it doesn't hit the same way that&nbsp;<em>Persona 5</em>'s villains did.</p>

<p>I am, at the very least, invested in the main party. Wonder is your blank slate protagonist like Joker, but the sporty Motoha Arai and the trusty animal companion, Lufel, are very likable, as are later additions like Shun Kano. Various side characters also have eye-catching designs and engaging personalities, so I'm hoping things pick up!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wonder-persona-5-the-phantom-x.jpg?itok=2g92dqid 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wonder-persona-5-the-phantom-x.jpg?itok=TVEs6VMs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Go on, awaken to your Persona!</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Persona5: The Phantom X&nbsp;</em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>This is a mobile&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;PC title. The mobile elements are very evident if you're playing on your computer. Using a controller would have been my favored method in playing&nbsp;<em>Persona5: The Phantom X,&nbsp;</em>but the control scheme is obtuse and unresponsive. Even with the mouse and keyboard, it's clear that a touch screen was the priority here.</p>

<p>The UI and interface, by the way, is extremely cluttered.&nbsp;<em>Persona</em>&nbsp;is known for its incredibly artsy UI, and while it's often bold in its presentation, it isn't obstructive. There are so many different buttons flashing at you on the screen at any given time, it can be quite annoying to deal with as you're trying to immersive yourself Tokyo or somewhere in the Metaverse.</p>

<p>There are a lot of smaller issues that prevent&nbsp;<em>Persona5: The Phantom X&nbsp;</em>from realizing its true potential. The UI and controller issues definitely hinder my enjoyment, and the story just doesn't hit the same way...&nbsp;<em>yet</em>. Even still, I'm hooked, since&nbsp;<em>Persona5: The Phantom X&nbsp;</em>boils down to being more&nbsp;<em>Persona</em>, and more&nbsp;<em>Persona&nbsp;</em>can't be a bad thing, right?&nbsp;</p>

<hr><p><em><strong>Persona5: The Phantom X</strong>&nbsp;was reviewed on PC with a copy provided downloaded the reviewer over the course of 30 hours of gameplay - all screenshots were taken during the process of review.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>CD Projekt Red has confirmed that a second season of&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk: Edgerunners&nbsp;</em>is in the works, although it's probably going to be a little while before you can watch it.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://x.com/edgerunners/status/1941584253893959928" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X,&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk: Edgerunners 2</em>, as CDPR is calling it, is currently in production. It'll air on Netflix "when it's ready", according to the developer, so it sounds like the next season is at least a year or more away.</p>

<p>When it does air,&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk: Edgerunners 2&nbsp;</em>will tell a "new standalone 10-episode story" set in the world of&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, a story that Netflix and CDPR describe as "a raw chronicle of redemption and revenge".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cyberpunk-edgerunners-2-purple-figure.jpg?itok=VJccNPxt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cyberpunk-edgerunners-2-purple-figure.jpg?itok=MYuCIvMD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Cyberpunk: Edgerunners 2&nbsp;</em>is officially coming...at some point in the future.</figcaption></figure><p>Helming the new series is storyboarder Kai Ikarashi, who worked on original <i>Edgerunners&nbsp;</i>episode "Girl on Fire". He's joined by lead character designer Kanno Ichigo, as well as "returning collaborators" Masahiko Otsuka and showrunner Bartosz Sztybor.</p>

<p>Animation studio Trigger will return once again to work on the new series, so you can expect the same sort of flashy, exciting visual style <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-edgerunners-is-anime-set-in-cyberpunk-universe" rel="nofollow">the first season</a> of&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk: Edgerunners&nbsp;</em>brought to the table. Spoilers ahead for the first season of&nbsp;<em>Edgerunners</em>, if you haven't seen it yet!</p>

<p>Of course, we don't yet know how the story of the new season will dovetail with the original (if, indeed, it does at all). All we know for now is that, as the trailer itself proclaims, "David is dead, but Night City lives on". We'll have to wait for another trailer to learn more, I guess.</p>

<p>In the meantime, you can check out the debut teaser trailer for&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk: Edgerunners 2&nbsp;</em>right here. It doesn't give too much away, but it does feature some stylish&nbsp;<em>Persona</em>-esque visuals upon which to feast your eyes.</p>




<p>Elsewhere in&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk&nbsp;</em>news, the hotly-anticipated sequel to&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cd-projekt-profits-cyberpunk-sequel-pre-production" rel="nofollow">recently entered pre-production</a>, and between that, the new <em>Edgerunners&nbsp;</em>season, and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-2077-update-23-delayed" rel="nofollow">recently-delayed</a>&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>Update 2.3, we're in a bit of a holding pattern when it comes to new&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk&nbsp;</em>media.</p>
