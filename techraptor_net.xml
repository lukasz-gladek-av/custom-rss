            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Techland has announced that upcoming zombie sandbox parkour-'em-up&nbsp;<em>Dying Light: The Beast&nbsp;</em>has been delayed by a few weeks in order to ensure additional polish.</p>

<p>While the game was originally intended to launch on August 22nd, Techland now says it needs extra time "to make&nbsp;<em>Dying Light: The Beast&nbsp;</em>the best&nbsp;<em>Dying Light&nbsp;</em>game [it's] ever released", which is why the latest title in the series will now be launching on September 19th.</p>

<p>Techland says it understands the delay "may be disappointing", but that its "experience has shown how important the first impression is", and that four extra weeks of development will help the studio "address final details that make all the difference between good and great".</p>

<p>Additionally, Techland will be releasing more information about&nbsp;<em>Dying Light: The Beast&nbsp;</em>regularly until September, so if you're disappointed you won't be able to play the game in August, the new reveals should tide you over.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Dying Light: The Beast</em>, it's a standalone followup to 2022's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dying-light-2-stay-human" rel="nofollow"><em>Dying Light 2: Stay Human</em></a>&nbsp;in which you'll once again take on the mantle of Kyle Crane, the protagonist of the original&nbsp;<em>Dying Light</em>.</p>

<p>The game was <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/turns-out-dying-light-the-beast-started-out-as-leaked-dying-light-2-dlc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">originally intended</a> to be a DLC expansion for&nbsp;<em>Dying Light 2</em>, but after plot details for that DLC were leaked by hackers in 2023, Techland decided to turn&nbsp;<em>The Beast&nbsp;</em>into a full standalone followup instead.</p>
