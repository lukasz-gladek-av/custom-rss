            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bithell Games and publisher Big Fan have announced that fast-paced tactical game&nbsp;<em>John Wick Hex&nbsp;</em>is being delisted from all storefronts in just a couple of days.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1405790/view/596280216846860675" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on Steam,&nbsp;<em>John Wick Hex&nbsp;</em>will be removed from digital storefronts on July 17th. That includes PC and consoles; as the two studios say, as of that date, "new purchases of&nbsp;<em>John Wick Hex&nbsp;</em>will not be possible, regardless of platform or storefront".</p>

<p>However, if you do already own the game, then you'll still be able to play it after that date. That includes both physical and digital copies, thankfully, so it's not completely disappearing.</p>

<p>Announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/john-wick-goes-tactical-on-epic-store-with-john-wick-hex" rel="nofollow">in May 2019</a> and released in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/john-wick-hex-launches-for-pc-on-october-8th-consoles-to-follow" rel="nofollow">October that same year</a>, the game takes place prior to the events of the popular&nbsp;<em>John Wick&nbsp;</em>movies. It sees the titular hitman descending into the underworld to rescue allies Winston and Charon from a new enemy calling himself Hex.</p>

<p>Gameplay-wise,&nbsp;<em>John Wick Hex&nbsp;</em>offers what Bithell calls "fight-choreographed chess brought to life as a video game", with the gameplay "capturing the series' signature gun fu style while expanding its story universe".</p>

<p>You can check out a trailer for&nbsp;<em>John Wick Hex</em>, which shows off the game's unique graphic novel art style and some of its tactical gameplay, right here.</p>




<p>Big Fan and Bithell Games didn't give any reason for the sudden delisting of&nbsp;<em>John Wick Hex</em>, but it's almost certainly got something to do with licensing rights, given that the game is based on an existing property.</p>
