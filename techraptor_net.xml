      <div><p>Today, the Shift RPG Kickstarter project has gone live. This new TTRPG, published by Hit Point Press, aims to be a more accessible experience for players new to the hobby. It' a pitch that is paying off since the project was fully funded the day of launch.</p>



<p>According to the official <em>Shift RPG</em> Kickstarter <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shiftrpg/shift-rpg/description" rel="nofollow">campaign page</a>, this new TTRPG is designed to bring a rich experience to the table without hundreds of pages of rules or additional supplements. On the GM side, it is designed to be less cumbersome thanks to streamlined rules.</p>

These are a series of micro-settings with enough detail to get players' imaginations going. These micro settings are designed by industry creatives. The ones mentioned in the campaign a sci-fi western world by Carlos Cisco (<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/daggerheart-review-narrative-forward-yes-and-ttrpg-that-is-force-to-be-reckoned" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Daggerheart</em></a>), and a post-apocalyptic setting by Joseph Carriker (Fantasy AGE).</p>

<p>The Shift RPG Kickstarter is transparent with its influences in the campaign page. It cites various genre properties as inspiration for its atmosphere and fiction such as Transformers, Batman: The Animated Series, and classic Final Fantasy, but mechanic-lite, storytelling rich TTRPG systems like <em>FATE Core</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/john-harper-announces-blades-in-dark-deep-cuts-ttrpgs-first-official-supplement" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Blades in the Dark</em></a>, and <em>Mothership</em>.</p>

<p>The fundamental system involves the Trait and Shift Die mechanic. Traits represents a character, vehicle, item, or monster's strengths and weaknesses. Those strengths and weaknesses determine what Shift Die you use to resolve a skill test, which ranges from a D4 to a D12. A 1,2, or 3 is a success, which means the lower the die face, the better. But if you roll the highest number on your die, the die face goes up.</p>

<p>The different pledge tiers for the Shift RPG Kickstarter are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Print'N'Play PDF for $19:</strong> A digital copy of&nbsp; the game, a set of three reference sheets, and all unlocked PDF stretch goals</li>
