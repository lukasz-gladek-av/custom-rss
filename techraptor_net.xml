            <title><![CDATA[Xbox Hardware Revenue Still in Freefall, Microsoft Reveals]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft has released its first-quarter fiscal results for the 2025-26 financial year, and Xbox consoles appear to be continuing their sales freefall, although "content and services" revenue is up.</p>

<p>In the company's latest <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2026-Q1/more-personal-computing-performance" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">financial release</a>, Microsoft says its Xbox hardware revenue has dropped by 29% when compared to the same period last year, and given that Xbox hardware sales have been in decline for a while now, that's not good news for the gaming division.</p>

<p>There's a silver lining for Microsoft, though, albeit a very small one; content and services revenue, which includes the company's Game Pass service as well as gaming-related software, increased by (an admittedly paltry) 1%, driven by "growth in Xbox Game Pass and third-party content".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-game-pass-xbox-hardware-revenue-decline.jpg?itok=Nf1aQZo1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-game-pass-xbox-hardware-revenue-decline.jpg?itok=KeapOShe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Game Pass continues to grow, albeit slowly.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that the first quarter of Microsoft's fiscal year covers the period between June and September, so it doesn't take into account the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-tiers-reworked-2025" rel="nofollow">controversial Game Pass changes</a> introduced earlier this month, which saw the price of top tier Ultimate jump to $30 per month.</p>

<p>The data also won't include major Xbox releases for the end of the year, like&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>, the latter of which will almost certainly boost sales in the coming second quarter.</p>

<p>Still, Xbox's continuing console woes don't appear to be deterring the company from continuing to pursue hardware development, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-console-hardware-rumors" rel="nofollow">at least not officially</a>; it's been confirmed that there will be a next-generation Xbox console, and that it's being developed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/next-gen-xbox-hardware-sneak-peek" rel="nofollow">in conjunction with tech company AMD</a>.</p>

<p>Despite that, Xbox is currently chasing a multi-platform strategy, with major releases like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/halo-campaign-evolved-announced-for-2026-coming-to-xbox-series-pc-and-playsation-5" rel="nofollow">Halo</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gears-of-war-reloaded-announced" rel="nofollow">Gears of War</a>&nbsp;</em>no longer confined to Xbox consoles. That's unlikely to change, even when Xbox does eventually release its next machine.</p>




<p>This data also doesn't take into account the newly-released ROG Xbox Ally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rog-xbox-ally-release-date" rel="nofollow">handhelds</a>, although whether they'll be enough to tip the scales and reverse the company's woeful hardware performance is unclear.</p>

<p>Things are looking a little rosier for Microsoft as a whole, however; the software giant <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/fy-2026-q1/press-release-webcast" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reported</a> a revenue increase of 18%, which I'm sure will soothe the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" rel="nofollow">thousands of employees who lost their jobs</a> during the company's latest round of layoffs.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A group of ex-<em>Fall Guys&nbsp;</em>developers, including one of developer Mediatonic's co-founders, have banded together to create a brand new UK-based studio called Panic Stations, and they're already hard at work on their first game.</p>

<p>Per a press release, Panic Stations' staffers include&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys&nbsp;</em>designers Dan Hoang and Joe Walsh (no, not that one), as well as social and community lead Oliver Hindle, who shaped&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys</em>' "distinctive voice and viral presence" online.</p>

<p>They're joined by Mediatonic co-founder Paul Croft, who, along with Josh Tarrant, is also one of the founders of new indie development collective Skeleton Crew (not to be confused with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wizards-of-the-coast-skeleton-key-project-canceled" rel="nofollow">Wizards of the Coast subsidiary Skeleton Key</a>).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/panic-stations-ex-fall-guys-devs-founders.jpg?itok=ZPv71Qtb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/panic-stations-ex-fall-guys-devs-founders.jpg?itok=1VzAqLRW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Panic Stations counts several ex-<em>Fall Guys&nbsp;</em>developers among its number.</figcaption></figure><p>According to the aforementioned press release, Panic Stations' goal is to create "fun, fresh, physics-based co-op games with a sense of humor", and not only that, but the studio is aiming to "release a few every year".</p>

<p>Panic Stations is already hard at work on its first game, it seems; the studio says it will announce its debut project "soon", so we shouldn't have too much longer to wait before we know whether this new UK outfit is aiming to take on&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys</em>' crown (as it were).</p>

<p>Whatever Panic Stations is working on, it sounds like it'll be an online offering; founder Paul Croft says he's a "huge fan of the online co-op space" and that he wants to make games that "bring people closer together".</p>

<p>You can check out the trailer announcing Panic Stations' formation, which takes the form of a sort of pigeon-based mockumentary, right here. It's very characteristic of the founders' humor, I think.</p>




<p>We'll have to wait and see what Panic Stations comes up with, but in the meantime, if you're jonesing for some physics-y multiplayer fun, you can check out&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys&nbsp;</em>and its ranked mode, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fall-guys-ranked-knockout" rel="nofollow">launched back in April last year</a>.</p>
