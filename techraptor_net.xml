            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>studio Crystal Dynamics has announced that it's been hit by layoffs, but the developer says that work on the next game in the aforementioned action-adventure series remains "unaffected".</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7366524687985594369/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on LinkedIn, Crystal Dynamics says it has "made the very difficult decision to part ways with a number of [its] talented colleagues", blaming "evolving business conditions" for the decision. The studio stops short of revealing how many employees have been let go.</p>

<p>Crystal Dynamics goes on to say that while its decision was not "made lightly", it was "necessary...to ensure the long-term health of [the] studio and core creative priorities in a continually shifting market".</p>

That, the studio says, "includes the future of&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider</em>, which remains unaffected" by the layoffs.</p>

<p>It's been five years since Crystal Dynamics' last original game, namely 2020's&nbsp;<em>Marvel's Avengers</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvels-avengers-ending-development-support" rel="nofollow">ended service in January 2023</a>. Other than that, the studio has also worked alongside Aspyr on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tomb-raider-i-ii-iii-remastered" rel="nofollow">remasters</a> of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tomb-raider-4-6-remastered-announced" rel="nofollow">first six</a>&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>games and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/soul-reaver-remasters-leaked-psn" rel="nofollow">first two titles</a> in the&nbsp;<em>Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver&nbsp;</em>sub-series.</p>

<p>Technically speaking, a new game in the&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>series is in development, although Crystal Dynamics and publisher Amazon Games have revealed nothing about the new project yet. It's likely to be a while before we learn exactly what direction the studios intend to take with the property in future.</p>

<p>Still, even without a flagship game announcement, the&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>franchise remains active. Last year, an animated series by the name of&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft&nbsp;</em>debuted on Netflix, and a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tomb-raider-live-action-series" rel="nofollow">live-action series is also in the works</a>.</p>




<p>Crystal Dynamics' decision to lay off employees may well be connected to the fact that in July, Xbox <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">canceled its&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</em>reboot</a>, on which Crystal Dynamics was serving as a co-development studio alongside The Initiative.</p>
