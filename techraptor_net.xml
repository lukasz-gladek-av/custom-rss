            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There are fantasy games about knights fighting dragons or a mayor building a town, but there is an even more honorable profession that is often overlooked: the tavern keeper. In this&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper</em>&nbsp;preview, I'll explore a new tavern management simulator that is a lot more challenging than it looks at first glance.</p>

<p><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="074ae8fb-5c20-4715-96ad-96d3239ede91" href="https://techraptor.net/games/tavern-keeper" rel="nofollow"><em>Tavern Keeper</em></a>&nbsp;is the long-awaited sophomore title from&nbsp;<em>Game Dev Tycoon</em>&nbsp;developer&nbsp;Greenheart Games. We've <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/greenheart-games-announces-tavern-keeper" rel="nofollow">waited nearly ten years</a>&nbsp;for it to arrive, and now it's finally here. I was excited to see how&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper</em>&nbsp;turned out after all this time, and I can confidently say this: it was definitely worth the wait.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tavern-keeper-preview-starting-the-tavern-keeper-preview-in-riverbottom-with-the-first-tavern.jpg?itok=b-bFtwjw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tavern-keeper-preview-starting-the-tavern-keeper-preview-in-riverbottom-with-the-first-tavern.jpg?itok=4F3eKmxX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You don't have much room (or much money) in your first tavern, but it's enough to get started.</figcaption></figure><h2>Surviving the Swamp</h2>

<p>Your adventure as a tavern keeper begins in the murky swamps of Riverbottom. This isn't a metaphor, really; your first tavern is literally smack dab in the middle of a swamp. You've decided to try to turn things around and build a working business in the ruins of an abandoned tavern.</p>

<p>The <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1a361ff1-c666-4fd4-820d-bcc100274c63" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/tavern-keeper-guide-beginner-tips-and-tricks" rel="nofollow">first few days</a> are pretty dodgy; you have enough money to build <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7505bb65-ecba-4be8-871f-b3baed27fc8b" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/tavern-keeper-building-guide-how-to-build-tavern" rel="nofollow">the bare necessities of a tavern</a> and hire a single <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6dca68a7-2bd6-4c3a-b296-bb14d4fbde37" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/tavern-keeper-employees" rel="nofollow">employee</a>. If you manage your money well, you'll make a small but steady profit each day. That money, in turn, can be reinvested into expanding your tavern, buying new stock and equipment, and hiring more employees.</p>

<p>There's more to&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper</em>&nbsp;than just managing your money, though. Just like real-world eateries, your tavern has a star rating. A higher star rating will unlock new rooms (such as the Kitchen) and new furniture items, allowing you to provide more services to your customers.</p>

<p>You'll need this new gear, too — a higher star rating also brings more customers and higher tiers of customers. More customers means you'll have to build more tables, hire more employees, and increase the variety and amount of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="dcfa5593-cf14-4808-ae43-cdd162559c0b" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/tavern-keeper-cooking-and-drinks" rel="nofollow">food and drink</a> you have available.</p>

<p>Stars serve as the objectives in freeplay, but the scenarios will have different objectives altogether, along with some special mechanics. Successfully complete all of the objectives, and you'll be able to move on to managing a much larger tavern in another region.</p>

<p>Riverbottom effectively serves as the tutorial for&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper</em>. Even if you opt out of the guided tutorial, you're only scratching the surface of what you can do in&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper</em>. Your next stop is <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="462d4cbc-647d-4d03-9d79-9c56dd1ccbd3" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/tavern-keeper-harvest-festival-walkthrough" rel="nofollow">Halfington</a>, the homeland of the halflings — and your new tavern which had mysteriously burned down before your arrival.</p>

<p>Halflington gives you much more space to work with, but it also comes with some restrictions: unmovable indoor walls shape and restrict the internal structure of your tavern. This somewhat limits your building layout, but you can work around it (and even use the internal walls to your advantage) if you're creative.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The optional challenges add some welcome replayability to the second and third scenarios.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The second scenario also introduces new optical objectives called "challenges." Based on my experience with Halfington and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6c56b2aa-2705-4868-92d2-af5ad31bb949" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/tavern-keeper-orcish-ambitions-walkthrough" rel="nofollow">the third scenario in Gugamush</a>, these challenges require you to use a specialized scenario if you want to complete them.</p>

<p><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="337e3a62-d7b4-4915-89a5-62492adc8779" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/tavern-keeper-best-in-show-challenge" rel="nofollow">Halfington's "Best in Show" challenge</a>, for example, requires you to win a best guild competition by earning votes from groups of customers. Groups can arrive at any time of day, so your best strategy is to have your tavern open 24 hours a day. That means you'll need double the staff of a normal tavern.</p>

<p>As for <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c92d8b66-c380-48a1-9e40-aed856226284" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/tavern-keeper-accountant-challenge" rel="nofollow">Gugamush's "Accountant" challenge</a>, you must not take any loans whatsoever. This is complicated by the fact that your first employee asks you to give him back pay for the time he spent working in the tavern while it was abandoned. Both of these challenges add some welcome replayability to the second and third scenarios.</p>

<p>There's more to running a tavern than simply hiring employees and keeping the storeroom filled with booze, mind — you have to actually build the tavern. This is an area where&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper</em>&nbsp;diverges from some other games in this vague genre of business simulation: each scenario has a fixed tavern layout.</p>

<p>As I said earlier, the Halfington scenario has these positively annoying supporting walls running through parts of the tavern. The Gugamush scenario has its own strange quirk; the center of your tavern counts as an outdoor area. Gugamush's central courtyard breaks up the floor plan of your tavern, but it does give you a handy spot for an outhouse.</p>

<p>This is one of my bigger pain points with&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper</em>. I enjoy having room to lay things out with few obstructions, but it can be challenging to get everything set up just right, and you'll often have to make compromises with your tavern design.</p>

<p>The difficulties of laying out your tavern are exacerbated by the need to provide light and control temperatures. All light sources shoot out embers in a particular radius, and having furniture too close to these lighting sources massively increases your risk of a fire. The same applies to stoves and hearths which are needed to warm up colder maps.</p>

<p>In effect, actually building out your tavern is a balancing act between furniture placement, lighting, and heat (or cooling). You also have to consider pathfinding; you don't want to have too large a distance between your bar, kitchen, and storeroom; customers actually have a patience meter, and it's bad if they aren't served quickly.</p>

<p>Lest we forget, there's a little more to running a tavern than building the place and hiring employees; you'll also need food and drink to serve them. Keeping a steady supply of goods in your storeroom is a little more challenging than you might think at first glance.</p>

<p>Anything you'd want to serve to your customers has to be delivered from breweries and markets. The brewery in Halfington, for example, takes around 14 hours to deliver an order (unless you choose fast shipping, which costs more); there are similar time constraints for food markets, and these delivery times increase if the market is far away.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Tavern Keeper</em>&nbsp;has a lot of helpful tooltips and built-in guides, but it still falls short on explaining some mechanics here and there.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What this means in practical terms is that you'll usually have to order your food and drink a few hours before opening or the night before. Extreme cases such as the market in Gugamush or distant markets in other regions might have delivery times of 24 hours or longer.</p>

<p>Finally — and perhaps most importantly — customers of different races have different tastes. Orcs prefer one type of food and drink, and halfings prefer something else altogether. Having something is better than nothing in a pinch, but supplying customers with their favored food and drink does wonders for your tavern's ratings.</p>

<p>I love this mechanic — there are many games in this subgenre that don't put this much thought into the food and drink you're serving. What I didn't like, however, was that it wasn't explained as well as it could have been.&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper</em>&nbsp;has a lot of helpful tooltips and built-in guides, but it still falls short on explaining some mechanics here and there.</p>

<p>I spent the better part of 120 hours exploring&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper</em>. While it has its rough edges here and there, I had a lot of fun trying to work out the best way to complete the objectives and playing with a tavern in free play.</p>

<p><em>Tavern Keeper</em> has a solid amount of content for an Early Access launch with 1 tutorial scenario and 2 full scenarios with optional objectives; you can also freeplay the maps with variant layouts or customized rulesets if you so choose. If you enjoy this genre, you'll easily have 40+ hours of content to play at the Early Access launch.</p>

<p>As with all Early Access games, though, the value proposition of&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper</em>&nbsp;depends on how quickly they can get content updates out the door.&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper</em>&nbsp;has a rock-solid foundation and great game mechanics, so here's hoping we won't have to wait too long to play some more.</p>
