<p>Several individuals, including influencer Cyberboi, a number of journalists, and some Build a Rocket Boy employees, will apparently be "served in person, criminal complaints, shortly", with those complaints alleging "espionage, sabotage, and criminal interference".</p><p>Insider Gaming contacted Ritual Network for comment, and the platform told the publication that it is "not involved in the matter". It goes on to say that it's "not aware of any legitimate legal action" brought by Build a Rocket Boy, and that any suggestion it's connected to the aforementioned sabotage is "incorrect".</p><p>Build a Rocket Boy, however, insists that it's on the right track; in a statement, it told Insider Gaming that it has "evidence that there has been a co-ordinated campaign to purposefully and maliciously damage" both the studio and the game, and that it's "taking steps" to address the issue.</p><p>In case you need a reminder, <em>MindsEye </em>launched last year to a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mindseye-launch-messy" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="090d2e26-517c-4b1d-81d8-0c4c40228804" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">pretty negative reception across the board</a>, seemingly leading to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mindseye-build-a-rocket-boy-layoffs-report" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="cc20a09e-a602-4466-a53f-4fb3ccf68d58" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">layoffs at Build a Rocket Boy shortly after the game's launch</a>, as well as publisher IO Interactive seemingly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/io-interactive-mindseye-third-party-publishing" rel="nofollow">pulling back from third-party publishing</a>.</p>

<figcaption><em>Baldur's Gate </em>is getting a TV show, and it takes place right after <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>According to Mazin, he's a big fan of Larian's latest entry into the iconic CRPG series; he says he's put "nearly 1000 hours" into the game, and that he's a "devoted fan" not only of <em>Baldur's Gate </em>but of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons </em>in general.</p><p>Although the show will be based on <em>Baldur's Gate</em>, Deadline says it won't draw from the first two games in the series too much, since they're not "official source material", according to the publication.</p><p>With that said, there will be "some commonalities across those games" that also refer to general <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons </em>lore, and those might come into Mazin's new <em>Baldur's Gate </em>show.</p><p>It's worth noting that this is a distinct entity from the upcoming <em>Forgotten Realms </em>TV show, which is being made for Netflix. It's unlikely, therefore, that the two will cross over in any meaningful way, at least not to begin with.</p>
<p><em>Baldur's Gate </em>is just one of the video game franchises getting itself a TV adaptation. It joins the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/far-cry-tv-series-apparently-in-works" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c0708981-d3ea-4448-9169-c69c7a5dddba" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Ubisoft's <em>Far Cry</em></a>, Sony's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/god-of-war-tv-series-not-filming-this-year" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="89ed31a0-2f47-4441-a213-ecc7281c72b1" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>God of War</em></a>, and Bethesda and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wolfenstein-tv-series" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e313e89f-98da-4b59-a46d-ae9d64ca0fe3" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">MachineGames' <em>Wolfenstein</em></a>, among many others.</p><p>We're still likely a long way away from the <em>Baldur's Gate </em>TV show being released, but stay tuned for more info about this as and when we get it.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Every night for the past several weeks, I'd go to bed thinking about <em>Mewgenics</em>. With my eyes closed and my head on the pillow, my mind wouldn't rest; it would play out scenarios from the game automatically, until, eventually, I finally managed to sleep. Even then, I'd start to dream about <em>Mewgenics. </em>This game has consumed me.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Mewgenics</em> is a turn-based, tactical roguelite created by <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/edmund-mcmillen" rel="nofollow">Edmund McMillen</a> and Tyler Glaiel. The former is most known for <em>The Binding of Isaac</em> and <em>Super Meat Boy, </em>but they both co-developed the tough-as-nails platformer <em>The End Is Nigh</em> in 2017. The duo is back with this being their largest and most ambitious game yet.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Don't mess with these kitties.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Pick a Collar, Any Collar</h2><p>This is a multi-faceted game with so many different layers, yet they somehow meld together to create something truly special. We have the breeding mechanics from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/series/pokemon" rel="nofollow"><em>Pokemon </em></a>series combined with elements from strategy titles like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/final-fantasy-tactics-ivalice-chronicles-review-timeless-classic" rel="nofollow"><em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em></a> and heck, even <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a><em>. </em>And of course, a good ol' roguelite twist adds even more spice.</p><p>Like any game with McMillen involved, there's a lot more going on than what is initially shown. As you progress throughout <em>Mewgenics</em>, fighting battle after battle and breeding a plethora of super messed up cats, you'll start to see just how deep the rabbit hole goes. If it clicks as it did for me, it will be your life for the next few weeks at the very least.</p><p>But of course, <em>Mewgenics</em> starts out very simple. You're given a group of four cats, and you're tasked with taking them out on runs. Runs start fairly linear by nature, as you're given a path that you must follow (sort of like a linear version of &nbsp;<em>FTL: Faster Than Light)</em>, and each path has a set amount of battles and random events players must engage with.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Spider cats???</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Battles are the bread and butter of <em>Mewgenics</em>. It's a tactics game first and foremost, and while it has a crude and humorous look to it, the mechanics are no joke. Seriously, this might be the most in-depth, fleshed-out, and rich system I've ever come across in a turn-based tactics title, surpassing even that of <em>Final Fantasy Tactics </em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/battle-brothers" rel="nofollow"><em>Battle Brothers</em></a>.</p><p>Before each run, you're able to assign a class collar to your cat. In <em>most</em> instances, you can only have one of a certain class, and that determines their role from the start. Each cat has a set of predetermined stats, with attributes like Intelligence affecting mana regeneration and Luck affecting anything chance-based and random.&nbsp;</p><p>Picking a class gives a few bonus points to certain stats befitting the role, while others might take a hit. From there, it's onward to battle! Fights take place on 10x10 grids filled with obstacles and enemies. There's no elevation to take into consideration here like other tactics games, and honestly, there's already so much complexity to <em>Mewgenics</em> that elevation isn't even needed.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Can't go wrong with Healing Aura, I say!</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>A Talented Group of Felines</h2><p>Part of the depth comes from the breadth of abilities each class is privy to. After each battle, a random cat gains a level-up. You'll be able to choose abilities to use in combat, different passives, and also stat increases. Your choice of abilities, passives, and stats is random, so sometimes you have to make do with what you're given, even if it doesn't seem optimal at first.</p><p>Active abilities are diverse and offer a wide range of benefits. The Cleric class, for instance, has several different types of heals to choose from; one is a single-target spell that can be shot from afar, while another allows you to dash long distances and heal an ally.&nbsp;</p><p>My favorite abilities are attributed to the Druid class, which offers various forms to shapeshift into, if you're lucky enough to be offered those on a level-up. You can turn into a tree that's completely stationary, but offers some support abilities; or, my personal favorite, the stag. The stag tramples over units and displaces them, and you can spend mana to refresh your movement action to keep on tramplin' on.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>With all these abilities and enemies on the screen at once, tactical mode can sometimes help with visibility.&nbsp;</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Combine that with a few other spells, like the ability to give your druid's crow companion an extra turn, and there's a great deal of utility and usefulness derived out of a single unit. Throw passives into the mix, and that's where things get truly crazy.&nbsp;</p><p>The Necromancer class is my favorite in this area, as a lot of passives revolve around minions spawning from either the enemies they kill or from the Necromancer themselves. The Necromancer has a few other ways to just go absolutely crazy, though.&nbsp;</p><p>This class's basic attack is a leech that siphons health from enemies every turn. With a combination of passives and abilities, there's a way to multiply this effect and cause catastrophic damage on enemies, with numbers reaching in the hundreds or even thousands.&nbsp;</p><figure role="group">

<p>Mind you, most basic enemies don't have a lot of health, with very few reaching upwards of 50. Bosses themselves, while chunky, usually don't have more than several hundred, but this is late in the game.&nbsp;</p><p>Thus, <em>Mewgenics</em> is a game you can break, and it encourages you to do so. There is an unprecedented amount of options in this game, in which you're able to absolutely steamroll it if you're lucky enough and build your units right.&nbsp;</p><p>Not to mention the various other ways your cats can become hilariously overpowered. Throughout runs, you'll come across hundreds of different items that affect the behavior of your cats and their abilities. Some items are fairly simple and might give just stat gains, while others have behaviors that can be truly game-changing.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>You can't just hoard items as there is a limited amount of space between each run.&nbsp;</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The Leaky Brain item, for instance, gives your unit a couple of hits in the intelligence stat, but any mana spent is given to adjacent allies. Another item, the Fly Larva, gives your basic ability "rot" and causes flies to spawn from enemies afflicted with it. As I said, there are so many different items, and I haven't even begun to see probably half of them over 100 hours in.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>Mewgenics</em> is a game you can break, and it encourages you to do so.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>With each cat having several different equipment slots, you're able to make freaky little cat super soldiers. One of my favorite passives to use in conjunction with weapon items is duel-wield, which allows Fighters to use their weapon twice in succession. As you might imagine, some weapons can have ludicrously good effects, and this makes a huge difference on the battlefield when used twice.</p><figure role="group">

<h2>The Cost of Battle</h2><p>For all that choosing the right abilities, passives, and items does for you, fighting can be brutal in <em>Mewgenics</em>. Each chapter in each of the three acts have different quirks to the environment and their own set of enemies that come with it. These progressively get harder, continually putting on the pressure.&nbsp;</p><p>Let's talk about the Desert, which might just be one of the most brutal areas in <em>Mewgenics</em> due to its scorching hot sun. In most areas, your units regain some health after combat, but because the cats are dehydrated in the desert, they do <em>not</em> regain health after battle. You can mitigate this in a few creative ways, like with water-based abilities, but sometimes that isn't at your disposal.</p><figure role="group">

<p>There are also spiky cacti that can damage your cats if they're knocked into them, but conversely, you can also knock enemies into the cacti for some bonus damage. As I said, each area has its own quirks, and you're constantly challenged to counteract them with ingenuity and incentivized to take advantage of environmental elements, as well.</p><p>Enemies as a whole, though, are so diverse that I continued to see new ones even 80+ hours in. The Boneyard has a bunch of ghostly enemies that can cause fear or inflict leeches, while The Cave has a bunch of spiders that shoot webs. The Sewers have piles of poop that spawn more little poops, and be sure to look out for those rolling turds. The Sewers also has bloodthirsty sharks, because of course.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Enemies as a whole, though, are so diverse that I continued to see new ones even 80+ hours in.</p></blockquote><p>With such a high number of enemies across all these zones, gameplay might feel a little intimidating or even overwhelming at first. Thankfully, each enemy has a handy tooltip that describes their behaviors, so that is definitely recommended.</p><figure role="group">

<h2>The Chaos of <em>Mewgenics</em></h2><p>Let's throw in random events to stir the pot even more during runs. Random events are, by their very nature, random. You might come across a rotten corpse and... it might be moving? It's filled with insects like flies and grubs. You're usually given a few choices, and in this case, you can eat the corpse, loot it, or examine it. Whatever you choose, it's essentially a die roll, so you'd better hope the outcome is good.</p><p>Fail an event, though, and you're in for some trouble. You might get a cursed item, which, in most cases, cannot be removed. You might even get a parasite or a disorder, which drastically affects your cat in typically adverse and unsavory ways.&nbsp;</p><p>One of my cats became obsessed with eating poop, so they'd rush over and eat any poop close to them at the start of their turn. It just goes to show, you shouldn't eat random piles of poop, who'da thunk?&nbsp;</p><figure role="group">

<p>One particularly nasty side-effect from an event gave my cat a nasty case of Cordyceps. You know, the fungus made popular by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/last-of-us-part-ii-review" rel="nofollow"><em>The Last of Us</em></a><em>? </em>Well, that cat, he was a lost cause, now with a 30 percent chance to be controlled by the AI every turn. It can actually be frustrating to encounter some of these punishing events and can, unfortunately, derail a run before it even begins.</p><blockquote><p>It just goes to show, you shouldn't eat random piles of poop, who'da thunk?&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>To lose a run means all of your cats are dead and gone for good, which can be very unfortunate since you'll lose almost all of your food, money, and items gained during that run as well. Plus, you can't breed dead cats, so if you come across a string of unfortunate events, <em>despite</em> your cats being well-built... tough luck.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Everything is fine.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I don't disparage <em>Mewgenics</em> for its difficulty, though, as you're able to bounce back fairly quickly. You're given a steady stream of cats, and they breed fast. Food is easy to get during runs, which is needed to feed your cats at home base.&nbsp;</p><p>The best part is, when the randomness of active and passive abilities, items, and events collide, you're met with so many unexpected moments. Abilities and items interact with enemies unpredictably, and there is rarely, if ever, just one way to handle a certain situation or encounter. The unexpected ways in which you can combo all facets of <em>Mewgenic</em>'s gameplay means every run is something to look forward to.&nbsp;</p><p>Even if I lost a run, I'd be ready to jump right back in and learn how I can break the game. The "one more run" mentality has never been stronger in a game for me than <em>Mewgenics</em>, and that's because of all the twists and turns the minute-by-minute gameplay provides.&nbsp;</p><figure role="group">

<h2>Breeding!&nbsp;</h2><p>But of course, I've alluded to breeding a few times now, and that is a <em>huge</em> part of <em>Mewgenics</em>. There's a home base that holds all of your cats -- cats from previous runs, and ones that have yet to embark on an adventure.&nbsp;</p><p>It is worth noting that cats from an adventure become retired and can't be used again. Their stats and abilities, however, can become inheritable and are passed on to the next generation. Thus, at the beginning of <em>Mewgenics</em>, it's the weakest your cats will ever be. With enough time and effort, you'll have dozens of badass little kitties ready to take on the world.</p><p>That also means that any mutations you gain from your adventure are often carried over to their offspring. One of my cats gained a mouth mutation, giving them gills instead. That mutation gives a permanent +2 health regeneration while a cat is wet. Another mutation, for the eye for instance, might give +2 intelligence but -1 luck.&nbsp;</p><figure role="group">

</figure>
<p>So some mutations can have negative effects on your stats. Even so, I dedicated a sole room in my house to cultivate the most freaky and abominable cats possible, yielding some very intriguing units to use as a result.&nbsp;</p><p>The depth of this mechanic is as complex as you want it to be, depending on what mutations you think are useful. Put these cats in a room together, and they'll breed more and more. Of course, cats don't always get along, so they might also fight each other (and even kill each other) at the end of the day instead of breed.</p><p>By adding certain items to your house, you can stimulate cats to breed more, be less aggressive, or stay healthier so they don't develop disorders like ADHD. Items are gained either through runs or bought via an NPC, and the usefulness of these cannot be understated enough; the items you use to decorate will directly have an impact on the next crop of cats.&nbsp;</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Cats fight, and when they do, it can get bloody. Lethal, even.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You can also donate any cat you want to any number of NPCs, giving you various benefits. I donated kittens to an NPC to unlock the Gaydar, which, well, determines if cats are straight, bisexual, or gay. It's actually important to know these things because, if a mutation you like ends up on a gay cat, you might be out of luck getting it to spread.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>I dedicated a sole room in my house to cultivate the most freaky and abominable cats possible, yielding some very intriguing units to use as a result.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>My only issue with donating cats is that it's pretty slow-going, and some crucial features are locked behind this. The Gaydar was quite useful, but so too was the ability to determine a cat's demeanor. Meaning, for a while, before unlocking this, you'd be grouping aggressive cats with docile ones without really knowing it.</p><p>The house also becomes crowded quite quickly, so it's difficult to sort through all your cats. There really isn't a great way to filter through them, so I wish there was a streamlined way to pick what cats I wanted for a run. Give me a filter so it highlights the cats I need, rather than having to click through each cat one by one.&nbsp;</p><figure role="group">

<h2><em>Mewgenics </em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2><p>In case you couldn't tell by the screenshots, <em>Mewgenics</em> has a certain aesthetic to it. It's an acquired taste, but I've grown up with Edmund McMillen's art style through his flash games. He goes for a dirty, nasty, unapologetic cartoonish style that features tons of poop and other unsavory bits. A duo of phallic, white fluid-spewing bosses is the tip of the iceberg here.</p><p>Still, I fell in love with all the freaky cats I made and the creative enemy designs. If <em>Mewgenic</em>'s art style is the only thing putting you off, I encourage you to push through it and discover the sheer amount of depth in its mechanics.</p><figure role="group">

<p>There's a robust soundtrack here, too, and it's surprisingly catchy. There are definitely a few very unlikely, weird songs, but dammit all, I can't get them out of my head. A lot of vocal tracks are here, and if you listen to the lyrics, well... they're definitely something else.&nbsp;</p><p>There are some elements to this game that I've deliberately omitted so that you can be surprised just as I was by what <em>Mewgenics</em> offers; even so, if I got you even a little bit interested, I've done my job. After all, <em>Mewgenics </em>is, no doubt in my mind, one of the best tactics games I've ever played, and with even over a hundred hours put into the game, I'm still finding new things and having more fun than I did when I last played it. More sleepless, feline-filled nights, here I come.</p><hr><p><em><strong>Mewgenics</strong> was reviewed on PC with a copy provided by the developer over the course of around 100 hours of gameplay.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>From numerous flash games to<em> </em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/super-meat-boy" rel="nofollow"><em>Super Meat Boy</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/binding-of-isaac" rel="nofollow"><em>The Binding of Isaac</em></a>, it's fair to say that developer Edmund McMillen's made an immense impact on the video game industry. So then, it's also fair to say that <em>Mewgenics</em> is shaping up to be another monumental release not just for this critically acclaimed developer, but for games at large.</p><p>To learn more about <em>Mewgenics</em>, which McMillen describes as his "best work," TechRaptor chatted with him about features we can expect in this tactical strategy title, and we also reflect on the game's long developmental journey.</p><h2>The Long Journey of <em>Mewgenics</em></h2><p>If you've followed Edmund McMillen at all in the past, oh, decade, then you've probably heard of <em>Mewgenics</em> at least in passing. Both he and co-developer Tyler Glaiel have made several games since <em>Mewgenics</em>' announcement (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/edmund-mcmillens-end-is-nigh-releases-july-12th" rel="nofollow"><em>The End is Nigh</em></a>, for instance), but this is shaping up to be their biggest title yet.&nbsp;</p><p>"The gameplay loop is essentially breed cats, take them on adventures," said McMillen. "Bring them back, breed them again, and inchworm your way towards a bigger house and a crazier bloodline of cats."</p><p>That's <em>Mewgenics</em> in a nutshell, but there's so much going on under the hood. The very process of cats going on an adventure is highly dangerous; this is, after all, a tactical strategy game, a genre known for its high stakes.&nbsp;</p><figure role="group">

<p>With that basic understanding of what <em>Mewgenics</em> is, know that it's been through a long and tumultuous developmental cycle. Initially announced in 2012, this one particular game has been on quite the journey.&nbsp;</p><p>"I knew I wanted to make a roguelike," said McMillen, "and I had this idea for a little test, and I wanted to kind of get my feet in the water with roguelike. So before I jumped into <em>Mewgenics</em>, I wanted to make a roguelike game that I thought was going to be really simple, and that was <em>The Binding of Isaac</em>."</p><p>The irony of this statement is that <em>The Binding of Isaac</em> is lauded for its depth, and it's turned into a resounding success. Of course, despite said success, <em>Mewgenics</em> was still on McMillen's mind as he toyed with ideas throughout the years. From his experience developing <em>The Binding of Isaac</em>, his intent was to use that knowledge to further develop <em>Mewgenics</em>, though it was still early on.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Yes, breeding is still a core component of <em>Mewgenics</em>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"So it looked really pleasing, and it was kind of a fun breeding sim," said McMillen, "and outside of that, it was just like collecting furniture to decorate your house with, and then you would use your cats as avatars in minigames, and that was as kind of far as it got, and we did end up working on it for almost two years -- I think it was 18 months, maybe a little under 18 months, and we got as far as showing it at PAX in its barebones form, and shortly after that, it was cancelled out from under me."</p><p>This was all while McMillen worked at the studio he co-founded (and eventually left), Team Meat. McMillen was reluctant to cancel <em>Mewgenics </em>at that time, and it was shelved. Even so, elements from the original <em>Mewgenics </em>were retained. Elements like the vibe and world, characters, and cat breeding are shared between the prototype and the 2026 release.&nbsp;</p><p>"It's still there," said McMillen, "but really, I mean, as you've seen, the meat and potatoes of the game is this sprawling tactical turn-based strategy game, which did not exist in the slightest before."</p><picture>

  </picture><p>Some early concepts for gameplay included a <em>Pokemon-</em>style battler, a brawler a la <em>Castle Crashers</em>, and heck, even a <em>Pikmin-</em>like RTS. Even so, the idea of a turn-based strategy game was what both McMillen and Glaiel kept returning to. McMillen says the duo are fans of the genre and connected on having played <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> <em>Advanced</em> when they were younger.&nbsp;</p><p>"I had always wanted to do a game like this, but these kind of games, to make a unique tactical turn-based strategy game... it's a lot of work," said McMillen. "You got to do a lot to go further than what exists there, and going in, we kind of just started playing those old games again and kind of realized that when you go back, your memory fills in a lot of blanks, and there's actually not as much going on as you would think, especially in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/final-fantasy-tactics-ivalice-chronicles-review-timeless-classic" rel="nofollow"><em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em></a> games."</p><figure role="group">

<p>McMillen's enjoyed other games in the genre such as <a href="https://techraptor.net/series/advance-wars" rel="nofollow"><em>Advance Wars</em></a><em> </em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/15-years-of-fire-emblem-in-west" rel="nofollow"><em>Fire Emblem</em></a>, and even <em>Into the Breach. </em>He likens these games to chess where, "the bigger your brain, the better you do." Conversely, <em>Mewgenics</em> follows a more unexpected source of inspiration: <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>.</p><p>"There's something appealing about <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> that does work for big brain people, and it's because it's odds. It's odds and averages, and you're always leaning in different ways when you're drafting and whatever else, but there's an element of surprise and, I guess, luck with the card draw aspect of the game that shakes things up just enough to make it so it's not a guarantee that the smartest guy in the room is destroying everybody all the time, and it still feels correct and nice."</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Eugenics in <em>Mewgenics</em></h2><p>One of the defining characteristics of <em>Mewgenics</em> are mutations. These can manifest in multiple ways: through random events, from breeding, and other unexpected events. Since breeding is a core part of <em>Mewgenics</em>, you're bound to come across some interesting combinations.</p><p>Florian Himsl, co-creator of <em>The Binding of Isaac</em>, is an avid cat breeder in <em>Mewgenics</em>. McMillen recalls the craziest cat he's ever seen in <em>Mewgenics </em>and, of course, this monstrosity belonged to Himsl.&nbsp;</p><p>"It wasn't a cat anymore. It was a turtle with a really long neck that had three sets of eyes. So it was like its mouth had eyes. Its eyes were eyes, and its eyebrows were eyes. And then it had an exposed brain. And then it was like shiny and just like the craziest, craziest stuff. And the cool thing is with those cool visuals come cool abilities. So it wasn't just this, oh, it looks cool. It also had the stats of a turtle. It was very defensive, and all of its eyes gave it dodge chance because it could see in all directions, you know what I mean? So it's bonkers."</p><picture>

  </picture><p>With hundreds of different mutations, players can expect to see new things for many hours to come -- and not just with mutations, but with disorders too. In McMillen's most recent run at the time, he came across a cat with narcolepsy.&nbsp;</p><p>"I designed the disorder, but it's not something I ever got to play with," said McMillen. "And narcolepsy is just simply your cat falls asleep at the end of its turn, but whenever you fall asleep, you gain 10 HP and I think seven mana. So it's this big boost to whatever. And the puzzle here is, OK, that's bad because it's skipping a turn. Like every other turn, he's asleep. But how do I work around this? How can I find a way to wake up my cat?"</p><p>This is where the ingenuity of <em>Mewgenics </em>comes into play, where punishment doesn't mean utter defeat. McMillen's Hunter (a class in <em>Mewgenics) </em>shoots a needle that gives the narcoleptic cat thorns, which damages anything that hits the unit.&nbsp;</p><picture>

  </picture><p>"I found ways to basically, when he would wake up, he would just be so, maxed out mana, maxed out HP," said McMillen, "and I could just put him right in the battle, in the middle of all the enemies and all the enemies would attack him, but it doesn't matter because he was never going to die.</p><p>"So while he was sleeping, he's getting pummeled and then he'll wake up and then he'll start barfing -- he had a barf attack -- and he'd have so much mana that he could just puke on everybody and his barf attack was tied to his constitution, so I just drafted around his constitution and that was a lot of fun. So I did it. I had a plan going in and I pivoted mid-run and it worked out for me. And those are the sort of things that as you play for a really long time, you'll really appreciate."</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Flash Games and Beyond</h2><p>McMillen and Glaiel both were avid Adobe Flash game developers back in the day. <em>Meat Boy</em> and its subsequent level pack came years before the indie darling that is <em>Super Meat Boy.</em> To that end, we wanted to hear more about McMillen's thoughts on developing for that platform back in its heyday.</p><p>"I do miss the instant gratification of making a small-form, quick game," said McMillen, "and I would like to definitely do that in the future, but I don't even know, the way I think about future stuff is like... right now, who knows if I'll even make another game.</p><p>"I might just work on <em>Mewgenics </em>DLC for the next five years and just kick back and do whatever else. I'm gonna go with whatever moves me and whatever feels right at the time. I'm going to try not to plan and just let it happen."</p><picture>

  </picture><p>Though Adobe Flash is technically dead, it still has its uses. You might be surprised to learn that all of McMillen's hand-drawn art in <em>Mewgenics </em>(you can tell it's done by him if it has thick lines), are created in Flash and then exported over.&nbsp;</p><p>"We're just not using the engine at all, it's just Vector art from Flash that's being imported from SWFs, so all the animation and all that stuff, it's all in FLA files, it's all SWF files." He adds: "There are action script calls that we use; we utilize Flash as much as possible, but it's just an art tool for this."</p><picture>

  </picture><p>While writing this article, some interesting news came out: Adobe was <a href="https://community.adobe.com/announcements-539/adobe-animate-end-of-life-and-support-timeline-1548220" rel="nofollow">discontinuing support</a> for Adobe Animate, the program that is essentially Adobe's successor to Flash. This caused quite a bit of uproar amongst game developers utilizing this tool.</p><p>Both McMillen and Glaiel use Animate extensively, so for Adobe to discontinue such a service has massive repercussions. Glaiel's custom engine for <em>Mewgenics</em> ingests the aforementioned SWF files for art assets, which is why it's important to the game; the game does not <em>run</em> on Flash/Animate itself.</p><p>Glaiel was available for comment at the time, so we reached out to him to understand the importance of Adobe Animate, despite the company's insistence on discontinuing support:</p><blockquote><p>"We use Animate (aka Flash) for the art and animation in [Mewgenics]. Flash is more than JUST an animation program, it was a multimedia program, capable of doing a whole lot of things and working in a very unique way that basically has no alternatives. The particular way you can organize assets in it is core to how <em>Mew</em>'s art style functions (piecing together cats out of pieces, heavy use of randomization within art assets, etc, while also exporting to a format that retains the raw vectors and animations instead of flattening it out) which is also core to the main gameplay mechanic of the game (breeding these cat pieces). - Tyler Glaiel&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Later that evening on Feb 3, Adobe decided to roll back its plans to discontinue the product, though it wasn't without great uproar. For now, in a Tweet, Mike Chambers from the Adobe Community team relayed that Animate is now in what is called "<a href="https://x.com/mesh/status/2018812283158470726" rel="nofollow">maintenance mode</a>," implying support will continue, but new features are not planned at this time.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Looking Into Both the Past and Future</h2><p><em>Mewgenics</em> has had quite the journey from its start in 2012, to its cancellation, to its resumed development once more. Now, in 2026, we're finally getting <em>Mewgenics</em>, and a lot has changed for McMillen since then.</p><p>McMillen is a father, and his youngest, a five-year-old daughter, has <em>only</em> known him as working on this game. As for Edmund McMillen as a game designer? He's feeling pretty darn confident about his work, and it took years to get to this point.</p><p>"I think I'm much better at this point," said McMillen. "I got a few failures under my belt, and I think I learned a lot from those failures. I think I grew as a designer and have a better understanding of what to do and what not to do. I've learned a great deal over these years. I think I've discovered how to have fun more with a project and how to entertain myself throughout it.</p><p>"I don't know, that's really the culmination of everything. <em>Mewgenics</em> really is, like, I think it's my best work. It's what I poured most of myself into, which is saying something, because <em>Binding of Isaac</em> was that game for me for so long, but I feel like this has eclipsed that."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/edmund-mcmillen-talks-mewgenics-development-journey-turtle-cats-and-adobe-flash]]></content:encoded>
