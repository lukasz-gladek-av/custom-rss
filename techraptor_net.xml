            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-x-shadow-generations-sales-million<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega has announced that&nbsp;<em>Sonic x Shadow Generations&nbsp;</em>sales have topped a big milestone on the very day of its launch.</p>

<p>According to a Sega press release (via <a href="https://www.sonicstadium.org/news/games/sonic-x-shadow-generations-sells-over-one-million-units-on-launch-day-r2660/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sonic Stadium</a>),&nbsp;<em>Sonic x Shadow Generations&nbsp;</em>has reached a million sales already, which is pretty impressive given the fact that the game was only released today.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that players who pre-ordered the Digital Deluxe Edition of the game were granted three-day early access, so technically,&nbsp;<em>Sonic x Shadow Generations&nbsp;</em>has been available for a few days, but it was released to the general public today.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sonic-x-shadow-generations-sales-wings.jpg?itok=eXTZORSY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sonic-x-shadow-generations-sales-wings.jpg?itok=4yWT4R7a 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Sonic x Shadow Generations&nbsp;</em>is already doing pretty brisk numbers for Sega.</figcaption></figure><p>In the press release, Sega attributes&nbsp;<em>Sonic x Shadow Generations</em>' success to a worldwide marketing blitz, as well as the fact that the game supports 12 different languages and was released simultaneously around the world.</p>

<p>Additionally, Sega says it's themed this fiscal year around Shadow, dubbing this initiative "Fearless: Year of Shadow". That makes sense, given that he'll be turning up as a pivotal character in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-sonic-hedgehog-3-movie-trailer-keanu-shadow">upcoming third&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>movie</a> later this year.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Sonic x Shadow Generations&nbsp;</em>is, it's the latest 3D platformer in the long-running and iconic&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog&nbsp;</em>series, and as you've probably guessed, it's themed around everyone's favorite edgy hedgehog Shadow.</p>

<p>The game consists of two parts: a full remaster of 2011's&nbsp;<em>Sonic Generations</em>, complete with "updated visuals and reworked cinematics", and a new game that sees Shadow speeding through some of the levels from games in which he's appeared.</p>




<p>Shadow's campaign is technically a standalone game, so you don't need to play&nbsp;<em>Sonic Generations&nbsp;</em>to enjoy it, but unfortunately, it's not possible to buy Shadow's campaign separately.</p>

<p><em>Sonic x Shadow Generations&nbsp;</em>is available now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2513280/SONIC_X_SHADOW_GENERATIONS/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/sonic-x-shadow-generations/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/sonic-x-shadow-generations/9MVLZDH2FH05" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/sonic-x-shadow-generations-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/river-of-gold-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/river-of-gold-review-gold-for-gameplay-bronze-for-theme.1019478/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/river-of-gold-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Running centrally through almost the entirety of Rokugan, the <em>River of Gold</em> connects all but the Northernmost clans with the central trade. Influence there means power across the continent. Welcome to <em>River of Gold</em>, a board game set in the <em>Legend of the Five Rings</em> setting. I was just sent a review copy of <em>River of Gold</em>, so let's&nbsp;have a look at the core board game, and see how deep the theme runs throughout.</p>

<p>I've been playing <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/legend-of-five-rings-rpg-review-l5r-rpg-core-rulebook-and-games-masters-kit"><em>Legend of the Five Rings</em> (<em>L5R</em>)</a> since the first edition roleplaying and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/legend-of-five-rings-lcg-review-new-dynasty">collectible card game (CCG)</a> when it was first published in 1995, and I've played all editions through its life, to the last living card game incarnation of the card game, and the current edition of the roleplaying game by Edge Studios.</p>

<p>When I heard they were making a board game set focused on merchants, over the standard samurai, courtiers, and shugenja (magic users in the world of Rokugan), my only hope was that they still kept the wonderful and incredibly detailed theme of the setting. With nearly 30 years worth of lore, this could be an incredible way to introduce a whole new market of gamers to this rich world of <em>Legend of the Five Rings</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/river-of-gold-2.jpg?itok=pd5GUvsN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/river-of-gold-2.jpg?itok=6dOmBMQE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The <em>River of Gold</em> components look incredible laid out on the tabletop [Photo: Office Dog Games].</figcaption></figure><h2>How Do You Play <em>River Of Gold</em>?</h2>

<p>The aim of <em>River of Gold</em> is to score victory points, and these can be achieved by delivering orders or trade goods, gaining influence along the river by building buildings, and claiming masteries, which are competitive goals.</p>

<p>The turn phase for each player is simple, streamlined, and adds a real pace to the game. Players roll a dice at the end of their turn, which gives them time to plan their next turn while other players are taking theirs. At the start of their turn, they can use divine favor points to modify their dice, and then they get a choice of 3 actions.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/river-of-gold-7.jpg?itok=tBIIINBC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/river-of-gold-7.jpg?itok=0a9u95Iz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Players get a choice of buildings to place in <em>River of Gold</em>, and these also determine the pace of the game, moving the game into the next era when enough have been built.</figcaption></figure><p>Players can either build a building along the river, which gives some immediate rewards, and also rewards you when other players visit your shore space. Buildings also gain you influence in the area, moving you along an influence track, which gains you further rewards and victory points during the end game.</p>

<p>Or players can also choose to sail one of their ships along the river (players get 2 ships, which start the game at different points on the river) which gains you visitor rewards for the areas you visit, and also owner rewards for those who own buildings in those areas. The final action choice is to deliver to a customer.</p>

<p>At the start of the game, players draw 2 customer cards that detail the customer's request. By fulfilling the customer's request, players gain an ongoing ability, and also an end-game effect to help with scoring.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/river-of-gold-4.jpg?itok=7r0FG6jc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/river-of-gold-4.jpg?itok=KODPWJH4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>River of Gold</em> includes custom dice with a number and a symbol that tie into each available action.</figcaption></figure><p>Each of the above action choices is influenced by the dice roll, which all have matching numbers and symbols. Players can move spaces equal to the dice, build in one of the 6 shore areas that match their dice, or deliver to a customer who also has a matching die number at the top of their card (there are 5 customer types, each with 6 cards to match each dice number/symbol). So there is some element of randomness, but as mentioned above, you can change your dice roll with your limited divine favor points.</p>

<p>The pace of the game is kept going by the 2 eras that are controlled by the building track. Once enough buildings have been built, 2nd-era building tiles start to appear, triggering the start of the 2nd-era, with the final phase for each player starting when the last 2nd-era building tile hits the board. The simplicity of the turn keeps games moving, even with 4 players, and there's a lot to think about when choosing your actions.</p>

<p>You want buildings so that you're getting visit rewards as players sail, but you also want to deliver to customers to get the ongoing benefits from that, and you also want to sail yourself in order to get money to build buildings, but you also want to stop your opponent's from getting the things that they want in certain areas.</p>

<p>It all comes together for a very light, but strategic non-confrontational game, very much like the courts of Rokugan, where you can never outright challenge, but you can make passive-aggressive remarks, and make moves to stop your opponents, rather than aggressively attacking them.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/river-of-gold-3.jpg?itok=3rJ92XPj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/river-of-gold-3.jpg?itok=7QidSr28 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>River of Gold</em> lets you play with 4 of the <em>L5R</em> Great Clans.</figcaption></figure><h2>What Clans Can You Play In River Of Gold?</h2>

<p><em>River of Gold</em> has 4 clans that you can play, the Crab, Crane, Mantis, and Scorpion. But your clan choice has no in-game effect other than changing the color of your pieces, and the flavor text on the reverse of your player board (which you never see because you use the other side of it in the game.</p>

<p>There is an included Clan Patrons expansion to the game, where you can pick or randomly determine which of the 2 patrons you use for each clan (each clan has 2 unique patrons), and this gives you a benefit throughout the game. This adds an element of theme that ties into the clans themselves.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/river-of-gold-6.jpg?itok=ITRGBQ40 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/river-of-gold-6.jpg?itok=1E6PHGkn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>River of Gold</em> has an included mini-expansion, Clan Patrons, that adds some <em>L5R</em> theme to the game.</figcaption></figure><h2>How Deep Is the <em>Legend Of The Five Rings</em> Theme In <em>River Of Gold</em>?</h2>

<p><em>River of Gold</em> has got some beautiful components, and it looks very <em>L5R</em>. There's a great map in the back of the rulebook that will help new players immerse themselves in the Rokugan setting, and there's incredible artwork used throughout. But other than the Clan Patrons mini-expansion, the theme is skin only, and this could be any setting and wouldn't change the game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <em>L5R</em> clans are all vastly different, with their own unique flavor, strengths, and weaknesses, and it feels like a missed opportunity not to have capitalized on this. No one trusts the Scorpions, the Mantis are considered lower than the other clans, because while a major clan, they are made up of several smaller clans, and the Crane and Crab hate each other. The Crab are very warlike, defending the continent against the horrors that live in the Shadowlands, and because of this, they favor anything that lets them win, over what the other clans would consider honorable. But none of this comes through in <em>River of Gold</em>.</p>

<p>The mini-expansion goes some way, but for the effort it took to include cards, they could have easily just included some optional rules for each clan on their clan board. Given each clan an ability, a restriction, or a goal that they have to achieve to gain extra rewards, or penalties for not achieving at the end.</p>

<p>This would have kept the balance of the core game, but given <em>L5R</em> fans and those new to the setting, a deeper feel for the theme, and not have made it feel so soulless when such a deep setting has been used to promote the mechanics.</p>

<h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On <em>River Of Gold</em>?</h2>

<p><i>River of Gold </i>is a great game. It looks beautiful, play is fluid, fun, and challenging, but it feels like a copout to use such a deep setting, and then not include anything beyond a couple of cards on the theme. Hopefully, new players will be drawn in to explore more of the setting because <em>L5R</em> is incredible, but for an <em>L5R</em> fan, this feels like a missed opportunity to make an incredible <em>L5R</em> board game, about an element not usually covered in the roleplaying or card games.</p>

<h2>Should I Buy <em>River Of Gold</em>?</h2>

<p>If you want a solid board game that's easy to play, doesn't have direct confrontation, and also looks beautiful on your tabletop, then <em>River of Gold</em> will hit the spot. If you're looking for a board game that looks into the rich theme and narrative of the <em>Legend of the Five Rings</em> setting, then beyond the Clan Patrons mini-expansion (which does add a little depth to each clan), you won't find much here beyond the <em>L5R</em> art and capturing of the setting in the components.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/castle-crashers-dev-behemoth-new-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Castle Crashers&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Alien Hominid&nbsp;</em>developer The Behemoth has announced its next project, and it's an arcade throwback title with a very familiar name.</p>

<p>"Game 6", as The Behemoth refers to it, will also be called&nbsp;<em>Behemoth</em>, and it'll launch on PC via Steam on October 31st. It'll enjoy some stiff competition, with the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-release-date-leaked-trailer"><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>also set to launch on that date</a>.</p>

<p>The Steam page for&nbsp;<em>Behemoth&nbsp;</em>describes the game as an "arcade extravaganza" in which you play as a chicken gathering up baby chicks and collecting candy corn as you soar through the skies.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-behemoth-arcade-throwback-behemoth-gameplay.jpg?itok=UcrkFUQO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-behemoth-arcade-throwback-behemoth-gameplay.jpg?itok=BsjFKs1S 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Behemoth's new game&nbsp;<em>Behemoth&nbsp;</em>looks characteristically weird.</figcaption></figure><p>Gameplay footage released by The Behemoth today makes&nbsp;its latest game<em>&nbsp;</em>look a little like&nbsp;<em>Flappy Bird</em>, although mercifully, it appears not to be embracing the kind of live-service nonsense the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/flappy-bird-returning-this-year">recently-revealed&nbsp;<em>Flappy Bird&nbsp;</em>reboot</a> is going for.</p>

<p>Candy corn you collect over the course of your time with&nbsp;<em>Behemoth&nbsp;</em>will allow you to unlock cosmetics "like chicken colors, beaks, wattles, and feet", and you'll also be able to compete in daily leaderboards to see if you can beat the rest of the world at&nbsp;<em>Behemoth</em>.</p>

<p>The game is aiming for a pretty low price point, too; it'll only cost you $3.99, which puts it on the same level as the likes of&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em>&nbsp;(although it's unlikely we'll be seeing any<em>&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-survivors-castlevania-crossover-dlc"><em>Castlevania&nbsp;</em>crossover DLC</a>&nbsp;for this one anytime soon).</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Behemoth</em>, which also shows off the kind of chaotic gameplay you can expect from the game, right here.</p>




<p><em>Behemoth&nbsp;</em>will be The Behemoth's sixth major project. The studio's first effort was the Flash game&nbsp;<em>Alien Hominid</em>, which was followed up by side-scrolling beat-'em-up&nbsp;<em>Castle Crashers&nbsp;</em>in 2008.</p>

<p>After that, the California-based studio released wacky platformer&nbsp;<em>Battleblock Theater&nbsp;</em>in 2013 and strategy RPG&nbsp;<em>Pit People&nbsp;</em>in 2018, followed by a reimagined version of debut title <em>Alien Hominid&nbsp;</em>last year.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Behemoth&nbsp;</em>when it launches <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3027260/BEHEMOTH/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on PC via Steam</a> on October 31st. Stay tuned for more on all other things The Behemoth-related.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-update-crossovers-cyberpunk<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Indie poker roguelike&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>has received a brand new update, and it's bringing crossover card skins based on popular franchises like&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Binding of Isaac</em>, and more.</p>

<p>This update constitutes the second part of the "Friends of Jimbo" event, which was first revealed during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-august-2024-recap">August's Nintendo Direct presentation</a>&nbsp;and which has already seen the likes of&nbsp;<em>The Witcher</em>,&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver&nbsp;</em>joining&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>(with the latter even <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/big-dave-diver-collaboration-update-balatro">returning the favor recently</a>).</p>

<p>The latest Friends of Jimbo update brings four new franchises into the&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>fold:&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Binding of Isaac</em>,&nbsp;<em>Slay the Spire</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley</em>, each of which gets a number of cards based on "fan-favorite characters".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/balatro-update-crossover-cards-stardew-valley.jpg?itok=49QhJLB8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/balatro-update-crossover-cards-stardew-valley.jpg?itok=LrJL_O6B 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>has some new crossover cards for you to enjoy.</figcaption></figure><p>Just like the first Friends of Jimbo update, this&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>crossover content is entirely free, and it's up for grabs across all platforms on which&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>is currently available as well, including <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-mobile-release-date">mobile devices</a>.</p>

<p>It's also worth noting that this isn't the big&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>update that developer LocalThunk <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-reach-2-million-as-devs-promise-first-major-update-soon">promised back in August</a>. That one is set to bring "new ideas and strategies" to&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>, and it's set to launch sometime next year.</p>

<p>If you've somehow managed to avoid the&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>hype, it's a poker-based roguelike created by Canadian developer LocalThunk, and it's based around creating big combos and game-breaking strategies to reach higher and higher score multipliers.</p>

<p>While the game is based on poker, it's more about creating synergy across the cards in your deck so that you can keep meeting a series of rising point antes over the course of a run.</p>




<p>Shortly after being released,&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-half-million">crossed 500,000 sales</a>, hitting the million mark <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-one-million">within a month of its initial launch</a>. At last count, the game had reached two million sales, and that number is only likely to increase as time goes on.</p>

<p><em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379780/Balatro/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/balatro/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/balatro/9PK087LNGJC5" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/balatro-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>
