            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/4a-Ukraine-reburn-la-quimera<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Metro&nbsp;</em>series developer 4A Ukraine has announced that it's changing its name, and that its next project will be a narrative-led first-person shooter based on an entirely original IP.</p>

<p>Per a press release, 4A Ukraine' new name is Reburn, and it's currently hard at work on&nbsp;<em>La Quimera</em>, a game the studio describes as an "action-packed first-person shoter with a heavy focus on narrative, world design, and characters".</p>

<p>Unlike the&nbsp;<em>Metro&nbsp;</em>series' oppressive subterranean tunnels,&nbsp;<em>La Quimera&nbsp;</em>will take place in "a fictional Latin American megalopolis" and will revolve around a "down-on-their-luck PMC outfit".</p>

Refn is best known for movies like&nbsp;<em>Drive&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Neon Demon</em>, as well as 2008's prison drama&nbsp;<em>Bronson</em>.</p>

<p>The studio promises that the game's world will combine "Latin American folklore with highly advanced weaponry and technology", which, I suppose, is where the title comes from.</p>

<p>You'll be able to play&nbsp;<em>La Quimera&nbsp;</em>in single-player, but if you want to, you can also team up with up to two friends for three-player co-op. Seems a little strange to stop at three, but hey, if it's good enough for&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-2025" rel="nofollow"><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></a>, it's good enough for&nbsp;<em>La Quimera</em>, I guess.</p>

<p>Reburn says you can expect the same kind of "tense gunplay and intimate storytelling" you're familiar with from the&nbsp;<em>Metro&nbsp;</em>series, as well as "highly detailed environments, characters, and weapons".</p>




<p>Whatever the case may be,&nbsp;<em>La Quimera&nbsp;</em>is slated to arrive on PC via Steam, although it doesn't have a release date yet. No console version appears to be planned for now. Stay tuned for more.</p>
