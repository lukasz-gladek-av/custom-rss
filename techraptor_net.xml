            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/fallen-london-rpg-kickstarter-raises-six-times-its-funding-goal-day-one<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Kickstarter campaign for the <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magpie-games-and-failbetter-games-announces-official-fallen-london-ttrpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Fallen London RPG</a></em> has gone live. Magpie Games' official tabletop adaptation of Failbetter Games' alternate history gothic fantasy world has made an impressive start, raising more than six times its initial funding goal on day one.</p>

<h2>The <em>Fallen London RPG</em> Kickstarter Campaign</h2>

<p>According to its <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/magpiegames/fallen-london-the-roleplaying-game" rel="nofollow">campaign page</a>, the <em>Fallen London RPG</em> is set in the same world created by Failbetter Games. A setting made up of the browser-based Fallen London game and the various videogame spin-offs <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/sunless-sea-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Sunless Seas</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/mask-of-rose-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Mask of the Rose</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

This has led to London becoming a twisted version of itself. Hell is close, immortality is cheap, and Empress Victoria still reigns. But the screaming has mostly stopped.</p>

<p>For certain enterprising people, it is a city full of opportunities. Players can explore these opportunities in the <em>Fallen London RPG</em>. Fame, power, defeating Death itself, opening a gate to the stars, or even restoring London to the surface are goals that can be pursued.</p>

<p>The RPG is made up of two books. The Core Book is 200+ pages and contains everything needed to play. The second book, <em>Guide to London</em>, is over 100 pages and contains new character options.</p>

The group, called a Concern, are devoted to a single Grand Ambition, a major goal that no single character can achieve on their own. But just because those ambitions are grand does not mean they are good. Members of the Concern don't even need to be friendly to one another; they just need to be united in their goal.</p>

<p>The <em>Fallen London RPG</em> will also feature an original TTRPG system. The&nbsp;Ædana System, built on Magpie Games' ten-year history of game development, is a flexible system built around a simple central dice mechanic. You roll a number of d6s equal to your skill level. More dice are added for situational or environmental bonuses. A 5 or a 6 is a Hit. The more Hits you roll, the better the result.</p>

<p>The <em>Fallen London RPG</em> has the following pledge tiers:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Deliciously Digital for $29:</strong> PDFs of the Core Book and Guide to London</li>
	<li><strong>Watcher for $59:</strong> A physical copy of the Core Book and PDFs of the Core Book and <em>Guide to London</em></li>
	<li><strong>Agent for $99.</strong> Physical and PDF copies of both the Core Book and <em>Guide to London</em> and a Benthic Kriegsspiel digital item for Fallen London</li>
	<li><strong>Midnighter for $149:</strong> Everything in the Agent tier, a GM Screen, and a set of custom <em>Fallen London</em> dice</li>
	<li><strong>Master of the Bazaar for $299:</strong> Everything in the Midnighter tier, a set of Neathbow dice, a Deluxe Core Book, and a Sullier of Probabilities digital item for <em>Fallen London</em></li>
</ul><p>In addition, the <em>Fallen London RPG</em> has unlocked additional extras thanks to hitting certain stretch goals. These include official VTT support for both Roll20 and Alchemy, new NPCs being added to the Core Book like Sinning Jenny and Virginia, and official <em>Fallen London</em> dice trays.</p>

<p>At time of writing the <em>Fallen London RPG</em> has raised&nbsp;$313,727, more than six times its initial funding goal of $50,000. The campaign will conclude March 2025. The RPG is expected to ship in August 2026.</p>
