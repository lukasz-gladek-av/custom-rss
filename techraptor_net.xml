<h2>The Hearts of Iron Board Game Announcement</h2>

<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/394360/view/782034509920993389" rel="nofollow">recent post</a> on the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hearts-of-iron-iv" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Hearts of Iron IV</em></a> Steam page, Paradox Interactive officially announced the <em>Hearts of Iron</em> board game. Much like source material, the game allows 2-5 players to take control of history.</p>

To these ends they must build political power, manage resources, and keep their nation stable.</p>

<p>They can play out real historical events or explore alternative histories. What if a Communist France competed against a Democratist Italy? The <em>Hearts of Iron</em> board game will facilitate that. Just be prepared for the time commitment since the estimated time to finish a game is about three hours.</p>

<p>Steamforged Games is developing the <em>Hearts of Iron</em> board game. The company has a glowing reputation in the tabletop industry for its complex, high-quality licensed board games, such as <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/horizon-forbidden-west-seeds-of-rebellion-is-kickstarter-success" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Horizon Forbidden West</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/runescape-kingdoms-games-finally-arrive-to-retail" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Runescape Kingdoms</em></a>.
