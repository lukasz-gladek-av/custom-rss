            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-q3-financials-alan-wake-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em>developer Remedy has announced its financial results for the third quarter of its fiscal year, and things are looking a little rosier for the Finnish studio.</p>

<p>In Remedy's <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/inderes-widgets-prod-assets/remedy/attachments/1ef581e9-5f40-4a92-ab0f-0d15844717cd/remedy-q3-2024-business-review.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">financial report</a>, the studio says its revenue has jumped 128.6% over the same period from the previous year. Between July and September this year, Remedy raked in&nbsp;€17.9 million in revenue, and its operating profit was&nbsp;€2.4 million, up from a&nbsp;€5.5 million loss in Q3 2023.</p>

<p>The studio also says that while&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alan-wake-2-budget-remedy-financials">still isn't profitable</a>, the game had recouped "most of its development and marketing expenses" by the end of the quarter, which means that it may well be profitable within the next couple of quarters.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/alan-wake-2-remedy-financials-lake-house.jpg?itok=VdDMC3Qy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/alan-wake-2-remedy-financials-lake-house.jpg?itok=VJ0dMg8C 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</em>isn't profitable yet, but it seems to be getting there.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Remedy, full production on&nbsp;<em>Control 2&nbsp;</em>is scheduled to start in 2025, with the sequel currently progressing "well in the production readiness stage". Many of the game's "critical features" have been implemented, Remedy says, and it's currently testing "workflows and pipelines" for full production.</p>

<p>Similarly, the&nbsp;upcoming&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/max-payne-remakes-control-spinoff-remedy"><em>Max Payne&nbsp;</em>remakes</a> are "making steady progress", and Remedy says it's "gradually reaching important milestones" in development on the projects.</p>

<p>For the rest of 2024, Remedy expects its revenue to "increase from the previous year", and it also expects its "operating profit to improve", so it looks like Remedy will likely have a better time in 2024 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-financials-2023">than in 2023</a>.</p>

<p>The report also looks ahead to Remedy's upcoming projects, including the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Control 2&nbsp;</em>and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fbc-firebreak-control-spinoff-announced">recently-revealed&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em></a>, a multiplayer&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em>spinoff set to launch sometime next year.</p>




<p>While Remedy is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-annapurna-control-2-tv-movies">teaming up with Annapurna</a> (even amidst that company's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/annapurna-interactive-staff-resign-after-company-spin-off-talks-fail">recent turmoil</a>) for&nbsp;<em>Control 2</em>, the Finnish developer will be self-publishing the game, as it will with&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>.</p>

<p>Here's hoping Remedy's fortunes continue to improve in the coming months. Stay tuned for more on all things Remedy-related.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dayz-creator-kerbal-space-program-killer-ksa</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dayz-creator-reveals-kerbal-space-program-killer-ksa.1025283/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dayz-creator-kerbal-space-program-killer-ksa<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>DayZ&nbsp;</em>creator and RocketWerkz head Dean Hall has announced he and his team are working on a "<em>Kerbal Space Program&nbsp;</em>killer" by the name of&nbsp;<em>KSA</em>, or&nbsp;<em>Kitten Space Academy</em>.</p>

<p>Announcing the game <a href="https://x.com/rocket2guns/status/1851832821020790791" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Hall says he's working on&nbsp;<em>KSA&nbsp;</em>with RocketWerkz alongside "former members of the&nbsp;<em>Kerbal Space Program&nbsp;</em>team and amazing modders".</p>

<p>Right now, the game looks to be in its early stages; the footage Hall showed off in his post simply shows a moon's surface, then zooms out (albeit seamlessly) to reveal a galaxy of planets, all soundtracked by some appropriately moody synth music.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ksa-kerbal-space-program-killer-dean-hall.jpg?itok=d5xCeo72 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ksa-kerbal-space-program-killer-dean-hall.jpg?itok=QwKZf6qu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Dean Hall and RocketWerkz are currently working on a "<em>Kerbal Space Program&nbsp;</em>killer" called&nbsp;<em>KSA</em>, or&nbsp;<em>Kitten Space Academy</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1gg5106/comment/lun0vsl/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Reddit post</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1gg5106/comment/lun0vsl/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" rel="noopener" target="_blank">accompanying comment</a>,&nbsp;Hall goes into more detail regarding RocketWerkz's new project, as well as his own efforts to pitch Private Division on a&nbsp;<em>Kerbal Space Program&nbsp;</em>sequel.</p>

<p>Hall says that his studio was in "the top three bids" to work on&nbsp;<em>Kerbal Space Program 2</em>, but that because his team's pitch focused on the technical side of things and didn't contain any art, his studio wasn't chosen.</p>

<p>However, Hall says that for&nbsp;<em>Kitten Space Agency</em>, he and RocketWerkz have employed several developers who worked on both&nbsp;<em>Kerbal Space Program&nbsp;</em>and its sequel, as well as a mystery "key person" who is a "key individual in our industry".</p>

<p>There's also a little more nerdy technical information contained within Hall's comment, including how the video footage's seamless movement is achieved, how the team deals with floating point precision loss, and more.</p>




<p>If you're wondering why exactly a&nbsp;<em>Kerbal Space Program&nbsp;</em>killer would be needed, look no further than Take-Two's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/intercept-games-shut-down-kerbal-space-program-2">apparent shutdown</a> of&nbsp;<em>Kerbal Space Program 2&nbsp;</em>developer Intercept Games (although Take-Two itself <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-denies-roll7-intercept-closure">denies closing that studio</a>).</p>

<p>Reportedly, Take-Two is also <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-two-reportedly-planning-to-close-or-sell-private-division" rel="noopener" target="_blank">looking to close down or sell</a> its indie label Private Division, so despite the company's claims to the contrary, <i>Kerbal Space Program 2&nbsp;</i>might not be a going concern for much longer.</p>

<p>There's a niche a mile wide, then, for someone like Hall to slide in with a game that's similar enough to&nbsp;<em>Kerbal&nbsp;</em>that people take interest while also being different enough to carve out a niche for itself.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see whether RocketWerkz achieves this, but in the meantime, you can join the project's <a href="https://discord.com/invite/aCwHR7HJ4W" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Discord server</a> if you want to keep up with things as they happen.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Monster Hunter Wilds Open Beta Breaks Series' Steam Player Count Record]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-steam-records</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-breaks-series-steam-player-count-record.1025178/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-steam-records<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' open beta period has begun, and despite the fact that this isn't even a full game release, it's already broken Steam player records for the franchise as a whole.</p>

<p>A quick look at <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3065170/charts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB's stats</a> for the&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta">open beta</a> shows that the test hit a staggering total of 463,798 players at its peak, and that it's currently sitting pretty at 441,009 players (at time of writing).</p>

<p>By way of comparison,&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter World</em>, which remains the <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/business/million.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">biggest-selling</a>&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>game to date, managed 334,684 players at its busiest on Steam, while&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Rise&nbsp;</em>hit 231,360. Both are very respectable totals, but they don't hold a candle to&nbsp;<em>Wilds</em>' beta test.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-steam-records-beasts.jpg?itok=eguERMHa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-steam-records-beasts.jpg?itok=uc3NSK0D 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>open beta is taking the world by storm right now.</figcaption></figure><p>While it could be contended that&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter World&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Rise&nbsp;</em>are both paid premium products,&nbsp;<em>Wilds</em>' open beta is also leaving the free demos the series has offered in the past in its dust.</p>

<p><em>Monster Hunter Rise</em>'s demo, for instance, attracted just 23,991 players at its peak, while the demo for expansion&nbsp;<em>Sunbreak&nbsp;</em>topped out at 27,540. Again, those aren't numbers to be sniffed at, but they do show just how popular&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' open beta is.</p>

<p>The open beta is free, of course, and so many players may be checking it out even if they don't intend to buy the full game. Still, it looks like Capcom will have another bona fide success on its hands when&nbsp;<em>Wilds&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-release-date">launches in February</a>.</p>




<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, it's the latest game in Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>series of action RPGs.</p>

<p>Set in the Forbidden Lands, the game will once again see players venturing out into large semi-open world areas to do battle with a series of monsters, including the game's new flagship beast Arkveld, also known as the White Wraith.</p>

<p>The open beta offers a look at the character creator, as well as an open hunt and a portion of the story. Of course, the internet has already <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/monster-hunter-wilds-character-creator-is-being-used-to-make-scarily-accurate-recreations-of-superheroes-actors-and-characters-from-other-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">created some pretty impressive stuff</a> with said character creator.</p>

<p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/monster-hunter-wilds/9NMT6XFN0LVD" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on February 28th.
