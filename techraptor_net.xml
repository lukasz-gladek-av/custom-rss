            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/virtua-fighter-5-steam-release<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega has announced that 2006 fighting game&nbsp;<em>Virtua Fighter 5&nbsp;</em>is getting a Steam release, and it comes complete with a number of enhancements, including one that's very important to the fighting game community.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://x.com/SEGA/status/1859960222493671731" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>,&nbsp;<em>Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O.</em>, as the Steam version is called, will be coming sometime this winter, although the studio isn't specific about exactly when we can expect the game to arrive on PC.</p>

<p>It'll feature support for up to 4K resolution and 60fps, as well as a host of gameplay balance adjustments. Perhaps most importantly, however, the game will also feature rollback netcode at launch, without which it arguably wouldn't be a viable online title for fighting game enthusiasts.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/virtua-fighter-5-steam-jacky-lau.jpg?itok=MEwGlO27 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/virtua-fighter-5-steam-jacky-lau.jpg?itok=DqXUR5Q5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Virtua Fighter 5&nbsp;</em>is coming to Steam with a very important feature.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with rollback netcode, it's essentially a feature in fighting games by which if an online connection is dropped, each player's game state will try to predict what the player was about to do.</p>

<p>It's a little more complicated than that, but suffice it to say that rollback netcode significantly improves the online experience in fighting games. It's used in the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-fighterz-rollback-netcode-ps5-xbox" rel="nofollow"><em>Dragon Ball FighterZ</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/street-fighter-6-rollback-netcode-will-be-better-open-worlds-detailed" rel="nofollow"><em>Street Fighter 6</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/will-tekken-8-have-crossplay-and-rollback-netcode-katsuhiro-harada-responds" rel="nofollow"><em>Tekken 8</em></a>, so&nbsp;<em>Virtua Fighter 5&nbsp;</em>including it at launch on Steam makes a lot of sense.</p>

<p>Sega says it will be sharing more information about&nbsp;<em>Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O.&nbsp;</em>in the future, so presumably, we'll be getting a release date in the next couple of weeks. I wouldn't be surprised if this year's Game Awards included that info.</p>




<p>News of&nbsp;<em>Virtua Fighter 5</em>'s impending Steam release comes just a few weeks after Sega revealed that a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sega-new-virtua-fighter-game" rel="nofollow">new installment in the franchise is in development</a>, although we don't yet know what it'll look like or when we can expect it to arrive.</p>

<p>It's part of a wider initiative on Sega's part to revive some of its classic franchises, with that initiative also yielding the likes of a&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shinobi-movie-announced" rel="nofollow"><em>Shinobi&nbsp;</em>movie</a>, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crazy-taxi-reboot-open-world-mmo" rel="nofollow">new&nbsp;<em>Crazy Taxi&nbsp;</em>game</a>, and several more classic Sega IPs <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sega-super-game-old-ip-revived" rel="nofollow">getting new games as well</a>.</p>

<p><em>Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O.&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3112260/Virtua_Fighter_5_REVO/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> sometime this winter. The game is also currently available <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0177-CUSA27065_00-9558212560709500" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on PS4</a> (and on PS5 via backwards compatibility).</p>
