            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Atari has announced that it has acquired the intellectual property rights to five classic Ubisoft games, and that it will revive all of them on newer platforms with "renewed publishing frameworks".</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://businesswire.com/news/home/20250826081788/en/Atari-Announces-Strategic-IP-Agreement-With-Ubisoft-To-Revive-Five-Acclaimed-Titles" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a>, Atari reveals that the five&nbsp;Ubisoft titles in question are as follows:&nbsp;<em>Cold Fear</em>,&nbsp;<em>Child of Eden</em>,&nbsp;<em>I Am Alive</em>,&nbsp;<em>Grow Home</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Grow Up</em>. All five will be re-released on "new platforms", according to Atari.</p>

<p>It's likely that the company is referring specifically to current-gen consoles, given that technically speaking, four of the five games in this list (with&nbsp;<em>Child of Eden&nbsp;</em>being the only exception)&nbsp;are still available on PC via Steam.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/i-am-alive-ubisoft-atari-revival.jpg?itok=GxeB1ktm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/i-am-alive-ubisoft-atari-revival.jpg?itok=bZQURLhD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>2012's survival game&nbsp;<em>I Am Alive&nbsp;</em>is just one of five Ubisoft titles Atari plans to revive.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Atari, the plan is to re-release all five of these games under its own publishing label, as well as to "explore opportunities" to expand the reach of the games "through updated formats, new content, and extended distribution channels".</p>

<p>Hopefully, this means that the five games in the list will be getting remastered versions; they're all arguably in need of them to varying degrees, with 2005's&nbsp;<em>Cold Fear&nbsp;</em>being a particularly strong candidate for an updated re-release.</p>

<p>Still, being able to play <i>Cold Fear</i>,&nbsp;<em>I Am Alive</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Child of Eden&nbsp;</em>on modern consoles will be nice. Technically, both&nbsp;<em>Grow Home&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Grow Up&nbsp;</em>are already available on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S through backwards compatibility.</p>

<p>This news comes after a particularly difficult year for Ubisoft. Not only did its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-creative-houses-q1-financials" rel="nofollow">first-quarter financials back in July</a> disappoint, but last fiscal year <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-financials-layoffs-possible" rel="nofollow">was a grim one for sales</a>, with a strong performance from&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>failing to make up for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing" rel="nofollow">shortfalls elsewhere</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced two brand new features for its SNES Classics catalog on the Nintendo Switch Online service, and if you're a connoisseur of strategy and puzzle games, this one's for you.</p>

<p>First up, select SNES games now support mouse controls on Switch Online. Naturally, this includes&nbsp;<em>Mario Paint</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-paint-nintendo-switch-online" rel="nofollow">released on the service last month</a>; in fact, Nintendo says some games "can only be played using mouse controls", seemingly including&nbsp;<em>Mario Paint</em>.</p>

<p>Other games support mouse controls as well, though; the trailer demonstrating the new mouse control feature shows not only&nbsp;<em>Mario Paint&nbsp;</em>being played, but also&nbsp;<em>Mario's Super Picross&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Nobunaga's Ambition</em>, both of which are probably a lot more satisfying with a mouse.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-online-snes-classics-mouse-controls.jpg?itok=lH5X3M39 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-online-snes-classics-mouse-controls.jpg?itok=1FWa5CpH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You can now play some SNES Classics on Nintendo Switch Online with mouse controls.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're playing on Switch 2, then the SNES games that support mouse controls will be playable with the Joy-Con 2's mouse mode, but if you're on the original Switch, you'll need to hook up a USB mouse to take advantage of this new feature.</p>

<p>As well as mouse controls, the new update also brings the ability to both view and change the controls for the SNES game you're playing. If there are button mappings that don't quite suit your play style, you can change them around to suit you.</p>

<p>Naturally, you'll also be able to save different mappings and configurations for each game, so you won't have to stick with the mappings you set up for&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Kart&nbsp;</em>in&nbsp;<em>Super Metroid</em>. Nintendo isn't that heartless.</p>

<p>You can check out a trailer showing off the new features being added to Nintendo Switch Online right here.</p>




<p>Both mouse controls and the ability to remap your buttons are available right now if you're a Nintendo Switch Online subscriber. Of course, if you're not, you'll need to sign up to get access to the SNES catalog.</p>
