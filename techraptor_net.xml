            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-modding-clampdown<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>developer NetEase appears to have clamped down on the use of skin mods within the game in its latest update, effectively banning users from changing characters' skins with mods outright.</p>

<p>Per an IGN <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-season-1-update-appears-to-have-disabled-mods-much-to-the-dismay-of-fans-of-custom-skins" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, the latest season of the game has added a process called "asset hash checking" to&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>, which is essentially a way for the game to check whether assets are legit or not.</p>

<p>Naturally, this means that any unauthorized user mods, such as the one that turns Iron Man into&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/marvelrivals/mods/105" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dragon Ball</em>'s Vegeta</a> or the one that gives Guardian of the Galaxy Mantis a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/marvelrivals/mods/435" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">decidedly goth bent</a>, are no longer valid as far as&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>is concerned.</p>

Your&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>Mantis goth mod won't work anymore. Image courtesy of svanax's mod on Nexus Mods.</figcaption></figure><p>As IGN points out, modding has always been against&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' terms of service, and NetEase itself has warned players against using mods to change their skins or do anything else unauthorized within the game.</p>

<p>In a statement to IGN, NetEase says it doesn't recommend modifying game files, because doing so "carries the risk of getting banned". It doesn't seem to provide any official confirmation that asset hash checking has been added.</p>

<p>It is, of course, entirely possible that enterprising modders (and is there any other kind?) will find a way around this latest setback. For the time being, however, you'll have to shelve your&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>mods if you don't want to get banned.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>is, it's a multiplayer hero shooter developed by Chinese studio NetEase and heavily inspired by the likes of&nbsp;<em>Overwatch</em>.</p>




<p>Revealed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-announced" rel="nofollow">in March last year</a>, the free-to-play game was released in December, going on to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-10m" rel="nofollow">hit 10 million players within a 72-hour period</a>. Of course, it's free-to-play, so many of those players may not be repeat customers, but it's still an impressive number.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-engineers-2-steam-workshop-confirmed</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-engineers-2-steam-workshop-confirmed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Keen Software House has announced that&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>will, in fact, be using Steam Workshop as its main user-generated content platform.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1133870/view/527583567913419118" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Steam, Keen Software House CEO Marek Rosa says that the decision to switch to Steam Workshop came from "listening to our community, particularly our content creators, who have expressed a strong preference" for the platform.</p>

<p>The original plan, according to Rosa, was to use Mod.io, which Rosa says was "driven by the goal of providing a unified backend" for&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2</em>'s PC and console versions. However, user feedback subsequently "made it clear" that Steam Workshop was the preferred direction.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/space-engineers-2-steam-workshop-astronauts.jpg?itok=p7SAGgLS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/space-engineers-2-steam-workshop-astronauts.jpg?itok=xTKQW9up 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Space Engineers 2</em>'s user-generated content will primarily use Steam Workshop, it's been announced.</figcaption></figure><p>Rosa goes on to say that Steam Workshop support will be added for&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2</em>'s user-generated content in the game's first major post-launch patch, which will arrive after the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-engineers-2-early-access-release-date" rel="nofollow">planned Early Access launch on January 27th</a>.</p>

<p>As for console players, Rosa says he and Keen Software House are currently "evaluating the best approach" when it comes to console-based user-generated content, and that the studio will "share more details as we progress".</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://2.spaceengineersgame.com/roadmap-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">roadmap</a> has also been updated to reflect the Steam Workshop decision, with Vertical Slice 1.1 now connecting the in-game workshop to Steam Workshop rather than Mod.io.</p>

<p>Future Vertical Slices for&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>will bring the likes of improved gameplay mechanics, support for modding via the VRAGE Editor, and the opportunity to explore individual planets, plus lots more.</p>




<p>As you can probably guess,&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>is the sequel to the original&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers</em>. It expands the original's sandbox gameplay with new blueprint tools, new gameplay systems, and plenty more.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>when it launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1133870/Space_Engineers_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on January 27th. Stay tuned for more.</p>
