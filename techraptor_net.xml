            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A change-up has happened at Archetype Entertainment. The lead of the studio, James Ohlen, will be stepping down from the company, shifting his role within the parent company, Wizards of the Coast.</p><p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.enworld.org/threads/james-ohlen-shifts-from-archetype-entertainment-head-to-creative-consultant-for-tabletop-rpgs-at-wizards.716766/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">EN World</a>, James Ohlen has chosen to leave his position as the lead of Archetype Entertainment. This is a new internal games studio established by tabletop giant Wizards of the Coast to develop AAA videogames based on original IPs.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>This is important since the studio's first project, <em>Exodus</em>, has been long in development. After its 2023 announcement, a lot of pre-rendered trailers, a dedicated episode in the anthology series <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/secret-level-brings-videogame-anthology-to-prime-video" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Secret Level</em></a>, and an official <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coasts-exodus-ttrpg-is-out-putting-sci-fi-twist-on-dungeons-dragons" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">TTRPG tie-in</a>, the sci-fi title had a gameplay trailer at this year's The Game Awards. The game appears to be a narrative-focused third-person action title. It also dropped a release date of early 2027.</p><p>Ohlen's official reasons for his departure from Archetype Entertainment were that he felt that his work on <em>Exodus</em> was complete and that the final bits of development were in good hands. Given the nature of videogame development cycles, this tracks. It means the game is essentially content complete; all that is left is QA, playtesting, and improving technical performance.</p><p>But Ohlen is not completely departing from Wizards of the Coast as a company. Ohlen will remain as a creative consultant for the tabletop publisher, shifting his focus to TTRPGs. This is a familiar field for Ohlen since he launched Arcanum Worlds, a TTRPG studio dedicated to publishing third-party material for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>.</p><p>Better still, Arcanum Worlds' output has a consistent record of quality. Their world includes DMs Guild supplements like <em>Minsc and Boo's Journal of Villainy</em> and <em>Heroes of Baldur's Gate,</em> as well as the comprehensive book on the Nine Hells, <em>Chains of Asmodeus</em>. The studio has also created original fantasy settings built on D&amp;D's system, such as <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dragon-age-writer-reveals-raiders-of-serpent-sea" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Raiders of the Serpent Sea</em></a> and <em>Odyssey of the Dragonlords</em>.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
