            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-kill-team-blood-and-zeal-expansion-brings-ferocity-and-faith-to-warhammer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Games Workshop has announced a new expansion for <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000-kill-team" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000 Kill Team</em></a>. The aptly named <em>Kill Team: Blood and Zeal</em>, will not just introduce new factions to the skirmish game, but the introduction of two new mission decks.</p>

<h2>The <em>Kill Team: Blood and Zeal</em> Announcement</h2>

<p>In an official <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/qtq917vz/kill-team-blood-and-zeal-how-the-latest-expansion-set-changes-the-game/" rel="nofollow">Warhammer-Community post</a>, Games Workshop goes into detail about the <em>Kill Team: Blood and Zeal</em> expansion. First, the expansion will introduce new units to the game: Khorne's bloodthirsty Goremongers and the militant Sanctifiers.</p>

Those cards are divided into two new mission categories: Blood and Zeal. Zeal mission cards represent protection and guidance, reducing wounds or preventing death. Alternatively, Blood cards are aggressive, providing bonus damage, extra movement, and even double Fight and Shoot actions.</p>

<p>Players can draw and play from either of these decks during the Strategy phase and whenever an opponent scores Victory Points. In addition, these cards can be used with any faction in the game. In addition, you can score additional Victory Points if you played the most Blood or Zeal cards during a match. This means no matter what you play, you have some extra options at your disposal.</p>

<p>These cards play into another new feature in <em>Kill Team: Blood and Zeal</em>. There is a shrine statue in the set; a focal point of supernatural power. While controlling the statue, your operatives can perform two new actions. Praise/Blaspheme lets you remove cards from your hand or discard pile and draw a new one. Hallow/Defile, allows you to draw a new card into your hand.</p>

<p>This means controlling the shrine statue can grant players a major advantage. It can lead to valiant standoffs or devastating slaughter depending on how the dice go.</p>

<p>These new mission decks will not stop with <em>Kill Team: Blood and Zeal</em>. The post continues stating each new Kill Team battle box will contain new mission packs. It mentions an upcoming box, Kill team: Brutal and Cunning, which will facilitate attacker/defender scenarios.</p>

<p><em>Kill Team: Blood and Zeal</em> will be available for pre-order this upcoming Saturday.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/croc-legend-of-gobbos-remaster-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Argonaut Games has announced the release date for the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Croc: Legend of the Gobbos&nbsp;</em>remaster, and it won't be long before you get to revisit this cult platforming classic.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://x.com/ArgonautGames_/status/1902030119524331617" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on social media platform X,&nbsp;<em>Croc: Legend of the Gobbos&nbsp;</em>arrives on PC and consoles on April 2nd. You can wishlist the game on PC now via GOG, but wishlisting isn't yet available for the console platforms; it's coming "soon", according to Argonaut.</p>

<p>If you're wondering what's happened to the Steam version of the game, Argonaut revealed back in October that the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/croc-legend-of-gobbos-remaster-no-steam-release" rel="nofollow">wouldn't be coming to Valve's platform</a>, citing a desire for the game to remain DRM-free on PC (although not on consoles, of course).</p>

<p>The game was part of a rush of mascot platformers released around that period, going up against the likes of Nintendo's&nbsp;<em>Super Mario 64</em>, Naughty Dog's&nbsp;<em>Crash Bandicoot</em>, and Insomniac Games'&nbsp;<em>Spyro the Dragon</em>, all of which were released within a couple of years of one another.</p>

<p><em>Croc: Legend of the Gobbos&nbsp;</em>wasn't quite as well-received as the aforementioned titles during its time, but it garnered a cult following, and in August last year, its original publisher Argonaut <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/croc-legend-of-gobbos-remaster" rel="nofollow">announced its revival</a>, as well as the game's remaster.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Croc: Legend of the Gobbos&nbsp;</em>remaster will, of course, sport fresh HD graphics, as well as new controls and an updated camera to make the game's occasionally janky platforming a little less frustrating. You can also expect a&nbsp;<em>Croc</em>&nbsp;treasure trove with lots of materials pertaining to the game's creation.</p>




<p><em>Croc: Legend of the Gobbos&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/croc_legend_of_the_gobbos" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via GOG</a>, as well as on PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch, on April 2nd.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/analogue-3d-n64-delayed-july<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Retro gaming specialist company Analogue has announced that its upcoming Analogue 3D, a "reimagining" of the original Nintendo 64 console, has once again been delayed.</p>

<p>Back in October, the console was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/analogue-3d-n64-delayed-2025" rel="nofollow">delayed until the first quarter of this year</a>, but in an updated <a href="https://www.analogue.co/support/resource/3d-preorder-faq" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">FAQ</a> for the machine, Analogue says it's now intended to ship "by July 2025" following a delay. The company doesn't give the reason for said delay.</p>

<p>Analogue does, however, say it's "working hard to get your 3D order in hands ASAP" and that it "appreciate[s] your patience". The company also reiterates that its refund policy is still "no questions asked", so while you don't need to do anything if you're happy with your pre-order, you can cancel it and get your money back if you wish.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/analogue-3d-delayed-july-2025-top-down.jpg?itok=iqnLh1d3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/analogue-3d-delayed-july-2025-top-down.jpg?itok=zJAucjb- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The upcoming Analogue 3D retro console has been delayed once again.</figcaption></figure><p>In closing, Analogue says that it will email customers a week in advance of the eventual shipping date (which has not yet been announced) to ensure that it has the correct address.</p>

<p>If you're not aware of the Analogue 3D, it's a retro console that's intended to serve as a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/analogue-3d-announced-and-its-4k-nintendo-64" rel="nofollow">sort of supercharged N64</a>; it can play any cartridge officially released for Nintendo's console, but it's got a bunch of upscaling tricks up its sleeve.</p>

<p>The Analogue 3D will be fully region-free, and it'll support Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, as well as sporting its own operating system. The console is engineered in FGPA, too, so Analogue says it won't have any of the kind of glitches you might expect from software-level emulation.</p>

<p>Of course, since this is basically a reimagined N64, it'll also feature the same four controller ports included with the original console, and you can even use your original N64 controllers with it, although you may prefer to use the (not included with purchase) 8BitDo 64 controller.</p>

You can head over to the <a href="https://store.analogue.co/products/analogue-3d-black" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">store page</a> if you'd like to be notified when it arrives.</p>
