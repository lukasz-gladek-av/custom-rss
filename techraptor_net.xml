            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Another GameCube game has been added to the Nintendo Switch Online library, and this time, it's the turn of classic turn-based strategy epic <em>Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</em>.</p><p>Just like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wario-world-nintendo-switch-online" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6472b9f8-3b35-41d5-9c98-1ffee343faf2" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">every other</a> GameCube <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/luigis-mansion-nintendo-switch-online" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="559128f7-0f60-43f5-a4e0-64e6a9d1d5b0" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">game</a> on the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chibi-robo-switch-online" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5eda1a19-710c-4126-8f24-86dd16fbc1ae" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">service</a>, <em>Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance </em>is only available if you're a Switch 2 owner with the Expansion Pack addon for your Switch Online membership, but if you do fulfil those criteria, you can check it out right now.</p><p><em>Path of Radiance </em>was released all the way back in 2005 (and, incidentally, was my introduction to the <em>Fire Emblem </em>series, as I'm sure it was for many). The game follows Ike, a mercenary who gets caught up in a conflict between nations and who must help a princess reclaim her throne.</p><figure role="group">

<p>Much like its predecessors (and, indeed, its successors), <em>Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance </em>is a turn-based strategy RPG in which you'll be issuing commands to your characters and trying to keep them alive throughout various combat scenarios.</p><p>The game features permadeath, so if any of your troops fall during a battle, they're gone for good. Even plot-critical characters can fall in this way, although they'll be gravely wounded rather than dead, so you'll still see them during cutscenes.</p><p><em>Path of Radiance </em>is the first <em>Fire Emblem </em>game to feature fully-rendered 3D graphics, as well as voice acting and FMV cutscenes, but it's not the first title to come to the West; that honor goes to 2003's eponymous <em>Fire Emblem </em>(which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fire-emblem-nintendo-switch-online" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a7f1d4bf-fa55-4e28-a6da-a9eb0190b12d" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">also on Switch Online!</a>).</p><p>You can check out a trailer for <em>Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</em>'s Switch Online release right here. The trailer's in Japanese, but the game is available across the world, so you won't exclusively be playing the Japanese version.</p>
<p><em>Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance </em>is available right now to Nintendo Switch Online subscribers with a Switch 2 and the Expansion Pack addon. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
