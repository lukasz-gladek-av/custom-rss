            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/games-workshop-reports-strong-profits-hands-out-ps20-million-to-staff<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Employees at Games Workshop are getting a pay bonus. Despite the tabletop industry being highly volatile due to reckless <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/adjusted-us-trade-tariffs-to-china-still-poses-problems-to-board-game-industry" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">trade tariffs</a> disrupting trade and imports, the UK-based studio has reported growth. Growth that will be given to its staff.</p>

<h2>The Games Workshop Windfall</h2>

<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/warhammer-games-workshop-staff-payout-b2756495.html" rel="nofollow">The Independent</a>, Games Workshop will be distributing bonus payments to its staff drawn from profits. These bonus payments will be distributed on an equal basis to each member of the staff. The studio, most well-known for <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer: 40,000 </em></a>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-age-of-sigmar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer: Age of Sigmar</em></a>, stated the payout was in recognition of its employees' contributions to financial performance.</p>

This is a notable increase from last year, which saw £18 million shared among the staff for stellar performance. Considering other tabletop studios have either shut down or have filed lawsuits in response to current events, this report of growth is unexpected.</p>

<p>As for how much that&nbsp;£20 million will break down among the Games Workshop staff, that is harder to parse. GW doesn't disclose how many employees they have, but it is believed they have 1,500 employees in their home base in Nottingham. Assuming that number is correct, that would mean each employee may be getting about £13k in pay bonuses.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition, the staff number cited doesn't take into account global employees, either in offices outside the UK or working online.</p>

<p>A major factor in Games Workshop's growth are its licensed video games. These include ongoing support for Owlcat Games' RPG <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader</em></a> and Saber Interactive's <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/space-marine-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</em></a>. This is in addition to strong sales and ongoing support for the company's many tabletop miniatures games.</p>

<p>The growth of Games Workshop may not be slowing down anytime soon. The company has <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/amazon-warhammer-40000-film-contract-signed-production-can-now-begin" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">partnered with Amazon</a> and Vertigo Entertainment to produce official movies and TV shows set within the grimdark sci-fi world of <em>Warhammer 40,000</em>. Better still, the production has the star power of Henry Cavill on board.</p>
