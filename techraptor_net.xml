            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-layoffs-leamington-closure<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has closed down yet another studio and laid off almost 200 employees, with a support outfit in the UK being shuttered and three studios undergoing "targeted restructurings", i.e. layoffs.</p>

<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-announces-studio-closure-as-it-lays-off-185-staff" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>, a spokesperson for Ubisoft said the closure and downsizings were "part of our ongoing efforts to prioritize projects and reduce costs" in order to "ensure long-term stability".</p>

<p>As such, the company's Leamington branch, a support studio that's worked on the likes of&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Skull and Bones</em>, will be closed entirely, while Ubisoft Düsseldorf, Ubisoft Stockholm and Ubisoft Reflections will be downsized. Overall, Ubisoft is letting go 185 of its employees.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ubisoft-leamington-closing-layoffs-skull-and-bones.jpg?itok=FrD3gmu7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ubisoft-leamington-closing-layoffs-skull-and-bones.jpg?itok=lpG68lAn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Skull and Bones&nbsp;</em>support studio Ubisoft Leamington is no more.</figcaption></figure><p>The cost-cutting measures to which Ubisoft refers have already seen it close down its San Francisco and Osaka branches, the former being responsible for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing" rel="nofollow">developing the flop multiplayer FPS&nbsp;<em>XDefiant</em></a>.</p>

<p>It's not just&nbsp;<em>XDefiant&nbsp;</em>that flopped, either; two high-profile releases, namely&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Skull and Bones&nbsp;</em>(both of which Leamington worked on as a support studio), <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-h1-2024-25-fiscal-results" rel="nofollow">contributed to a $285 million loss</a> for the company in the first half of the 2024-25 fiscal year.</p>

<p>Ubisoft's woes don't end there, either. Having likely banked on the November release of&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>to bolster its finances, the game was instead <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-february" rel="nofollow">delayed to February</a>, then <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-march" rel="nofollow">again to March</a>.</p>

<p>As if that wasn't enough, the company is also facing unrest from its shareholders, some of whom have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activist-ubisoft-investor-open-letter-change" rel="nofollow">called for "strategic and structural change"</a>&nbsp;and expressed "deep dissatisfaction" with what they see as the direction in which the studio is currently heading.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-leamington-closure.jpg?itok=I3xrNZE8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-leamington-closure.jpg?itok=7kTrshzN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ubisoft is likely banking on a big success with&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Amid reports that company boss Yves Guillemot and major shareholder Tencent are <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-bosses-tencent-private-buyout-report" rel="nofollow">considering taking the company private</a>, another potential force to be reckoned with on this front is the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund, which has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-mirage-dlc-report-ubisoft" rel="nofollow">reportedly provided funding</a> for new&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Mirage&nbsp;</em>DLC.</p>

<p>Whatever the case may be, Ubisoft desperately needs a big hit if it's going to dig itself out of the rut in which it's found itself. For the sake of the company, let's hope&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>is that hit.

We’ll be breaking all of it down so that you know what’s new, what you can expect, when you can find it, and more.</p>

<h2 id="section-1">New Magic: The Gathering in 2025 Features</h2>

<h3 id="section-2">Headliners</h3>



<p>Starting with <em>Innistrad Remastered</em>, 2025 premieres Headliners – a new part of the ongoing booster fun initiative. This means a single card from the set has been given special treatments and illustrations to be unique. This can include serialization, like we see with the first two Headliners of the year in <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/inr/234/edgar-markov" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Edgar Markov">Edgar Markov </a>and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dft/231/the-aetherspark" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="The Aetherspark">The Aetherspark</a>.</p>

<h3 id="section-3">Japan Showcase Cards</h3>



<p>Continuing from the end of last year, Japanese Showcase Cards will be in at least some of 2025’s sets, after debuting in Duskmourn. These are a few (so far 10 each time) cards that have been given alternate art by Japanese artists, and appear only in collector boosters. They appear in about 10% of collector boosters, and 10% of those will have the Japan Showcase exclusive fracture foiling.</p>

<h2 id="section-4">Secret Lair Changes to Magic: The Gathering in 2025</h2>

<p>Wizards Secret Lair program is seeing changes this year as they attempt to innovate with it, and address ongoing problems.</p>

<h3 id="section-5">Chaos Vault</h3>

<p>On the experimental side of things, Wizards <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-announces-their-first-chaos-vault-drop-for-magic-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Wizards of the Coast Announces Their First Chaos Vault Drop for Magic: The Gathering">introduced the Chaos Vault </a>this year, where they promise to have unusual items, at unusual times. This is where we’re going to see some of the product innovation it appears, and we have seen a couple of things so far. So far they have experimented with a foil only drop, and changing the way they <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/latest-secret-lair-chaos-vault-previews-psychedelic-land-cards" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Latest Secret Lair Chaos Vault Previews Psychedelic Land Cards">handle basic land drops </a>in the first two this year.</p>

<h3 id="section-6">Distributing Mechanically Unique Secret Lair Cards</h3>

<p>Without The List to put Universes Within versions of mechanically unique secret lair cards, Wizards has worked out a few ideas on how to fulfill the promise of making these cards available outside of ordering via the Secret Lair website. While reprints in sets are an option, another is via promo distribution, such as they are doing with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/upcoming-magic-presents-spring-flourishes-event-showcases-new-dd-themed-cards" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Upcoming Magic Presents: Spring Flourishes Event Showcases New D&amp;D-Themed Cards"><em>Dungeons and Dragons: Honor Among Thieves </em>secret lair cards</a>.<br><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dnd-secret-lair-bohn-rashel-and-mathise.jpg?itok=-yjpg5NK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dnd-secret-lair-bohn-rashel-and-mathise.jpg?itok=t5KwmCC5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture></p>

<p>The bigger experiment though, is that Wizards of the Coast will be allowing <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/a-secret-lair-test-is-coming-to-your-local-wpn-game-store" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="A Secret Lair Test Is Coming to Your Local WPN Game Store">game stores to sell secret lairs</a> that have mechanically unique cards. This won’t solve all the issues people have, but should make them more available.</p>



<p>2025 will have 6 standard legal, tentpole set releases, with three of them being universes beyond sets. Additionally, Innistrad Remastered will be coming out, though its cards will retain whatever current legality they have, much like they have for past remastered sets.</p>

<p>The reduction in the number of sets released this year to ‘only’ 6 has meant that they have decided to delay the release of the previously announced set codenamed Wrestling. Announced back in 2023 as part of their longterm showing, Wrestling is a return to the plane of Lorwyn/Shadowmoor, a celtic inspired plane of duality. It was scheduled to release in 2025, but now will instead be the first set released in 2026.</p>

<h3 id="section-8">Innistrad Remastered</h3>



<p><strong>Release date: January 24</strong></p>

<p>The first release of 2025 is magic’s latest remaster set, this time taking us to the horror plane of Innistrad. Like past remaster sets, this is all reprints, and it’s of cords that have ties to the plane of Innistrad.</p>

<p>One small change here is that the card’s don’t need to have been printed in an Innistrad set before. These cards do need to fit the set, and either depict Innistrad, or appear to be cards that could have been printed there in the past. The most notable reprint introduced in this way is <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/inr/202/hermit-druid" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Hermit Druid">Hermit Druid</a>, a card that hasn’t been printed in a paper set since 1995, outside of an appearance on The List.</p>

<p><strong>Headliner: Edgar Markov</strong></p>

<p><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/edgar-markov-headliner.jpg?itok=ASjv1v45 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/edgar-markov-headliner.jpg?itok=8-8h5q1E 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><br>
The Headliner program starts with Innistrad Remastered and we see that Edgar Markov gets to appear in several different ways. In any pack he can be in a standard, retro border, or fang treatment (from Innistrad: Crimson Vow). Exclusively in collector boosters though he can be in a secret lair style movie poster, as a serialized card out of 500.</p>

<h3 id="section-9">Aetherdrift</h3>

<p><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aetherdrift-key-art.jpg?itok=CfiusYHK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aetherdrift-key-art.jpg?itok=N0_91uvi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><br><strong>Release Date: February 14</strong></p>

<p>Magic’s first attempt at a ‘travelogue’ set, <em>Aetherdrift </em>is Magic’s take on racing, in particular the death race area. It involves the planes of Avishkar (<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/aetherdrift-brings-wacky-races-and-new-name-for-old-plane-to-magic-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Aetherdrift Brings Wacky Races and New Name for an Old Plane to Magic: The Gathering">formerly known as Kaladesh</a>), Amonkhet, and Muraganda, as ten teams race across them representing each two color pairing.</p>

<p>The set leans into its themes of racing and features a large number of vehicles, and mounts, with new mechanics designed to further and complement the theme. A number of callbacks, and cameo mechanics to past visits to Amonkhet and Avishkar are also present, as well as the first time we’re seeing more of Murganda.</p>

<p><strong>Headliner: The Aetherspark</strong></p>



<p>The Headliner for Aetherdrift is the grand prize of the race itself, The Aetherspark, the first ever Planeswalker card with another type. The headliner version of The Aetherspark is like Edgar Markov, in that it is a borderless, serialized (out of 500), double rainbow foiled card only findable in collector boosters. This version also has distinct art, though it’s much more normal than the poster art of Edgar Markov.</p>

<p><strong>First Place Foils</strong></p>

<p>Coming in Box Toppers and Finish Line Bundles, First Place Foils are a new type of foiling process that goes heavy on the . To get one of these, you need to buy a Play or Collector booster box, or the Finish Line Bundles. The special packs they come in will have 2 cards, 1 of 10 basic lands in First Place Foil, and 1 of 127 Rare or Mythic Rares in the set.</p>

<p><strong>Commander Decks</strong></p>

<p>There are 2 <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/aetherdrift-commander-decklists" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Aetherdrift Commander Decklists">Commander decks for Aetherdrift</a>, a marked decline from the normal 4 we have seen recently. They are Living Energy (a green/blue/red Energy focused deck), and Eternal Might (a white/blue/black Zombie focused deck).</p>

<h3 id="section-10">Tarkir: Dragonstorm</h3>



<p><strong>Release Date: April 11</strong><br>
A decade has passed since we last saw the mighty plane of Tarkir, and we return to it in <em>Tarkir: Dragonstorm</em>. We’ve seen various dragons appearing in odd spots in sets (like in <em>Bloomburrow</em>) because of the Dragonstorm, and it appears here we might learn some of what is going on.</p>

<p><em>Tarkir: Dragonstorm</em> will take a best of both approach in regards to what parts of the first block it will capture: there are going to be dragons, and there will be the wedge-aligned clan factions. We can also expect the return of <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mat/46/sarkhan-soul-aflame" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Sarkhan, Soul Aflame">Sarkhan Vol </a>(desparked as of March of the Machines Aftermath), and more ominously Ugin, who retains his spark but has left his guardianship of Nicol Bolas for some reason.</p>

<p><strong>Headliner: TBA</strong><br>
We don’t know what the Headliner for <em>Tarkir: Dragonstorm </em>will be at this time.</p>

<p><strong>Commander Decks</strong><br>
We have no knowledge of what Commander decks will be distributed with Tarkir: Dragonstorm at this time.</p>

<h3 id="section-11">Magic: The Gathering - Final Fantasy</h3>



<p><strong>Release Date: June 13</strong></p>

<p>The first of the direct to standard Universes Beyond sets will be the <em>Final Fantasy </em>set releasing in June. This set will feature aspects of games all across the <em>Final Fantasy </em>series, with some favorite characters confirmed already to be represented. Cloud, Terra, Lightning, and Noctis, will all be in the set, alongside summons, monsters, chocobos, and more in the set.</p>

<p><strong>Headliner: TBA</strong></p>

<p>We don’t know what the Headliner for <em>Magic: The Gathering - Final Fantasy </em>will be, or even if the Headliner program will be used with Universes Beyond sets like this one.</p>

<p><strong>Commander Decks: TBA</strong></p>

<p>We don’t know anything at this point about Commander Decks for <em>Magic: The Gathering - Final Fantasy</em>.</p>

<h3 id="section-12">Edge of Eternities</h3>



<p><strong>Release Date: August 1</strong></p>

<p>For the first time, Magic: The Gathering is heading out into the blind eternities, that space in the multiverse between planes. <em>Edge of Eternities </em>will be a science fantasy set, this will involve Magic’s take on the space opera genre as it takes place beyond the edge of the known multiverse in heretofore unknown Sothera system.</p>

<p><strong>Headliner: Sothera, The Supervoid</strong></p>



<p>We don’t know much of anything about Sothera, merely that it was announced to be the headliner card when they were showing off future sets, and teasing 2025 content.</p>

<p><strong>Commander Decks: TBA</strong><br>
We don’t know what Commander Decks will be released along with <em>Edge of Eternities</em>.</p>

<h3 id="section-13">Marvel’s Spider-Man</h3>



<p><strong>Release Date: Final Quarter Of 2025</strong></p>

<p>Set to release sometime in September or later, <em>Marvel’s Spider-Man</em> will be the first of several Marvel sets releasing over the next few years. As the set’s name implies, this one will be focused on Spider-Man and will be based on the original comics, not the Marvel Cinematic Universe version of the webslinger. Like <em>Final Fantasy</em>, it will be standard legal, and distributed in normal boosters.</p>

<p><strong>Headliner: TBA</strong><br>
We don’t know what the Headliner for <em>Marvel’s Spider-Man </em>will be, or even if the Headliner program will be used with Universes Beyond sets like this one.</p>

<p><strong>Commander Decks</strong></p>

<p>We don’t know anything at this point about Commander Decks for Marvel’s Spider-Man.</p>

<h3 id="section-14">Unannounced Universes Beyond Set</h3>



<p><strong>Release Date: After Spider-Man In Final Quarter of 2025</strong></p>

<p>Our final release of 2025 is a large mystery still, with Wizard’s not announcing what Universes Beyond this will be. It will be the final release of the year, and come out sometime in the year after Spider-Man releases. It will be Standard legal, and be a randomized booster product.</p>

<p><strong>Headliner: TBA</strong><br>
We don’t know anything more about this set at this time.</p>

<p><strong>Commander Decks</strong><br>
We really don’t know what this set will be.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hogwarts-legacy-mod-support-update-coming-this-week.1092768/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-mod-support-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizarding RPG&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>is getting official mod support via an update this week, developer Avalanche Studios and publisher Warner Bros. Games have revealed.</p>

<p>Launching on January 30th, the update will not only add modding support to the game, but it'll also bring official modding tools that will allow&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>'s players to create mods even if they don't have much modding experience.</p>

<p>In a new video explaining modding for <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, community manager Chandler Wood explains how modding will work in the game. It turns out you'll be using a tool called the&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>Creator Kit, which will be available via the Epic Games Store.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hogwarts-legacy-mod-support-update-toolkit.jpg?itok=nj3jSR0a 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hogwarts-legacy-mod-support-update-toolkit.jpg?itok=mO0uYwGH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>is getting official modding support soon.</figcaption></figure><p>Wood doesn't specify whether you'll be able to find the Creator Kit on Steam, nor does he say whether you'll be able to use the Epic version of the kit to play mods via the Steam version of <i>Hogwarts Legacy</i>. I can only imagine the game's community will have something to say about it if not.</p>

<p>Mods can range from character cosmetics and "small touches" through to entire dungeons and quests. Wood also confirms that Avalanche has been working with&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>modders to ensure you'll have something to play as soon as the update launches.</p>

<p>You'll only be able to access&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>modding if you're playing on PC, unfortunately. It doesn't seem like mod support or the modding toolkit will be coming to the console versions of the game.</p>

<p><em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>launched back in 2023, and it's proven to be a massive success for Warner Bros. Games, selling over <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-sales-30m" rel="nofollow">30 million copies</a> at last count. Given <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-flop-warner-bros-100m" rel="nofollow">how bad the publisher's 2024 was</a>, that continued success will likely come as a balm.</p>




<p>A sequel for&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>is in the works, and it's also been reported that WB Games is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-directors-cut-report" rel="nofollow">working on a Director's Cut version</a> of the game, with staffers from&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad&nbsp;</em>developer Rocksteady reportedly helping out on the project.</p>

<p>Whatever the case may be, you can grab&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/990080/Hogwarts_Legacy/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/hogwarts-legacy/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/hogwarts-legacy" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/hogwarts-legacy-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>, and the modding update launches on January 30th.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-mirage-dlc-report-ubisoft</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-says-no-comment-on-reported-saudi-funded-assassins-creed-mirage-dlc.1092732/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-mirage-dlc-report-ubisoft<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Over the weekend, a report emerged suggesting that Ubisoft had secured funding from the Saudi Public Investment Fund in order to create more&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Mirage&nbsp;</em>DLC. Now, Ubisoft has responded to that report...sort of.</p>

<p>In a statement provided to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-responds-to-report-claiming-its-signed-a-saudi-deal-for-fresh-assassins-creed-mirage-content" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>, Ubisoft declined to comment on the matter, pointing fans to the imminent release of&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>instead. It's worth noting that declining to comment doesn't constitute a denial.</p>

<p>The statement in full, as Eurogamer relays it, simply reads: "We'll decline to comment. We are focused on finishing&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>and excited for players to get to play it on March 20th."</p>

<p>In his post (which is in French; we're using machine translation), j0nathan says that Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot reportedly signed a deal with Saudi Arabia's Savvy Games Group to develop extra content for&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Mirage&nbsp;</em>during a meeting last month.</p>

<p>Just in case you're not aware, the Saudi PIF is a national wealth fund backed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. It's been used to buy shares in companies like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/saudi-pif-becomes-nintendos-largest-outside-shareholder" rel="nofollow">Nintendo</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/saudi-pif-buys-1-billion-stake-in-embracer-group" rel="nofollow">Embracer Group</a>, as well as to outright buy up a controlling stake in&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/saudi-arabian-crown-prince-to-buy-controlling-stake-in-snk" rel="nofollow"><em>King of Fighters</em>&nbsp;developer SNK</a>.</p>

<p>The PIF doesn't currently hold any shares in Ubisoft, but this deal could signify an interest on bin Salman and Saudi Arabia's part to invest in the company, especially at a time when Ubisoft's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-strike-investor-letter" rel="nofollow">current shareholders seem unhappy</a> with the direction it's taking.</p>

<p>Ubisoft no doubt has a lot riding on&nbsp;<em>Shadows</em>' success; its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-h1-2024-25-fiscal-results" rel="nofollow">latest financials</a> were very gloomy indeed, with high-profile games like&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing" rel="nofollow">first-person shooter&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing" rel="nofollow">XDefiant</a>&nbsp;</em>proving to be expensive flops for the studio.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see whether more&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Mirage&nbsp;</em>DLC is indeed planned for the future. In the meantime, you can grab the game now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3035570/Assassins_Creed_Mirage/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/assassins-creed-mirage/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/assassins-creed-mirage/9N4096HX1WWQ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/assassins-creed-mirage-review-it-feels-so-good-to-be-back" rel="nofollow">read our review of it here</a>.</p>
