            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marathon-release-date-gameplay-revealed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bungie has announced a release date for its&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>reboot, which will reimagine the original 90s series of single-player FPS games as a multiplayer extraction shooter.</p>

<p>As revealed over the weekend, the&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>release date is September 23rd. A closed alpha test is also being held between April 23rd and May 4th, and if you want to get into that, you'll have to sign up to the official&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em><a href="https://discord.gg/marathonthegame" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Discord</a> (it's free, though, don't worry).</p>

<p>Narrative director Julia Nardin describes&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>as "both a reimagining of and a direct successor to the original games"; you'll "recognize characters, locations and events" from the original&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>games in the new title, but "those events played out slightly differently" than you may remember.</p>

Some of those moments will happen in-game, and others will "go beyond the game", utilizing the likes of ARGs (alternate reality games) and trailers.</p>

<p>As for the gameplay, well,&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>is an extraction shooter, just as you'd expect. You'll team up with up to two other players, facing off against "AI security forces, otherworldly threats, and rival Runner teams" as you explore a lost colony on the planet of Tau Ceti IV.</p>

<p>You'll choose from a range of Runners, each of whom has "unique abilities, stats, and styles", and you'll further customize them using the loot you find while exploring Tau Ceti IV.</p>

<p>You can take a look at&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>'s debut gameplay trailer, which gives a pretty good sense of what kind of game you can expect in September, right here.</p>




<p><em>Marathon</em>'s road to release began back in May 2023, when the reboot of the beloved 90s series <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-resurrects-marathon-playstation-showcase" rel="nofollow">was first announced</a>. Following that, Bungie <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/learn-what-marathon-is-all-about-in-new-video-from-bungie" rel="nofollow">revealed a little more info about the game</a> before dropping off the radar for "an extended period" to develop&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>further.</p>

<p>In the months between then and now, Bungie seemingly ran into some snags with&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>; the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/destiny-2-developer-bungie-suffers-layoffs-among-reported-delays-for-final-shape-and" rel="nofollow">suffered</a> numerous <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-layoffs-200-employees" rel="nofollow">layoffs</a> as&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>was reportedly internally delayed.</p>

<p>Following that, director Christopher Barrett was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marathon-director-fired-report-bungie" rel="nofollow">quietly fired</a> from the project over misconduct allegations last year. He subsequently brought a lawsuit against Sony regarding the dismissal, although Sony <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-christopher-barrett-lawsuit-evidence" rel="nofollow">has pushed back</a> against the claims he made in that lawsuit.</p>

<p><em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3065800/Marathon/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/marathon/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/marathon/9PB32DKQKZDQ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on September 23rd.</p>
