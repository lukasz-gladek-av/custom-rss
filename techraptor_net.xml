            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-2077-sales-witcher-production<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>CD Projekt has revealed that open-world action RPG&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>has hit another major sales milestone, and there's some good news if you're waiting on tenterhooks for the next&nbsp;<em>Witcher&nbsp;</em>game as well.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/CDPROJEKTRED_IR/status/1861447302260363516" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a</a><a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2024/11/cd-projekt-group-presentation-q3-2024.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">&nbsp;new financial presentation</a>, CD Projekt reveals that&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>sales have hit 30 million as of today, with that number including both sales of the base game and the Ultimate Edition bundle.</p>

<p>What's more,&nbsp;<em>Phantom Liberty</em>, the DLC expansion for&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>that launched last year, has managed to sell eight million copies, which is around the same number as the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-8m" rel="nofollow">lifetime sales of the&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em>remake</a>. That's pretty impressive considering&nbsp;<em>Phantom Liberty&nbsp;</em>isn't a full game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cyberpunk-2077-sales-phantom-liberty.jpg?itok=-ila7YeQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cyberpunk-2077-sales-phantom-liberty.jpg?itok=kn5dC9H3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Phantom Liberty&nbsp;</em>expansion has done pretty well for itself sales-wise.</figcaption></figure><p>In that same presentation, CD Projekt revealed that&nbsp;<em>Project Polaris</em>, which is the codename for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-witcher-game-in-development-cdpr-says" rel="nofollow">next major game in the&nbsp;<em>Witcher&nbsp;</em>franchise</a>, has entered full production.</p>

<p>Essentially, this means that the next&nbsp;<em>Witcher&nbsp;</em>game has left its planning stages and that staff are now working on creating the game in earnest, bringing it one step closer to completion. Of course, we're still a long, long way away from that point.</p>

<p>It's worth noting, too, that&nbsp;<em>Polaris&nbsp;</em>is an entirely new game in the&nbsp;<em>Witcher&nbsp;</em>series, and as such, it's distinct from the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/witcher-remake-announced-by-cd-projekt-red" rel="nofollow"><em>Witcher&nbsp;</em>remake that was announced by CD Projekt Red</a> back in 2022.</p>

<p>According to the financial presentation, as of October 31st, 400 staff members were working on&nbsp;<em>Polaris</em>, with 64 devoted to&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/project-orion-new-hires" rel="nofollow">sequel&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/project-orion-new-hires" rel="nofollow">Orion</a>&nbsp;</em>and 42 working on&nbsp;<em>Witcher&nbsp;</em>spinoff&nbsp;<em>Sirius</em>.</p>

Revenue is significantly down, as is gross profit, but the company still hasn't posted a loss despite releasing no major projects this year.</p>

<p>When it comes to year-to-date financials, CD Projekt's sales are slightly down over the same period last year, although sales of the&nbsp;<em>Witcher&nbsp;</em>series remain steady, and the company's net profitability has actually slightly increased.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-2-roadmap<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>11 bit studios has revealed the first&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>roadmap, detailing what's coming to the post-apocalyptic city-builder in the near future, and there's plenty on the way to keep you occupied.</p>

<p>Released in September,&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-2-profitable-sales-350k" rel="nofollow">quickly crossed the profitability line</a>, selling 350,000 copies just a few days out from launch (which isn't bad considering the game is also available on Game Pass as a day one release).</p>

<p>Now, developer and publisher 11 bit is looking to the future, and following on from October's Patch 1.1, the next major drop you can expect for&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>is the appropriately-named Patch 1.2, which will arrive sometime before the year is out.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/frostpunk-2-roadmap-full.jpg?itok=0_8kY5SF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/frostpunk-2-roadmap-full.jpg?itok=kg11pbox 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There's plenty coming to&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>in the near future.</figcaption></figure><p>After Patch 1.2, you can expect a "free major content update" in 2025. 11 bit hasn't specified what will be included in this update, but the studio does say these updates are "inspired by [players'] feedback" and that they will "significantly impact your overall experience with the game".</p>

<p>A console launch is also on the cards for 2025, as are two major DLC packs, currently codenamed Spectrum and Aurora. The devs promise these DLCs will "add something completely new to the harsh world of&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2</em>", although they're remaining tight-lipped for now.</p>

<p>A third DLC launch is planned for 2026, but that's quite a ways off, as evidenced by the fact that this DLC doesn't even have a codename yet. Still, it shows that you shouldn't set your copy of&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>down for too long.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2</em>, it's 11 bit studios' followup to the 2018 survival city-builder&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk</em>. It's largely a similar experience to its predecessor, but it adds new mechanics like factions, new resource types, and city districts, plus lots more thorny moral decision-making.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1601580/Frostpunk_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>. A release for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S is also planned for the future.
