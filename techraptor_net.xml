            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/la-quimera-release-date-ex-metro-devs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Reburn, the studio staffed by several ex-<em>Metro&nbsp;</em>developers, has announced the release date for its story-focused first-person shooter&nbsp;<em>La Quimera</em>.</p>

<p>The game, which was revealed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/4a-Ukraine-reburn-la-quimera" rel="nofollow">alongside Reburn's rebrand</a> back in February, will be launching for PC via Steam on April 25th. There's no word yet on whether the shooter will be coming to consoles or not.</p>

<p>If you'd like to get a chance to test out&nbsp;<em>La Quimera&nbsp;</em>early, you can apply for a place on the game's upcoming closed beta, which will take place on April 12th and will run for 24 hours (starting from 7am Pacific/10am Eastern). Slots are "limited", according to Reburn, so you should be quick if you want a place.</p>

<p>4A Games remains intact under its original moniker, and in a <a href="https://www.4a-games.com.mt/4a-dna/2025/2/28/4a-games-studio-update" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">studio update</a> posted around the time that Reburn decided to rebrand, 4A confirmed once again that it is, in fact, still working on a new&nbsp;<em>Metro&nbsp;</em>game alongside publisher Deep Silver.</p>

<p>All of this follows Embracer Group's sale of Saber Interactive <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/4a-games-zen-studios-embracer" rel="nofollow">back in September last year</a>, and although it was widely expected that Saber would purchase 4A, that didn't end up happening, meaning 4A remained with parent company Embracer.</p>

<p>If you're confused by this, rest assured that you're not the only one. Suffice it to say that&nbsp;<em>La Quimera&nbsp;</em>is the game currently in development by the studio formerly known as 4A Games Ukraine, and it's coming to PC in April.</p>




<p><i>La Quimera&nbsp;</i>lands on PC via Steam on April 25th, and you can head over to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2282350/La_Quimera/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the game's Steam page</a> to get a chance to join the closed beta right now.</p>
