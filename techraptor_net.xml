            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/earthblade-canceled-celeste-devs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Celeste&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Towerfall&nbsp;</em>studio Extremely OK Games has revealed that its ambitious Metroidvania platformer&nbsp;<em>Earthblade&nbsp;</em>has been canceled owing to an internal studio dispute.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://exok.com/posts/2025-01-22-earthblade-final-update/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the official EXOK website titled "Final&nbsp;<em>Earthblade&nbsp;</em>Update" (just in case you weren't absolutely sure the game was done), the studio describes the cancellation as "a huge, heartbreaking, and yet relieving failure". EXOK head Maddy Thorson says the decision to cancel was actually made in December.</p>

<p>According to Thorson, a "fracture" began forming in 2024, with her and coworker Noel Berry on one side and art director Pedro Medeiros on another. Specifically, the dispute revolved around "the IP rights of&nbsp;<em>Celeste</em>", and it's a dispute Thorson says she "won't be detailing publicly".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/earthblade-canceled-celeste-developers-platforming.jpg?itok=VVIxJQhI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/earthblade-canceled-celeste-developers-platforming.jpg?itok=MB3WBn6G 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ambitious-looking Metroidvania&nbsp;<em>Earthblade&nbsp;</em>has been canceled.</figcaption></figure><p>The dispute, which Thorson calls "a very difficult and heartbreaking process", was eventually resolved, but she and Berry eventually agreed to go their separate ways with Medeiros, who originally announced his departure from EXOK <a href="https://x.com/saint11/status/1857481536335131092" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">back in November</a>.</p>

<p>Thorson says that the dispute with Medeiros caused her and Berry to take a look at&nbsp;<em>Earthblade&nbsp;</em>and ask themselves whether continuing its development would be "worth the pain". Together, they concluded that working on the game had become "exhausting", leading them to "admit defeat".</p>

<p>She also goes on to say that fans shouldn't blame Medeiros, and that he and the team on his game&nbsp;<em>Neverway&nbsp;</em>"aren't the enemy". Treating them as such will make you unwelcome "in any EXOK community", she says.</p>




<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Earthblade&nbsp;</em>is (or was), it was an exploration-based action platformer that would have offered "seamless exploration, challenging combat, and countless mysteries to pick apart".</p>

<p>Originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/earthblade-revealed-as-new-game-from-celeste-developers" rel="nofollow">revealed in 2021</a>, EXOK announced in early 2024 that&nbsp;<em>Earthblade&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/celeste-creator-earthblade-delayed" rel="nofollow">wouldn't be coming out that year</a>. It's very likely the studio had already begun to grapple with the problems that would cause the game's cancellation even then.</p>

<p>As for what's next for EXOK, Thorson says the goal now is to "wipe the slate clean" and to "refocus...back to smaller-scale projects". We'll have to wait and see where that goes in future.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-developer-to-publish-horror-game-by-tales-of-kenzera-zau-devs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>developer Pocketpair has revealed that it's opened a publishing wing, and that its first game will be a horror project by&nbsp;<em>Tales of Kenzera: Zau&nbsp;</em>developer Surgent Studios.</p>

<p>The partnership was announced earlier today in a <a href="https://x.com/PocketpairPBLSH/status/1882352824731980211" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on social media platform X, wherein Pocketpair describes Surgent as "a studio with an original approach" and pledges to support the studio "to the fullest extent".</p>

<p>While this is Pocketpair's first publishing signing, it won't be the studio's last; the&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>dev tells fans to "look forward to future announcements for details of specific projects", so we're going to be seeing more Pocketpair-published games in future.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pocketpair-palworld-tales-of-kenzera-zau-publishing-next-game.jpg?itok=BnWEcCFq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pocketpair-palworld-tales-of-kenzera-zau-publishing-next-game.jpg?itok=MjE3-mJ- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>studio Pocketpair is stepping up to publish&nbsp;<em>Tales of Kenzera: Zau&nbsp;</em>developer Surgent's next game.</figcaption></figure><p>Over on the new Pocketpair Publishing <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/publishing" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, the studio says its mission is "simple": to "find fun games" and then "help make those fun games a reality".</p>

<p>Pocketpair pledges not to tell indie developers "what to do", not to "take control" from them during the making of their games, and not to "change [their] dream or push [them] to make a certain type of game".</p>

<p>Instead, the studio simply wants to "give [developers] money" and "help [them] make a fun game". That sounds nice and simple to me, although it's notable that Pocketpair doesn't disclose the share it'll take of developers' revenue or other terms along those lines.</p>

<p>As for the next Surgent project, studio head Abubakar Salim says that it won't be set in the&nbsp;<em>Tales of Kenzera: Zau&nbsp;</em>universe and that it will be based around "a pattern in the entertainment industry". It'll also be "short and weird", according to Salim.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-developer-publishing-surgent-horror-game-rocket-launcher.jpg?itok=IG_TiTGZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-developer-publishing-surgent-horror-game-rocket-launcher.jpg?itok=U7WO8bcb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>We'll likely see more Pocketpair Publishing projects in the future.</figcaption></figure><p>This is a nice redemption story for Surgent Studios; back in October, the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-of-kenzera-zau-developer-redundancy-notice" rel="nofollow">put its team "on notice for redundancy"</a>&nbsp;following the underperformance of the game (although we now know it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-ea-sports-fc-25-underperformed" rel="nofollow">not the only EA-published game</a> to have underperformed in recent months).</p>

<p>We'll likely have to wait a little while to see what Surgent's next project looks like, and we don't know whether Pocketpair will indeed be publishing more games in the&nbsp;<em>Tales of Kenzera&nbsp;</em>universe, but for now, it looks like Surgent has been granted a reprieve. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-update-new-expansion-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The long-awaited&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>trading update finally has a release date, and it's coming just a day before the game's next major expansion set arrives.</p>

<p>Per a press release, the trading update, which will allow you to trade cards with your friends (albeit with some <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-details" rel="nofollow">pretty hefty caveats</a>), will arrive on January 29th, which is next Wednesday at time of writing.</p>

<p>As a reminder, the trading update will only let you trade with friends, and only certain cards will be supported to begin with. Additionally, you'll only be able to trade cards of certain rarity levels, and new items will need to be used in order to facilitate trades.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-update-space-time-smackdown.jpg?itok=EqhDLw6a 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-update-space-time-smackdown.jpg?itok=Ls5PaGcb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The new&nbsp;<em>Space-Time Smackdown&nbsp;</em>expansion will bring plenty of new cards for you to collect.</figcaption></figure><p>At first, you'll only be able to trade cards from the first two sets as well, those being Genetic Apex and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mythical-island-expansion" rel="nofollow">Mythical Island</a>. Plans are in place to introduce trading for other sets at a later date, apparently.</p>

<p>As for the new expansion, it's called&nbsp;<em>Space-Time Smackdown</em>, and as the name suggests, it'll largely revolve around two of the Sinnoh region's pivotal legendary Pokemon, namely Dialga and Palkia. The new booster packs will be themed around those Pokemon as well.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to new Pokemon from Sinnoh that haven't appeared in&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>before; The Pokemon Company is teasing Lucario and the three Sinnoh starters (Turtwig, Chimchar, and Piplup), but there will likely be others, too.</p>

<p>The trailer for the new set also teases a Pachirisu ex card that includes attack text referring to Pokemon Tools, a mechanic from the main&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG&nbsp;</em>game that can augment certain 'mon attacks. Sounds like they'll be making their debut with this set as well.</p>




<p>The&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>trading update launches on January 29th, and the&nbsp;<em>Space-Time Smackdown&nbsp;</em>expansion set launches a day later on January 30th. Make sure you're ready for both!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dragon Age: The Veilguard and EA Sports FC 25 "Underperformed", EA Says]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-ea-sports-fc-25-underperformed</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-ea-sports-fc-25-underperformed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has released its preliminary financial report for the third quarter of the 2024-25 fiscal year, and the company says that two of its biggest releases for the period underperformed.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Electronic-Arts-Pre-Announces-Preliminary-Q3-FY25-Results/default.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a>, both&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC 25&nbsp;</em>were financial disappointments for EA, with CEO Andrew Wilson confirming that both games "underperformed our net bookings expectations", which is essentially a fancy way of saying they undersold.</p>

<p>As a result of both games' failures, EA says it's revising its outlook for the year, predicting a "mid-single-digit decline" and pinning most of the blame for that decline on&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC 25</em>'s underperformance.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ea-sports-fc-25-dragon-age-the-veilguard-underperformed-5v5-rush.jpg?itok=eEUGKwf1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ea-sports-fc-25-dragon-age-the-veilguard-underperformed-5v5-rush.jpg?itok=qrgXnlc9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>EA says two of its flagship games underperformed in the last quarter.</figcaption></figure><p>EA doesn't specify how far&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC 25&nbsp;</em>fell below its expectations, but the company does say that the game put an end to "two consecutive fiscal years of double-digit net bookings growth" for football (sorry, Americans) games.</p>

<p>Apparently, the&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC&nbsp;</em>franchise "experienced a slowdown" as early momentum gathered at the start of the quarter "did not sustain through to the end". As a reminder, the quarter runs from September through December, and&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC 25&nbsp;</em>launched on September 27th.</p>

<p>Separately, EA says that&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>"engaged approximately 1.5 million players" during the period, which presumably means that's how many copies it sold. EA was expecting the game to sell somewhere in the region of three million copies in the same time period.</p>

<p>Wilson says he and his company "remain confident in our long-term strategy" and that EA expects to return to growth in the next financial year. CFO Stuart Canfield agrees, pointing to EA launching "more of [its] iconic franchises" next year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-ea-sports-fc-25-sales-disappointing-combat.jpg?itok=9s7C-NLz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-ea-sports-fc-25-sales-disappointing-combat.jpg?itok=wqIMXF1k 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>didn't do the kind of numbers EA was hoping for.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, it's unlikely that the underperformance of these games will reflect poorly on what will <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-ceo-25-million-income-layoffs" rel="nofollow">inevitably be another massive bonus</a> for Wilson this year.</p>

<p>Instead, I wouldn't be surprised if devs across BioWare and EA's&nbsp;<em>Sports FC&nbsp;</em>teams were laid off in the coming months.&nbsp;<em>Veilguard&nbsp;</em>director Corinne Busche <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/veilguard-director-corinne-busche-leaving-bioware" rel="nofollow">left BioWare last week</a>, although it's unclear whether or not that decision was related to the game's disappointing sales.</p>

<p>As for the reasons both games underperformed, it's hard to say. Wilson and EA don't speculate, but&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC 25&nbsp;</em>has attracted its fair share of <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/ea-sports-fc-25/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">player vitriol</a> in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2669320/EA_SPORTS_FC_25/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">user reviews</a> online (although very few&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>FIFA&nbsp;</em>games in the last few years haven't).</p>

<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, criticism has been aimed at the game's writing and storytelling, as well as other elements, although for what it's worth, our own reviewer Erren <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/dragon-age-veilguard-review-homecoming" rel="nofollow">looked more kindly on the game</a> than some did.</p>
