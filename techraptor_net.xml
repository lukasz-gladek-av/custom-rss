            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/digimon-alysion-time-stranger<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has announced&nbsp;<em>Digimon Alysion</em>, a mobile game that will allow you to play the&nbsp;<em>Digimon&nbsp;</em>TCG on the go. The studio has also unveiled new information about the upcoming RPG&nbsp;<em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em>.</p>

<p>As revealed during the&nbsp;<em>Digimon&nbsp;</em>Con showcase,&nbsp;<em>Digimon Alysion&nbsp;</em>will let you collect and battle&nbsp;<em>Digimon&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/digimon-card-game-2020" rel="nofollow">cards</a>. It's likely intended as a competitor to The Pokemon Company's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-dena-revenue" rel="nofollow">wildly popular</a>&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>.</p>

<p><em>Digimon Alysion&nbsp;</em>will, however, have some features&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>doesn't. For one thing, it looks like there will be a story; main characters Kanata Hondo, Futre, and Valner Dragnogh are all introduced in the debut trailer, along with what appears to be a new Digimon in the form of Gemmon.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/digimon-alysion-gemmon.jpg?itok=arRulbqW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/digimon-alysion-gemmon.jpg?itok=N6DPt37i 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Digimon Alysion&nbsp;</em>will bring the card game to mobiles, as well as introducing new Digimon like Gemmon.</figcaption></figure><p>There's no word yet on when the game will release, but like Konami's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suikoden-star-leap-announced" rel="nofollow">upcoming&nbsp;<em>Suikoden Star Leap</em></a>, it'll be a free-to-play game that includes in-app purchases.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Digimon Alysion&nbsp;</em>right here. The trailer shows text largely in Japanese, but it's pretty likely that the West will be seeing this game at some point as well.</p>




<h2>Bandai Namco also revealed new&nbsp;<em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger&nbsp;</em>details</h2>

<p>If you've been waiting for more info about upcoming RPG&nbsp;<em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em>, then you're in luck, since that's exactly what we got during the aforementioned showcase.</p>

<p>Sadly, that info didn't include a release date, but we did learn more about the game's story, its dual-world concept, and various other elements.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-greymon.jpg?itok=NoG8DZ2j 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-greymon.jpg?itok=9cWsuEN7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger&nbsp;</em>got a bunch of new info during the&nbsp;<em>Digimon&nbsp;</em>Con showcase.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger&nbsp;</em>will cast you as an agent of an organization called ADAMAS, which "specializes in investigating and solving anomalous phenomena", according to Bandai Namco.</p>

<p>After a mysterious explosion in which you encounter your first Digimon, you'll be blasted back eight years into the past, and you'll pursue "the mystery of the impending world's collapse". It all sounds suitably epic.</p>

<p>You'll split your time between two worlds: the Human World and the Digital World. Producer Ryosuke Hara says&nbsp;<em>Time Stranger&nbsp;</em>will allow you to make "frequent visits to the Digital World", contrasting against the&nbsp;<em>Cyber Sleuth&nbsp;</em>games, in which you had "very few opportunities" to do so.</p>

<p>We also got tons more info about the game's characters, the Digimon that will be appearing (of which there will be more than 450!), and lots more. You can check out a new&nbsp;<em>Time Stranger&nbsp;</em>trailer, which shows off some of the Digimon's special abilities, right here.</p>




<p>There's no release date for&nbsp;<em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger&nbsp;</em>yet, but the game will come to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1984270/Digimon_Story_Time_Stranger/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/digimon-story-time-stranger/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and Xbox Series X|S when it launches. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Konami's Deliver At All Costs Gets May Release Date]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/deliver-at-all-costs-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/konamis-deliver-at-all-costs-gets-may-release-date.1140021/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/deliver-at-all-costs-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Konami and developer Studio Far Out Games have revealed the release date for chaotic delivery-based action game&nbsp;<em>Deliver At All Costs</em>, and it's coming later in spring.</p>

<p>As announced in a new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Deliver At All Costs</em>, which was originally unveiled <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/konami-reveals-deliver-at-all-costs" rel="nofollow">in September last year</a>, is coming to PC and current-gen consoles on May 22nd. The game will be available across three different storefronts on PC.</p>

<p>In case you're not familiar with it,&nbsp;<em>Deliver At All Costs&nbsp;</em>is an isometric action game in which you play as courier Winston Green at the tail end of the 1950s. It's your job to deliver "highly unconventional cargo" while also leaving "a trail of havoc and chaos" behind you.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/deliver-at-all-costs-release-date-crash.jpg?itok=KVvITghD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/deliver-at-all-costs-release-date-crash.jpg?itok=qhiyDCXe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Deliver At All Costs&nbsp;</em>has a release date, and it's coming in spring.</figcaption></figure><p>Set against a backdrop of what Konami and Studio Far Out call "a time of rock'n'roll, polka dot dresses and the ever-looming dread of nuclear annihilation",&nbsp;<em>Deliver At All Costs&nbsp;</em>tasks you with making "bizarre deliveries" across a series of "highly destructible environments".</p>

<p>Of course, the packages you're delivering aren't just nondescript brown paper parcels; you'll be doing everything from "delivering a giant flailing marlin" through to disposing of "a big bomb teetering on the edge of explosion".</p>

<p>Each of&nbsp;<em>Deliver At All Costs</em>' levels is a semi-open environment full of things to do, and you'll discover a "story of mystery and intrigue" as you explore them as well. Konami and Studio Far Out are promising a three-act narrative with "a cast of distinct and memorable characters".</p>

<p>Not only that, but&nbsp;<em>Deliver At All Costs&nbsp;</em>will also feature an immersive 50s environment with its own built-in radio ads and soundtrack, helping to give you that authentic late-50s feeling.</p>




<p>You're in luck this year if you're looking for delivery games that aren't actually about deliveries. Not only is&nbsp;<em>Deliver At All Costs&nbsp;</em>coming in May, but Hideo Kojima recently revealed that his own <i>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach&nbsp;</i>is set for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">release in June</a>, appropriate given Konami is his former employer.</p>

<p><em>Deliver At All Costs&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1880610/Deliver_At_All_Costs/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012329" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/deliver-at-all-costs/9pmwkz7ftnp0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on May 22nd, and pre-orders for the game are open right now.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/real-wabi-sabi-in-assassins-creed-shadows-open-world</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-real-wabi-sabi-in-assassins-creed-shadows-open-world.1139886/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/real-wabi-sabi-in-assassins-creed-shadows-open-world<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Feudal Japan—and the country's culture in general—has been idolized and romanticized for decades, including during the early days of <em>Assassin's Creed</em>. Ubisoft is finally answering the fans' longtime call with <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/assassins-creed-shadows" rel="nofollow"><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em></a>, which brings Japan's landscape to life in painstaking detail, for better and for worse.</p>

<p>Across the nine regions in this game, I've traversed across roughly half of them, and there's an abundance of viewpoints to synchronize and take in the breathtaking scenery. And when the seasons change, the landscape meaningfully shifts in mood and tone, in ways reminiscent of an Akira Kurosawa film.</p>

<p>There's incredible attention to detail in the environment here, as to be expected in an <em>Assassin's Creed</em> game. But in some ways, unfortunately, that detail undermines the overall experience.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-spring-viewpoint.jpg?itok=xZm6WjCR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-spring-viewpoint.jpg?itok=A-y1yKyI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows'</em>&nbsp;Open World&nbsp;Has a Mountain of Pathfinding Problems</h2>

<p>Geographically speaking, Japan is incredibly mountainous and hilly. Modern-day Japan has tunnels for the shinkansen to go through, but back in the late 1500s, when this game is set, you either climb up or go around the mountains.</p>

<p>In a game like <em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>, you're running from waypoint to waypoint. Some you'll see for yourself from atop a viewpoint, others you'll find on the world map using your scouts. More often than not though, running straight toward the marker doesn't work well.</p>

<p>To make it to your goal in a straight line, you'll probably have to spend a couple minutes climbing mountains, finding the exact right slopes to run up. If it's too steep, you'll slide back down—more so <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/assassins-creed-shadows-hands-on-preview" rel="nofollow">if you're playing as the heavy tank Yasuke</a>. Your horse has an even worse time with slopes, especially when there's lots of bushes around, so it's not worth bothering.</p>



<p>Coming down the mountain isn't as bad, as long as you're mindful of fall damage. What doesn't help though, is the amount of foliage that assaults the camera from every angle. It's difficult to parse out where you're going, and it feels like wrestling instead of running.</p>

<p>Of course, this probably isn't the intended way to play; after all, we don't have gravity-defying <em>Skyrim </em>horses. Instead, there's a setting that turns on a wayfinder, and an in-game line directs you to your destination via pre-defined paths through the mountains.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following this line guarantees you'll get to your destination smoothly, but it also sort of defeats the purpose of an open world. It's a classic dilemma the genre's faced for as long as <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> has been popular.</p>



<h2>Random Not-So-Random</h2>

<p>What makes things extra difficult here, though, is that exploring the not-so-beaten path often feels frustrating because of the mountainous terrain.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This didn't really feel like a big problem until I hit a certain area of the map where fast travel points were sparse. The quests here also had me running back and forth, and without fast travel, I had to wrestle with slopes until I just gave up and relinquished control to the wayfinder.</p>

<p>This made me realize that&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em> and its seemingly "random" moments feel less magical and serendipitous.</p>



<p>For example, early on in my time with the game, I'd run into random people on the road who needed help. Some were threatened by bandits, others had their wagons break down. One guy was in debt, so I handed him some money.</p>

<p>None of these were quest markers or side quests, and they made the world feel more lived in. It reminded me a bit of <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/red-dead-redemption-2-review-wild-wild-west-part-2" rel="nofollow">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> </em>in how it brought the world to life.</p>

<p>But then I did a main quest later in the game, where these same sorts of "random" events happened as a direct reaction to a story event. They were also dotted along the wayfinding path to my next destination.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the magic felt gone; despite being a big open world, I couldn't help but feel like the "intended" way to experience <em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em> is on rails. And the joy of breaking out of that cage is constantly hampered by the map's own geometry.</p>



<h2>Beauty Within Imperfections</h2>

<p>It's a shame that traversing the map freely has so many roadblocks, because ironically, the hills and valleys have a naturally striking appeal. After climbing to the top of a viewpoint and scanning around, it's hard not to take a screenshot of what's in front of you.</p>

<p>Mountains of treetops give way to pagodas and temples, while majestic castles overlook a sea of lush greenery. When the seasons change, it makes the world feel alive. Fast traveling from fall's warm hues to a blank canvas of fresh snow never gets old.</p>



<p>Overall, Ubisoft has done a great job capturing the natural beauty of Japan in <em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>. But that beauty is also ironically responsible for making exploration more of a chore.</p>

<p>It's a continuation and exacerbation of a problem I've had with the current <em>Assassin's Creed</em> formula <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/assassins-creed-origins" rel="nofollow">that started with <em>Origins</em></a>. The fastest way to get to your destination is usually by horse, which feels like an overall passive experience. But at least in previous games, it wasn't too hard to go off the beaten path and meander.</p>

<p>In <em>Shadows</em>, though, that passive experience feels more required than ever. It feels like the game might as well play itself sometimes.</p>
