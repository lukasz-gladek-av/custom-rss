      <div><p>Today, Hero Forge launched a new Kickstarter campaign to add custom dice to their services. The aptly named Hero Forge: Custom Dice campaign has already found great success, reaching its funding goal within an hour of going live.</p>

<h2>The Hero Forge: Custom Dice Kickstarter Campaign</h2>

<p>According to its Kickstarter campaign page, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/heroforge/custom-dice/description" rel="nofollow">Hero Forge: Custom Dice</a> lets you order customized polyhedral dice for your home games. This customization is an extension of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/hero-forge-full-color-miniatures-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Hero Forge's service</a>, printing custom miniatures of various custom characters. It is a service they have provided to tabletop players since 2014, bringing endless personalized minis to gaming tables around the world.</p>

The service can print any kind of dice: D4, D6, D10, percentile dice, D12, large or XL D20s. If you play a lot of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer</em></a>, you can order bricks of D6s for your wargames. If you're more of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic</em></a> player, you can print a custom spin-down die to keep track of life totals.</p>
