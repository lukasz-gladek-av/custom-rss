            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>My friend group and I do our own version of<em>&nbsp;</em>Easy Allies' "<a href="https://easyallies.com/#!/show/the-hall-of-greats" rel="nofollow">The Hall of Greats</a>" every quarter, and we have a grand ol' time. If you don't know what The Hall of Greats is, it boils down to being a celebration of games; essentially, we get together, present what we think deserves to be in The Hall of Greats, and everyone takes a vote using poker chips. We all get five poker chips, and each one is valued from one to five.</p>

<p>Formal apology to my good friend Matt: he brought&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/system-shock-2-embracing-enigma-brief-retrospective" rel="nofollow"><em>System Shock 2</em></a>&nbsp;the very first time and was defeated quite soundly by many other games. I gave&nbsp;his pick a paltry one point, and I deeply regret it now. Not because I hurt Matt's feelings or anything, but because I now believe&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2</em>&nbsp;absolutely deserves the coveted five-point poker chip.</p>

<p>Indeed, I had given&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2</em>&nbsp;a try in the past and acknowledged its worth, but for a multitude of reasons, I lost interest. Still, it was quite a revolutionary game back during its release in 1999, so it has historical value. After playing <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/nightdive-studios" rel="nofollow">Nightdive Studios</a>'&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Edition Remaster</em>, I now realize that few games come close to the depth and immersion it provides, even to this day.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/system-shock-2-wrench.jpg?itok=RxFnL4I_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/system-shock-2-wrench.jpg?itok=iXdpDKIq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Crisp, clean visuals!</figcaption></figure><h2>A Remaster That Makes an Incredible Game Even Better</h2>

<p>Nightdive is an incredible studio, modernizing <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/star-wars-dark-forces-remaster-review-return-of-kex" rel="nofollow">beloved</a>&nbsp;--&nbsp;and, well, some <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/poed-definitive-edition-review-more-like-pooed" rel="nofollow">not-so-beloved</a> --&nbsp;classics to run on modern hardware. These aren't just your simple ports, no, Nightdive loves to give its titles the VIP treatment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Often, this VIP treatment comes in the form of new, refined sprites and models to revitalize and rejuvenate aging games.&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2</em>, which is now certainly an all-timer in my eyes, did start to look and feel a bit dated. In comes&nbsp;Nightdive to save the day.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/system-shock-2-interface.jpg?itok=sK1S5JAG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/system-shock-2-interface.jpg?itok=99ybE96M 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Don't get intimidated by the interface. You'll get the hang of it!</figcaption></figure><p>I think I fell off of&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2</em>&nbsp;several years back&nbsp;<em>because</em>&nbsp;of it looked quite dated, and it felt like it, too. The&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster&nbsp;</em>is the silver bullet for my previous complaints, resulting in the definitive way to experience a masterpiece.</p>

<p>Visually,&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster</em>&nbsp;is faithful to the original developer's vision, while adding some needed touch-ups to enemy models and weapons. Atmosphere is also so incredibly important for an immersive sim, and that is captured so well here.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/systme-shock-2-hallway-run.jpg?itok=Zb0pyxNt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/systme-shock-2-hallway-run.jpg?itok=b53kZzGy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Duly noted.</figcaption></figure><p>Lighting, environment textures, and everything in between convinced me that I was actually there on the Von Braun space ship, the main setting of&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2</em>. The result from this attention to detail is an atmosphere akin to the movie <em>Alien</em>: a feeling of hopelessness and survival against terrifying odds.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One other issue I had with&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2'</em>s non-remastered port was the controls and the clunkiness of its gameplay. The UI makes&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2</em>&nbsp;appear more intimidating than it really is, and while that almost claustrophobic UI is still here, everything feels much smoother to play.</p>

<p>Mouse and keyboard controls are seamless and once you actually get the hang of things an hour or so in, everything clicks. This remaster also has controller support. Nightdive does a pretty good job at making the controller able to navigate menus, making ample use of various controller shortcuts since you're lacking the precision of a mouse.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/system-shock-2-character.jpg?itok=NF2c6nqw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/system-shock-2-character.jpg?itok=GvnMz2JT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Time to get immersed in being this goofy lookin' fella.</figcaption></figure><h2>Get Immersed in the Foreboding Von Braun</h2>

<p><em>System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster</em>&nbsp;is an immersive sim, and if you don't know what that is, I forgive you. They really just don't make very many of them anymore... but if I had to put it succinctly: an immersive sim is a broad term for games that allow for a high degree of player choice in approaching its various situations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Player choice comes in many forms, especially in<em>&nbsp;</em>this title. Right from the start, you're forced to pick a role without really knowing how it'll benefit you in the long run. You pick a career path in the UNN Marines, Navy, or OSA; following this choice, you go on a choice-filled tour of duty to give you a few extra stat bonuses.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Each will essentially give you a kickstart on the path to whatever build you want to make in&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2</em>. The&nbsp;initial few choices are quite intimidating. The Marines caters more toward your typical run-and-gun playstyle, the Navy is a bit more technical with hacking and maintenance, and OSA focuses on Psi powers.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/system-shock-2-melee.jpg?itok=big-yzRK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/system-shock-2-melee.jpg?itok=5Wx38-BW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Guns? Sure, they're useful, but so is this shard.</figcaption></figure><p>For a game from 1999, the amount of freedom you have with your character is quite impressive, and even by today's standards, it holds up. I didn't even&nbsp;<em>touch</em>&nbsp;Psi powers, focusing more on a hybrid between melee and ranged weapons, as well as hacking. I ended up doing just fine, but it's a game that incentivizes multiple playthroughs, since gameplay can vary so much.</p>

<p>Gameplay takes place mostly within the confines of the Von Braun starship. Something&nbsp;<em>horrible</em>&nbsp;has happened on the ship, and you're there to figure out what happened. You've just awoken from cryo-sleep on the starship, and things are, inexplicably, looking worse for wear.</p>

<p>Sneak, shoot, or hack your way through the ship as you follow objectives given to you by various characters in&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster</em>. Polito, a surviving crewmate, gives players a lot of directions at the start, but the Von Braun is a rather confusing maze of pathways. Players have to rely on limited context, a not-so-helpful map, and reading the environment for the path forward.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/system-shock-2-gun-animation.jpg?itok=NkaOnzaY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/system-shock-2-gun-animation.jpg?itok=Z_f1hkT6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Locked and loaded.</figcaption></figure><p>Von Braun is a complex ship, with various sectors like the Hydroponics Deck and Recreation Deck. These areas have their own identity and feel distinct from one another, so as you're scrounging around for supplies and fighting (or avoiding) enemies, there's this exciting feeling of discovery.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was quite gratifying to go from being completely unfamiliar with the ship's interior to memorizing it through hours of exploration. And yet, there are still so many secrets for those who have a keen eye. Exploration is rewarding, giving players new weapons, upgrades, and the like.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/system-shock-2-map.jpg?itok=T2mVb5ik 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/system-shock-2-map.jpg?itok=z1Uajiu6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Maps are hard, man.</figcaption></figure><h2>Tools of the Trade</h2>

<p>As you piece together the fate of the Von Braun ship and simply find a way to survive and escape, you'll have many different tools at your disposal. This is where the freedom of choice and your build come in. Plenty of weapons are strewn about, so you can go in guns blazing if you like. Or use that reliable wrench to whack away at enemies.</p>

<p>You can also try the stealthy path, which relies on patience and some hacking, too. Hacking is a simple mini-game, but it's crucial. Avoiding the ire of Xerxes is essential, as if you're seen by one of his cameras, he'll have hordes of robots and zombie-like reinforcements on you quickly.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/system-shock-2-grenade-launcher.jpg?itok=UMTqbjpK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/system-shock-2-grenade-launcher.jpg?itok=bO5v1zPE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Big robot? Nothing an EMP grenade won't solve.</figcaption></figure><p>Shooting played a large role in my playthrough, for when stealth failed, I'd pull out the big guns. Gunplay is not as tight as a boomer shooter or typical FPS, but you can improve the handling of guns and their damage by increasing stats at certain kiosks around the ship.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These kiosks are very important, as you'll want to constantly improve your build. You're not necessarily pigeonholed into being a run-and-gun type versus a psionic soldier, so you're given some freedom to experiment.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/system-shock-2-energy-weapon.jpg?itok=Ke7Gxqv5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/system-shock-2-energy-weapon.jpg?itok=vEu0jPG6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This energy gun was largely ineffective, as I didn't spec into using this type of weapon.</figcaption></figure><h2>A Narrative That Makes You Think</h2>

<p>Much of your time with this game comprises of utilizing the skillset of your choosing, while exploring the horrors and dangers of the Von Braun. Exploration is another key component here, and it's the means by which the story is delivered.</p>

<p><em>System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster</em>&nbsp;relies on environmental storytelling, piecing together the grim fate of the starship by looking at the state of things. It also leans heavily on audio logs, which were a novelty back in 1999 when&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2&nbsp;</em>was first released. Audio logs went on to inspire numerous games to follow this same delivery of narrative.</p>

<p>Audio logs seem tacky, but I mean, it makes sense -- most everyone on the Von Braun is dead. These audio logs range from mundane to intriguing, but the voice acting -- which is, again, from 1999 -- leaves a lot to be desired. Thankfully, the writing is still so well done. Piecing together the series of events that led up to<em>&nbsp;</em>the disaster on Von Braun will keep you on the edge of your seat.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/system-shock-2-shodan.jpg?itok=5fNh6OQi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/system-shock-2-shodan.jpg?itok=AQdteTU_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some horror elements are in&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2</em>, so it can feel a little ominous and sinister!</figcaption></figure><p>This is a game that is perhaps more poignant than ever. We live in an age where AI is starting to develop rapidly, and it's scary and frightening. With AI being among the primary antagonists, we see the damage it can cause, even if that's far into the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other than fighting robots sicced on you by AI, you'll have to contend with The Many. It's a Hivemind organism that's terrifyingly efficient and spreads like some aggressive fungus. This entity has a sort of collectivist mentality, and on top of that, you're contending with an AI that has a god complex. Regular humans are stuck in between these two -- it's a thrilling dynamic that engrossed me.</p>

<p>Like other Nightdive remasters, this version has a vault with an abundance of historical documents, concept art, and videos involving&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2</em>'s development. I'm particularly fond of scans for a <em>System Shock 2&nbsp;</em>review from PC Format magazine, but there are also plenty of other fragments from history to enjoy.</p>

<p>For many,&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2</em>&nbsp;was considered among the best of the best. With the&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster</em>, it's more accessible than ever and feels incredible to play -- it looks great, too. If there was ever a time to take the plunge and play it for the first time, it's now, and if you're looking to revisit, well, the Von Braun is ready for boarding!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's old news at this point to talk about just how popular the new <em>Magic The Gathering Final Fantasy</em> set is, but its for good reason. With a smart IP pairing between Wizards of the Coast and Square, incredible card design, and artwork that feels both true to&nbsp;<em>Magic&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy</em>, it's no surprise this set is going wild.</p>

<p>We've covered it plenty here at TechRaptor, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/ranking-all-of-magic-gathering-final-fantasy-legendary-creatures-part-1" rel="nofollow">ranking all of the legendary creatures</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/discussing-magic-gathering-x-final-fantasy-with-daniel-holt-game-design-lead-for" rel="nofollow">chatting with the lead designer of the Commander decks</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/exclusive-mtg-final-fantasy-spoilers-card-reveals" rel="nofollow">even getting a chance to premiere our own preview cards</a>. Now that the set's settling down, Wizards of the Coast sent us some pre-constructed products to check out - so read on for our thoughts on the&nbsp;<em>Magic The Gathering Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>Starter Kit and Limit Break Commander Deck.</p>


<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-starter-kit-main-photo.jpg?itok=fnICS15B 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-starter-kit-main-photo.jpg?itok=axkj29F9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The&nbsp;<em>Magic The Gathering Final Fantasy </em>Starter Kit contains the following:</p>

<ul><li>2 60-card pre-constructed decks
	<ul><li>1 Traditional foil legendary creature in each deck</li>
		<li>5 Non-foil new-to-<em>Magic&nbsp;</em>cards in each deck</li>
		<li>54 Non-foil cards from the main set in each deck</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>4 Non-foil double-sided tokens</li>
	<li>2&nbsp;<em>MTG Arena</em>&nbsp;code cards (available in select regions)</li>
	<li>2 cardboard Deck boxes</li>
</ul><p>Featuring the famous clash between Cloud and Sephiroth as depicted in&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy VII</em>, the Starter Kit contains everything two players need to jump into the action and learn how to play&nbsp;<em>MTG</em>. Let's chat briefly about each of the two 60-card decks, talking about what they do and how they serve as introductory decks.</p>

<h3>Red-White Cloud Deck</h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-starter-kit-cloud.jpg?itok=s4sj0I_w 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-starter-kit-cloud.jpg?itok=sf5219uL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Looking at this deck's feature card, Cloud, Planet's Champion, gives us a good sense of what this deck wants to do. As you can see from the image above, if Cloud is equipped he gains double-strike and indestructible, which is obviously extremely powerful. The other rares from the deck - as pictured above - also clue is into the fact that this is a deck that's all about attack, attack, attack.</p>

<p>Get your creatures loaded up with equipment and then swing for the fences! The deck plays extremely fast, and once new players understand the nuances of equipping artifacts to a creature, this deck runs pretty smoothly. So you must be wondering, with creatures and equipment so powerful, what hope does my opponent have against me?</p>

<p>haha</p>

<h3>Blue-Black Sephiroth Deck</h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-sephiroth-deck.jpg?itok=YBL7Gmq3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-sephiroth-deck.jpg?itok=_b1IFgDt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>If the Red-White deck is all about attacking with creatures armed to the teeth, the Blue-Black deck is all about having an answer for just about whatever your opponent throws your way! Led by Sephiroth, Planet's Heir, the Blue-Black deck does exactly what you'd think Blue-Black does. It draws you cards and slows down your opponent (Blue), and kills your opponent's creatures before they can cause a fuss (Black).</p>

<p>I really like Xande, Dark Mage (pictured above), because he and other creatures like him really want you to not be bashful about casting spells to gain card advantage. If the hurdle for new players with Red-White is understanding equipment, understanding the Stack is going to be a hurdle with this deck. Once you understand the difference between instant speed and sorcery speed spells, and how effects resolve, you'll be slicing your opponents to ribbons with lethal precision.</p>

<h2>Starter Kit Final Thoughts</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-starter-kit-two-decks.jpg?itok=DsqLQeFk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-starter-kit-two-decks.jpg?itok=7GVKHYzo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>I'll admit, I've seen more beginner-friendly pre-constructed decks over the years (remember the glory days of those $15 Intro Decks??), but these are by no means too complicated to wrap your head around. In fact, many newcomers to the game may find themselves impressed by the depth of strategy on hand with <em>Magic</em>, I know I was the first time I sat down to play. The rulebook included here is also a great resource, and is one of the clearest presentations of the rules I've ever seen! So if you're new to the game, or want to get a friend into it <em>and&nbsp;</em>they like <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>&nbsp;- this is a phenomenal place to start!</p>

<p>Now let's jump into a more advanced option, the&nbsp;<em>Magic The Gathering Final Fantasy</em>&nbsp;Limit Break Commander Deck - also starring everyone's favorite SOLDIER, Cloud!</p>

<h2><em>Magic The Gathering&nbsp;</em><em>Final Fantasy</em>&nbsp;Limit Break Commander Deck</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-limit-break-commander.jpg?itok=TgBnK_ba 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-limit-break-commander.jpg?itok=DirKbPzR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The&nbsp;<em>Magic the Gathering Final Fantasy</em>&nbsp;Limit Break Commander Deck includes the following:</p>

<ul><li>1 Ready-to-play 100-card Commander deck&nbsp;
	<ul><li>1 Traditional foil face commander</li>
		<li>1 Traditional foil featured commander</li>
		<li>98 Non-foil cards</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>10 Double-sided tokens</li>
	<li>1 Collector Booster Sample Pack</li>
	<li>1 Reference card</li>
	<li>1 Deck box</li>
</ul><p>Already hard to get ahold of, and selling for around $120 USD at the time of this writing, the Limit Break Commander Deck is a serious piece of precon hardware. Just like the Starter Deck (but completely super-charged), this deck is focused around Cloud and equipment.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-two-commanders.jpg?itok=8ai58A77 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-two-commanders.jpg?itok=d-r6A5qL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The deck comes with two potential commanders for you to field, but I think - as is usually the case - you won't get much traction out of Tifa without a fair bit of luck. But Cloud... good lord... what a card! And of course he's a huge target the second he hits the board, but the fact the Cloud has haste&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;lets you auto-attach an equipment to him when he comes in mitigates the fact that you'll be the target here.</p>

<p>I really love a Voltron approach to Commander (I&nbsp;<em>just</em>&nbsp;built a nasty little deck with that Secret Lair Wolverine) because I love to turn my creatures sideways. So, this really appeals to me. But what's nice about this deck is that unlike the&nbsp;<a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/magic-the-gathering-fallout-commander-decklists" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>Scrappy Survivors</a> deck from a few years back that saw you focusing on overloading a single creature with tons of equipment, you get a lot of benefit out of spreading your equipment around! Sharing is caring, even in Midgar!</p>

<p>The other cards in the deck are - as you'd expect - a mixture of great creatures, beat-down equipment (plus some good evasion equipment - shoutout to the inclusion of Trailblazer's Boots), and a few key spells to get you out of a jam.</p>

<p>The other&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy</em>&nbsp;Commander decks also look pretty cool, and each have a big bold approach (<a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/final-fantasy-commander-decklists" rel="nofollow">you can check out all the decklists here</a>), but I'm really drawn to this aggressive approach.</p>

<p>The commander deck also comes with a Collector Booster sampler pack, which contains two cards. With single Collector Booster packs selling for $100, this Collector Booster sampler was a fun way to get a tiny taste of the action (like a drop of water in the desert, but still).</p>

<p>The high price retailers are asking for this deck isn't just about chasing valuable cards inside - this deck is a heater! Holy smokes, it really sings - and when it gets grooving you really feel like a big threat at the table, swinging for absolutely silly amounts of damage. Cue the&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy</em>&nbsp;victory music - if you can get this for a good price, and you like playing aggressive-leaning midrange, grab it!</p>
