            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Level-5 has announced that its cozy open-world RPG&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em>has passed another big sales milestone, and that a major update is coming to the game with a brand new feature soon as well.</p>

<p>Over on the official&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.fantasylife.jp/fli/en/topics/250708/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, Level-5 says the game has crossed 1.2 million sales across all platforms around the world. That's another 200,000 sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-sales-1m-new-update" rel="nofollow">since mid-June</a>, a feat of which Level-5 can be justly proud.</p>

<p>Along with the new milestone, Level-5 also reveals that a photo mode is coming to&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</em>as part of an update that will be deployed "later this month". It will, as the name suggests, allow you to pause the action and take snapshots of your favorite moments.</p>

<p>When the photo mode arrives in&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i</em>, Level-5 is planning to hold a photo contest in which players will be invited to "showcase their islands, house designs, and more", so be on the lookout for that closer to the time (whenever that happens to be).</p>

<p>We're still not sure when the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/free-fantasy-life-i-dlc-roguelike-open-world" rel="nofollow">upcoming <em>Update the World!</em> DLC</a> will be released, but when it is, it'll bring a brand new roguelike open-world mode to the game in which you'll have the chance to earn new gear and more.</p>

<p>You can also enjoy some free stuff by entering the code "K9E8VADB" in&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i</em>'s main menu's gift code entry window, which will net you access to a bunch of nifty legendary crafting materials.</p>




<p><em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2993780/FANTASY_LIFE_i_The_Girl_Who_Steals_Time/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time/9PP7TDRDZGHD" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and the Nintendo Switch console family. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Just in case you've been feeling like your shoe collection isn't cursed enough, Nintendo has announced a collaboration between&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing&nbsp;</em>and Crocs. I'll let that sink in for a minute.</p>

<p>Per a Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/crocs-launches-first-ever-collaboration-with-animal-crossing/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a>, a new collection of&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing&nbsp;</em>Crocs will be launching on August 26th, which is, coincidentally, the same date on which a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-ps5-release-date-enhancements" rel="nofollow">trio</a> of previously console-exclusive <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gears-of-war-reloaded-announced" rel="nofollow">games</a> cross the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-xbox-series-xs-august" rel="nofollow">border</a> to join their rival ecosystems.</p>

<p>For adults, the&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing&nbsp;</em>Platform Clog comes in size ranges of 4-13 for men and 6-12 for women. These shoes will set you back $69.99, but for your cash, you'll get Crocs decorated with&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing</em>-themed pastel shades and characters.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/animal-crossing-crocs-nintendo-clog.jpg?itok=SeHEE8v6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/animal-crossing-crocs-nintendo-clog.jpg?itok=mH3qm_8W 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Look upon these Crocs, ye mighty, and despair.</figcaption></figure><p>For kids, the Kids'&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing&nbsp;</em>Classic Clog comes in sizes 11C to 6Y, and it'll set you back a slightly more modest $54.99. The aesthetic is pretty similar, so you could even buy them as a matching set if you want to hasten the coming of the great Croc God of Destruction.</p>

<p>In addition to the shoes themselves, Nintendo and Crocs will also sell sets of Jibbitz Charms themed around&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing</em>, and you can apply these charms to the Crocs as you see fit. A 5-pack will cost you $16.99, and you can buy individual charms for Rosie, Marshal, and Bunnie for $5 each.</p>

<p>These unholy shoes aren't the first collaboration between Nintendo and Crocs; the company also <a href="https://www.crocs.co.uk/c/collections/more-collections/pokemon" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sells a set of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>-themed clogs</a>, as well as sets of Jibbitz Charms based on the likes of Eevee, Togepi, and Pikachu, among others.</p>

<p>You can also find Jibbitz Charms themed around&nbsp;<em>Super Mario&nbsp;</em>characters, although no&nbsp;<em>Mario</em>-themed Crocs have appeared yet, so at the very least, we haven't reached that stage of Ragnarok yet.</p>

You'll be able to get them from the official Crocs <a href="https://www.crocs.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, as well as Crocs retail stores and "select Crocs retailers" worldwide.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Romero Games Says It Hasn't Closed Down, Search for New Publisher Is On]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/romero-games-not-closing-down</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/romero-games-says-it-hasnt-closed-down-search-for-new-publisher-is-on.1238073/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Romero Games, the studio founded by legendary industry auteur John Romero, has clarified that it is not, in fact, shutting down, and that it's currently seeking a new publisher for its ongoing project.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/romerogames.bsky.social/post/3ltfjxsyavs23" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on social media, Romero Games says that while it's true funding for its game was pulled and that development on the game was halted, the studio is "not closed", and that "any suggestion otherwise is factually incorrect".</p>

<p>Romero Games goes on to say it held discussions regarding next steps just yesterday, and that while the studio will "reassess" its "entire staffing" structure, it's "doing everything in [its] power" to ensure closure doesn't happen.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/romero-games-not-closing-down-doom.jpg?itok=inBt5iX- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/romero-games-not-closing-down-doom.jpg?itok=U1nTCsy9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Romero Games has created new levels for the original&nbsp;<em>Doom</em>, and until recently, it was working on a brand new game as well.</figcaption></figure><p>Technically, Romero Games has never disclosed the publisher for its now-canceled project, although the studio says readers "may infer it from public information".</p>

<p>Just as a reminder, Microsoft recently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" rel="nofollow">undertook a massive layoff wave</a> that saw around 9,000 of its employees affected. As part of that layoff wave, in-development projects like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">Rare's </a><i><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">Everwild</a>&nbsp;</i>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">The Initiative's&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">Perfect Dark</a>&nbsp;</em>were canceled, with the latter also closing its doors for good.</p>

<p>It seems fairly obvious to me that Romero Games is referring to Xbox as the publisher for its game, although since the project itself was never officially announced, that hasn't technically been confirmed.</p>

<p>As for the future, Romero Games says it's "currently evaluating" the "opportunities" that the aforementioned publishers have provided, so it's entirely possible that the studio's project will be revived under a different banner. We'll have to wait and see what happens next.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rare-everwild-xbox-layoffs-romero-games.jpg?itok=F-VOXCsi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rare-everwild-xbox-layoffs-romero-games.jpg?itok=Bt7CwhFc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Xbox's recent layoff wave saw projects like&nbsp;<em>Everwild&nbsp;</em>canceled.</figcaption></figure><p>Amid cancellations and job losses at Xbox, Microsoft has <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/perfect-dark-everwild-game-canceled-microsoft-initiative-1236446212/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reportedly</a> claimed that every game shown during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">its showcase this summer</a> is safe, so to speak. Still, given how suddenly these layoffs appear to have happened, it's hard to take that assertion at face value.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what happens next, as well as whether Romero Games manages to find a new publisher for its game. Stay tuned for more.</p>
