            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A moment many fans have been waiting for is almost here as <em>The Mighty Nein</em>, Critical Role's second campaign, makes its way to Prime Video. Ahead of its release, we got to watch the season and see how <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a49b5305-f71e-4b04-a989-6db6823aa8cc" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/critical-role-and-legend-of-vox-machina-s3-cast-discuss-changing-story" rel="nofollow">Critical Role's second campaign</a> has been adapted to streaming services, how the titular Mighty Nein have come together, and how the campaign has been reshaped to best fit its new format.</p>

<h2>Forming The Mighty Nein And A World On The Edge</h2>

<p><em>The Mighty Nein</em> starts with a bang as the Luxon Beacon is stolen. The Luxon Beacon is an object of great importance to the Kryn Dynasty, not just because of it's power or use in religious ceremony, but it is a relic integral to the cycle of rebirth that is a core aspect of their society.</p>

<p>These first five minutes are the perfect hook, demonstrating not only the importance of the item, but also the skill that the strange thieves with tattooed arms and powerful magical abilities are required to possess to get away with this heist, and why it's disappearance is about to trigger a war that our heroes will very quickly find themselves embroiled with.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-mighty-nein-season-1-magic.jpg?itok=ixrud_Ym 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-mighty-nein-season-1-magic.jpg?itok=sq8TvAjc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Wizards in The Mighty Nein crafting sigils is one of the best demonstrations of magic I've seen in animation</figcaption></figure><p>It was fascinating watching a wordless sequence filled with a variety of magical abilities and spells cast, every one an easter egg for Critical Role and Dungeons &amp; Dragons in general, as wizards weave signs in midair to cast silence or trigger magical explosions.</p>

<p>The opening three episodes serve as the uniting of the party, we get to meet Caleb and Nott - one searching for magical components to find a familiar and the other searching for a way to keep their bottle filled - Fjord is tasked to protect Jester as she needs to escape Nicodranis, Beau is investigating an attack on the Cobalt Soul, and Mollymauk is already present at the circus that brings them all together.</p>

<p>The character's look and aesthetics are perfect from the get-go. After looking forward to seeing Caleb, Beau, Jester, and more all animated the team at Titmouse have absolutely nailed it. That being said even faithful character designs can't save the first three episodes from being the worst that the season has to offer.</p>

It robs us of getting a chance to really get to know much about the team, but it does begin the slow feed of information into the backstories of the Nein and how they all will lead them back to the Beacon.</p>

<p>It's an interesting juxtaposition from <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="8fba9665-9011-4fc8-bf7e-3873de998554" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/legend-of-vox-machina-season-2-review" rel="nofollow"><em>The Legend Of Vox Machina</em></a> which started with the party already (in)famous, and how they rose to greatness. Here we get to see the origins of the Nein before they came together, including their back stories and plenty of additional information that would only be revealed far later in the campaign.</p>

<h2>Early Adventures</h2>

<p>After those first three episodes, the party is together, and this is where the story really takes off. The focus of this initial season is on the party getting together, establishing Trent as a big-bad of the series, and telegraphing some major moments to be coming to Season 2.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-mighty-nein-season-1-caleb-and-frumpkin.jpg?itok=X3XrWXAS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-mighty-nein-season-1-caleb-and-frumpkin.jpg?itok=C2nPjg2p 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Fans of Caleb will be happy to hear that him and his relationship with the Volstruckers is a key aspect of this first season. Unlike the campaign, where this information is dripfed over months worth of gameplay in <em>The Mighty Nein</em> we get to really revel in it all.</p>

<p>It was incredible to see so many detailed secrets from Caleb's past laid out, this structural change does leave other characters on the sideline, but does a fantastic job to really focus on what makes Caleb the damaged fire wizard that we all know and love him as.</p>

<h2>Changes From Critical Role Campaign 2</h2>

<p>The biggest change that will disappoint people, is just how little Ashley Johnson's Yasha is in this season. We get brief flashes of her across different episodes, and one deep action sequence, but unfortunately aside from that she's primarily absent.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-mighty-nein-season-1-beau.jpg?itok=DCS8-dTt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-mighty-nein-season-1-beau.jpg?itok=K3AqYUmq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Where Caleb's back story gets explored earlier, Yasha was even removed from the Circus where she was originally found to better set her up for her role in later seasons.</p>

<p>While I won't spoil them a number of the other major changes are partial retcons of moments in the original adventure that can now be filled in with different elements of the extended Exandria lore that has been further developed through future Campaigns and One-Shots. If you were a fan of seeing Xerxes in<em> <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="42a53bd9-3ace-4e7e-b9b3-8cb0409963bc" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/legend-of-vox-machina-season-3-review-darker-season-of-dd-twists" rel="nofollow">Vox Machina</a></em>, then you'll have a few massive treats to look forward to in this.</p>

<h2>Easter Eggs In Blink And You'll Miss Them Moments</h2>

<p>Fans of Critical Role will want to keep a very close eye on the different scenes as there's all manner of easter eggs and references that will pop up in the background. It's a fun reward and hat tip to those who are watching <em>The Mighty Nein</em> after consuming <em>Vox Machina </em>or the Actual Play. It also gives the show a unique sense of rewatchability as you'll get to see the story for the first time to enjoy a story about found family and magical hijinx, and then rewatch it to spot some kind of delicious-looking dust in the background.</p>

<p><em>The Mighty Nein</em> Season 1 is everything that I hoped that it would be and more. Even after a slow initial group of episodes once the party is together they absolutely hit the ground running.</p>

<p>While you might find a lot different in the plot, in focusing on specific characters or revealing story elements far earlier than you might expect, it's all been very smartly reformatted to a season's worth of TV.</p>

<p>As with every season of Critical Role's TV shows, now the worst part is waiting for more to release. With Season 4 of The Legend of Vox Machina releasing next year at least there's not too long to wait for that.</p>
