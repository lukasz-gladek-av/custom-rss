            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>According to a new report, Ubisoft canceled an in-development&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>game that was set to take place in the Reconstruction-era USA last year, citing political concerns.</p>

<p>That's per Stephen Totilo of <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/scoop-ubisoft-cancelled-a-post-civil" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Game File</a>, who cites "interviews with five current and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-layoffs-leamington-closure" rel="nofollow">former Ubisoft employees</a>". Said employees told Totilo that they were "enthusiastic" about this potential&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>game, but were "frustrated by its cancellation", which they saw as "Ubisoft bowing to controversy".</p>

<p>If Totilo is to be believed, players would have taken the role of a Black former slave who had moved from the South in order to begin a new life. The Assassins would have recruited said protagonist, and he would have fought the Ku Klux Klan, among other hostile forces.</p>

<p>If you need reminding, said backlash revolved around whether or not the historical Yasuke (who was a real person) would actually have held the rank of samurai. Its proponents claimed historical inaccuracy, but those opposed to the backlash accused its adherents of covert racism.</p>

<p>The second reason the&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>project in question was canceled was, according to Totilo's report, the political climate in the US, which a source said was "too unstable" to justify the continuation of the game's development.</p>

<p>The sources to whom Totilo spoke said that cancelling a project in the gaming industry was not unusual (to which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-project-baxter-canceled-layoffs" rel="nofollow">recent events</a> will certainly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/contraband-canceled-report-avalanche-studios" rel="nofollow">attest</a>), but that doing so for the above reasons was.</p>

<p>The French studio also announced back in September that future games in the&nbsp;<em>Far Cry&nbsp;</em>series, another franchise that serves as one of Ubisoft's flagships, would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/far-cry-multiplayer-ubisoft" rel="nofollow">focus much more on their multiplayer elements</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/battlefield-6-review-war-on-unprecedented-scale</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-review-war-on-an-unprecedented-scale.1320916/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I used to have the time of my life with old&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/series/battlefield" rel="nofollow">Battlefield</a>&nbsp;</em>titles. You ever just take a grenade launcher to a house and completely demolish it in multiplayer, exposing enemy players to your gunfire? I thought the destruction in those games --&nbsp;<em>Bad Company 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 3,&nbsp;</em>specifically -- was revolutionary, but we're in 2025, and&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>is here to show you that destruction can get even bigger and better than ever.</p>

<p>Seriously, I can't get over how cool it is to fire tank missiles, grenades, and the like at buildings and blockades and see them crumble apart.&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>&nbsp;goes all in on the cinematic, bombastic action and destruction it's known for, and delivers a powerful multiplayer experience, and, for better or for worse, a single-player campaign.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-6-campaign.jpg?itok=rX4o2EQF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-6-campaign.jpg?itok=YEwEy7fN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It does look beautiful, I'll give it that.</figcaption></figure><h2>Does the <em>Battlefield 6</em>&nbsp;Campaign Exceed Expectations?</h2>

<p>You heard that right,&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>returns with a single-player story. I'm a sucker for campaigns, to the point that I found myself gravitating toward boomer shooters since most other <a href="https://techraptor.net/genre/first-person-shooter" rel="nofollow">FPS</a>' ditched singleplayer in favor of multiplayer-only content.</p>

<p>Needless to say, I was excited to see what&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>&nbsp;had to offer. The year is 2028, and you play as multiple members of a special forces unit within the Marines, MARSOC. NATO's alliance is crumbling as it faces an unprecedented threat -- PAX Aramata.&nbsp;</p>

<p>PAX Armata is a fair compromise as a villain when you consider the current affairs of the world. Painting any particular country as a villain opens up a can of worms that is probably left closed. Any other enemy other than a fictitious one could hit too close to home. In this case, PAX Armata is like a conglomerate of mercenaries of no particular nation, yet they've managed to amass an army with the latest hardware.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-6-campaign-explosions.jpg?itok=jGtqVC53 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-6-campaign-explosions.jpg?itok=8j64jOQ7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Big ol' explosions! Whoom, boom!</figcaption></figure><p>Okay, that concept alone is already a little unrealistic, so I absolutely had to suspend my disbelief with&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>. Perhaps I'm misremembering&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 3</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 4</em>'s campaigns, but I recall them being somewhat grounded in realism.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The campaign feels like something closer to&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em>&nbsp;than the&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>series I know. Or rather, it tries to imitate that over-the-top, action movie formula and fumbles. The plot is incoherently written to the point where most dialogue is military jargon that will fly over most players' heads, mine included.</p>

<p>It's a globe-trotting tale featuring your squad of Gary and Mary Sues. You'll fight PAX Armata in the backstreets of Cairo and in the rugged terrain of Tajikistan, and while I appreciate the variety of locales, something smaller and more focused would have been better than this hodgepodge of ideas thrown into a pot.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-6-campaign-1.jpg?itok=mqTaSTd2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-6-campaign-1.jpg?itok=wXJGRhjt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Gotta have a night vision level.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>The story ends so abruptly that I could scarcely believe it was over, not that I really cared for the story at that point. Thankfully, it's a pretty short narrative overall, so it's not there to waste your time. A lot of the campaign is actually to acquaint players with&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>'s mechanics, like the squad dynamic and how vehicles operate.</p>

<p>Its gameplay, I suppose, is serviceable. There are some enjoyable, if mindless, sequences that can look amazingly cinematic. As an example, one mission has you command a tank platoon on the outskirts of Cairo. With a tank, you see&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>'s destruction on full display, and it's chaotic, but bloody exciting as overpasses and buildings crumble before you.</p>

<p>There's one other mission that takes place within a large, open area. The type of landscape that the <em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>is known for is these rural, sparsely populated war zones. You're supposed to take out several pieces of military hardware, and you can tackle those in whatever order.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-6-sam.jpg?itok=Eg-SlXU5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-6-sam.jpg?itok=907Ib-Kb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Down with SAM.</figcaption></figure><p>This non-linear mission shows a hint of promise and perhaps a vision for something greater, but that potential is never realized.&nbsp;You're even given a drone for this particular mission, which is horrifically effective and a bit scary when you think about how it's being used in real-life war.</p>

<p>And so, if you're able to turn your brain off, you'll actually find that the campaign can be enjoyable. Outside of the disappointing narrative, I didn't dislike its gameplay by any means because the gunplay in&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>&nbsp;is so tight and refined, but mileage with it will vary. One playthrough is more than enough for me.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-6-m277.jpg?itok=Ht6ERWIX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-6-m277.jpg?itok=kqay0L3d 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>They could never make me hate you, M277.</figcaption></figure><h2>A Gun Nut's Delight</h2>

<p>Allow me to nerd out for a minute. Just a few years back, during the pandemic, the U.S. Army went out to bid for the Next Generation Squad Weapon. This was an effort to replace the now-dated M4, the de facto rifle of the time. In comes Sig Sauer's M7, the new rifle chosen to define the future of warfare.</p>

<p>The thing is, it's a pretty controversial firearm. Even though it conformed to the specs the U.S. Army put forth, it was a <em>hefty&nbsp;</em>boy.&nbsp;Not only that, it had a 20-round magazine (10 rounds less than its predecessor) in order to accommodate the larger cartridge it used.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is all to say, I'm a big stickler for gunplay in FPS games. It might not matter to some, but for me, how a weapon feels is pivotal to how I perceive the overall quality of the title.&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>&nbsp;has, by far, some of the best gunplay in a AAA title, and this game's version of the M7 -- called M277 in this case -- made me realize that.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-6-variable-zoom.jpg?itok=Pycjq_HZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-6-variable-zoom.jpg?itok=EichiAQL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>J.A.R.V.I.S., enhance.</figcaption></figure><p>Another cool tidbit about the M7, it features a super fancy optic that features, among other things, a variable zoom. This means the scope can adjust according to how far out the target is.&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>'s M277 also features this, and I fell in love with this damn thing. I felt like a real pro, zooming in or out in accordance with the target.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Battlefield Studios even gave that darn thing a 20-round mag, and man, you run out of ammo so fast, so I can see why it was a common complaint.&nbsp;You feel the power of the larger cartridge, though, and it was a blast to pick off enemies with this thing, even if I found myself reloading far more than I wanted to.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is just one of&nbsp;<em>many</em>&nbsp;weapons you can use in&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>. As you play more multiplayer and rank up, you'll unlock new weapons. Focusing on a specific firearm will also allow you to choose from a myriad of attachments. Gun customization is as good as it gets in&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6.</em></p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-6-progression.jpg?itok=3E-smb7H 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-6-progression.jpg?itok=C_am5j38 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A steady stream of attachments and new guns means you'll be spoiled for choice.</figcaption></figure><p>The variety is really staggering here, and I found myself constantly switching between different guns in multiplayer. Each gun has a distinct feel, so nothing felt like a repeat of the other. Later on, I discovered the PW7A2, a submachine gun best used by the Engineer class. It has this attachment that allows you to sprint while shooting, changing up the way I approach gunfights with it.</p>

<p>I'm certain there will be a meta, as there always is in games such as this. I'm a casual enjoyer of&nbsp;<em>Battlefield</em>, so if you're a gun nut and love to customize and use various weapons, you can't go wrong here.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tank-gameplay-bf6.jpg?itok=GhPU7Clz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tank-gameplay-bf6.jpg?itok=S3bOIBhv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Put me in one of these bad boys and I'm gonna have a great time.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Battlefield</em>&nbsp;Multiplayer is Back and Better Than Ever</h2>

<p>But yes, the multiplayer is the premier&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>&nbsp;experience. For complete transparency, I was able to play multiplayer during select times throughout my review period. That said, many of my games were composed of several players on either side, with the remaining slots being filled by bots.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bots inflated my ego a bit because they're not particularly smart. It was like shooting fish in a barrel. Either way, I expect&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>'s multiplayer to have a healthy player count without the need for bots in most, if not all, games. I say that, not because it's a popular series, but because the multiplayer is that addicting.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bf6-multiplayer_0.jpg?itok=FOCymdfx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bf6-multiplayer_0.jpg?itok=_mtjcb3N 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Yeah, I dabble in a bit of camping, so what?</figcaption></figure><p>EA would shut off the servers for the day, and I'd feel sad I couldn't play more. The progression is addictive, acquiring and upgrading guns. There are tons and tons of challenges to complete, weapon camos to unlock, and more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is a nice variety of multiplayer game modes in&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>. Whether you prefer short fights or long conflicts, there's something for you. Team deathmatch is a traditional FPS game mode comprising a lower number of players and closer quarters. This was a&nbsp;blast&nbsp;to play when we had a group of nearly all players.</p>

<p>Still, the smaller maps don't hit the same as the larger ones. The true&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>experience, in my mind, is these gigantic maps with tons of vehicles, mayhem, and destruction. You'll find that in spades here. During peak hours, we were able to get a larger group of reviewers together, and that's the most fun I've had in&nbsp;<em>Battlefield</em>&nbsp;in a long time.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-6-multiplayer-map_0.jpg?itok=vaEXOJm9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-6-multiplayer-map_0.jpg?itok=g4DauhZy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Keeping watch on the rooftops!</figcaption></figure><p>Everyone was either pushing objectives, riding in vehicles, or just causing utter mayhem. There I was with a Stinger launcher trying to shoot down every jet and helicopter just so I could be <em>that&nbsp;</em>guy, and it was cathartic. That vision of "all-out warfare" is the vision&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>&nbsp;is trying to sell. It achieves just that.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This opinion stands only on those larger, open maps. While I did enjoy fighting in some of the more urban environments, I wasn't a particular fan of the layouts, especially those taking place within New York City. They felt too cramped despite being actually quite large in size, and too repetitive with all the buildings, many of which you couldn't enter.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-6-loadout.jpg?itok=zuNcHUhe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-6-loadout.jpg?itok=h9Hppqz3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Gotta go with the grenade launcher, it's crucial!</figcaption></figure><h2>Fulfilling Your Role in&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em></h2>

<p>On the note of classes, the signature Assault/Engineer/Support/Recon makes a return in&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>. Now, there's some contention about any class being able to use any weapon. At first glance, it seems to blur the lines of what makes a class what it is, and also that it might mean players just end up using whatever weapon is the most "meta."</p>

<p>Those are valid concerns, but Battlefield Studios makes an admirable effort to mitigate them. One way&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>&nbsp;does this is by including "Signature Weapons." For the Support class, that's light machine guns. They get a benefit no other class gets from using LMGs, which is that they aren't slowed down by the rifle while sprinting. They can also aim down their sights faster, giving you a bit of an edge over, say, an Engineer using an LMG.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bf6-grenade-launcher.jpg?itok=BtQ-FOh3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bf6-grenade-launcher.jpg?itok=KqCJvsN8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Lobbing 'nades is fun.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>I found myself sticking to my class' designated weapons, but it's a toss-up if other players will feel inclined to do so as well. Personally, it's a smart inclusion and, at least in casual play, should make classes feel more distinct. Other than that, classes have different abilities and gadgets to further distinguish their role.</p>

<p>For example, Engineers have a range of launchers to choose from. They can, like other&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>titles, repair vehicles. We also have active abilities, so a Recon can live up to its name and toggle a UAV to disclose enemy locations. I actually sometimes forget about having these abilities, so it's good to get into the habit of using them right from the start.</p>

<p>I have some strong thoughts about the campaign. At this point, I think I've made my point that the story is incredibly lackluster. It's like a Michael Bay movie: All style, no substance. It's fun to look at, but that's about as much as you'll get out of the campaign.</p>

<p>Despite this drawback, the main attraction here is the multiplayer, and I had a helluva time with it. The tight, fierce gunplay kept me addicted to the progression so I could unlock more guns and customize them. The destruction and mayhem on the battlefield are cinematic and jaw-dropping, as well as incredibly immersive.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yeah,&nbsp;<em>Battlefield</em>'s had a few fumbles here and there, but with&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>, it feels like it's returning back to what it was meant to be. Pure, adrenaline-fueled multiplayer with rich destruction physics and plenty of guns and vehicles to commandeer.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A group of ex-ZeniMax Online Studios developers have banded together in order to form a new company by the name of Sackbird Studios, and it's pledging to create "bold, character-driven experiences".</p>

<p>Several of the developers involved in the formation of Sackbird were previously working on looter shooter&nbsp;<em>Project Blackbird&nbsp;</em>for Xbox, but that project was reportedly canceled during Microsoft's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" rel="nofollow">recent layoff frenzy</a>&nbsp;(which also saw studios like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">Rare</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">The Initiative</a> impacted).</p>

<p>Now, however, as reported by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/laid-off-zenimax-online-studios-developers-form-sackbird-studios" rel="nofollow">Game Developer</a>, a number of the staffers who were involved with that project, as well as with developing&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls Online</em>, have formed Sackbird together, including luminaries like technical director Robert Ballantyne and tools engineer David Worley.</p>

I really hope Sackbird can stick to those values in what is becoming an increasingly frantic and chaotic industry.</p>

<p>Worley says he and his team "wanted the freedom to take smart risks without waiting for a greenlight or chasing quarterly targets", and that the studio will "only answer to people who are passionate about games".</p>

<p>Other team members apparently describe Sackbird as a "developer-first environment with a long runway and a tight, senior team", which currently consists of fewer than ten people. I'm assuming that's being announced in order to demonstrate that there isn't a "too many cooks"-style issue at the top.</p>

<p>Sackbird is apparently already hard at work on its first project, which it describes as "an original project for PC and consoles", with more information becoming available "when the game is ready".</p>

<p>In any case, we'll have to wait and see just what exactly Sackbird Studios has in store for us. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things industry-related.</p>
