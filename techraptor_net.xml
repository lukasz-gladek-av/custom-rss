            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zelda-movie-delayed-may-2027<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced that its upcoming live-action&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda&nbsp;</em>movie will be releasing later than initially anticipated, although since the movie is such a long way off anyway, the delay likely won't mean much.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Nintendo/status/1932075231885382103" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Nintendo legend Shigeru Miyamoto revealed earlier today that the&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>movie, which was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/live-action-zelda-movie-march-2027" rel="nofollow">due to come out in March 2027</a>, will instead be releasing in theaters on May 7th. Like I said, both of these dates are pretty much too far off for the delay to be too meaningful.</p>

<p>According to Miyamoto, the movie was delayed in order to give the filmmakers and producers "extra time to make the film as good as it can be", which is a pretty standard reason for delaying a project. That famous quote about delaying and rushing <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/did-miyamoto-really-say-a-delayed-game-is-eventually-good-but-a-rushed-game-is-forever-bad" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wasn't actually said by Miyamoto</a>, but it feels apropos here anyway.</p>

<p>We do, however, know that the movie will definitely be live-action as opposed to an animation, and it'll be helmed by&nbsp;<em>The Maze Runner&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes&nbsp;</em>director Wes Ball, with production being handled by Miyamoto, Ball, and Avi Arad.</p>

<p>It's likely we're going to have to wait quite some time before we get more information about the&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>movie, especially given this delay, but it's not all bad news; while you're waiting, the Switch 2 just made its predecessor's&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>library a much smoother experience.</p>

<p>The Switch 2 Edition upgrades for&nbsp;<em>Breath of the Wild&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>&nbsp;bring smoother frame rates and better visuals, of course, but <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-upgrades-switch-1" rel="nofollow">free updates</a> for&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Link's Awakening&nbsp;</em>are also available, smoothing out their choppy frame rates and performance issues on the Switch 2.</p>




<p>The live-action&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda&nbsp;</em>movie is now set to launch on May 7th, 2027. We'll bring you more on this one as soon as we get it.</p>
