            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hundred-line-last-defense-academy-ps5-xbox-unlikely<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you've been holding your breath for&nbsp;Kazutaka Kodaka and Kotaro Uchikoshi's JRPG&nbsp;<em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy&nbsp;</em>to hit other platforms, then it's probably safe to let that breath out, unfortunately.</p>

<p>That's according to a post by Kodaka on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kazkodaka.bsky.social/post/3loblywautc2f" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>, in which he says that there are "no plans" to bring the JRPG to other platforms. Not only that, but the chances of that happening in the future are "very slim", according to Kodaka.</p>

<p>Kodaka's post was in response to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ethangarcia.bsky.social/post/3lnapnme7ms2n" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a user</a> who asked how long a port might take if&nbsp;<em>The Hundred Line&nbsp;</em>is successful, as well as whether other translations might become available in time. Kodaka says he'd "love to get started" on localizations, but that his studio Too Kyo Games is "still on the brink of going under".</p>

For that reason, he says he'll share updates about future plans "when the time comes", encouraging players to enjoy the game "without any worries".</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</em>, it's a tactical RPG co-authored by Kotaro Uchikoshi and Kazutaka Kodaka, the creators of the&nbsp;<em>Zero Escape&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Danganronpa&nbsp;</em>franchises respectively.</p>

<p>Released <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy-release-date" rel="nofollow">last month</a>, the game's development saw Too Kyo Games <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/danganronpa-creators-new-game-risking-lives" rel="nofollow">indebted as a result of securing financing</a>, so Uchikoshi and Kodaka will no doubt be hoping that&nbsp;<em>The Hundred Line&nbsp;</em>is a success.</p>

<p>At time of writing, the game's player count is sitting at 8,200, with a 24-hour peak of 9,053 and an all-time high of 10,026. Those are some pretty respectable numbers for a very niche JRPG, but whether they're enough to save Too Kyo is another matter.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-limited-time-modes-paywalls-rumor</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-might-soon-hide-limited-time-modes-behind-paywalls.1181157/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-limited-time-modes-paywalls-rumor<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report has emerged which suggests that&nbsp;Activision and Treyarch are considering putting some of the next&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>game's limited-time modes behind a paywall.</p>

<p>According to&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>leaker <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1919060883696722210" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">The Ghost of Hope</a>, the next game (which, in a break from tradition, will apparently be&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>) will have more seasonal limited-time modes, but "the only way to play [them] will be to have the battle pass".</p>

<p>Right now, anyone can enjoy&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em>'s seasonal limited-time modes regardless of whether they pick up the battle pass or not, but under these proposed changes, it seems you'd need to pay up for the privilege.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-duty-limited-time-modes-paywall-jay-silent-bob.jpg?itok=hlW83aKO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/call-of-duty-limited-time-modes-paywall-jay-silent-bob.jpg?itok=pmEKbaNH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some of&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em>'s future crossovers could be behind paywalls.</figcaption></figure><p>The Ghost of Hope says that Activision and Treyarch, who will be developing the game, are "planning on taking the higher tier skins, loot, and crossover operators" obtained through limited-time game modes and "making them only accessible to battle pass owners".</p>

<p>According to Hope, purchasing any paid battle pass for&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 7&nbsp;</em>will get you access to the limited-time game modes under the new system, although premium-tier Blackcell pass would probably get a little something extra.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that the next&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>game hasn't officially been unveiled yet, so this information should definitely be taken with a pinch of salt. Given Activision's eagerness to monetize <i>Call of Duty</i>, though, as well as its many high-profile crossovers, it wouldn't surprise me if limited-time event monetization is on the cards.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-duty-limited-time-modes-paywall-rumor-turtles.jpg?itok=0SDRRtbG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/call-of-duty-limited-time-modes-paywall-rumor-turtles.jpg?itok=YK5Emw0F 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>has crossed over with a number of high-profile properties.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Call of Duty</em>'s major high-profile crossovers include the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-squid-game-crossover" rel="nofollow"><em>Squid Game</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-skins-coming-to-call-of-duty-warzone-and-cod-modern-warfare-3" rel="nofollow"><em>Warhammer 40k</em></a>, and while not all of the crossovers arrive with limited-time modes, many do, meaning these crossovers could end up behind paywalls in future.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what Activision has in store for the next&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>to find out whether this leak is true or not. If the timing of<em>&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-revealed" rel="nofollow">Black Ops 6</a></em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-revealed" rel="nofollow">'s announcement</a> is anything to go by, we can probably expect a reveal for the next game in the series in summer.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-genki-switch-2-lawsuit</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-sues-accessory-maker-genki-over-glitch-2-switch-2-range.1181097/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-genki-switch-2-lawsuit<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo is suing accessory maker Genki over the latter's "Glitch 2" Switch 2 accessory range, alleging trademark infringement and false advertising under federal and California state law.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://thegamepost.com/nintendo-lawsuit-against-genki-switch-2-mockups-ces-2025/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">The Game Post</a>, Nintendo's lawsuit, which was filed last week, claims Genki used Nintendo's "Switch" and "Joy-Con" trademarks in order to make it seem as though the accessory company's products were approved by Nintendo.</p>

<p>This, according to Nintendo's lawsuit, included the demonstration of what Genki claimed to be accurate Switch 2 mockups at the CES 2025 trade show, which took place prior to the console's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">official announcement in January</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/genki-glitch-2-accessories-nintendo-lawsuit.jpg?itok=nIE3RlrZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/genki-glitch-2-accessories-nintendo-lawsuit.jpg?itok=_blZoz9b 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Genki is currently advertising accessories for the "Glitch 2", and I'm sure you know what they're really intended for.</figcaption></figure><p>In the lawsuit, Nintendo goes on to say that Genki's semi-April Fools' Day joke, which saw it holding a suspiciously Nintendo Direct-style showcase in which it revealed a range of accessories for the so-called "Glitch 2", was an "obvious reference" to the Switch 2.</p>

<p>The Japanese gaming giant says that Genki's claims of compatibility on "day one" for the Glitch 2 range was misleading and illegal, because Nintendo hadn't provided Genki with a Switch 2 prior to release.</p>

<p>This means the accessory maker either wasn't in "possession of a genuine console" and thus couldn't make claims of compatibility "in good faith", or said console (or information pertaining to its specs) was "unlawfully or illicitly obtained".</p>

<p>Nintendo also says Genki's use of its trademarks would make it likely consumers would "falsely perceive a connection, association, sponsorship, or affiliation" between the two companies where no such partnership exists.</p>




<p>As for what Nintendo wants from the lawsuit, it's asking the court to put a stop to Genki selling Switch 2-related accessories. In The Game Post's words, it wants Genki to "destroy any products or ads that use Nintendo trademarks", as well as handing over profits related to Switch 2 accessory sales.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-reach-3m.1181079/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-3m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>developer and publisher Warhorse Studios has announced that its medieval open-world RPG has managed to pass a brand new sales milestone.</p>

<p>Speaking <a href="https://x.com/WarhorseStudios/status/1918999047735857429" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">over the weekend</a>, Warhorse said that&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>sales have reached a rather impressive three million <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-moved-forward" rel="nofollow">in three months</a>, thanking players for "making history" with the studio.</p>

<p>The figure means that sales of the game have slowed down a little since its meteoric beginnings;&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>managed to surpass a million sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-1m" rel="nofollow">in its first day on release</a>, going on to break the two million barrier <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-2m-two-weeks" rel="nofollow">in under two weeks</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-3m-combat.jpg?itok=3tJMmDVY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-3m-combat.jpg?itok=WsDrtQ9j 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>is selling pretty well.</figcaption></figure><p>Even so, three million sales is a pretty impressive figure for what is, in the end, a fairly niche title.&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>places a heavy emphasis on realism rather than traditional RPG fantasy elements, so the fact it's managed to find an audience this wide is no mean feat.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>, it's the sequel to <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/kingdom-come-deliverance" rel="nofollow">the 2018 original</a>. Much like its predecessor, the game is a medieval RPG set in 15th-century Bohemia, and it follows the blacksmith's son Henry of Skalitz as he navigates a web of political and historical intrigue.</p>

<p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>boasts a world twice the size of the original game, and it's also got a script that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-script-words" rel="nofollow">runs to a formidable two million words</a>, according to Warhorse Studios.</p>

<p>Naturally, you'll also find new skills and systems to interact with, as well as an entirely new story to discover and a ton of sidequests to hunt down. If you're into open-ended RPGs, then this one should already be on your radar.</p>




<p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1771300/Kingdom_Come_Deliverance_II/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/9N4W31HSMVVD" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.
