            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher No More Robots and developer RageSquid have revealed the release date for upcoming extreme sports game&nbsp;<em>Descenders Next</em>, and, well, it turns out the game isn't so "upcoming" anymore.</p>

<p>As revealed in a press release,&nbsp;<em>Descenders Next&nbsp;</em>is out now for PC and Xbox, and it's also on Game Pass. That's right; the game has been shadowdropped, and you can check it out right now at no extra cost if you're a Game Pass subscriber.</p>

<p>If you're not, the game will set you back $24.99 or your regional equivalent. It's in Early Access right now, which means you're getting just two sports: snowboarding and mountainboarding. Additional sports will, however, be added over time;&nbsp;<em>Descenders Next</em>'s goal is to become "the only extreme sports game you'll ever need".</p>

Surprise!</figcaption></figure><p>As revealed back when the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/descenders-next-2025-pc" rel="nofollow">was announced last year</a>,&nbsp;<em>Descenders Next</em>'s first two sports will handle differently from one another as well, so you won't just be getting carbon copies of the same activity at launch (i.e. now).</p>

<p>No More Robots and RageSquid say the goal with&nbsp;<em>Descenders Next&nbsp;</em>was to "deliver the same feel, the same sense of speed [as the original <em>Descenders</em>], but expand beyond mountain biking". As such, the studios emphasized a philosophy of "perfecting the fluidity of numerous sports" for&nbsp;<em>Descenders Next</em>.</p>

<p>According to the two studios,&nbsp;<em>Descenders Next&nbsp;</em>already has the same amount of content that <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/descenders" rel="nofollow">the original</a>&nbsp;<em>Descenders&nbsp;</em>does, and it'll offer a "more natural experience" than the original game's mixture of procedurally-generated stages and hand-crafted levels thanks to its "procedural off-piste mountains that chain together into tight, winding parks and vistas".</p>




<p><em>Descenders Next&nbsp;</em>is out right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2375530/Descenders_Next/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/descenders-next-game-preview/9N66JJQFX3RX" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a> (including Xbox One), and if you're a Game Pass member, you can play it right now at no additional cost as well, although you will need to be on the Ultimate or PC tiers to check it out.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Void Interactive has announced that its tactical shooter&nbsp;<em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em>has managed to reach a pretty major sales milestone in just four days.</p>

<p><em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ready-or-not-ps5-xbox-summer" rel="nofollow">released on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S</a> last week, and according to a press release, the game has already managed to sell a million copies on both platforms, a milestone it reached within the first four days of its launch.</p>

<p>As Void Interactive points out, when combined with the 9 million sales milestone&nbsp;<em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ready-or-not-sales-9m" rel="nofollow">reached on PC earlier this year</a>, this means the game has managed to hit 10 million sales overall, which is a pretty impressive figure for a game that's proven pretty divisive.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ready-or-not-console-sales-1m-4-days-neon.jpg?itok=VU4ZXcf3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ready-or-not-console-sales-1m-4-days-neon.jpg?itok=cckl7ckc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em>has hit a million sales on console.</figcaption></figure><p>Void CEO Julio&nbsp;Rodriguez says that it took 36 days for <i>Ready or Not&nbsp;</i>to reach a million sales on PC, but that it managed to achieve this milestone in a tenth of the time on console.</p>

<p>Rodriguez also says his studio is "already hard at work ironing out issues and continuously improving the experience", so if you're not entirely satisfied with your&nbsp;<em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em>experience on console, there's every chance an update will be along soon to fix that.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Ready or Not</em>, it's a multiplayer-focused tactical shooter in which you must "defuse hostile and confronting situations" as a member of a SWAT team. You might be dealing with hostage situations, for instance, or you might be dispatched to a robbery, and working alongside your team to defuse such situations is key to the game's core.</p>




<p>Recently, the game has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1144200/Ready_or_Not/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">come under fire</a> from its PC community for what players perceive as censorship being imposed on the PC version in order for the console releases to go ahead, as well as a perceived graphical downgrade for the PC version to achieve parity with console gamers.</p>

<p>Void Interactive has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1144200/view/526472884483263337" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">clarified</a> that&nbsp;changes were made to&nbsp;<em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em>in order to comply with "platform standards, age rating boards, and local legal restrictions", and that those changes were only made "where absolutely required, and only to the letter of the regulations".</p>

<p>You can grab&nbsp;<em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1144200/Ready_or_Not/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10009213" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/ready-or-not/9NBR63PT4FZC" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>
