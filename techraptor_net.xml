You're not a settler, and you haven't crash-landed — you're expendable prison labor sent to tame a new world for the benefit of distant, heartless corporations. Welcome to the comically bleak world of <em>StarRupture</em>!</p><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/starrupture" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b3eb7ef1-31bd-43e4-bd15-aa4e8990ab75" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>StarRupture</em></a> is the second game from Creepy Jar, a game developer best known for their survival crafting game <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/green-hell" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d60f8f93-57ae-418f-9999-eebdf6c54d21" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Green Hell</em></a>. While <em>Green Hell</em> took place in a jungle in modern times, <em>StarRupture</em> is a sci-fi game set on an alien world.

<h2>Living on a Prison Planet</h2><p>While the player character in <em>StarRupture</em> is thematically a prisoner, you functionally get the same sort of standard survival crafting experience that you might expect. You'll need to gather materials, craft items, consume food and water, and survive both environmental dangers and hostile fauna.</p><p><em>StarRupture</em> stands out a bit from other games in the genre by featuring a manufacturing system rather than a simple crafting system. This makes it a bit closer to games such as <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/satisfactory" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ad287941-87b4-47ba-9bfa-1184bd27b53c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Satisfactory</em></a>. A handful of items can be made on demand at indoor crafting stations, but you'll be making most of your stuff using gigantic machines outdoors.</p><p>That's not to say you'll be stuck at your base all day; there's a fairly large open-world area to explore, bordered by a combination of impassable mountains and a cloud of radiation. You can find resource deposits, dead bodies, lost shipping drones, and even entire abandoned facilities that will have useful loot for you to collect.</p><p>Unfortunately, you're not alone on this world — hostile bug-like creatures populate most of the region outside of the starting area. The star of this solar system periodically erupts into a devastating wave of fire every now and again, burning the entire surface of the planet and instantly killing you if you're not safely inside a structure.</p><p>Suffice it to say, there's plenty to do and a lot of area to explore in <em>StarRupture</em> at first glance. I've explored nearly the entire playable space over approximately 60 hours of gameplay, and I now have somewhat more mixed feelings about the overall experience in the Early Access launch version of the game.</p><figure role="group">

<h2>Stepping Back from <em>Green Hell's </em>Survival</h2><p>Naturally, the second game from a developer invites comparison to the first game. <em>Green Hell</em> and <em>StarRupture</em> both have survival elements, and I was somewhat disappointed to see Creepy Jar tone down the complexity of survival mechanics in <em>StarRupture</em>.</p><p>If you haven't played <em>Green Hell</em>, it arguably has one of the better survival systems out there, despite being seven years old. There is no "food" meter, for example — you need to supply your character with a mix of protein, fats, and carbs to stay healthy. (Of course, you also need to stay hydrated as well.)</p><p>This same depth of detail applies to injuries and diseases. There are a bunch of different ways that you can get sick or injured in <em>Green Hell</em>, and several different types of medicine or first aid need to be correctly applied to cure your ills. Sanity is a factor, too; if your health is poor, you'll start to go a bit loopy and begin hallucinating.</p><blockquote><p>Creepy Jar created some truly fun and engaging survival mechanics in Green Hell, and replacing them with simpler survival systems in StarRupture is a massive step backward.</p></blockquote><p>With that knowledge in mind, I was excited for the possibilities of <em>StarRupture's</em> survival system. Surely, strange diseases and psychological hazards would be a concern on an alien planet — especially when you're literally on the ground by yourself with no other humans to help you.</p><p>Sadly, the survival mechanics in <em>StarRupture</em> aren't all that different from most other survival games. You need to manage health, hunger, and thirst, along with a "toxicity" metric that can build up from eating certain foods. Diseases requiring specialized treatment are replaced with simpler debuffs that can often be healed by waiting them out.</p><p>I was disappointed with this discovery, to say the least. Creepy Jar created some truly fun and engaging survival mechanics in <em>Green Hell</em>, and replacing them with simpler survival systems in <em>StarRupture</em> is a massive step backward.</p><figure role="group">

</figure>
<h2>Manufacturing's a Mess</h2><p>Manufacturing and crafting are a big part of <em>StarRupture</em>. In fact, you wouldn't really be able to unlock new technology without setting up a factory to automate your crafting. Building factories to make items at scale is an important part of gameplay. Unfortunately, it has some seriously rough edges.</p><p>Your factory starts at ore deposits where machines will mine up raw ore. This raw ore is processed into bars with smelters, and these bars of material are subsequently moved to other machines (such as furnaces and fabricators) to make them into more complex materials.</p><p>Some of the mid-game items require multiple stages of manufacturing. Let's use the "Rotor" item as an example. You'll need to mine Titanium and Wolfram ore and process both of those into bars. You must then make Titanium Rods and Wolfram Wire at fabricators, and then combine Titanium Rods and Wolfram Wire in another fabricator.</p><p>The problem is the way items are transported between machines. Instead of conveyor belts, <em>StarRupture</em> uses small drones traveling along rails akin to small trains. It is difficult to design a rail system like this in such a way that items can criss-cross over each other to reach different machines without a lot of overengineering.</p><blockquote><p>The rail system in StarRupture is such a pain to use that it's easiest to simply destroy and rebuild your setup each time you need to make a new item.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Another issue with the rail system is that there is no easy way to purge leftover items; you have to jump up next to any leftover items and manually remove them. Sometimes, items won't disappear at all, and you'll have to destroy your rails and place them elsewhere to get around this bugged item.</p><p>Finally, and perhaps most critically, there is no remote control for these machines. You need to go to each machine, start the manufacturing process, and then move down the line for each subsequent machine. These systems should be remotely controllable from a console so you don't have to run around everywhere, but they're not.</p><p>In other games, you can design a factory system in such a way that you can make different items without having to rebuild your item transportation system. The rail system in <em>StarRupture</em> is such a pain to use that it's easiest to simply destroy and rebuild your setup each time you need to make a new item. This feels like suboptimal game design.</p><figure role="group">

<h2><em>StarRupture</em> Early Access Preview | Final Thoughts</h2><p>From what I've seen, the foundations of a good game are there with <em>StarRupture</em>, despite its flaws. The manufacturing system is fun enough despite the quirks of the rail transport system. Running around fighting bugs is plenty entertaining.</p><p>That said, there's one major thing lacking at launch: a story. There's not much guidance once you get past the tutorial. You can explore the world and find some lore at points of interest, but there really isn't much to do beyond progressing your corporation reputation by manufacturing the next tier of items.</p><p>You can see machines and structures in the deadly radioactive cloud surrounding the playable area; this suggests that we'll see the playable area expand in the future. However, not much has been done with the fairly large game world as it stands now.</p><p><em>Green Hell</em> had an engaging, interesting story, and I'm sure Creepy Jar will eventually deliver the same for <em>StarRupture</em>. Still, the game as it stands now is a slightly wonky factory base-building game with a game world mostly devoid of significant stuff to do.</p><p><em>StarRupture</em> is worth checking out if you're one of those factory game nerds who have a few hundred hours in <em>Factorio</em> or if you're looking for a bit of a diversion by exploring a new setting for a few hours. If that's not you, it may be best to wait for the gameplay and story to be fleshed out a bit more in a future update.</p><hr><p><em>StarRupture</em> was previewed over approximately 60 hours of gameplay on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1631270/StarRupture/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Steam</a> with a key provided by the publisher. All screenshots were taken during the preview process.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
