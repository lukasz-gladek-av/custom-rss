            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/united-videogame-workers-union-formed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Communications Workers of America and the American Federation of Musicians have announced the United Videogame Workers Union, the first North American industry-wide union that any employee working within the field can join.</p>

<p>Per a press release on the new UVW <a href="https://uvw-cwa.org/news/20250319-press-release" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, the union will demand "dignity and job security for all video game workers", with the union pointing to the devastating slew of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-studio-visual-arts-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">layoffs</a> that's been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/oxenfree-night-school-layoffs" rel="nofollow">assailing the industry</a> in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-june-14th" rel="nofollow">last couple of years</a>.</p>

<p>The union's mission statement is to "take back our lives, our labor, and our passion from those who treat us like replaceable cogs", and to work to create a gaming industry that "nourishes its talent and invests in its future, rather than constantly seeking short-term profits".</p>

<p>In addition to US and Canada employees, the UVW union will also encompass "video game contractors, freelancers, indie developers, workers who are currently unemployed, and workers who are already organizing their workplaces", so even if you already have a workplace union, you can join up.</p>

<p>CWA senior director of organizing Tom Smith says the new union is a "cumulative effort" by workers to "redefine what it means to stand together and reclaim power", while CWA president Claude Cummings Jr. describes the union as an "exciting next step" in the journey to "help video game workers build power in their industry".</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-crossplay-update-patch-notes</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/palworld-crossplay-update-released-full-patch-notes-revealed.1138923/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-crossplay-update-patch-notes<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Pocketpair has released the&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>crossplay update, and as you can probably imagine, it adds crossplay to the creature-collecting survival game, as well as more Pal storage and lots of other goodies.</p>

<p>The developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-crossplay-update-late-march" rel="nofollow">announced last week</a> that the update would be coming sometime in late March, and while it's up for debate whether the 19th constitutes "late March", the update is here, and there's plenty to enjoy.</p>

<p>As you've probably already surmised, the main attraction in this update is crossplay; you can now enjoy&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>alongside your friends on other platforms, and every platform is supported, so PC players can play with PlayStation and Xbox gamers, who can also enjoy the game with one another.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-crossplay-update-pal-and-player.jpg?itok=y205TYic 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-crossplay-update-pal-and-player.jpg?itok=1CZFIF73 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Palworld</em>'s crossplay update has arrived, and it's letting you play with your friends on different platforms at last.</figcaption></figure><p>Despite the update's name, however, crossplay isn't all it's bringing. You can now transfer Pals between worlds using the new Global Palbox feature, and you'll also find that there's a new Pal storage system with "10 times the capacity of a regular Palbox".</p>

<p>A new cosmetic armor system has also been added, so you can switch up your look without worrying about whether your stats will be affected. You can also take advantage of the new Photo Mode if you want a snap of yourself wearing your new snazzy threads.</p>

<p>Other new features include a new drafting table that lets you combine multiple lower-rarity blueprints for a higher one, as well as lots of balance adjustments and bug fixes. It's worth reading the full patch notes if you want to know everything, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1623730/view/571499455390418195" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">you can do so here</a>.</p>




<p><em>Palworld</em>'s latest update comes as developer Pocketpair continues to fight a legal battle against Nintendo, with the Japanese gaming giant <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-palworld-pocketpair-lawsuit" rel="nofollow">suing the indie developer</a> over several <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-lawsuit-patents-demands-nintendo" rel="nofollow">allegedly infringed patents</a>.</p>

<p>The lawsuit did not, however, stop Pocketpair from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-pocketpair-monster-hunter-wilds-day-off" rel="nofollow">granting its employees the day off</a> last month to mark the release of&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, which the studio jokingly suggested its employees would simply call in sick to play anyway.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>and its latest update right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/palworld/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/palworld-game-preview/9NKV34XDW014" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>. A mobile version of the game is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-mobile-version-krafton" rel="nofollow">also in development</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/circana-us-sales-data-for-february-2025-shows-monster-hunter-wilds-is-king.1138875/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/circana-us-sales-data-february-2025-monster-hunter-wilds<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>US analyst group Circana has released its sales data for February, and you'll never be able to guess which phenomenally popular action RPG managed to top the all-format charts.</p>

<p>That's right: according to Circana's <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lkqai3ibbc2p" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Mat Piscatella</a>,&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>was February's best-selling game, despite launching on the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-release-date" rel="nofollow">very last day of the month</a>. Of course, given that it took&nbsp;<em>Wilds&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-8m" rel="nofollow">just three days to break eight million sales</a>, we probably shouldn't be surprised about that.</p>

<p>In second place, according to Piscatella's data, is Warhorse Studios'&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>, which hit <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-2m-two-weeks" rel="nofollow">two million sales in less than two weeks</a>. Not bad for what is effectively a fairly niche medieval RPG.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-circana-us-sales-data-february-2025.jpg?itok=bqeslHQE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-circana-us-sales-data-february-2025.jpg?itok=9gDARq56 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>was the second best-selling game of February, according to Circana.</figcaption></figure><p>Piscatella's chart follows those two games up with&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>in third place, so it looks like the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-early-access-mixed-reviews-50k-players" rel="nofollow">frosty reception at launch</a> hasn't necessarily hurt its sales performance.</p>

<p>In fourth place is golf sim&nbsp;<em>PGA Tour 2K25</em>, with basketball game&nbsp;<em>NBA 2K25&nbsp;</em>in fifth and perennially popular shooter&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>in sixth (appropriately enough).</p>

<p>Seventh place for the month is a new entry in Obsidian's&nbsp;<em>Avowed</em>, but Microsoft probably isn't too worried about a low placement like that given that the game is also available on Game Pass.</p>

<p>Bringing up the last three places in the top ten for February are&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</em>,&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto 5</em>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Madden NFL 25</em>, the latter demonstrating the sheer staying power of EA's sporting franchises (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-ea-sports-fc-25-underperformed" rel="nofollow">well, sometimes, anyway</a>).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/madden-nfl-25-circana-us-sales-data-february-2025.jpg?itok=MyGKAb9r 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/madden-nfl-25-circana-us-sales-data-february-2025.jpg?itok=vfkBbUGv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Madden NFL 25&nbsp;</em>is still hanging on in there, according to Circana's data.</figcaption></figure><p>With regards to specific platforms, <i>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</i>was the best-selling game on Playstation and Xbox, with&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart 8&nbsp;</em>topping the Switch charts (because&nbsp;<em>Wilds&nbsp;</em>isn't available on Switch, of course).</p>

<p>In hardware terms, it probably won't shock you to learn that the PS5, which recently passed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-sales-75m-best-quarter-ever" rel="nofollow">75 million lifetime sales</a>, was February's best-selling console in both unit and dollar terms, with Xbox bringing up second place.</p>
