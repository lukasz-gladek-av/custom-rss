            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Stories about artificial intelligence aren’t a new phenomenon, but they’re increasingly relevant in relation to the real world.<em> D-topia</em>, a new game in development by Marumittu Games and published by Annapurna Interactive, looks to bridge their own take on an AI world with a gentle-paced puzzle adventure.</p>

<p>In <em>D-topia</em>, you take on the role of a Facilitator, whose job is to keep the residents of D-topia happy and the facility running as it should, as part of a project known as Utopia. We had a chance to check out a short demo that introduces us to this world, as well as what to expect in terms of puzzle-solving and the adventure aspect.</p>

<p>The demo opens with the newly minted character, known in the world as No. 046. From the jump, we can see that the world of <em>D-topia</em> is very clean and minimalistic – certainly by design.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dtopia_screenshot1.jpg?itok=14o19O1J 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dtopia_screenshot1.jpg?itok=x85epFdx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>No. 046 begins his journey by waking in his newly minted home. It’s an apartment of sorts that can be explored and used as a place for easy-going life-sim moments. For example, food is provided, so it’s appropriate to eat. No. 046 can check today’s weather and then prepare to leave by washing up.</p>

<p>Once that’s done, it’s time for No. 046 to fulfill their role as the newest Facilitator, so it’s off to the factory. On the way, he can talk to the numerous bystanders scattered around, who have plenty of positive things to say about D-topia.</p>

<p>The work component involves solving a series of puzzles, and the ones in the demo seemed straightforward enough. Most of them involve moving numbered blocks to their marked endpoints. For example, blocks marked 1 and 2 need to be dragged to the 1 and 2 labeled on the field.</p>

<p>These puzzles do get more complex as No. 046 completes each one – some involve passing through a barrier that increases the number, or some involve having to move a block to keep down barriers and figure out how the correct blocks need to move across the board.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dtopia_screenshot2.jpg?itok=RNvrF7wj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dtopia_screenshot2.jpg?itok=J3qTAwI7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>There’s a little trial and error involved, but the puzzles in <em>D-topia</em> – at least those in the demo – seemed easy enough and not particularly stressful. Solving each puzzle earns points, which then turns into the currency earned for the day.</p>

<p>After work, No. 046 is afforded some leisure time, so it’s worth exploring around D-topia. He runs into a curious character named Eebie, who drops his a memory card and skates away. No. 046 can choose to pursue him and learn a little more about them.</p>

<p>During this encounter, there’s a bit of a disturbance, and No. 046 is able to enter a nearby shop to see what’s going on. As the Facilitator, he learns from the shop manager that there’s a malfunctioning robot that needs attention, and can be investigated by interacting with a panel that triggers the Block Side.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dtopia_screenshot3.jpg?itok=WeO1vUzb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dtopia_screenshot3.jpg?itok=KpYAkjQI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In <em>D-topia</em>, the Block Side seems to be a darker place – one hidden from the eyes of the public, but it allows No. 046 to see underneath and fix problems in the game world.</p>

<p>By completing this particular task, he earns some plants that can be decorated in his room. The demo wraps up here, but not without some mysterious dialogue that suggests No. 046 is going off-key, that he needs to be investigated.</p>

<p>So while time with <em>D-topia</em> was short, it was just enough to get a taste of what this AI-based world is all about and how small decisions move the adventure forward. With its cute art style and soothing music similar to Annapurna's own <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/stray-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Stray</em></a>, it’s easy to see <em>D-topia</em> as the type of game to relax and vibe with when it comes out in 2026.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[People of Note Preview - Give Life Back to Music]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/people-of-note-preview-give-life-back-to-music</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/people-of-note-preview-give-life-back-to-music.1328563/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Turn-based RPGs seem to be all the rage these days, what with games like <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-french-revolution" rel="nofollow">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> </em>lighting up the zeitgeist. <em>People of Note</em> is another such game looking to enter the scene, although it’s not out until next year, it already looks like a creative twist on the classic genre.</p>

<p>That creativity comes in the form of music, and not just as something that exists in the background. <em>People of Note</em> incorporates the very soul of music into the way it’s played. This, of course, means that not only is music ongoing, but in battle it becomes important as different styles and rhythm-based mechanics take up a lot of the action.</p>

<p>In the demo, we’re thrown right into the midst of the story, which sees the main character, Cadence – an up-and-coming popstar from the city of Chordia – put together her dream of making it to the top of the Noteworthy Song Contest and the music charts. Although she was met with resistance, she travels to the rock city of Durandis to try something unheard of: combining her own pop music with the sounds of classic rock.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/20251016182357_1.jpg?itok=ie_rKsGM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/20251016182357_1.jpg?itok=anAkSyF- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Right away, this concept is introduced as Cadence and her group get pulled into their first turn-based battle. Here, each turn is known as a stanza, and on that stanza, the top number indicates how many actions – including basic attacks and abilities – characters can take per turn. The number on the bottom indicates how many actions the enemy can then take per stanza.</p>

<p><em>People of Note</em> evolves this even further with the addition of a style gauge. Each stanza takes on different styles, and if a bandmate’s style is active, many of their abilities will gain a power boost. There’s a certain amount of ebb and flow here as the battle system opens up, and keeping track of BP is important as it's spent and gained each turn.</p>

<p>The rhythm game aspect comes into play every time a party character takes an action, and it’s fairly straightforward. Similar to something like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/hi-fi-rush-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Hi-Fi Rush</em></a>, simply tap a button every time the incoming circle lines up, and it’ll score your effort accordingly. The better the score, the more efficient the damage.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/20251016182229_1.jpg?itok=ydHC3XWO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/20251016182229_1.jpg?itok=uo-G2pLo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Outside of battle, <em>People of Note</em> includes a puzzle-adventure aspect that is required to get through sections of the level. These, from what was shown in the demo, involve basic ideas such as positioning mirrored lasers to open a door. There’s not a lot of direction, but with some trial and error, these puzzles aren’t too challenging. It’s easy to see how they can become tedious after a while, though, so hopefully it’s mixed up more in the full game.</p>

<p>The other element is the story itself, which is told in cutaways with 2D-sketchy artwork. The art style in general has a pleasant, painterly feel to it, with plenty of colors to go around. The music in <em>People of Note</em> is also noteworthy, of course. It seems like it’s ever-present in a way that helps flesh out the world.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/20251016180545_1.jpg?itok=8b_LUyun 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/20251016180545_1.jpg?itok=ieQUsd4z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Time with the demo was brief, but the beginnings of the mechanics were all there, and it’s clear that <em>People of Note</em> is going to be one to watch out for going into 2026. The intricacies of the battle system help it stand out from the usual turn-based outings, and it feels like the demo is only scratching that surface.</p>

<p>For now though, it remains to be seen just how much deeper the gameplay in <em>People of Note</em> is willing to go. Hopefully, it’s quite a bit because the potential is certainly there for all to see.</p>
