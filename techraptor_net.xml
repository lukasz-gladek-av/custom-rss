            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>An official <em>Ghost in the Shell</em> RPG is in the works. Mantic Games and Kodansha Ltd will help adapt the iconic cyberpunk sci-fi series, beloved for its blend of worldbuilding, existential philosophy, and cybernetic technology, to the gaming table.</p><h2>The <em>Ghost in the Shell</em> RPG Announcement</h2><p>According to an official press release, the <em>Ghost in the Shell</em> RPG will adapt the world of danger, espionage, and artificial intelligence found in the original manga, created by legendary mangaka Shirow Masamune.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The game will feature a bespoke RPG game system created by a team of acclaimed designers, including the legendary Alessio Cavatore (<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bolt-action-3rd-edition-review-snapping-into-action" rel="nofollow"><em>Bolt Action</em></a>) and award-winning writer Zak Barouh (<em>Animon Story</em>). The system will combine fast-paced, narrative-driven mechanics, with philosophical depth. A fitting mix, given the source material.</p><p>The influence Ghost in the Shell has had on cyberpunk sci-fi cannot be understated. The manga pushed the visual identity of cyberpunk dystopias with it s juxtaposition of urban decay and futuristic technology. It explored ideas of transhumanism and identity in a world where consciousness can be downloaded.</p><p><em>Ghost in the Shell's </em>influence is so ubiquitous, from aesthetics to themes, it can be found everywhere. From feature films like <em>The Matrix</em> and <em>Blade Runner</em> to games like Mike Pondsmith's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/cyberpunk-red-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Cyberpunk </em>TTRPG</a> or the iconic immersive sim, <em>Deus Ex</em>.</p><blockquote><p>“We’re absolutely thrilled to be bringing The Ghost in the Shell to the world of tabletop roleplaying” said Ronnie Renton, CEO of Mantic Games. “This is one of the most iconic and influential science fiction worlds ever created, and we’re honoured to be entrusted with the official license. Alessio and Zak have worked tirelessly to ensure every story told at the table feels true to the original manga, allowing players to live, think, and fight in the world of Major Kusanagi and the iconic Section 9.”&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>The <em>Ghost in the Shell</em> RPG is a departure from Mantic Games' past history of licensed work. Most of the licensed games they have produced are miniature-based tactical experiences like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/halo-flashpoint-war-games-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Halo: Flashpoint</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/walking-dead-all-out-war-comes-to-end" rel="nofollow"><em>The Walking Dead: All Out War</em></a>. That experience will undoubtedly be useful given the source material's history of gunfights and mech battles.</p><p>The <em>Ghost in the Shell</em> RPG is set to come out in Summer 2026.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p><span><div>
