            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Surgent Studios and publisher Pocketpair have revealed the release date for upcoming psychological horror game&nbsp;<em>Dead Take</em>, and some pretty big names have joined the cast list as well.</p>

<p>Per a press release, the game, which was first revealed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/surgent-pocketpair-dead-take" rel="nofollow">back in early June</a>, will be launching on PC via Steam and Epic on July 31st, which is just a couple of weeks away at time of writing. There's no word on console versions yet, however.</p>

<p>As well as the release date, Surgent also revealed some new members of&nbsp;<em>Dead Take</em>'s cast, and a couple of them will be familiar if you're a fan of&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;</em>actual-play series&nbsp;<em>Critical Role</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dead-take-release-date-cast-reveal-matt-mercer.jpg?itok=EkbKtvjf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dead-take-release-date-cast-reveal-matt-mercer.jpg?itok=uxSuBbn3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some of&nbsp;<em>Dead Take</em>'s cast members will be familiar to you if you've seen&nbsp;<em>Critical Role</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>The first two big names to join&nbsp;<em>Dead Take</em>'s list are Jane Perry and Alanah Pearce. You may recognize the former from her roles as&nbsp;<em>Hitman</em>'s Diana Burnwood,&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>'s Rogue, or&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>'s Mystra, but she's done plenty of other work as well.</p>

<p>Pearce's name may be familiar if you've played&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>as well; she voiced a character bearing her likeness in that game. She's also written for Sony Santa Monica Studio and created content for the likes of Rooster Teeth.</p>

<p>Also joining&nbsp;<em>Dead Take</em>'s cast in cameo roles are&nbsp;<em>Critical Role&nbsp;</em>mainstays Matt Mercer, Laura Bailey, and Travis Willingham. Surgent head Abubakar Salim has appeared on&nbsp;<em>Critical Role&nbsp;</em>before, so it's perhaps not a surprise to see these names appearing in&nbsp;<em>Dead Take</em>'s credits.</p>

<p>The names mentioned above will join main&nbsp;<em>Dead Take&nbsp;</em>stars <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-take-neil-newbon-ben-starr" rel="nofollow">Neil Newbon and Ben Starr</a>, who will play the game's main character Chase Lowry and missing actor Vinny Monroe, respectively.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Dead Take</em>, it's a narrative-focused psychological horror game in which you'll explore a Hollywood Hills mansion in order to piece together what happened after a typically decadent, star-studded party.</p>

<p>The game will <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-developer-to-publish-horror-game-by-tales-of-kenzera-zau-devs" rel="nofollow">serve as the debut title</a> of&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>developer Pocketpair's publishing wing, and it'll launch on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3352690/Dead_Take/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a> and the Epic Games Store on July 31st. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA["At Least Three" Caves of Qud Expansions Planned, Developers Say]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/caves-of-qud-expansions-three-planned</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/at-least-three-caves-of-qud-expansions-planned-developers-say.1244961/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Freehold Games and publisher Kitfox Games have announced that "at least three"&nbsp;<em>Caves of Qud&nbsp;</em>expansions are planned "over the next few years", and that major updates will accompany each expansion as it arrives.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/333640/view/805697599227036255" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Steam, Freehold says that the "success" of the game's 1.0 release, which came in December last year, has allowed it to consider "adding new layers of game to the already 17-year layer cake".</p>

<p>The developer says it will be focusing its efforts on "a few big expansion packs" that will come out over the next few years, with the first one due sometime next year. Not only that, but "a big update" will arrive alongside each expansion, and that update will be free for all players.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/caves-of-qud-expansions-base-game.jpg?itok=-6rQh4ss 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/caves-of-qud-expansions-base-game.jpg?itok=PDNv0hEB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Caves of Qud&nbsp;</em>is getting expansions over the next few years.</figcaption></figure><p>With regards to what will be included in free updates and what will be added to DLC, Freehold says it will make that decision "based on what makes sense"; if a feature is "core to the game", it will be part of an update, but if it's "part of a new set of non-vanilla features", you'll probably find it in an expansion.</p>

<p>Pricing is still to be determined, but Freehold says the DLC packs will almost certainly cost more than&nbsp;<em>Caves of Qud</em>'s&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3252660/Caves_of_Qud__Pets_of_Harvest_Dawn/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Pets of Harvest Dawn&nbsp;</em>pet pack</a>, which you can currently get for $4.99. That's because they "take a lot of development time and energy to make", the developer says.</p>

<p>When it comes to pet packs, Freehold says it's planning to add more pets to&nbsp;<em>Caves of Qud</em>, but that the plan is now to simply add more pets to the aforementioned pack rather than to continuously create new pet packs. The price "may" increase as a result, but that hasn't been decided yet, according to Freehold.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Caves of Qud</em>, it's described by its developers as a "science fantasy roguelike epic steeped in retrofuturism, deep simulation, and swathes of sentient plants".</p>

<p>Like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dwarf-fortress" rel="nofollow">Dwarf Fortress</a>&nbsp;</em>before it,&nbsp;<em>Caves of Qud&nbsp;</em>is built around simulated systems; relationships and situations are generated prior to each playthrough, and the world of the game can progress in different ways depending on that initial generation.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Caves of Qud&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/333640/Caves_of_Qud/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zelda-live-action-movie-link-zelda-cast</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/zelda-live-action-movie-casts-link-and-zelda-ahead-of-2027-release.1244889/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced who's going to be playing the two main roles of Link and Zelda in the upcoming live-action&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda</em>&nbsp;movie, which is currently set for release in 2027.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://x.com/Nintendo/status/1945433161124688335" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">social media post</a> by none other than Nintendo legend Shigeru Miyamoto, the role of Link will be played by actor Benjamin Evan-Ainsworth, whose previous roles include Miles in Netflix's <i>The Haunting of Bly Manor&nbsp;</i>and Pinnochio in the live-action Disney remake of the same name.</p>

<p>He'll be acting opposite Bo Bragason as Princess Zelda. You might recognize Bragason's name from shows like&nbsp;<em>The Jetty&nbsp;</em>or the Disney+ show&nbsp;<em>Renegade Nell</em>, and she also served as the model for the young Lunafreya in the animated movie&nbsp;<em>Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zelda-live-action-movie-link-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom.jpg?itok=J4wIaTuL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zelda-live-action-movie-link-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom.jpg?itok=oKr40KXy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Both Princess Zelda and Link have been cast in&nbsp;Nintendo's upcoming&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda&nbsp;</em>movie.</figcaption></figure><p>As Miyamoto points out, the live-action movie adaptation of&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda</em>&nbsp;is currently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zelda-movie-delayed-may-2027" rel="nofollow">set for release on May 7th, 2027</a>, having been delayed from its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/live-action-zelda-movie-march-2027" rel="nofollow">previous March 2027 release date</a>.</p>

<p>The movie, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-announces-live-action-legend-of-zelda-movie-distributed-and-co-financed-by" rel="nofollow">announced back in late 2023</a>, will be co-produced by Miyamoto and Avi Arad, whose previous producer credits include the critically-acclaimed&nbsp;<em>Spider-Verse&nbsp;</em>animated films, as well as many other blockbusters.</p>

<p>Directing duties will be handled by&nbsp;<em>The Maze Runner&nbsp;</em>head Wes Ball. We don't yet know who's going to be writing the&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>movie, nor do we know whether it will adapt a specific game or tell a story of its own.</p>

<p><em>The Legend of Zelda&nbsp;</em>is, however, just one of several video game franchises getting its own movie in the coming months and years. Others include ghost-hunting phenomenon&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-movie-blumhouse" rel="nofollow"><em>Phasmophobia</em></a>, smash hit open-world action RPG&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-movie" rel="nofollow"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>, and co-op platformer&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-movie-sydney-sweeney" rel="nofollow"><em>Split Fiction</em></a>, among others.</p>

Movie</em>, which <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/84343-highest-grossing-live-action-videogame-to-film-transfer-single-film" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">currently stands</a> as the highest-grossing video game movie adaptation of all time.</p>

<p>Whether it manages to achieve that feat or not remains to be seen, but in any case, the movie is set to be released in theaters around the world on May 7th, 2027. Stay tuned for more.</p>
