            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/front-mission-3-remake-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Forever Entertainment has revealed that mech RPG&nbsp;<em>Front Mission 3: Remake&nbsp;</em>is launching next month, completing the set of remakes for the original PlayStation-era trilogy.</p>

<p>Following on from 2022's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/front-mission-1st-remake-release-date-revealed" rel="nofollow">remake-of-a-remake</a>&nbsp;<em>Front Mission 1st&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/front-mission-2-remake-for-nintendo-switch-delayed-to-q3-2023" rel="nofollow">the following year's</a>&nbsp;<em>Front Mission 2: Remake</em>, the latest entry in the series will be arriving on June 26th, per a brand new trailer.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, no Nintendo Switch 2 Edition version of the game has been announced, so it sounds like it won't be getting any Switch 2 enhancements at launch, at the very least. It's entirely possible that's coming in the future, however.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/front-mission-3-remake-release-date-battle.jpg?itok=Ai3I8Rkg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/front-mission-3-remake-release-date-battle.jpg?itok=3GiU7iWC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Front Mission 3: Remake&nbsp;</em>is set for release in June.</figcaption></figure><p>There's also no word yet on whether&nbsp;<em>Front Mission 3: Remake&nbsp;</em>will be coming to other platforms, although given that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/front-mission-1st-remake-steam" rel="nofollow">both of its predecessors</a> were eventually <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/front-mission-2-remake-pc-console-release-date" rel="nofollow">released outside of the Switch ecosystem</a>, it's a distinct possibility.</p>

<p>The original&nbsp;<em>Front Mission 3&nbsp;</em>was the first game in the series to make it outside of Japan, as well as the franchise's final numbered release on the original PlayStation (if we don't count&nbsp;remake&nbsp;<em>Front Mission 1st</em>, which also wasn't released in the West in its PS1 form).</p>

<p><em>Front Mission 3</em>'s plot revolves around pilots Kazuki Takemura and Ryogo Kusama, who are caught up in one of the&nbsp;<em>Front Mission&nbsp;</em>series' signature political conflicts. As tensions rise and military zones become more "volatile", Kazuki and Ryogo must pilot their "wanzer" mechs to survive.</p>

<p>Just as with previous&nbsp;<em>Front Mission&nbsp;</em>remakes, you can expect this one to come complete with a number of improvements, including sharper visuals, smoother performance, and gameplay tweaks.</p>




<p>We'll have to wait and see whether Forever Entertainment intends to continue remaking&nbsp;<em>Front Mission&nbsp;</em>games; if so, the next logical candidate in the string would be 2003's&nbsp;<em>Front Mission 4</em>, the first series entry on the PlayStation 2.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Front Mission 3: Remake&nbsp;</em>launches for Nintendo Switch on June 26th. It will likely also be playable on Switch 2 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-successor-will-be-backwards-compatible" rel="nofollow">thanks to backwards compatibility</a>.</p>

Let's jump right in.</p>

<h2>MTG Final Fantasy - Magic Pot</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/-techraptor-magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-magic-pot.jpg?itok=itbIBPqb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/-techraptor-magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-magic-pot.jpg?itok=MdkTo3Dq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>That's right! We're so lucky to share the exclusive premiere of everyone's favorite recurring enemy: Magic Pot! This 3 mana 1/4 isn't just a decent blocker - it's also a great way to deal with cards causing trouble in your opponents' yards! And the fact that it dies and leaves behind a treasure token is a nice little bonus.</p>

<p>Now let's move onto the big guy, the crystal hunter himself:</p>

<h2>MTG Final Fantasy - Golbez, Crystal Collector</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/techraptor-exclusive-magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-golbez.jpg?itok=IivZOyzj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/techraptor-exclusive-magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-golbez.jpg?itok=X_OVuNKG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>We're so excited to premiere exclusive to TechRaptor&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy IV</em>'s number 2 baddie, Golbez! Known as the mysterious Man in Black in the original&nbsp;<em>FFIV</em>&nbsp;game, he later becomes a playable character in&nbsp;FFIV: The After Years. Zealous in his pursuit of Crystals!</p>

<p>That's matched perfectly with the flavor of this card, as Golbez, Crystal Collector cares about being surrounded by Artifacts! I've got plans already brewing to put together a Commander deck around Golbez, Crystal Collector, filling up my board with treasure and food token generation via cards like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/pip/137/nuka-cola-vending-machine" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nuka-Cola Vending Machine</a>, <a href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=671622" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Academy Manufactor</a>, <a href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=598195" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Currency Converter</a>, and more! Add in discard outlets like big creatures with Cycling (which you can grab back), Golbez, Crystal Collector's own Surveil ability, and old classics like&nbsp;<a href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=5113" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bottomless Pit</a>, and we've got a nasty little engine here!</p>
