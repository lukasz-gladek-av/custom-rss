            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Media Molecule co-founder David Smith has announced that he's leaving the studio after nearly 20 years in order to focus on his own personal projects.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mediamolecule.bsky.social/post/3lvqf3rzp622e" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message</a> on social media, Smith says that while he's "proud" of everything Media Molecule has created, he has been "feeling a growing itch to explore truly wild ideas and make things based on [his] personal whimsy".</p>

<p>He says that while he still "greatly enjoy[s] the creative dynamic of working at Media Molecule", he doesn't have enough time to do so and work on his personal projects "without entirely giving up on pursuing that mythical creature called 'work-life balance'".</p>

<p>It's not clear exactly what personal projects Smith will be working on; whether he intends to start a new studio away from Media Molecule is unclear. We may well learn more about his plans in the coming months.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with Media Molecule, it's a development studio that was founded back in 2006 by Smith and three others: Mark Healey (who <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/media-molecule-co-founder-mark-healey-leaves-studio-after-17-years" rel="nofollow">departed the studio himself back in 2023</a>), Alex Evans, and Kareem Ettouney.</p>

<p>The company's first game as Media Molecule was 2008's PS3 exclusive&nbsp;<em>LittleBigPlanet</em>, a platformer that emphasized user-generated levels, although it did also offer a campaign of its own created by Media Molecule staffers.</p>

<p>The studio's most recent release is&nbsp;<em>Dreams</em>, the PS4 creativity sandbox that acts as a game and content creation tool more than a title in and of itself. Live support for&nbsp;<em>Dreams&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/media-molecule-says-dreams-live-support-is-ending-in-september" rel="nofollow">ended in 2023</a>, but Media Molecule said at the time that it was moving onto an "exciting new project", although we still don't know what that might be.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sony Sales Up as CFO Pledges Live-Service Commitment Despite "Negative News"]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-sales-up-as-cfo-pledges-live-service-commitment-despite-negative-news.1264254/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has released its financial statement for the first quarter of the 2025-26 fiscal year, and sales are up compared to last year, with the company pledging to continue focusing on its live-service offerings in the future.</p>

<p>As revealed in the statement's accompanying financial <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/25q1_sonyspeech.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">documents</a>, overall sales for Sony's gaming segment are up by 8% compared to the first quarter of 2024-25, and operating income more than doubled for "a new quarterly high".</p>

<p>These numbers are up due mainly to "increased sales of third-party software", and while Sony doesn't specify which games sold particularly well, it's very likely that games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/oblivion-remastered-sales-circana-april-2025" rel="nofollow"><em>Oblivion Remastered</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-3-3m-33-days" rel="nofollow"><em>Clair Obscur</em></a>, and the PS5 release of&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 5&nbsp;</em>bolstered its numbers for this quarter.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/oblivion-remastered-sony-financials-q1-2025.jpg?itok=5g1B0cdG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/oblivion-remastered-sony-financials-q1-2025.jpg?itok=ynJFbMgk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Games like&nbsp;<em>Oblivion Remastered&nbsp;</em>have probably helped Sony to no end this quarter.</figcaption></figure><p>Additionally, Sony says its live-service revenue is "steadily growing" thanks to the performance of games like&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>,&nbsp;<em>MLB: The Show</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>, contributing "more than 40% of...first-party software revenue during the quarter".</p>

<p>In a Q&amp;A following the release (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sony-cfo-says-its-live-service-shift-is-not-entirely-going-smoothly-but-pledges-to-carry-on-and-learn-from-mistakes/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">VGC</a>), Sony CFO Lin Tao said the company will continue to pursue live-service games despite "negative news" about its two most recent live-service releases, namely&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;Marathon</i>.</p>

<p>In case you need a reminder,&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds" rel="nofollow">unceremoniously shut down last year</a> following a disastrous launch, while Bungie's&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shocking-no-one-bungies-marathon-delayed" rel="nofollow">delayed following negative feedback</a> from its alpha test, as well as news that the game contained <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-marathon-art-stolen" rel="nofollow">art stolen from an online artist</a>.</p>

<p>Tao says that despite these problems, live-service games are "contributing to sales and profits in a stable manner", citing the aforementioned three still-operational live-service games, as well as&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7</em>.</p>

The studio also points to the release of&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">in June</a>, although no sales figures are provided.</p>
