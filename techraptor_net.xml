            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>To hear the clacking of bones on hard stone is to know your doom, unless <em>you’re</em> the one controlling the Ossiarch Bonereapers in <em>Warhammer: Age of Sigmar</em>! I got a chance to check out the brand new Battletome and some new units up for preorder courtesy of Games Workshop, so let’s open up the catacombs and check it out!</p><h2><strong>Ossiarch Bonereapers Battletome - What’s In It?</strong></h2><p>Like all good <em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar </em>Battletomes, the new Ossiarch Bonereapers Battletome features everything you need to get an army of these clattering soldiers up and running.</p><h3><strong>What’s The Lore?</strong></h3><p>The book starts with a healthy heaping of lore, diving into these Chosen of Nagash with the level of depth and storytelling we’ve come to expect from Games Workshop.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ossiarch-bonereapers-dramatic-shot.jpg?itok=JBAbFy2x 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1000" height="580">

  </picture><p>Highly organized, far more so than your typical army of undead, the Ossiarch Bonereapers consist of legions of skeletons and construct hewn of bone and brought to life by soul fragments.&nbsp;</p><p>No pity, no mercy, no feeling at all except unwavering loyalty remains in these legions - making them a particularly deadly adversary for just about anyone with a beating heart.</p><p>Along with vivid descriptions of who the Bonereapers are, the lore section of the book (over forty pages) also tells the story of their impassive leader, Orpheon Katakros, Mortarch of the Necropolis. From his rise as Nagash’s leader to his various and impressive exploits, we get a clean picture of the undead captain.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>From there, we learn about the various divisions within the army, what they’re made of (spoiler: bones!), and how the Bonereapers, like so many forces in the world of <em>Age of Sigmar</em>, are out to smash and destroy the Skaven rat-men (at least there’s <em>something</em> most everyone can agree on).</p><h3><strong>The Rules</strong></h3><p>Rules-wise, the new Battletome walks us through what we need to bring this army to (undead) life! We start with Battle Traits. The Immortal Elite trait gives your army access to a number of “Relentless Discipline” points equal to a value attached to one of your Bonereaper heroes.</p><p>You can spend these points to access five valuable abilities, including spending a point to add 3” to a unit’s movement, spending a point to allow a unit that retreated to also charge, give a unit Ward (5+), and more - all until end of turn.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>There are also four battle formations to choose from when building your army: Grim Sentinels (strong against incoming charges), Nadirite Wedge (adding additional grits), The Inevitable Empire (lowering your opponent’s control value), and Remorseless Conquerors (adding to your run ability). It’s a clever way to begin building an army around a central theme, with each battle formation having its own distinct use.</p><p>There are also Heroic Traits which you can attach to a hero, making them uniquely strong and a bit more customized, rare relics you can give to a hero to help in their unwavering conquest, and spell lore that can empower your army’s weapons, douse your enemy’s in dark flaming magic, and drain your foes very life-force.</p><p>From there we dive into the Warscrolls for all available units, from the God of Death himself down to lowly foot soldiers, before moving onto Spearhead rules, Path to Glory rules, Armies of Renown, and Regiments of Renown. All in all, it’s a well-thought out and nicely paced new update to the rules for this iconic army.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>Now let’s check in with the new units I got a chance to preview.</p><h2><strong>Ossiarch Bonereapers - New Units</strong></h2><p>Included with my review package from Games Workshop were the following four new model releases for the Ossiarch Bonereapers:</p><h3><strong>Liege-Mortek</strong></h3><p>First up is the Liege-Mortek, the infantry officers of the Ossiarch Bonereapers army. Stats are: Move 5”, Save 3+, Control 2, Health 5, with a 6+ ward save, and 5 Relentless Discipline points.</p><p>His Commander’s Weapon (5 Attacks, 3+ Hit, 4+ Wound, Rend 1, Damage 2) pairs nicely with his <strong>Clinical Efficiency </strong>ability which allows a friendly visible Mortek Guard, Mortek Triaxes, or Mortek Crawler unit that hasn’t used an Attack ability yet to fight or shoot right after the Liege-Mortek fights, and they add 1 to their attacks for the rest of the turn.</p><p>This represents the flavor of an army officer well, as they lead the attack and then command a nearby unit to strike quickly.</p><h3><strong>Mortis Reapers</strong></h3><p>You’d think with a perfectly skilled and precise army, there’d be no room (or outside the box thinking) for an assassin - but you’d be wrong, as the Mortis Reapers prove! Stats: Move 6”, Save 5+, Control 1, Health 2.</p><p>With their Reaper’s Blades (3 Attacks, 3+ Hit, 4+ Wound, Rend 1, Damage 1) (Anti-Hero (+1 Rend)), they slip behind enemy lines to dish out serious damage.</p><p>Their <strong>Necrocaches</strong> ability allows them to, at the end of any turn, roll a D3 for each enemy unit they’re in combat with. On a 2+, they inflict that many mortal wounds and then can move 6” (including through combat ranges of enemy units, but they cannot end the move in combat).</p><p>They also have the <strong>No Escaping The Tithe</strong> ability, which reads as such: Declare: If there are no enemy units within 6” of this unit, pick a terrain feature within 3” of this unit to be the target. Effect: Remove this unit from the battlefield and set it up again wholly within 3” of the target and more than 9” from all enemy units.</p><p>In other words, you can do a little bit of a hop around the board if no enemy units are daring enough to get close to your Mortis Reapers.</p><p><strong>Mortek Triaxes</strong><br>&nbsp;</p><p>The Mortek Triaxes are up next, offering some ranged support. Stats: Move 4”, Save 5+, Control 1, Health 1, and a ward save of 6+.</p><p>They strike from a distance with their Osseous Bow (Range: 18”, 2 Attacks, 3+ Hit, 4+ Wound, Rend 1, Damage 1), and they are ranged control masters.</p><p>Their Atavistic Nightmares ability allows them to move Balefire Braziers tokens around the board which reduces an enemy’s control score by 3 (wow!), and prevents healing or returning slain models!</p><p>It’s very rare to see this kind of ranged control support, and I think it’s a clever and really interactive and fun addition to the army (and the <em>AoS</em> in general).</p><h3><strong>Liege-Kavalos On War Chariot</strong></h3><p>Finally, thundering in is the Liege-Kavalos on War Chariot, an imposing model with Move 10”, Save 3+, Control 2, and Health 12. He’s also got a 6+ ward save, and offers his army a whopping 6 Relentless Discipline points.</p><p>Along with his Commander’s Blade (5 Attacks, 3+ Hit, 4+ Wound, Rend 1, Damage 2) (Charge (+1 Damage)), his abilities help him get into position and brush off attacks. The <strong>Grind Them To Dust</strong> ability triggers once per turn during your army phase, and lets you get a free pile-in for him and up to two visible friendly Kavalos War Chariots wholly within 12”. You pile-in, then pick an enemy unit in combat with the target and roll D3, on a 2+ you deal mortal damage to that enemy unit.</p><p>He also has the <strong>Masterful Charioteer</strong> ability, which gives him and up to 2 friendly Kavalos War Chariots within 12” of him Ward (5+) for the rest of the turn.</p><p>So you want to be charging in with him, but as a single unit charging sometimes leaves you in an awkward position or vulnerable - which is where these abilities will be crucial!</p><h2>Ossiarch Bonereapers - Final Thoughts</h2><p>I’m thrilled with the new models for the Ossiarch Bonereapers. Along with looking extremely cool, they’re all built around synergies with existing models - or offer up a new patch the army needed.</p><p>I’m especially fond of the Mortis Reapers, who are just this skulking, creeping force of death hunting down heroes and throwing grave-sand bombs. Extremely cool and wildly flavorful!</p><p>What do you think of these new releases? Will you be picking up the new Battletome and models? Let me know in the comments below!</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-aos-ossiarch-bonereapers-review-them-bones]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p dir="ltr">We're early in the year, and with it, a new Warband and Rivals Deck is about to be released for <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-underworlds-starter-set-2023-review" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a4a60a44-5c6a-4787-be2e-abd18b18f684" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Warhammer Underworlds</em></a>. This time around, we have <em>Thanatek's Tithe</em>, a Warband of corpse reapers led by Thanatek in search of the 'truebone'. The <em>Nexus of Power</em> Rivals Deck is all about holding Treasure Tokens to power up your attacks in a strange 'King of the Hill' twist on Warhammer Underworlds.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Thanatek's Tithe</em> is a Warband of five fighters. The leader Thanatek is accompanied by two Mortis Reapers and two Retainers. To start off, the look of this Warband is fantastic. Thanatek weilds a bladed dagger as well as a variety of magical objects. From there, the other groupings match each other quite closely.</p><picture>

  </picture><p dir="ltr">Each Mortis Reaper, as you might expect from the name, has two blades and snarled faces ready for attack, while the Retainers have heads that look like coffins. I'm a bit fan of when a design is legible, and from whatever distance it's very easy to pick out who is who in your Warband. It also helps that each of the Mortis Reapers and the Retainers shares the same stats, creating a very easy-to-interpret hierarchy.</p><p dir="ltr">While they're easy to spot from a distance, their play is far more technical. There are a number of abilities that I'll go through that are tied to the Leader, Mortis Reaper, or Retainer.</p><p dir="ltr">For the Leader, when at the start of a turn, you can pick an enemy fighter to be the posessor, basically a target for the turn, and every time it takes damage as part of a friendly attack, your Retainers can all be pushed one hex closer.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Collect Cadaver Tokens In <em>Warhammer Underworlds</em></h2><p dir="ltr">The movement of your Retainers plays into this Warband's unique mechanic, cadaver tokens. You can gain cadaver tokens after a friendly fighter successfully hits a target who is adjacent to a Retainer.</p><picture>

  </picture><p dir="ltr">These cadaver tokens can be spent in a variety of ways:</p><ul><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1" data-list-item-id="e3cf94b7b1eafaaf9e780b46b3e9b5c8e">In your Power Phase, if a Mortis Reaper has been slain, you can remove a number of cadaver tokens and roll that many dice. With a good roll, you can raise that fighter.</li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1" data-list-item-id="e73c257a7c379a3200e259d32a5f57471">Alternatively, in your Power Phase, you can remove cadaver tokens and replace them with dice rolls to have Retainers attack enemy fighters who are adjacent</li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1" data-list-item-id="e0da62fd9f8d2651ed3049d94ce5bc95c">Lastly, you can remove cadaver tokens equal to the bounty of a character to Inspire it</li></ul><p dir="ltr">This movement of Mortis Reapers and Retainers is even better when you have access to your Leaders 'Soul-Linked Constructs' ability, which lets them use their melee attack with a friendly Retainer as the source of the attack.</p><picture>

              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/whu-thanatek-s-tithe-stats.jpg?itok=SciFE5xi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p dir="ltr">The flow of this deck is to pick a target, move your Retainers in and get them close, earn your cadaver tokens, and then use them to keep your army alive, attacking, and powered up. Once your fighters are in place, attack with your Leader from anywhere you want on the board for additional chances at damage.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><em>Nexus of Power</em> Rivals Deck</h2><p dir="ltr">As opposed to <em>Thanatek's Tithe</em>, which is all about moving through the board and stalking your enemies, the <em>Nexus of Power</em> Rivals Deck is about finding a good Treasure Token and holding down the fort to increase your range.</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr">"Friendly fighters are covetous while they are within 1 hex of a treasure token. Friendly covetous fighters' Range 1 melee weapon (excluding Upgrades) has +1 Range while they hold a treasure token."</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">There's a far simpler focus in the <em>Nexus of Power </em>Rivals Deck: you should secure your upgrade and hold it in place.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/whu-nexus-of-power-full-deck.jpg?itok=g0aLmcF8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/whu-nexus-of-power-full-deck.jpg?itok=YvToQhDi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p dir="ltr">For your objectives, you'll see rewards for melee attacks within a hex of a treasure token, having covetous fighters in enemy territory, getting a critical hit with a covetous fighter, and more. If there's some way to strategically move or attack with one or many covetous fighters then you should expect to earn some points with it.</p><p dir="ltr">This trend continues in the Power Deck. So many abilities read like standard Rival Deck cards with abilities like pushing a fighter 1 hex, give a weapon attack Grapple and Brutal, increase the range of a weapon +2. But ALL of these abilities also include the stipulation that it needs to occur within 1 hex of a treasure token.</p><p dir="ltr">For this Rivals Deck you're likely going to want to pick a bulky Warband that is able to post up at a singular location, or nearby Treasure Tokens, and do everything you can to bait your opponent into engagement to reap the benefits of the <em>Nexus of Power.</em></p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/whu-nexus-of-power-objective-card.jpg?itok=RcFfudZX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><h2 dir="ltr">Put Them Together, Or Keep Them Apart</h2><p dir="ltr">Interestingly enough, when we've seen Games Workshop release a Warband and Rivals Deck together, there's some level of synergy that we can see between them. Abilities of the Warband complement the strategy of the Rivals Deck. For these two I found it was quite the opposite.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Thanatek's Tithe</em> always wants to be on the move and pushing towards whatever poor enemy fighter has been designated as the possessor, and from there the whole Warband slowly but surely skulks up on their opponents. The <em>Nexus of Power</em> is instead about positioning yourself favorably and then not moving far to maximise the Power Cards you can use and your own stat benefits.</p><p dir="ltr">If anything, these two might get the most entertaining battles going on by going face-to-face with one another instead of working together.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/whu-nexus-of-power-power-cards.jpg?itok=hIfAtkS_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><h2 dir="ltr"><em>Warhammer Underworlds Thanatek's Tithe Warband </em>and <em>Nexus of Power Rivals Deck</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2><p dir="ltr">While these two components might not work together what it does offer is a healthy variety of gameplay for anyone interested in getting a very defensive deck or a very aggressive deck. If one of these offerings doesn't speak to you then the other one certainly will.</p><p dir="ltr">For this Warband more than others I also just can't get past how fantastic the miniatures look from a distance and how legible they are.</p><hr><p><em><strong>Warhammer Underworlds Thanatek's Tithe Warband and Nexus of Power Rivals Deck were reviewed with copies provided by the publisher - All photos were taken over the course of the review</strong></em></p></div><div><p><span><div>
