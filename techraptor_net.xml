            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Saber Interactive and publisher Focus Entertainment have revealed what you can expect from next week's&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>Anniversary Update, as well as what's coming as part of the game's second full year of content.</p>

<p>As revealed in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/500582260112622093" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post on Steam</a>,&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>'s Anniversary Update, otherwise known as Update 10.0, lands on September 4th (a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-september" rel="nofollow">very important date in the gaming calendar</a>). It brings with it a brand new PvE mission, a new Helbrute Onslaught PvP mode, three new weapons, and tons more.</p>

<p>It'll be the last-but-one update this year, with Patch 11 set to arrive sometime in the fourth quarter. It'll add another new PvE mission, as well as new mission pickups and new stratagems for you and your squad to consider.</p>

You'll also get the new Techmarine class, as well as its Omnissiah Axe weapon and an expansion for the Battle-Barge.</p>

<p>Lots more is coming to&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>throughout next year as well, including more missions, new enemies, and new PvP arenas, as well as a new Siege map in the second quarter of 2026. Don't say Focus and Saber don't spoil you!</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with <i>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</i>(or, to give it its full title,&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</em>), it's a sequel to the cult 2011 classic&nbsp;<em>Space Marine</em>. Like its predecessor,&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>is a third-person shooter, but it has more of a focus on live-service-style updates and content than the first game did.</p>

<p>The campaign picks up the story of Ultramarine Captain Demetrian Titus, who must battle through hordes of Tyranids in order to prove his loyalty to his chapter after the events of the first game.</p>




<p>A third&nbsp;<em>Space Marine&nbsp;</em>game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-space-marine-3-revealed" rel="nofollow">is officially in development</a> following the success of the second installment, and not only that, but the devs behind&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>are currently working on a game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-marine-2-devs-hasbro-tentpole-ip" rel="nofollow">based on a "tentpole" Hasbro IP</a>, although we don't know which one just yet.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>right now on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, and if you want to know what I thought of the game, you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review" rel="nofollow">read my review right here</a>.</p>
