<p><em>Hunters Gathering</em> is just one of the two multiplayer <em>Horizon </em>spinoffs in the works; the other, <em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em>, is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/horizon-steel-frontiers-announcement" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6e846926-a867-4dfb-94eb-b908c540bda9" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">an MMO</a> being worked on by <em>Guild Wars </em>and <em>Throne and Liberty </em>studio NCSoft.</p><p>As Kotaku and Schreier tell it, these projects are being considered main entries in terms of focus and development time, so if you're not into either of them, then it's probably going to be some time before the next <em>Horizon </em>game that appeals to you.</p><p>Of course, <em>Horizon </em>is also moving beyond the world of games, just like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-movie-director" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a9c59ec8-3853-4f23-9cd0-2a0396cacad7" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">other Sony properties</a>; there's a live-action <em>Horizon </em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-helldivers-horizon-movies-ghost-of-tsushima-anime" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2e3004d3-4622-4ff6-a7ef-39de11054b8d" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">movie in the works</a>, although we don't know too much about the creative personnel behind the project yet.</p><p>Considering <em>Horizon Hunters Gathering </em>and <em>Steel Frontiers</em>, Sony's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-tencent-light-of-motiram-lawsuit" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="158b5a17-6308-4b2e-9131-b6559d6e961f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">belligerence towards Tencent</a> for its decidedly <em>Horizon</em>-esque <em>Light of Motiram </em>makes a lot more sense, although it's also fair to say Sony is generally quite protective over its IP.</p><figure role="group">

That's a pretty standard boast as far as RPGs go, so it'll be interesting to see whether the game can put its money where its mouth is on that front.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Aether &amp; Iron </em>is a "decopunk narrative RPG" coming in March.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The story for <em>Aether &amp; Iron </em>takes place in "an alt-history 1930s New York" powered by a mysterious resource known only as aether, which provides energy for some pretty fantastical-looking contraptions.</p><p>Just like in games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/disco-elysium" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="989e82b0-e77a-495c-9583-e4576fdec8c0" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Disco Elysium</em></a>, you'll be holding conversations with a wide range of interesting and eccentric characters, and you'll need to roll skills if you want to influence, intimidate, or persuade your conversation partners.</p><p>Those conversations will be punctuated by turn-based vehicular combat in which you'll commandeer "a wide range of incredible aether-powered vehicles", tinkering with your loadout to determine exactly what kind of approach you want to take.</p><p>You can check out the new release date trailer for <em>Aether &amp; Iron</em>, which should also give you a pretty good sense of what you can expect from the game, right here.</p>
<p><em>Aether &amp; Iron </em>is arriving into a world increasingly populated with games looking to take <em>Disco Elysium</em>'s crown, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/longdue-hopetown-kickstarter-disco-elysium" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d3fcdd84-da78-41a4-b39c-85f0cc472810" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">some of them</a> made by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-disco-elysium-devs-new-studios-spiritual-successors" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="dc0c27a2-83ab-45f5-9ee3-60310fb61e94" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">folks who worked on the original</a>, so it'll be intriguing to see whether this one can carve out a place for itself in that landscape.</p><p>If you want to know as well, then you can wishlist <em>Aether &amp; Iron </em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1836560/Aether__Iron/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC via Steam</a>. The game launches on March 31st.
