            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Modiphius has announced a new campaign book for their WWII pulp action TTRPG. <em>Achtung Cthulhu The Norway Projekt</em> continues the war between the Allies and the Axis powers, with the latter delving into dark occult works, shifting the venue to the icy regions of Norway.</p>

<h2>The Achtung Cthulhu The Norway Projekt Pre-Order Announcement</h2>

<p><em>Achtung Cthulhu The Norway Projekt</em> is a 156-page hardcover campaign book. The campaign is divided into three parts and features nine linked missions across the Norwegian front of the game's alternate history of WWII. The campaign builds on Modiphius' 2d20 RPG system, which has powered other TTRPGs such as <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/fallout-royal-flush-ttrpg-adventure-set-in-new-vegas-is-now-available-for-pre-order" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Fallout</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dishonored-role-playing-game-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dishonored</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/modiphius-announces-star-trek-adventures-second-edition-starter-sets-now-available" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Star Trek Adventures</em></a>.</p>

The Nazis are desperate to turn to the tide of the war and look to developing atomic weapons. To prevent this, the Allies launch Operation: Grouse, Freshman, and Gunnerside, where they race to prevent the Axis from acquiring the Norwegian heavy water plant at Vemork.</p>

<p>But, since this is <em>Achtung Cthulhu</em>, the threat of nuclear devastation isn't the only danger to contend with. Enter the little-known Norwegian cult the Flokk of the Allfather, whose arcane knowledge may provide a darker, and faster, source of atomic power than conventional science.</p>

<p>The mission is a race against the clock where the players must rescue resistance fighters, uncover a vast conspiracy threatening to rain atomic fire on Allied cities, and fighting tooth and nail against horrors beyond mortal ken such as the Daemon Sultan Azathoth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“We’re delighted to finally give fans a chance to get their hands on The Norway Projekt. If you’re looking to take your agents on an epic campaign through the coldest of fronts, with a chance to foil eldritch cults, battle Nazi super science and change the course of the Secret War, then this will be a perfect addition to your collection!’ - Achtung Cthulhu Line Editor John Houlihan</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Achtung Cthulhu The Norway Projekt</em> is available for pre-order now on Modiphius' store at an MSRP of $55. The book is expected to ship January 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has revealed that&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>has enjoyed the franchise's biggest launch to date, having sold over seven million copies since launching last week.</p>

<p>In a press release, EA says that the latest entry in the long-running first-person shooter series "hit all-time highs for franchise sales during the first three days of launch", confirming the aforementioned sales figure, as well as the game's "172 million matches played online" <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-6-revealed-release-date-october-maybe" rel="nofollow">in that weekend</a>.</p>

<p><em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>franchise general manager Byron Beede says this is "just the beginning" for the game, with the first season just twelve days away. For his part, executive VP Vince Zampella expresses his "sincere gratitude" to&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>fans while also looking forward to what's to come "in the weeks ahead".</p>

The fact that the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-6-no-80-pricing" rel="nofollow">won't cost you $80</a>, remaining instead at a far more sensible $70, probably doesn't hurt to begin with.</p>

<p>There has also been a growing discontent with&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>and its range of colorful skins from various different franchises. In the run-up to&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>'s launch, EA promised that the cosmetics it sold for&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>would be more <a href="https://www.dbltap.com/news/battlefield-6-will-avoid-goofy-crossover-skins" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sober and realistic</a> than those of its closest competitor.</p>

<p><em>Battlefield 6</em> has also received pretty positive reviews across the board, averaging 83 on Metacritic on both <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/battlefield-6/critic-reviews/?platform=playstation-5" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a> and <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/battlefield-6/critic-reviews/?platform=pc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> (and 86 on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/battlefield-6/critic-reviews/?platform=xbox-series-x" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, where EA <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-6-xbox-series-s-development" rel="nofollow">put in a little extra effort</a> to ensure the game ran smoothly).</p>

<p>Whatever the case may be, it looks like Activision will have to step up its game for the next major&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>release if it wants to compete with a resurgent&nbsp;<em>Battlefield</em>.</p>
