            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Upcoming Viking tactics RPG <em>Norse: Oath of Blood </em>has been delayed on both PC and consoles, and while PC players won't have to wait too much longer to check the game out, it'll be a bit of a longer delay for PS5 and Xbox.</p><p>Originally set to launch on February 3rd, <em>Norse: Oath of Blood </em>will now be arriving on February 17th on Steam, Epic, and GOG, which represents a delay of just two weeks. That's not too bad, if you ask me.</p><p>The PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions of the game were initially due to arrive alongside the PC launch, but that's no longer happening; instead, console players will have to wait until spring to check out <em>Norse: Oath of Blood</em>.</p><figure role="group">

<p>Arctic Hazard explains the delay <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/norsegame.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">over on Bluesky</a>, but it's a fairly standard explanation; the devs need more time to "further refine and polish the experience" of <em>Norse: Oath of Blood </em>so that it reflects the studio's "passion for the source material".</p><p>Although the game is being delayed, Arctic Hazard and Tripwire are promising new developer diaries in the coming weeks, which will include "behind-the-scenes looks at development, deeper dives into gameplay, and additional updates".</p><p>If you're not familiar with <em>Norse: Oath of Blood</em>, it's a gritty tactical RPG that emphasizes down-to-earth realism in a way that I suspect <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/wartales" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fe4a9aa9-b171-4bf8-a97d-e538c2805501" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Wartales</em></a><em> </em>fans will appreciate.</p><p>You play as a young Viking called Gunnar (because of course he is), who's out for vengeance after his home is destroyed by the intimidating-sounding Steinarr Far-Spear. You must build a settlement from scratch, training warriors and assigning villagers as you go.</p>
<p><em>Norse: Oath of Blood </em>will be launching on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3054690/NORSE_Oath_of_Blood/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/norse_oath_of_blood" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GOG</a>, and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/norse-d7df8c" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Epic</a> on February 17th, and it'll be arriving on <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10014665" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/norse-oath-of-blood/9ndrfjpjfx5x" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a> at some point this spring.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On a scale of one to ten, how desperate would you say you are to try out <em>Heavy Rain </em>studio Quantic Dream's new multiplayer action-strategy game <em>Spellcasters Chronicles</em>? Well, it's launching in February, at any rate.</p><p>Per a press release, <em>Spellcasters Chronicles</em>' Early Access period starts on February 26th, but before that date rolls around, there's a second closed beta to participate in should you wish to. That kicks off on January 29th and comes to an end on February 2nd.</p><p>As for what you can expect from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/quantic-dream-competitive-multiplayer-game" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bedfa7a4-f771-4828-a192-0f8c25580a6a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">competitive multiplayer title</a>'s second beta, Quantic Dream says the game will come complete with "a range of new content and technical improvements", including a new map and more.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Spellcasters Chronicles</em>' second beta, as well as its Early Access launch, will be along soon.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The new map is The Nordic Shore, a five-lane arena with "open sightlines, harsh environmental conditions, and a unique pattern" for players to get to grips with.</p><p>It's joined by a new in-game intro and tutorial to help new players get into <em>Spellcasters Chronicles</em>, as well as in-game text chat for teams, a player reporting system (for such a thing must come alongside text chat), and customization for spellcasters.</p><p>Of course, since there is now customization, there must also be microtransactions, and so this update is also introducing a range of cosmetic packs you can buy, with costs ranging from $8.99 to a slightly alarming $69.99.</p><p>Quantic Dream has also altered the system specs for <em>Spellcasters Chronicles </em>for this beta. Revised specs are as follows.</p><h3>Minimum</h3><ul><li data-list-item-id="eeb3a782e487e3110098c63fb25ed9a96">CPU: Intel Core i5-10400 or AMD Ryzen 5 2600</li><li data-list-item-id="e55f07f09d07039d8ef08064511115ebd">GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070 or AMD Radeon RX 5700</li><li data-list-item-id="eb02ca3e7fe7c53c726a169e2f41d5a06">16GB RAM, NVMe SSD, Windows 11</li></ul><h3>Recommended</h3><ul><li data-list-item-id="e671ad249f3b9c2b4956c4b95dded54a1">CPU: Intel Core i7-10700K or AMD Ryzen 7 2700</li><li data-list-item-id="ec4172b3af1465a1f60d7d12f6053762f">GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 or AMD Radeon RX 9060 XT</li><li data-list-item-id="e563b3b634cad9c84027fa2e6cade7c10">16GB RAM, NVMe SSD, Windows 11</li></ul>
<p>As for Quantic Dream's other project, <em>Star Wars Eclipse</em>, there's still no news, unfortunately, although Quantic Dream did apparently manage to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/quantic-dream-unaffected-netease-layoffs" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="443866cd-9f19-4b01-9659-841beff2381f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">escape the recent NetEase employee and studio purge</a>, so that's something, at least.</p><p><em>Spellcasters Chronicles </em>launches in Early Access on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2458470/Spellcasters_Chronicles/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow">PC via Steam</a> on February 26th.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Fabraz and publisher Atari have revealed the <em>Bubsy 4D </em>release date, so if you think everyone's (least?) favorite bobcat deserves one more shot, then it's nearly time to put your money where your mouth is.</p><p>As revealed by Atari <a href="https://x.com/atari/status/2014345190346011105" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">on social media</a>, <em>Bubsy 4D </em>will be arriving on PC and consoles on May 22nd, and if, for some reason, you'd like to pre-order the game, you can do so now on your platform of choice.</p><p>It's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bubsy-bobcat-makes-his-grand-return-for-some-reason" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="db3d0244-1ad5-4c64-ad19-5f7ed0f148aa" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">no secret</a> that <em>Bubsy </em>games <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/bubsy-woolies-strike-back-review-bubsy-is-still-bad" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ef96e2fa-8978-4a24-b83d-f084a4633ecc" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">aren't exactly well-received</a> by and large, but Fabraz, whose name you might recognize from 3D platformer <em>Demon Turf </em>and 2D offering <em>Slime-san</em>, is hoping it can change all that.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Could <em>Bubsy 4D </em>finally be the game to turn the franchise around?</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This time around, Bubsy is making a return to 3D, which feels like a pretty ballsy move given how things went for the bobcat's last excursion into the third dimension.</p><p>As you'd probably expect (and as is probably necessary given <em>Bubsy</em>'s history), <em>Bubsy 4D </em>is taking a self-aware approach; Bubsy himself is returning to the fold after a long absence, and characters around him frequently question whether he's up to the job.</p><p>The game itself is a fairly straightforward 3D collectathon platformer in which Bubsy must navigate a series of "expansive craft-themed levels" and do battle with vicious BaaBots in order to recover his beloved Golden Fleece.</p><p>You can check out the new release date announcement trailer for <em>Bubsy 4D </em>right here. It gives a sense of what kind of gameplay you can expect if you decide to humor the bobcat one last time.</p>
<p>I've been talking smack about <em>Bubsy </em>for this whole piece, but I won't lie: I'm actually rooting for Fabraz and Atari on this one, because I played the <em>Bubsy 4D </em>demo, and it's...well, it's quite fun. Don't tell anyone I said that.</p><p>In any case, <em>Bubsy 4D </em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3237970/Bubsy_4D/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10016621" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/bubsy-4d/9P82VZJSZWGS" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox</a>, and both Switch 2 and Switch on May 22nd. Stay tuned to find out whether it's actually decent like the demo.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
