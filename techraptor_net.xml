  </picture><h2>Third Place - Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</h2><p>Developer: Kojima Productions | Release Date: June 26th, 2025</p><p>Written by Robert Scarpinito</p><p><em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em> features a pretty eclectic soundtrack, mixing some cinematic orchestra scores with what I like to call "sadboi" music (gender neutral). The more contemporary, personal tracks from Woodkid juxtapose nicely with the grand scale that Ludvig Forssell brings to the soundscape, which reflects the overall vibe of the game pretty well.</p><p>Forssell's scores feels like something out of a movie, where each track really fits the scene or character it's used for. "Higgs" is eerie, menacing, and just a little off-kilter, using violins, a choir, and an electric guitar later (which is deeply funny).</p><p>Conversely, "Neil Vana" feels simultaneously hopeful as it does tragic, mirroring his overall character arc. And if you're looking for bombastic epic action set pieces, Forssell delivers in songs like "One Last Fight" and "Good Old Fashioned Boss Fight."</p><p>Woodkid brings a different energy to <em>Death Stranding 2</em>, filling the space that Low Roar occupied in the prequel. If Forssell perfectly fit the cutscenes and the action gameplay, Woodkid was the soundtrack to everything else. You'll spend hours roaming the landscape of Australia, and when you finally crest that hill or cross that canyon as the rain lets up, the soothing tones of Woodkid's relaxed vibe feels like the perfect reward as you cruise to your destination.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Second Place - Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</h2><p>Developer: Sandfall Interactive | Release Date: April 24th, 2025</p><p>Written by Robert Scarpinito</p><p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>'s soundtrack is as pretty as it is depressing. It's tragic and operatic, opting for soaring strings and pensive pianos to underscore a lone woman's voice for many songs.</p><p>"Lumiére" sets the tone very well for the early part of the game, underscoring this melancholic scene as people dissolve into nothingness. There's a bustling movement to the melody that brings the city to life a bit, but the timbre of singer Alice Duport-Percier's voice carries more sorrow than it does joy.</p><p>When it comes to fights and action though, <em>Clair Obscur</em> brings in thunderous drums, triumphant horns, a powerful choir, and some electric oomph carry the energy. The songs "Paintress" and "Une vie à peindre" both play at pivotal boss fights in the second half of the game, and their energy ups the stakes while providing moments of solemn contemplation. Even better, they're fitting for what those boss fights symbolize in the story, too.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Winner - Hades II</h2><p>Developer: Supergiant Games | Release Date: September 25th, 2025</p><p>Written by Robert Scarpinito</p><p>Once again, Darren Korb spearheads a fantastic soundtrack for Supergiant Games.<em> Hades II </em>feels both familiar and fresh, building on its predecessor while carving out a unique sound for itself. In some ways, this soundtrack comes off like an alternate-universe version of the one we heard with Zagreus.</p><p>Much like the previous game, many tracks come with two sort of "modes," the second of which tends to amp things up with more gain and a harder energy. It's what you hear when you find a room with a guardian, making each level's songs flexibly switch between exploration and serious combat.</p><p>Where <em>Hades II</em> really differs, however, is how its music is both familiar but eerily different. Occasional hits of glitchy sounds and extra distortion punctuate familiar melodies, delivering on the idea that Melinoe is returning to a home she never had.</p><p>Time-like motifs also come through in the music, as you might expect for a game all about killing Chronos. You'll hear the use of bells throughout the soundtrack, which evokes a feeling of nostalgia and longing for a time gone past. Additionally, in the song "The Titan of Time," you hear what sounds like a clock ticking throughout the track, perfect for while you're fighting time itself.</p><p>And of course, it's hard to talk about the music in <em>Hades II </em>without mentioning Scylla and the Sirens, the bosses who play the boss fight music as you cut them down one by one. When you knock one down, their respective part in the song stops until they're all down. It's a clever way to make the music feel like part of the world, and it's only made better by the fact there isn't a single bad track on the OST.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
