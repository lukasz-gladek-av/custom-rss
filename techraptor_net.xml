<p>In a developer livestream held earlier today (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/the-first-descendant-ending-support-for-last-gen-consoles/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">TheGamer</a>), Nexon revealed that the PS4 and Xbox One versions of&nbsp;<em>The First Descendant&nbsp;</em>will be shutting down on June 19th, which, as TheGamer points out, is two weeks before the first anniversary of the game's original release.</p>

<p>Nexon says that because the scale of&nbsp;<em>The First Descendant&nbsp;</em>has "increased" since release, the team is spending "a lot of effort and difficulty" keeping the PS4 and Xbox One versions of the game afloat.</p>

<p>Not only is the game being removed from Sony and Microsoft's last-gen platforms, but you won't be able to continue playing it on those platforms after June 19th, even if you have it downloaded on your system.</p>

<p>However, if you do plan to upgrade to a next-gen console, you'll be pleased to know that&nbsp;<em>The First Descendant&nbsp;</em>supports cross-saves, so you'll be able to pick up where you left off if you play on PS5 or Xbox Series X|S.</p>

<p><em>The First Descendant&nbsp;</em>launched to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2074920/charts/#max" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">extremely strong Steam player numbers</a> back in July, but the player count has significantly dwindled since then, with around 8,000 players checking out the game in the last 24 hours. That's not nothing, of course, but it's a far cry from the 264,860 players the game attracted at its peak.</p>




<p>Since launch,&nbsp;<em>The First Descendant&nbsp;</em>has received a number of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-descendant-update-new-boss-descendants" rel="nofollow">updates</a>, with new bosses, characters, and other goodies being added to the looter-shooter. The latest update adds the valkyrie-esque Serena to the game's roster, as well as new areas, a new weapon, and more.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>The First Descendant&nbsp;</em>right now for free on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2074920/The_First_Descendant/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/the-first-descendant/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/the-first-descendant/9p8fbxkmclwc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>. If you're planning to play on consoles, though, I'd plump for the PS5 or the Xbox Series X|S if I were you.</p>
