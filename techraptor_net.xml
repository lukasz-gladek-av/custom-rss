            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you're a <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> PC player and you're sick of the game's poor performance on your rig, Capcom may have the answer to your prayers, and the studio has confirmed an enterprising player's theory about the source of some of the issues as well.</p><p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2246340/view/526492547790405650" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">news post</a> on Steam, Capcom says it's released a patch for <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>that includes "optimization improvements for Steam-specific processes and options to reduce processing load", so your machine should have an easier time running the game now.</p><p>Capcom points to a CPU load issue caused by "claimed content status check processes" intended to notify players if unclaimed content is waiting for them, which confirms the results of an experiment performed by a <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>player <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-poor-pc-performance-dlc-check-report" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="22239c1b-456a-474c-ab0c-9209f9d66e0c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">earlier this month</a>.</p><p>According to Capcom, this problem should only cause <em>Wilds</em>' FPS to drop "in the Base Camp and Grand Hub", and how much DLC you own doesn't matter; if you have any unclaimed DLC at all, you may run into the issue.</p><p>More improvements and optimizations are planned for <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, too; in February, another patch will arrive that aims to "reduce GPU processing load by adding quality levels (LOD) to the polygon mesh for 3D models".</p><p>In case you're wondering, LOD stands for "level of detail", and, as you can imagine, it refers to the amount of complexity in the detail of 3D models for characters and other assets.</p><p>Remarkably, Capcom says this solution would involve "swapping to low-resolution models for objects farther away from the camera", which implies that <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>doesn't already do this. That would probably go some way towards explaining some of the FPS issues experienced by PC players. Yikes.</p>
<p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>is available now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/monster-hunter-wilds/9NMT6XFN0LVD" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and its latest update can be downloaded right now on PC.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Retro-style brawler <em>Scott Pilgrim EX </em>now has a release date, developer and publisher Tribute Games has announced, and the studio has also revealed two more fighters joining the side-scroller's roster.</p><p>According to a new official trailer, <em>Scott Pilgrim EX </em>will be arriving across PC and consoles on March 3rd, and what's more, two erstwhile foes, Matthew Patel and Robot-01, will be available to play as if you're looking for allies.</p><p>They'll join a roster that also includes playable characters from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/scott-pilgrim-vs-world-game-complete-edition-launches-january-14" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="58de8c13-490f-4d7e-9d00-eb4a7768921a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Scott Pilgrim vs. the World: The Game</em></a>, like Scott himself and Ramona Flowers, although iconic characters like Knives Chau and Wallace Weldon won't be playable in the game.</p><p>If you're not familiar with <em>Scott Pilgrim EX</em>, it's a brand new side-scrolling beat-'em-up from <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-shredders-revenge" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="0e3ecb91-e301-4ac1-ab70-91478adfdd1a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge</em></a><em> </em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-cosmic-invasion-release-date" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3239c132-009d-45e4-bbaa-cf2539d52c49" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em></a><em> </em>studio Tribute Games.</p><p>Although the name might suggest otherwise, <em>Scott Pilgrim EX </em>isn't an expanded re-release of Ubisoft's rather excellent 2010 side-scroller <em>Scott Pilgrim vs. the World: The Game</em>; instead, it's a completely new title, and it boasts an all-new story penned by series creator Bryan Lee O'Malley.</p><p>Gameplay-wise, as you've probably come to expect from Tribute Games, you can expect chaotic pixel-based side-scrolling action, with screens full of enemies to defeat and retro art to enjoy, plus tons of classic video game references.</p><p>Not only that, but each playthrough allows you to collect and spend coins to upgrade your characters and equip special items, leading to the potential for "a unique build for every playthrough", as Tribute tells it.</p><p>You can check out the new release date trailer for <em>Scott Pilgrim EX</em>, which also shows off Matthew Patel and Robot-01, right here.</p>
<p><em>Scott Pilgrim EX </em>is set to arrive on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2640950/Scott_Pilgrim_EX/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10014026" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/scott-pilgrim-ex/9p8rfn5p0423" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/scott-pilgrim-ex-switch/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch</a> on March 3rd.
