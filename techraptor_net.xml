            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/warhammer-40k-space-wolves-army-set-preview-awoooo<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The grimdark future of <i>Warhammer 40,000</i> is constantly evolving, and with each new edition comes the promise of refreshed armies and new tactical opportunities. For the Sons of Fenris, that promise is finally being delivered with the highly anticipated Space Wolves Army Set and Space Wolves Codex Supplement. Packing brand-new sculpts, the essential new Codex, and a suite of datacards designed to get you howling into battle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We’ve recently covered army sets from the warp with our reviews of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-40k-world-eaters-gorestorm-slaughterpack-review-gory-goodness" rel="nofollow">World Eaters Army Set</a> and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-40k-death-guard-poxwrought-vector-review-so-sick" rel="nofollow">Death Guard Army Set</a>, so join us now as we take a sneak peek at this massive army set release.</p>

<h2><b>Space Wolves Army Set - Special Edition Codex</b></h2>

<p>I really like the look of the Codex, and reading through it we get, as usual, a really great and extensive dive into the lore of this Chapter. From the start of the chapter on the death world of Fenris, to detailing how this Chapter battles with the ferocity of the wolves of their home planet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There’s also an extensive section in the lore describing the heraldry of the Chapter, as well as how each of the different “packs” of warriors (like the Blood Claws and Grey Hunters, which we’ll speak to in a moment). Finally, the Codex includes all the rules you need to play, including how Sagas work for this Chapter.</p>

<p>Now let’s take a Quick Look at the individual units included in this Army Set!</p>



<p>The new Space Wolves Army Set comes with five units all ready to hit the battlefield (after some assembly, of course) and fight until the Wolftime dawns! As opposed to one of our more in-depth reviews where we break down all the stats, for this Army Set preview I really want to just take a Quick Look at what makes each unit feel different from one another and special.</p>

<h3><b>Wolf Guard Battle Leader</b></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-space-wolves-wolf-guard-battle-leader.jpg?itok=RPNs3_Vt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-space-wolves-wolf-guard-battle-leader.jpg?itok=X6xvQBgY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Let’s start with the Wolf Guard Battle Leader - veterans of battle and some of the bravest warriors in the army. What makes this unit most unique is how customizable it is. You can choose from an array of melee weapons (a power weapon or a thunder hammer) and ranged options (Carbine, heavy bolt, or plasma pistol), and as a leader you can attach this unit to Blood Claws, Grey Hunters, or Wolf Guard Headtakers.</p>

<p>When you set them up as a leader, you give their unit the Sustained Hits 1 keyword and let them re-roll 1’s when you’re attacking within 6 inches. Not bad for a melee-happy Chapter like the wolves!</p>

<h3><b>Wolf Priest</b></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-space-wolves-wolf-priest.jpg?itok=TtWVfNLJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-space-wolves-wolf-priest.jpg?itok=V0r4gklv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Next up is the Wolf Priest, the physical and spiritual leader of the group. And while they’re outfitted with decent weaponry, their abilities truly make the Wolf Priest an extreme standout.</p>

<p>You can attach them to Blood Claws, Grey Hunters, or Wolf Guard Headtakers, and as they act as leaders you’ll get two special abilities. First, you’ve got the Litany of Hate ability, which says if the Priest is leading a unit they add 1 to wound rolls.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But the real prize here, and what makes the Wolf Priest stand out, is the Healing Balms ability, which says “While this model is leading a unit, in your Command phase, you can return 1 destroyed model (excluding Character models) to that unit.” That’s not a once-per-battle thing, which is huge!</p>

<h3><b>Wolf Guard Headtakers</b></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-space-wolves-wolf-guard-headtakers.jpg?itok=UtiqqE40 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-space-wolves-wolf-guard-headtakers.jpg?itok=JGQ1VlUm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The Wolf Guard Headtakers are tasked with breaking through enemy lines and taking down important figures in the enemy camp. To do that, they’re joined by their ferocious Hunting Wolves!</p>

<p>What makes this unit special is that, at the start of your deploy units phase, you actually split this unit up into two units - one for the marines and the other for the wolves! This unit can also can name one enemy unit as their quarry which gives the marine models in this unit Devastating Wounds and Precision keywords tied to attacking their quarry!</p>

<h3><b>Grey Hunters and Blood Claws</b></h3>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-space-wolves-blood-claws.jpg?itok=NCnjymrg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-space-wolves-blood-claws.jpg?itok=HU7kOajz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Space Wolves Blood Claws</figcaption></figure><p>Blood Claws are the youngest members of the Chapter, hungry to prove themselves in savage battle. Contrasting that are the Grey Hunters, who are older, more mature, and patient marines. These are two different units, but they each only have one thing making them each stand out - beyond the impressive weaponry of your standard space marine.</p>

<p>For the Blood Claws, their fiery and impatient nature is brought to life via their Berserk Charge ability, which let’s them charge in the same turn it Advanced, meaning these marines can cover some serious ground.</p>

<p>For the Grey Hunters, their stalking nature is portrayed in the Cunning Hunters ability, which let’s them re-roll Wound rolls of 1 and, if they’re within range of an object marker, the ability is upgraded to allow them to re-roll all Wound rolls.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-space-wolves-gray-pack.jpg?itok=nzLq0QHV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-space-wolves-gray-pack.jpg?itok=Kldmcjxt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Space Wolves Gray Pack</figcaption></figure><p>Along with the Codex, Codex Cards - which do a great job of making it super easy to keep track of your units - and the models, this feels like a very solid offering, and similar to other Space Marine Army Boxes we’ve seen since the launch of 10th. I’ve got some playtesting to do with these models, but on first look - I think you could use this box as the start of an extremely aggressive Force!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/games-workshop-reports-strong-profits-hands-out-ps20-million-to-staff<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Employees at Games Workshop are getting a pay bonus. Despite the tabletop industry being highly volatile due to reckless <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/adjusted-us-trade-tariffs-to-china-still-poses-problems-to-board-game-industry" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">trade tariffs</a> disrupting trade and imports, the UK-based studio has reported growth. Growth that will be given to its staff.</p>

<h2>The Games Workshop Windfall</h2>

<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/warhammer-games-workshop-staff-payout-b2756495.html" rel="nofollow">The Independent</a>, Games Workshop will be distributing bonus payments to its staff drawn from profits. These bonus payments will be distributed on an equal basis to each member of the staff. The studio, most well-known for <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer: 40,000 </em></a>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-age-of-sigmar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer: Age of Sigmar</em></a>, stated the payout was in recognition of its employees' contributions to financial performance.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-promo-artwork.jpg?itok=QoeV3s9Y 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-promo-artwork.jpg?itok=SlKjeshh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>That performance has led to a £20 million windfall for the company, demonstrating strong sales and growth. This is a notable increase from last year, which saw £18 million shared among the staff for stellar performance. Considering other tabletop studios have either shut down or have filed lawsuits in response to current events, this report of growth is unexpected.</p>

<p>As for how much that&nbsp;£20 million will break down among the Games Workshop staff, that is harder to parse. GW doesn't disclose how many employees they have, but it is believed they have 1,500 employees in their home base in Nottingham. Assuming that number is correct, that would mean each employee may be getting about £13k in pay bonuses.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition, the staff number cited doesn't take into account global employees, either in offices outside the UK or working online.</p>

<p>A major factor in Games Workshop's growth are its licensed video games. These include ongoing support for Owlcat Games' RPG <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader</em></a> and Saber Interactive's <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/space-marine-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</em></a>. This is in addition to strong sales and ongoing support for the company's many tabletop miniatures games.</p>

<p>The growth of Games Workshop may not be slowing down anytime soon. The company has <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/amazon-warhammer-40000-film-contract-signed-production-can-now-begin" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">partnered with Amazon</a> and Vertigo Entertainment to produce official movies and TV shows set within the grimdark sci-fi world of <em>Warhammer 40,000</em>. Better still, the production has the star power of Henry Cavill on board.</p>
