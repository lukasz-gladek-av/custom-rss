            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/disco-elysium-mobile-version-announced-to-captivate-the-tiktok-user.1133646/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/disco-elysium-mobile-version-tiktok-user<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>ZA/UM has announced a mobile version of cult hit RPG&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>, and the studio's head Denis Havel says the intent behind the game's reimagined mobile adaptation is to "captivate the TikTok user".</p>

<p>As revealed by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/official-disco-elysium-mobile-version-announced-zaum-calls-it-a-fun-on-the-go-alternative-aimed-at-tiktok-users" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">IGN</a>, ZA/UM wants to both attract new players to&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>and provide a "fun, on-the-go alternative" for those who've already experienced the game in its current PC and console form. The mobile version will, however, be exclusive to Android devices. Sorry, iOS users.</p>

<p>The first two chapters of&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>on Android will be released for free, ZA/UM says, and you'll be able to experience the rest of the game for a single one-off payment, so at least you won't have to buy each chapter one by one.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disco-elysium-mobile-revealed-measurehead.jpg?itok=gWC6eiaH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disco-elysium-mobile-revealed-measurehead.jpg?itok=gVMCjqoJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Have you ever wanted to play&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>on your phone? Well, now you can.</figcaption></figure><p>Perhaps a little defensively, ZA/UM says its current staff comprises "both creators and custodians of the&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>IP", and that this will be "evident in the&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>mobile experience" the studio is creating.</p>

<p>Worryingly, however, studio head Denis Havel then says the goal is to "captivate the TikTok user with quick hits of compelling story, art, and audio". He says he believes this will create an "all-new, deeply engaging form of entertainment".</p>

<p>I can't honestly say I think the&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>experience will be significantly improved by playing the game on your tiny smartphone screen, nor do I think the train or a long car journey are the best places to experience Harry DuBois' descent into (or ascent out of) madness. Still, that's corporations for you, I guess.</p>

<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>on Android devices right here.</p>




<p>This is the second major announcement ZA/UM has made this week. Just a couple of days ago, the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zaum-project-c4-disco-elysium" rel="nofollow">revealed a new "genre-defining" RPG</a> it's currently calling&nbsp;<em>Project C4</em>, although details on that project are scant right now.</p>

<p>It is also worth bearing in mind that although ZA/UM makes noises about being "custodians" of&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>, many of the game's original creators are no longer at the studio due to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-wild-story-behind-disco-elysiums-spiritual-successors-allegations-legal-threats-and-a-usb-stick" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a huge falling-out</a> that carried both cultural and legal ramifications for all concerned.</p>

<p>Several of the original folks behind&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>have, however, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-disco-elysium-devs-new-studios-spiritual-successors" rel="nofollow">announced their own projects</a>, and if I were you, I'd be keeping my eye on those over the mobile version of&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>. Still, who knows? Maybe it'll be great. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo San Francisco Store to Open in May]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-san-francisco-store-may</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-san-francisco-store-to-open-in-may.1133643/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-san-francisco-store-may<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced that its planned San Francisco store will be opening on May 15th, thus becoming the company's second major US outlet alongside the flagship store in New York.</p>

<p>Revealing the store's opening date in a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/nintendo-san-francisco-celebrates-grand-opening-may-15/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a>, Nintendo says its new store will offer "game systems and games" as well as "accessories, apparel, home goods and souvenirs" that you'll only be able to buy from the San Francisco store.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/retail-locations/san-francisco/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">FAQ</a> for its new store, Nintendo says "reservations will be required for entry", although it's likely the company is specifically referring to the San Francisco location's grand opening; you probably won't need to reserve a spot just to visit the shop itself once it's open.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-san-francisco-store-new-york.jpg?itok=Kbfov85a 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-san-francisco-store-new-york.jpg?itok=wKskSoSy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nintendo's San Francisco store is due to open in May, and it'll probably resemble the New York store in terms of layout.</figcaption></figure><p>The store will be located on Powell Street in Union Square, and Nintendo says you'll be able to reach it easily via bus or cable car.</p>

<p>If you do want to attend the Nintendo San Francisco store's grand opening, you will need a reservation, but you can't get one just yet; Nintendo says more details will be available "soon", so keep an eye out if you'll be in the area in May and you want to go.</p>

<p>Additionally, Nintendo says that the SF store won't be offering online or phone sales, so if you want some of the exclusive stuff from that store, you'll have to visit physically to get it. Hey, that'll hopefully make the trip feel more special!</p>

<p>As with the New York store, Nintendo says it won't be offering spare parts for your consoles, nor can you go to the San Francisco store to have your Nintendo stuff repaired. Bear that in mind if you're looking to have your Switch screen replaced.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-san-francisco-store-new-york-display.jpg?itok=nvcYEttU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-san-francisco-store-new-york-display.jpg?itok=pDmfWVSZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hopefully, the Nintendo San Francisco store will have some cool displays like this one.</figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo is holding a sweepstakes right now to give you and "up to two guests" the chance to attend the San Francisco store's grand opening. You can see how to enter that <a href="https://my.nintendo.com/rewards/0347dfdfd78e4195?_gl=1*16k8vxz*_gcl_au*MTM3OTk4MDk2NC4xNzM4MjQzNDgy*_ga*MTM3MjQzMjg0OS4xNzMwMjExNzQ3*_ga_F6ERC4HMNZ*MTc0MTg4MDM1NC4xNy4xLjE3NDE4ODE4MjkuMC4wLjA." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>.</p>

<p>In other Nintendo news, the gaming giant is currently gearing up to release the Switch's hotly-anticipated successor sometime this year. The console will be revealed in full during a Nintendo Direct presentation <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">next month</a>, so stay tuned for more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Split Fiction Sales Reach 2m in Just One Week]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-sales-2m</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/split-fiction-sales-reach-2m-in-just-one-week.1133595/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-sales-2m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA and Hazelight Studios have announced that sales of their genre-hopping co-op platformer&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>have hit another big milestone just a single week after the game's initial launch.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hazelightgames.bsky.social/post/3lkbeztsqbs2b" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on social media platform Bluesky,&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>has managed to break the two million sales barrier, a feat the studio describes as "simply amazing". Hazelight also thanks "all of [its] new and old fans", describing itself as "blown away" by the milestone.</p>

<p>As a quick reminder,&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-sales-1m-48-hours" rel="nofollow">hit one million</a> within the game's first 48 hours on sale, which means the game has picked up another million sales for itself in the interim. This one looks like it's going to run and run.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/split-fiction-sales-2m-combat.jpg?itok=xMxZU07h 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/split-fiction-sales-2m-combat.jpg?itok=qFZjcNvj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>sales have hit another milestone, which will be good news for EA and Hazelight.</figcaption></figure><p>It took&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>'s predecessor&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two&nbsp;</em><a href="https://x.com/HazelightGames/status/1405499693438808064" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">almost four months</a> to reach the same milestone, so it's clear&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>is continuing to strike a chord with players, perhaps because of&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two</em>'s positive reputation.</p>

<p>Again, as a reminder,&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two&nbsp;</em>went on to sell <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hazelight-josef-fares-new-ip-it-takes-two-sales" rel="nofollow">over 20 million copies at last count</a>, so it's not unrealistic to imagine that&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>might do even better than that over the next couple of years.</p>

<p><em>Split Fiction</em>'s performance also throws into sharp relief EA's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-the-veilguard-shared-world-elements" rel="nofollow">apparent suggestion</a> that recent flop&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>didn't do well because it lacked "shared world elements"; after all, Hazelight's latest isn't a live-service game, but it's already sold <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-ea-sports-fc-25-underperformed" rel="nofollow">more than&nbsp;<em>Veilguard&nbsp;</em>did</a> within its first three months on sale.</p>

<p>Just in case you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>, it's a co-op action-adventure game from&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>A Way Out&nbsp;</em>developer Hazelight Studios, headed up by industry personality Josef Fares.</p>




<p>The game revolves around Mio and Zoe, two writers who must work together in order to escape a nefarious machine that wants to drain them of their ideas. Like the aforementioned games, it's co-op only, so grab a friend or partner for this one.</p>

<p><em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>is available to buy right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2001120/Split_Fiction/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/split-fiction/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/split-fiction/9N1WXXD1RL8D" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[PowerWash Simulator 2 Announced, Coming Later This Year]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/powerwash-simulator-2-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/powerwash-simulator-2-announced-coming-later-this-year.1133592/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/powerwash-simulator-2-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher FuturLab has announced&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em>, a followup to the popular 2022 work sim. It's coming to PC and current-gen consoles sometime later this year.</p>

<p>Unlike the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/powerwash-simulator" rel="nofollow">original game</a>,&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>will be a self-published affair; it is, after all, the studio's first new game since being snapped up by mobile and browser game giant Miniclip <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/miniclip-futurlab-acquisition" rel="nofollow">back in April last year</a>.</p>

<p>As you'd probably expect from a&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator&nbsp;</em>sequel,&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>will task you with cleaning a whole new set of environments. You'll be able to explore more of Muckingham, and a number of new locations will also be available to you in a brand new campaign.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/powerwash-simulator-2-cleaning.jpg?itok=NbY_6b1l 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/powerwash-simulator-2-cleaning.jpg?itok=KrNJ1b7w 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>is coming sometime this year.</figcaption></figure><p>When you're not cleaning, you can kick back and relax at your home base, which you can also fill with "furniture and trinkets" to make it a more homely place.</p>

<p>You'll also be able to share your campaign progress with another player online, but if you don't fancy playing together at a distance, you can also team up in split-screen co-op. It's not yet clear whether&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>will support crossplay.</p>

<p>Of course, some improvements have also been made to gameplay mechanics; FuturLab says you can expect "enhanced soap that clings to stubborn stains and annihilates dirt", making cleaning feel "even better" than in the game's predecessor.</p>

<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em>, which gives a sense of what the game will look and play like, right here. Of course, if you've played&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator</em>, you'll probably already know what to expect on that score.</p>




<p><em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>will launch for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2968420/PowerWash_Simulator_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S later this year.
