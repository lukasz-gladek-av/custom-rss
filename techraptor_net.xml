            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-sales-3m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Medieval colony sim&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>has crossed another big sales milestone, publisher Hooded Horse and developer Slavic Magic have revealed.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>has now hit three million sales across all of the PC storefronts on which it's available. That means the game has picked up another million sales for itself in the time between now and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-sales-two-million" rel="nofollow">May last year</a>.</p>

<p>Three million is a particularly impressive number when considering that&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>is available on Game Pass (as long as you're a PC Game Pass or Game Pass Ultimate member, at any rate; the console version isn't available via the service).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/manor-lords-sales-3m-village.jpg?itok=LTg9_RtJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/manor-lords-sales-3m-village.jpg?itok=URerxqwZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>has hit another big sales milestone.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>was originally released via Early Access in April 2024, quickly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-price-player-count" rel="nofollow">climbing the Steam charts</a> and passing 120,000 concurrent players within just a few hours of its release (again, impressive given it landed on Game Pass on day one as well).</p>

<p>Within just a few days, the game had managed to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-sales-player-count" rel="nofollow">surpass a million sales</a>, and it had broken the two million barrier inside three weeks. Naturally, sales have slowed since then, but amassing another million sales in less than a year is solid work.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>is, it's a medieval colony sim-come-city builder in which you must build and oversee your very own village (hence the title).</p>

<p>You'll be responsible for overseeing the game's "complex economic and social simulations", guiding your village and constructing different districts depending on what you need to grow and flourish.</p>




<p><em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>does have combat, but by its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-manor-lords-roadmap-yet" rel="nofollow">own developer's admission</a>, it's not intended to be a&nbsp;<em>Total War&nbsp;</em>competitor; it's a city builder with battles rather than a war simulator with city building.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>right now on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1363080/Manor_Lords/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/manor_lords" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/manor-lords-ef795f" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Epic</a>, and the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/manor-lords-game-preview/9p5f966564fs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Microsoft Store</a>, and it's also available on Xbox.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-patch-7-2-march</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-xiv-patch-7-2-set-to-bring-new-dungeon-and-more-in-march.1103319/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-patch-7-2-march<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has revealed the release window for&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>Patch 7.2, as well as the kind of content you can expect when the update rolls around.</p>

<p>Following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-patch-71-release-date" rel="nofollow">November's</a> Patch 7.1, the new patch, which launches in late March, largely represents business as usual for&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>patches, with one major exception.</p>

<p>Like previous patches, 7.2 will continue the main post-<em>Dawntrail&nbsp;</em>storyline, so if you've been keeping up with what happened after the events of that expansion, you'll appreciate what's being added. It'll also bring a brand new dungeon in the form of the Underkeep, which, in turn, will also bring new bosses to fight and new loot to collect.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-xiv-patch-7.2-pictomancer.jpg?itok=HU9L8Wpk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-xiv-patch-7.2-pictomancer.jpg?itok=ThM1TkDA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>Patch 7.2 launches in late March, Square Enix has confirmed.</figcaption></figure><p>The big new addition, however, comes with the introduction of the Occult Crescent, a new "large-scale battle-oriented duty" that represents&nbsp;<em>Dawntrail</em>'s version of <i>Shadowbringers</i>' Bozjan Southern Front or&nbsp;<em>Stormblood</em>'s Forbidden Land Eureka.</p>

<p>Much like those activities, the Occult Crescent will task large numbers of players with exploring its map, battling its inhabitants, and taking on a series of objectives to contribute to a larger-scale initiative. More information about the Occult Crescent will likely be released as we draw closer to Patch 7.2's release date.</p>

<p><em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>'s next patch will also introduce the next part of the eight-man Arcadion raid. The Cruiserweight tier will add four more encounters, and if you played the first part of the raid, you'll likely know roughly what to expect on this front.</p>

<p>A new Trial will also be added as part of the patch's story content, and you'll be able to take on a level 100 Unreal-difficulty version of the Suzaku Hells' Kier trial as well, so there's plenty of combat-oriented content to keep you busy.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake Outsold Expectations, Square Enix Says]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-outsold-expectations</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-outsold-expectations-square-enix-says.1103280/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-outsold-expectations<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It would appear the stars have aligned, because Square Enix has admitted that one of its games outsold its expectations, a fairly rare occurrence for a studio that seems to want a lot from its releases.</p>

<p>In its Q3 financial results <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/pdf/25q3release.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">release</a>, Square Enix says that while its numbers are down for the nine-month period between April and December 2024 when compared to the same period last year, the quarter itself saw operating income increase, largely due to&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remaster</em>.</p>

<p>The company says the JRPG remake achieved "stronger sales" than it had "initially assumed", helping to offset newer releases achieving lower sales than tentpole games like&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI&nbsp;</em>and the&nbsp;<em>Pixel Remaster&nbsp;</em>series.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-sales-battle.jpg?itok=eUQg7jM2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-sales-battle.jpg?itok=m2DDXHdX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake&nbsp;</em>did better than Square Enix expected it to.</figcaption></figure><p>Although Square Enix says its latest games haven't done as well as&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>, it's worth remembering the company also said that game, along with&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-16-rebirth-profits-square-enix" rel="nofollow">didn't meet its expectations</a>.</p>

<p>Square Enix hasn't shared how many sales either of those games achieved (nor, indeed, has it shared specific figures for&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake</em>), but the company has something of a reputation for expecting its games to achieve what some might call unrealistic sales figures.</p>

<p>Naturally, the company's nine-month period between April and September also benefited from the launch of&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>expansion&nbsp;<em>Dawntrail</em>, although that launch didn't stop net sales and operating income from falling for that period. Instead, it likely just softened the blow.</p>




<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake&nbsp;</em>is, well, the clue's in the name; it's a remake of classic JRPG&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest 3&nbsp;</em>using Square Enix's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/trademark-for-octopath-travelers-hd-2d-filed-by-square-enix" rel="nofollow">trademarked</a> HD-2D style, which combines nostalgic pixel art with chunky 3D.</p>

<p>You can check the game out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2701660/DRAGON_QUEST_III_HD2D_Remake/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/dragon-quest-iii/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake/9P5ZQNN9WRL2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> if you want to see what all the fuss is about.
