            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GSC Game World has released&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>Update 1.7, also known as "Expedition", and it's bringing a brand new difficulty mode with it, as well as further fixes and improvements for the A-Life system and much more.</p>

<p>The new Master difficulty mode is, as you'd probably expect, not for the faint of heart; GSC Game World describes it as a mode for "the most skilled players", and it brings "harsher conditions and limited saves", according to the developer.</p>

<p>Additionally, there's a brand new Expedition mode modifier that will introduce those conditions to any difficulty level, so if you feel like challenging yourself but don't want to commit to a Master run, the Expedition mode should allow you to do so.</p>

<p>New features for A-Life include the ability for factions to expand their territories, which means that&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>'s landscape is constantly shifting in terms of who's in charge of where. Factions will also defend their lands from hostile encroachment.</p>

<p>Additionally, it should now be a little easier to fight in a swamp; GSC Game World says&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>enemies will "have real problems detecting you in tall grass or reeds", and that their shots will be less accurate when they're shooting at you in these conditions as well.</p>

<p>If you'd like to see everything that's new as part of this update, you can check out the full&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>Update 1.7 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/596291616874954993" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">patch notes right here</a>.</p>




<p>This isn't the first time GSC Game World has found itself in the news over the last few days; the developer recently issued a DMCA claim to survival game&nbsp;<em>Misery</em>, although it looks like the issues raised therein have been ironed out now, since&nbsp;<em>Misery</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/misery-steam-return" rel="nofollow">returned to Steam last week</a>.</p>

<p><em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/stalker-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and it's also landing on <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10014084" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a> this week. You can check out our very own Robert's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/stalker-2-review" rel="nofollow">review of it here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and developer Ultizero Games have announced a major&nbsp;<em>Lost Soul Aside&nbsp;</em>update that's arriving tomorrow, and it's bringing a wave-based battle mode and a host of gameplay improvements with it.</p>

<p>As outlined in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/17/new-lost-soul-aside-update-out-tomorrow-includes-wave-based-surge-of-voidrax-mode/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation Blog post</a>, the new Surge of Voidrax mode pits you against 100 waves of enemies back-to-back. All of the main game's skills and weapons will be unlocked from the beginning in this mode.</p>

<p>Waves will consist of "classic bosses and diverse monsters", according to Ultizero Games, and you'll be able to refill your supplies and boost your power between each wave, thus helping you to prepare for what's to come.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lost-soul-aside-update-november-combat.jpg?itok=_c91wmg6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lost-soul-aside-update-november-combat.jpg?itok=D3CEkgXg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Lost Soul Aside&nbsp;</em>is getting a big free update tomorrow.</figcaption></figure><p>Clearing waves will grant you access to unique cosmetic rewards, and you'll get them upon clearing "specific waves for the first time", so you won't have to beat the entire mode to check out the new looks.</p>

<p>It's not just the Surge of Voidrax mode coming in this update, either. There are also a range of gameplay improvements and tweaks coming to&nbsp;<em>Lost Soul Aside&nbsp;</em>tomorrow, the first of which allows you to skip the game's prologue and jump straight into combat if you wish.</p>

<p>A new Voidrax Pathfinder system has been added to help you with "complex puzzles or challenges", too, so if you're stuck on some part of&nbsp;<em>Lost Soul Aside</em>, this sounds like it'll be for you. Let's hope <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/god-of-war-ragnarok-please-shut-up-mod" rel="nofollow">this isn't a&nbsp;<em>God of War Ragnarok&nbsp;</em>situation</a>, though.</p>

<p>You can also expect a range of new skins, "completely revamped" cutscenes with new animations and improved effects, and refined combat actions, as well as customizable controls. In short, tomorrow's update should hopefully give you a reason to jump back into&nbsp;<em>Lost Soul Aside&nbsp;</em>or to check it out for the first time.</p>




<p><em>Lost Soul Aside&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3378960/Lost_Soul_Aside/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/lost-soul-aside/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and its major Surge of Voidrax update launches for both platforms tomorrow.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Cities: Skylines 2 Developer Changes as Paradox Parts Ways With Colossal Order]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-colossal-order-iceflake-studios-paradox</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cities-skylines-2-developer-changes-as-paradox-parts-ways-with-colossal-order.1355779/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Cities: Skylines 2&nbsp;</em>publisher Paradox Interactive has announced that it's parted ways with the game's developer, Colossal Order, and that a new studio will be taking over ongoing development on the city-builder.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/an-update-on-cities-skylines-ii.1873154/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">update</a> on the game's official forum, Paradox says the decision for itself and Colossal Order to split was a mutual one, and that said decision was made "thoughtfully and in the interest of both teams" in order to ensure "the strongest possible future" for&nbsp;<em>Cities: Skylines</em>.</p>

<p>The new developer will be Iceflake Studios, whose name you may know from post-apocalyptic city-building sim&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/surviving-aftermath" rel="nofollow"><em>Surviving the Aftermath</em></a>. Paradox says Iceflake is already "hard at work getting into the nuts and bolts of&nbsp;<em>Cities: Skylines 2</em>".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cities-skylines-2-developer-changing-iceflake-studios-paradox.jpg?itok=nZiiJZde 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cities-skylines-2-developer-changing-iceflake-studios-paradox.jpg?itok=kN6w4ldz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Cities: Skylines 2&nbsp;</em>developer Colossal Order is moving on to other things.</figcaption></figure><p>Before Colossal Order departs&nbsp;<em>Cities: Skylines 2</em>, however, the developer will "implement a few additional updates", including the addition of bikes to the game, as well as new Old Town buildings and lots of bug fixes and improvements.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to a beta version of asset support for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-editor-weekly-patches" rel="nofollow">the game's Editor</a> "before year-end", but after that, development will switch to Iceflake, who will take over starting from the beginning of next year.</p>

<p><em>Cities: Skylines 2&nbsp;</em>was released in late October 2023, and it's fair to say the game wasn't exactly received well at launch (by its community, at the very least), with players <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-will-support-mods-on-consoles-devs-promise-performance-improvements" rel="nofollow">complaining</a> about poor <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-gets-first-of-several-patches-to-improve-performance-following-flawed" rel="nofollow">performance</a>.</p>

<p>Colossal Order and Paradox subsequently implemented a number of updates aimed at addressing common performance woes, but whether they've been successful is a matter of opinion; the game is still <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/949230/Cities_Skylines_II/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow">sitting at a Mixed rating</a> on Steam at time of writing.</p>




<p>That's without mentioning&nbsp;<em>Cities: Skylines 2</em>'s long-in-development console versions, which have been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-console-delay" rel="nofollow">delayed</a> a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-ps5-xbox-release-delayed-again" rel="nofollow">number</a> of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-console-versions-not-before-summer" rel="nofollow">times</a>&nbsp;and which still don't have anything approaching a release date yet.</p>

<p>Perhaps Iceflake Studios will be able to fix the common issues that still appear to plague&nbsp;<em>Cities: Skylines 2</em>, but we won't be finding out until next year. You can grab the game right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/949230/Cities_Skylines_II/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>.</p>
