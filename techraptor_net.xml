            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rift-of-necrodancer-pc-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Klei and developers Brace Yourself and Tic Toc have announced the&nbsp;<em>Rift of the NecroDancer&nbsp;</em>release date, although it's probably a little later than you might have expected or hoped for.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2073250/view/4489618994289967161" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post on Steam</a>,&nbsp;<em>Rift of the NecroDancer&nbsp;</em>will launch on PC on February 5th, but Brace Yourself says it's "decoupling" the Steam launch from the game's console release, which will now happen "at a later date" that's yet to be determined.</p>

<p>According to Brace Yourself, the delay is down to the team not wanting to cut any of&nbsp;<em>Rift of the NecroDancer</em>'s features to make a 2024 release, and the console delay is so that the team has "a little more time" to polish the game.</p>

<p>These features include an extra "Impossible" difficulty level, as well as more Rhythm Rift beat maps, additional readability for monsters that land off the beat, and tools to implement custom music.</p>

<p>You'll also be able to enjoy a Remix Mode that "throws a fresh chart your way every playthrough", as well as better tutorials and practice mode gameplay, more animation clarity, and a revamp of the story mode. In short,&nbsp;<em>Rift of the NecroDancer</em>'s devs are using the extra time wisely, it seems.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Rift of the NecroDancer</em>, it's a&nbsp;rhythm spinoff of Brace Yourself's roguelike&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/crypt-of-necrodancer" rel="nofollow"><em>Crypt of the NecroDancer</em></a>. Though the game will feature many of the same characters as&nbsp;<em>Crypt</em>, it has its own gameplay style that's more indebted to games like Harmonix's&nbsp;<em>Frequency&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Amplitude</em>.</p>

<p>The game is set to launch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2073250/Rift_of_the_NecroDancer/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> on February 5th, with a console release to follow sometime after.</p>
