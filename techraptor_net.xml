            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/evil-dead-game-delisted-playstation-epic<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Eagle-eyed fans have noticed that&nbsp;<em>Evil Dead: The Game&nbsp;</em>appears to have been delisted from two major storefronts, prompting worries that the game may be about to be shut down.</p>

<p>Over on the game's official subreddit, user ThePatMan117 (who has quite the flair, by the way) <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EvilDeadTheGame/comments/1ka4d44/update_evil_dead_the_games_epic_games_store/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">spotted</a> that&nbsp;<em>Evil Dead: The Game&nbsp;</em>has disappeared from both the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/evil-dead-the-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Epic Games Store</a> and the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/evil-dead-the-game/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation Store</a>. The listing for the game is now a dead link in both cases.</p>

<p>Strangely enough,&nbsp;the game is still available on both the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/evil-dead-the-game/9pd4jfnzcz90/0010" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1493750/Evil_Dead_The_Game/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>, so it is, of course, entirely possible that the PlayStation and Epic delistings are just a mistake and that normal service will resume soon.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/evil-dead-the-game-delisting-car.jpg?itok=tm5fM0hA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/evil-dead-the-game-delisting-car.jpg?itok=WLGl3Jj1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Evil Dead: The Game&nbsp;</em>could be on the way out.</figcaption></figure><p>I fired up my PS5 to check whether the game is still available via the console's storefront and I didn't see it while searching, so it looks like you can't buy it via either the web interface or the PS5's store.</p>

<p>At time of writing, there's been no official word from developer Saber Interactive, and the&nbsp;<em>Evil Dead: The Game&nbsp;</em>X account hasn't posted anything for a number of months. We've reached out to Saber to ask whether the game's delisting is a mistake or intentional.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Evil Dead: The Game</em>, it's an <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/evil-dead-game" rel="nofollow">asymmetrical multiplayer horror game</a> along the lines of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dead-by-daylight" rel="nofollow">Dead by Daylight</a>&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Friday the 13th</em><em>: The Game</em>, although as the name suggests, it's based around the&nbsp;<em>Evil Dead&nbsp;</em>franchise.</p>

<p>You can choose to play either as the forces of good, led by Ash Williams, or the Kandarian Demon and its Deadite followers, and as you'd expect, the action can get pretty gory and violent at its most outre.</p>




<p>A quick glance at&nbsp;<em>Evil Dead: The Game</em>'s <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1493750/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam numbers</a> might suggest a reason for its potential delisting; the game currently has just 31 players online, with a 39-player peak over the last 24 hours. Of course, it's available on consoles and other storefronts too, but that's not an encouraging figure.</p>

<p>It does, however, prove that servers for&nbsp;<em>Evil Dead: The Game&nbsp;</em>haven't been shut down yet, although that may change in the near future. We'll bring you more on this as soon as we get it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splitgate-2-open-beta-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher 1047 Games has announced that the open beta for portal-based first-person shooter&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>will be starting next month.</p>

<p>Per a press release, you'll be able to head into the world of&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>on May 22nd, and the beta will be available across PC, PlayStation, and Xbox, with full crossplay also being enabled between all three platforms.</p>

<p>There's no time period listed in the press release, which seems to indicate that the open beta for&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>will be closer in spirit to an Early Access release rather than a limited-time stress test.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/splitgate-2-open-beta-date-portal-shooting.jpg?itok=YfTfEvrY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/splitgate-2-open-beta-date-portal-shooting.jpg?itok=4WUwVmb2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll be able to try out&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>on May 22nd.</figcaption></figure><p>Tons of stuff will be available for you to try out when&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2</em>'s open beta lands in May. You'll have access to over 15 maps, including "two new massive 24-player Onslaught maps" in the form of Drought and Fracture.</p>

<p>Over 25 weapons will be available for you to try out, including&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2</em>'s new Borealis energy carbine, and 10-plus modes will be available at launch as well, including the "fan favorite" Takedown mode.</p>

<p>Rather tantalizingly, 1047 also says&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>will feature something called "infinite" maps, over footage of what looks rather like a level editor, so perhaps you'll be able to make your own mind-bending portal levels as well.</p>

<p>It's all accompanied by a rather brief, but nonetheless exciting, teaser trailer that shows off some of&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2</em>'s frantic action. You can check out that (admittedly very short) trailer right here.</p>




<p>First announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splitgate-2-announced" rel="nofollow">in July last year</a>, <i>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</i>is the sequel to 2022's&nbsp;<em>Splitgate</em>. Developer 1047 Games is putting all of its eggs into the sequel's basket, too; at the same time that it announced the sequel, the studio also revealed it would cease future development on the original game.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2</em>'s open beta when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2918300/Splitgate_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10010012" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/splitgate-2/9pf5q1b0fhsl" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a> on May 22nd.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Borderlands 4 Release Date Apparently Moving Forward, Per Randy Pitchford]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/borderlands-4-release-date-moving-forward-report</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/borderlands-4-release-date-apparently-moving-forward-per-randy-pitchford.1176438/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/borderlands-4-release-date-moving-forward-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It looks like&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>might be coming out sooner than you think, if a now-deleted post on X by Gearbox head honcho Randy Pitchford is anything to go by.</p>

<p>The post, which was <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1917223361622508015" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">handily salvaged</a> by Wario64, shows Pitchford excitedly claiming that development on&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>is going great; in fact, he says that where the team is at with the game right now is "the best-case scenario".</p>

<p>As a result, Pitchford says the&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>release date is being moved forward to September 12th. He also reiterates that there will be a&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em>-focused PlayStation State of Play show "imminently", with PlayStation subsequently <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/29/watch-the-borderlands-4-gameplay-deep-dive-state-of-play-on-april-30/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">confirming that show for tomorrow</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/borderlands-4-release-date-moving-up-shooting.jpg?itok=UmCwTRJP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/borderlands-4-release-date-moving-up-shooting.jpg?itok=wcEW7tx0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It looks like&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>is coming sooner than you think.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, Pitchford is framing&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em>'s sooner release as a positive for Gearbox, but it's equally likely that the team has moved the release date forward to avoid clashing with some big games that are due out this fall.</p>

<p>There's Sony's&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yōtei</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ghost-of-yotei-release-date" rel="nofollow">due to arrive on PS5 in October</a>, as is Paradox and The Chinese Room's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-october-2025" rel="nofollow">long-awaited&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-october-2025" rel="nofollow">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a>&nbsp;</em>(at time of writing, at least).</p>

<p>Perhaps the biggest elephant in the room, however, is&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em>, which Rockstar (and Gearbox) parent company Take-Two says is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gta-6-still-on-track-for-fall" rel="nofollow">still on track to arrive sometime this fall</a>. No release date has been revealed yet, of course, but it is possible&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>was moved to avoid clashing with&nbsp;<em>GTA VI</em>.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em>, it's the fourth mainline entry in the&nbsp;<em>Borderlands&nbsp;</em>series (although not the fourth overall, thanks to the existence of games like&nbsp;<em>Tiny Tina's Wonderlands&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel</em>).</p>

<p>The game features four all-new Vault Hunters with new abilities and skills to master, plus lots and lots of new weapons to collect. According to its narrative director,&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>will also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/borderlands-4-toilet-humor-narrative-director" rel="nofollow">feature less "toilet humor"</a> than its predecessors.</p>

<p>Assuming Pitchford's deleted post was accurate,&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>will launch on September 12th for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/borderlands-4/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/borderlands-4/9MX6HKF5647G" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and it's also coming to <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/Borderlands-4-2792057.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p>
