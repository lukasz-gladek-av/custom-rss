            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>The Outer Worlds 2 </em>and <em>Avowed </em>underperformed for developer Obsidian, but the studio isn't letting that discourage it from making more games in the <em>Avowed </em>universe, according to a new report.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-03/xbox-studio-behind-grounded-outer-worlds-is-charting-new-path" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>, Obsidian head Feargus Urquhart says that both action RPGs didn't sell as well as the studio's owner Microsoft hoped, although he says neither game was a "disaster" for Obsidian.</p><p>Instead, Urquhart says the feeling within Obsidian was more geared towards what lessons the studio could take from the two games' relative failure in sales terms. According to Urquhart, <em>The Outer Worlds 2 </em>and <em>Avowed</em>'s bad performance led his studio to "think a lot about how much we put into the games, how much we spend on them, how long they take".</p><figure role="group">

<p>Part of that goal is to cut down Obsidian's production pipeline to just three or four years per game; according to Schreier's report, both <em>Avowed </em>and <em>The Outer Worlds 2 </em>took around six years to make, and that's partly why Microsoft had such high expectations for them.</p><p><em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>'s disappointing sales status doesn't seem to have been impacted by the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-outer-worlds-2-70-dollars-xbox" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4d0309c7-1558-4342-aada-7ec9f96f2b0d" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">being sold for $70 rather than $80</a>, although sales could well have been negatively affected by the fact the game was released on Game Pass on day one, like all new Xbox Studios releases are.</p><p>Despite these two games' relative failure, Obsidian's cloud did have a silver lining in 2025 in the form of <em>Grounded 2</em>, which proved a hit. Perhaps relatedly, the game also took a lot less time to make, according to Obsidian and Schreier.</p>
<p>Obsidian says it's not planning to make any more <em>Outer Worlds </em>games in future, but that more games in the <em>Avowed </em>universe are coming (which also means more games in the <em>Pillars of Eternity </em>universe, technically).</p><p>If you'd like to remind yourself of what we thought of <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>, you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/outer-worlds-2-review" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2d44108b-4675-49c2-9b33-fb5caaa62a59" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">check out our review here</a>, and our review of <em>Avowed </em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/avowed-review-pillars-of-excellence" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d0b012fd-ac8c-4c48-838f-7a7425b16777" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">can be found right here</a>.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
