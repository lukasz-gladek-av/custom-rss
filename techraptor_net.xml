            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-dimension-20-cloudward-ho-trailer-reveals-characters-and-more<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Dropout has released a brand new trailer for the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Dimension 20&nbsp;</em>series&nbsp;<em>Cloudward Ho!</em>, and it introduces the players' characters, the steampunk land of Gath, and more.</p>

<p>The trailer teases the steampunk adventure on which the gang will be embarking, which premieres on June 4th. During the trailer, perennially irrepressible DM Brennan Lee Mulligan describes Gath as "a world of high-flying stunts and wild adventure".</p>

<p><em>Cloudward Ho!&nbsp;</em>will serve as an Intrepid Heroes series, which means your players will be the usual rogues' gallery: Ally Beardsley, Brian Murphy, Emily Axford, Lou Wilson, Siobhan Thompson, and Zac Oyama (and, of course, Mulligan himself in the top chair).</p>

Murphy will play a strapping athlete by the name of Maxwell, and Axford will play Marya Junková, who is "gaunt with starvation, not of the body but of the soul".</p>

<p>Oyama's character doesn't get a name during the trailer, but he's an elderly cowboy type with a pistol and bandolier (and, of course, a Texas-style southern-boy accent to match). He's joined by Beardsley's Olethra McCloud, an adventurer who's "extremely into" her family's adventuring legacy.</p>

<p>Finally, Wilson's character, who, like Oyama's cowboy, is unnamed in the trailer. He is possessed of "big, broad shoulders" and a "big chest", and his art shows him with a pencil and book in hand, as well as mutton chop-style facial hair.</p>

<p>Together, the group will form the Windrider Society, who will be taking to the skies of Gath in order to search for "the missing Professor Comfrey MacLeod", according to a press release. It promises to be another unforgettable Intrepid Heroes adventure.</p>




<p><em>Cloudward Ho!&nbsp;</em>reunites the core Intrepid Heroes cast following <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dimension-20-fantasy-high-junior-year-trailer-highlights-new-looks-for-bad-kids-and" rel="nofollow">last year's&nbsp;<em>Fantasy High: Junior Year</em></a>.
