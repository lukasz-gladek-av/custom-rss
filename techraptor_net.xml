            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Neil Druckmann, best known for his work as creative lead on Naughty Dog's successful&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us&nbsp;</em>series, has announced he will step down from his "creative involvement" with HBO's adaptation of the games in order to focus on his work with Naughty Dog.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Naughty_Dog/status/1940465773639880781" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message</a> on social media, Druckmann says the decision to step away from the show was "difficult", but that he wants to "transition [his] complete focus to Naughty Dog and its future projects", including the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/naughty-dog-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet" rel="nofollow">upcoming <i>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</i></a>, on which Druckmann serves as writer and director.</p>

<p>Druckmann says that working on HBO's&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us&nbsp;</em>series as a co-creator "has been a career highlight", and that now, after the completion of series two and "before any meaningful work starts on season three", is the "right time" to step away.</p>

<p>When the second season aired earlier this year, the response from audiences, as well as some critics, was decidedly more muted. Our very own Andrew Stretch <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/hbos-last-of-us-season-2-review-skeleton-of-story-no-heart" rel="nofollow">awarded the season a 7 out of 10</a>, praising its set dressing and Pascal's performance but criticizing "pacing issues".</p>

<p>A third season of the show is on the way, and given that the second season didn't conclude the story of&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us: Part II</em>, we can reasonably assume that the upcoming season will do so.</p>




<p>As for the games, as far as we know, there's no third installment in development, although Druckmann has said before that he believes there <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/last-of-us-creative-director-there-is-probably-one-more-chapter-to-this-story" rel="nofollow">could be "one more chapter"</a> to the story the games tell.</p>

<p>Given that Naughty Dog is currently hard at work on&nbsp;<em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</em>, however, and given the sheer amount of time games take to make these days, I wouldn't bank on seeing a third&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us&nbsp;</em>game for quite some time yet.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Helldivers 2 Xbox Series X|S Version Confirmed for August]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-xbox-series-xs-august</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/helldivers-2-xbox-series-x-s-version-confirmed-for-august.1235109/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>will soon break out of its console exclusivity prison, PlayStation and Xbox have announced, as the bug-slaying shooter is due to land on Xbox Series X|S later this summer.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/03/helldivers-2-xbox-release-date-pre-order/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the official Xbox Wire news platform,&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>will be released on Xbox Series X|S on August 26th. Coincidentally (or perhaps not), that's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-ps5-release-date-enhancements" rel="nofollow">the same date</a> on which<i>&nbsp;Senua's Saga: Hellblade II&nbsp;</i>lands on PS5.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, no specific enhancements or unique features will be introduced for the Xbox version of&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>, although you will net yourself some extra goodies if you pre-order either the standard version or the Super Citizen Edition of the game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-xbox-series-x-s-port-shooting.jpg?itok=clTAExid 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-xbox-series-x-s-port-shooting.jpg?itok=-nOmHKTH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>is finally coming to Xbox.</figcaption></figure><p>It looks like porting work for&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>was handled by Nixxes, a celebrated porting and support studio that Sony <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-has-acquired-porting-studio-nixxes" rel="nofollow">acquired back in 2021</a>. The studio has also helped out with PC ports for the likes of&nbsp;<em>Marvel's Spider-Man</em>,&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Horizon Forbidden West</em>.</p>

<p>If you're somehow not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>, it's a co-op-focused third-person shooter in which players band together to slay enemies belonging to one of three factions: the insectoid Terminids, the robotic Automatons, and the alien Illuminate.</p>

<p>The game's theming is heavily satirical; while players are routinely encouraged to support Super Earth and its introduction of "managed democracy" to the galaxy, in truth, Super Earth's government is much closer to an autocratic regime.</p>

<p>Missions revolve around completing a series of objectives while fending off enemies from the three aforementioned factions, and with friendly fire not only present but constant, I'd recommend playing with those with whom your friendship is ironclad.</p>




<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>on <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/helldivers-2/9mx9wn9dfpgt" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> when it launches on Microsoft's hardware on August 26th. The game is also currently available on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/helldivers-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>.</p>
