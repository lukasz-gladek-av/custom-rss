            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monaco-2-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Pocketwatch Games and publisher Humble Games have announced the release date for upcoming sneaky heist sim&nbsp;<em>Monaco 2</em>.</p>

<p>Per a new release date trailer,&nbsp;<em>Monaco 2&nbsp;</em>will launch across PC and current-gen consoles on April 10th. It is, as you've probably already surmised, the sequel to the amusingly-named 2013 stealth game&nbsp;<em>Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine</em>.</p>

<p>The sequel trades the original game's top-down 2D art style for a new isometric 3D look, but it's still very much all about finding the perfect route in and out of a series of well-guarded locations to steal valuable loot.</p>

<p>The game will boast eight playable characters, each of whom has their own strengths and weaknesses. You can also switch your character partway through a run if you need to utilize a different skillset.</p>

<p><em>Monaco 2</em>'s levels are procedurally generated, and you'll be able to see each of them before you delve into the heist thanks to the game's Blueprint Mode, which allows you to do what any good thief would do and case the joint before you break in.</p>

<p>You can check out the&nbsp;<em>Monaco 2&nbsp;</em>release date announcement trailer right here. It gives a good sense of what you can expect from the game in terms of art style and gameplay.</p>




<p><em>Monaco 2&nbsp;</em>will be published by Humble Games, which remains an operational outfit despite large-scale layoffs and restructuring efforts <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/humble-games-lays-off-over-30-employees-as-it-restructures" rel="nofollow">back in July last year</a>. The game will serve as developer Pocketwatch's fifth effort, as well as its first since the 2017 RTS&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/tooth-and-tail-review-fur-and-loathing" rel="nofollow"><em>Tooth and Tail</em></a>.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Monaco 2&nbsp;</em>when it launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1063030/Monaco_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S on April 10th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/longdue-hopetown-kickstarter-disco-elysium<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Longdue, a studio made up in part of former&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>developers and creative personnel, has launched a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign for its debut project&nbsp;<em>Hopetown</em>.</p>

<p>The studio describes&nbsp;<em>Hopetown&nbsp;</em>as a "psychogeographic RPG" that casts you as an ex-journalist looking to investigate "a town above, the world below, and the depths of your own psyche". So far, so very&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>.</p>

<p>As with&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>, you'll have the chance to play as you see fit; you can "spark chaos as a gonzo journalist" or "twist events as a conspiracist", sure, but if you prefer to do things in a more straightforward way, you can also "reveal brutal truths as a calculated investigator".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disco-elysium-longdue-hopetown.jpg?itok=bp8U2d4_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disco-elysium-longdue-hopetown.jpg?itok=cG-UqkJJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hopetown&nbsp;</em>is the very&nbsp;<em>Disco Elsyium</em>-esque debut game from Longdue Games.</figcaption></figure><p>True to Longdue's legacy, the studio promises that&nbsp;<em>Hopetown</em>'s "psychogeography system" will replace traditional puzzles and keys with "emotions, memories, and conversations". It sounds rather like if you love&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>, you'll want to keep an eye on this as well.</p>

<p>The Kickstarter campaign for&nbsp;<em>Hopetown&nbsp;</em>is live now, and at time of writing, it had raised £19,967 of its £25,000 goal (apologies for using UK currency, but I'm a Brit, so it comes with the territory). It's looking fairly likely the game will hit its goal by the end of the day.</p>

<p>Longdue is one of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-disco-elysium-devs-new-studios-spiritual-successors" rel="nofollow">a number of studios</a> that formed after original publisher ZA/UM effectively imploded following&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>'s release. The studio boasts the involvement of ZA/UM co-founder Martin Luiga, who also wrote "seven characters in&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>", according to the studio's website.</p>

<p><em>Kentucky Route Zero&nbsp;</em>co-creator Ben Babbitt and&nbsp;<em>The Witcher 3&nbsp;</em>composer Pawel Blaszczak have also joined the team, so it's fair to say Longdue is shaping up to be a real supergroup of developers at this stage.</p>




<p>Although many of ZA/UM's principal creatives have left the studio, the company is still soldiering on. Just last week, it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zaum-project-c4-disco-elysium" rel="nofollow">announced&nbsp;<em>Project C4</em></a>, which it describes as a new "genre-defining" RPG.</p>

<p>ZA/UM also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/disco-elysium-mobile-version-tiktok-user" rel="nofollow">unveiled a&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>mobile port</a> last week, which studio head Denis Havel says is aimed at "captivating the TikTok user" with shorter blasts of narrative and gameplay.</p>
