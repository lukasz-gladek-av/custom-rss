Cephalofair Games has announced a Gloomhaven Second Edition delay of several months to address production issues found with the <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/gloomhaven" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Gloomhaven Game Page">Gloomhaven</a> </em>advance copies they received.</p>

<h2>The <em>Gloomhaven Second Edition</em> Delay</h2>

<p>In an update post <a href="https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/cephalofair/gloomhaven/updates/16229#top" rel="nofollow">on Backerkit</a>, Cephalofair explained the <em>Gloomhaven Second Edition</em> delay. According to them, they had advanced copies of the game ready as part of their first round of shipping via ocean freight. These were copies meant for the design team, some content creators, and different partners.</p>

They mention warped map boards and scenario trackers alongside poorly injected and assembled miniatures. These issues were not present in samples or pre-preproduction copies received ahead of mass production. Given the price point of <em>Gloomhaven</em>, and how much it relies on a variety of parts, these constituted major issues with the game.</p>

<p>Cephalofair has confirmed that these errors affected a significant amount of product and are in conversation with the production facility to correct these issues. The producer has acknowledged these errors and has committed with providing replacements.</p>

<p>Those replacements will take some time since the workers won't be back until mid-February due to Lunar New Year having everyone off for a while at the production facility. Not to mention the root cause of the mass production issues will need to be identified and addressed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We aren’t sure exactly how long it will end up being, but be assured that we and our production facility are determined to solve this problem quickly and efficiently.</p>

<p>Making this decision was genuinely heartbreaking, but we firmly believe it was ultimately the best call.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Depending on how long <em>Gloomhaven Second Edition</em> is delayed, it may also face another challenge: the potential trade tariffs being proposed by US President Trump. As other developers <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/deep-regrets-developer-voices-potential-impact-of-imposing-us-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Deep Regrets Developer Voices Potential Impact of Imposed US Trade Tariffs">have expressed</a>, the vast majority of board production is done overseas in China, which can mean higher prices for all tabletop products in the United States if these tariffs are implemented. Previously Cephalofair had <a href="https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/cephalofair/gloomhaven/updates/13908#top" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Project Update: Tariffs and physical proofs of Gloomhaven ">expressed some concerns </a>about them, but were unable to say how it might impact them going forward.</p>
