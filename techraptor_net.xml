            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/digimon-alysion-time-stranger<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has announced&nbsp;<em>Digimon Alysion</em>, a mobile game that will allow you to play the&nbsp;<em>Digimon&nbsp;</em>TCG on the go. The studio has also unveiled new information about the upcoming RPG&nbsp;<em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em>.</p>

<p>As revealed during the&nbsp;<em>Digimon&nbsp;</em>Con showcase,&nbsp;<em>Digimon Alysion&nbsp;</em>will let you collect and battle&nbsp;<em>Digimon&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/digimon-card-game-2020" rel="nofollow">cards</a>. It's likely intended as a competitor to The Pokemon Company's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-dena-revenue" rel="nofollow">wildly popular</a>&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>.</p>

<p><em>Digimon Alysion&nbsp;</em>will, however, have some features&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>doesn't. For one thing, it looks like there will be a story; main characters Kanata Hondo, Futre, and Valner Dragnogh are all introduced in the debut trailer, along with what appears to be a new Digimon in the form of Gemmon.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Digimon Alysion&nbsp;</em>right here. The trailer shows text largely in Japanese, but it's pretty likely that the West will be seeing this game at some point as well.</p>




<h2>Bandai Namco also revealed new&nbsp;<em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger&nbsp;</em>details</h2>

<p>If you've been waiting for more info about upcoming RPG&nbsp;<em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em>, then you're in luck, since that's exactly what we got during the aforementioned showcase.</p>

<p>Sadly, that info didn't include a release date, but we did learn more about the game's story, its dual-world concept, and various other elements.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-greymon.jpg?itok=NoG8DZ2j 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-greymon.jpg?itok=9cWsuEN7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger&nbsp;</em>got a bunch of new info during the&nbsp;<em>Digimon&nbsp;</em>Con showcase.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger&nbsp;</em>will cast you as an agent of an organization called ADAMAS, which "specializes in investigating and solving anomalous phenomena", according to Bandai Namco.</p>

<p>After a mysterious explosion in which you encounter your first Digimon, you'll be blasted back eight years into the past, and you'll pursue "the mystery of the impending world's collapse". It all sounds suitably epic.</p>

<p>You'll split your time between two worlds: the Human World and the Digital World. Producer Ryosuke Hara says&nbsp;<em>Time Stranger&nbsp;</em>will allow you to make "frequent visits to the Digital World", contrasting against the&nbsp;<em>Cyber Sleuth&nbsp;</em>games, in which you had "very few opportunities" to do so.</p>

<p>We also got tons more info about the game's characters, the Digimon that will be appearing (of which there will be more than 450!), and lots more. You can check out a new&nbsp;<em>Time Stranger&nbsp;</em>trailer, which shows off some of the Digimon's special abilities, right here.</p>




<p>There's no release date for&nbsp;<em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger&nbsp;</em>yet, but the game will come to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1984270/Digimon_Story_Time_Stranger/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/digimon-story-time-stranger/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and Xbox Series X|S when it launches. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Konami's Deliver At All Costs Gets May Release Date]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/deliver-at-all-costs-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/konamis-deliver-at-all-costs-gets-may-release-date.1140021/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/deliver-at-all-costs-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Konami and developer Studio Far Out Games have revealed the release date for chaotic delivery-based action game&nbsp;<em>Deliver At All Costs</em>, and it's coming later in spring.</p>

<p>As announced in a new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Deliver At All Costs</em>, which was originally unveiled <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/konami-reveals-deliver-at-all-costs" rel="nofollow">in September last year</a>, is coming to PC and current-gen consoles on May 22nd. The game will be available across three different storefronts on PC.</p>

<p>In case you're not familiar with it,&nbsp;<em>Deliver At All Costs&nbsp;</em>is an isometric action game in which you play as courier Winston Green at the tail end of the 1950s. It's your job to deliver "highly unconventional cargo" while also leaving "a trail of havoc and chaos" behind you.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/deliver-at-all-costs-release-date-crash.jpg?itok=KVvITghD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/deliver-at-all-costs-release-date-crash.jpg?itok=qhiyDCXe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Deliver At All Costs&nbsp;</em>has a release date, and it's coming in spring.</figcaption></figure><p>Set against a backdrop of what Konami and Studio Far Out call "a time of rock'n'roll, polka dot dresses and the ever-looming dread of nuclear annihilation",&nbsp;<em>Deliver At All Costs&nbsp;</em>tasks you with making "bizarre deliveries" across a series of "highly destructible environments".</p>

<p>Of course, the packages you're delivering aren't just nondescript brown paper parcels; you'll be doing everything from "delivering a giant flailing marlin" through to disposing of "a big bomb teetering on the edge of explosion".</p>

<p>Each of&nbsp;<em>Deliver At All Costs</em>' levels is a semi-open environment full of things to do, and you'll discover a "story of mystery and intrigue" as you explore them as well. Konami and Studio Far Out are promising a three-act narrative with "a cast of distinct and memorable characters".</p>

<p>Not only that, but&nbsp;<em>Deliver At All Costs&nbsp;</em>will also feature an immersive 50s environment with its own built-in radio ads and soundtrack, helping to give you that authentic late-50s feeling.</p>




<p>You're in luck this year if you're looking for delivery games that aren't actually about deliveries. Not only is&nbsp;<em>Deliver At All Costs&nbsp;</em>coming in May, but Hideo Kojima recently revealed that his own <i>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach&nbsp;</i>is set for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">release in June</a>, appropriate given Konami is his former employer.</p>

<p><em>Deliver At All Costs&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1880610/Deliver_At_All_Costs/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012329" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/deliver-at-all-costs/9pmwkz7ftnp0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on May 22nd, and pre-orders for the game are open right now.</p>
