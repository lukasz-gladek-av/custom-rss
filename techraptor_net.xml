            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/rusty-rabbit-review-few-screws-loose<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you're into anime, light novels, or visual novels, Gen Urobuchi's influence is everywhere. He's the mind behind some of anime's biggest hits, including <em>Madoka Magica</em>, <em>Psycho-Pass</em>, and <em>Fate Zero</em>. That's just a fraction of his work, and his status as a legend is hard to dispute. So when I saw he was involved in creating <em>Rusty Rabbit</em>, you can imagine my excitement.</p>

<p>Part side-scrolling adventure/platformer, part visual novel, <em>Rusty Rabbit</em> is a charming game on the surface, no doubt. As a fan of Urobuchi's work, though, you can imagine my disappointment when <em>Rusty Rabbit</em>'s narrative, and in some cases its gameplay, didn't quite live up to my admittedly lofty expectations.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rusty-rabbit-priest.jpg?itok=K8yXAVe1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rusty-rabbit-priest.jpg?itok=r6w-wqnO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>That money's probably going into giving this rabbit some insane bling.</figcaption></figure><h2>A Different Approach for the Urobutcher</h2>

<p>Urobuchi is often called the "Urobutcher" for his unrelenting and brutal attitude towards characters in his narratives. It's apparent right from the start that <em>Rusty Rabbit</em> is a departure from these norms, and that's perfectly fine. A more lighthearted story as opposed to a violent one is a nice change of pace for Urobuchi.</p>

<p><em>Rusty Rabbit</em> stars the eponymous Rusty, and he's an ol' rabbit with that boomer mindset that's probably all too familiar to some of us with aging parents. He's stuck in his ways, gruff, and says it how it is. He's a scrapper by trade and digs for junk in Smokestack Mountain, and that's how he makes his living in this frozen wasteland of a world.</p>

<p>True to developer NITRO PLUS' usual portfolio, <em>Rusty Rabbit</em>'s narrative is often loaded with pages of exposition. The main story of <em>Rusty Rabbit</em> doesn't bog players down with a ton of story, but for those who want to explore its worldbuilding, lore, and Rusty's character, you have <em>plenty</em> of dialogue to comb through.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rusty-rabbit-renovation.jpg?itok=HPJKiagR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rusty-rabbit-renovation.jpg?itok=oZAr_wU_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Yes, that is how lights work.</figcaption></figure><p>I don't mind reading pages of dialogue -- I'm a budding <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/tsukihimes-turned-me-into-visual-novel-fan" rel="nofollow">visual novel fan</a>, after all -- but <em>Rusty Rabbit</em>'s additional lore is padded with a lot of unnecessary or uninteresting writing. This is not&nbsp;Urobuchi's best work by any stretch of the imagination.</p>

<p>For instance, you can take on various repair projects as you collect parts throughout your scrapping adventures -- a pair of tires, a car frame, stuff like that. You'll be met with, sometimes, a couple of dozen pages of Rusty talking about tires, and it seems like he's just talking in circles. Look, unless you're a mechanic, you're probably not going to find these projects as exciting as Rusty does.</p>

<p>In these sequences, there are some tidbits of lore that dive into Rusty's complicated past involving his wife and daughter. It's unfortunate that most of Rusty's development is hidden in pages of dialogue that are simply boring to read.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rusty-rabbit-bbs.jpg?itok=KtT6ymB1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rusty-rabbit-bbs.jpg?itok=3msXaSrK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Not like these folks'll matter much, in the end.</figcaption></figure><h2>What's Up With the BBs in <em>Rusty Rabbit?</em></h2>

<p>The narrative also makes a point to shoehorn in a group of characters that, in the end, serve little to no purpose. <em>Rusty Rabbit</em> gasses up this group of junksters, called the BBs, as a group of rabbits exploring Smokestack Mountain for uncertain reasons.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You'll come across the BBs plenty of times throughout the narrative, but maybe one out of the six gets a modicum of character development. The rest are simply there for gags, or to give Rusty blueprints or items he needs to proceed through levels. It's a shame because Urobuchi has the ability to craft great characters, but that is not apparent in <em>Rusty Rabbit</em>.</p>

<p>The worldbuilding holds some promise, at least. As the truth of the world becomes more apparent as you progress, <em>Rusty Rabbit</em> sprinkles tidbits of information throughout and keeps you guessing and theorizing. I enjoy settings that are mysterious in nature, but it's held back by the lack of character development and too much dialogue.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rusty-rabbit-drilling.jpg?itok=mW0PasxC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rusty-rabbit-drilling.jpg?itok=G0hhjo-v 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It IS satisfying to clear out all those blocks.</figcaption></figure><h2>It's a Junkers Life 'fer Me</h2>

<p>At its core, <em>Rusty Rabbit</em> is a game about digging for junk. Levels are 2.5D environments filled with drillable blocks, hazards, and enemies called rust beasts. Your main goal is to progress through each level and hit certain points in the story to progress. It's nothing too crazy, but <em>Rusty Rabbit</em>'s simplicity means it can be an enjoyable time.</p>

<p>The core of <em>Rusty Rabbit</em> has remained the same since Urobuchi conceived <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/lore-behind-rusty-rabbit-is-absolutely-nuts" rel="nofollow">the idea</a> during COVID-19 lockdown: digging for junk in large, sprawling levels. It's in these levels that there is both a great deal of promise but also untapped potential.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rusty-rabbit-blocks-2.jpg?itok=jRo2MWJS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rusty-rabbit-blocks-2.jpg?itok=TYq8jU-O 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Taking out a bunch of blocks in one go, it's cathartic!</figcaption></figure><p><em>Rusty Rabbit</em>'s first half is almost painfully basic. These first several areas in Smokestack Mountain appear Metroidvania-esque on the surface, but are mostly just linear pathways that wind around to give the feeling of being maze-like. <em>Rusty Rabbit</em> doesn't hit its stride until later, when new ideas are incorporated to make levels more dynamic.</p>

<p>Exploration and finding new upgrades to progress through levels takes more of a role later on, which is great -- racking your brain over where to go next and finding new areas to explore in games such as this are engaging. As a result, though, the first half is underbaked and relatively unexciting.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rusty-rabbit-combat.jpg?itok=s1PhBBUv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rusty-rabbit-combat.jpg?itok=dmP8DpPX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A shotgun to the face will always do a rust beast in.</figcaption></figure><h2>Tools of the Trade in <em>Rusty Rabbit</em></h2>

<p>Rusty's mech, Junkster, is your means of transportation, and it's quite a handy vehicle, at that. Moving in Junkster feels great. Movement is responsive, and platforming is a cinch. Most failures in making a jump feel like my fault rather than the game's -- though, sometimes there are collision issues, which will no doubt be ironed out in a patch or two.</p>

<p>You're equipped with four different types of weapons: a drill, shotgun, blade, and hammer. These are all used for different purposes, like clearing specific obstacles or doing extra damage to certain enemy types; again, it's simple, and these all do what they need to do. Sometimes, simple is best.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rusty-rabbit-map.jpg?itok=OvbTntmx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rusty-rabbit-map.jpg?itok=VZQUg_8g 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>More tools means you might be able to access areas once inaccessible.</figcaption></figure><p>You also unlock various traversal options, like a higher jump and a wire that grabs onto ledges and such. Using the full suite of tools at your disposal opens up a lot of possibilities and allows NITRO PLUS to create more complex environments. Having the fully upgraded Junkster -- with its weapons and traversal options -- greatly increased my enjoyment of the gameplay.</p>

<p>There are a few other gameplay systems players can engage with, like a leveling system that grants skill points for upgrades. Upgrades are useful and necessary, so gaining XP from killing enemies and drilling blocks has its advantages. There's a town where you're able to buy various items to aid you in combat or in crafting, too.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rusty-rabbit-crafting_0.jpg?itok=JY2iqRE4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rusty-rabbit-crafting_0.jpg?itok=WQWcAFHC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll be able to craft better weapons as time goes on.</figcaption></figure><h2>What's a Scrapper Without Crafting?</h2>

<p>But crafting is where <em>Rusty Rabbit</em> once again leads to some disappointment. As a scrapper, it's part of Rusty's character to salvage junk and turn it into useful items. These items usually come in the form of new weapons, which are, in some cases, needed to progress the story.</p>

<p>Crafting new weapons requires parts, and you'll only gain parts by drilling through certain blocks. There's also an endless dungeon where you can essentially farm for more parts to craft said weapons, but I never felt compelled to engage with this content much.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rusty-rabbit-shops.jpg?itok=K62ifnaU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rusty-rabbit-shops.jpg?itok=Z2ypCzxZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You can also buy or sell scrap.</figcaption></figure><p>More powerful weapons are required to explore some secret areas in <em>Rusty Rabbit</em>, but the story doesn't usually require you to go out of your way for these. So the Endless Dungeon feels nothing more than a vessel for getting parts for weapons that you don't necessarily need, unless you're trying to be a completionist.</p>

<p>Weapons also come with various modifiers that are RNG-dependent, which feels pointless. These modifiers don't seem to matter much at the end of the day, but supposing some players are looking for one modifier or another, I suppose that could be quite frustrating to just <em>not</em> get what you want and having to farm more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rusty-rabbit-boomer.jpg?itok=lV727VRR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rusty-rabbit-boomer.jpg?itok=WabSyHos 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I know someone just like this.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Rusty Rabbit</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>It's worth mentioning, <em>Rusty Rabbit</em>'s a pretty little game. The rabbits are so fluffy and distinct in their designs, but that leads to further disappointment when you find they have no personality outside of eye-catching designs. On top of that, environments are very cool -- NITRO PLUS makes a point to create visually distinct areas, and it does a lot to break up any sort of repetition.</p>

<p>There are definitely some issues with <em>Rusty Rabbit</em>, though, both in a narrative sense and in its gameplay, but it is still a perfectly adequate title. With its <em>mostly</em> smooth movement and platforming, as well as the therapeutic nature of drilling through blocks, <em>Rusty Rabbit</em> can still be an enjoyable little romp. It's just a game that, sadly, never achieves its full potential.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/last-of-us-season-2-episode-1-review-welcome-back-to-apocalypse<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HBO's <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4bf991e9-1624-48e4-90de-202719d86a32" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/how-hbo-last-of-us-episode-1-adapt-game" rel="nofollow"><em>The Last of Us</em></a> was an incredible achievement for was a very spotty history of video-game-to-TV adaptations. It managed to convey the tense tones of the fungal apocalypse with the heartbreak of our protagonists for those they they loved, and the eventual repairing of those breaks with what they found. Season 2 has just begun, and we're excited to see how this quality can be maintained as they move into the storyline of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>.</p>

<p>Ahead of the premiere, TechRaptor was lucky enough to watch <em>The Last of Us</em>&nbsp;season 2 Eeisode 1. <strong>Keep in mind there will be some spoilers for the episode below as well as <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="feb0b551-7fe5-4f74-9986-717a95c8865c" href="https://techraptor.net/games/last-of-us-part-ii" rel="nofollow"><em>The Last of Us Part II</em></a></strong>.</p>

<p>Season 2 opens with a reminder of the status quo at the end of the first. We see the final exchange between Joel and Ellie, her making him swear that what he said about the Fireflies was true, before we get to see a funeral scene attended by the surviving Fireflies and our introduction to Abby, played by Kaitlyn Dever, and her vendetta against Joel.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Slowly… [...] When we kill him, we kill him slowly" - Abby</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This short opening sequence does a great job of reminding viewers where we were when we left off from season one, while setting up important characters for this next leg of the journey before jumping ahead five years into the future.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-last-of-us-season-2-the-city.jpg?itok=YjW-k9oU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-last-of-us-season-2-the-city.jpg?itok=ML2jHi6M 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>A New Life In A Post-Apocalyptic World</h2>

<p>The rest of the episode is set largely in the city in Wyoming, catching the viewer up on where everyone is in life, what the current status of relations are, and showing that in this post-apocalyptic world it is possible to live a relatively normal life.</p>

<p>Here we get to see Joel going about as City Planner, working to fix up new houses for settlers who need a place to stay or fixing breakers by hand.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The largest change in these five years has been the relationship between Joel and Ellie. In season one, the father/daughter dynamic grew when they needed to rely on one another for protection. They still have that father/daughter relationship but with Joel helicoptering (probably a side effect of the horrific way he lost his first daughter) and Ellie coming out of being a teenager and wanting to be seen as an adult she tries to distance herself.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed that even while their scenes together were tense--and who couldn't feel for Pedro Pascal's brooding expressions--that they felt very real and very normal for an otherwise not-normal world.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-last-of-us-season-2-ellie-workshop.jpg?itok=LFmVRiac 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-last-of-us-season-2-ellie-workshop.jpg?itok=YjR0KJXv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ellie dilligently cleaning her weapons in the garage.</figcaption></figure><p>These 'normal' moments also do some heavy lifting to set up narrative flags, but we know that for there to be a season, there has to be conflict--even if you haven't played the games--so you can feel that these happier moments are being set up to be reflected back upon.</p>

<p>Ellie's rebellion continues on a raid where she and Dina, played by Isabela Merced, take out some clickers in an abandoned building. This character, who was teased in season 1, is Ellie's main love interest for the season and a confidant for her. We don't get to see too much other than their flirty banter, self-assuredness when taking out the infected, and their kiss, but I'm looking forward to seeing more of their relationship develop.</p>

<p>This scene also introduces the plotline of a talking infected. This is only lightly touched on, so I'm intrigued to see where this goes as the season continues.</p>

<h2>The Powerful Small Moments</h2>

<p>For a TV show about infected mushroom people and the collapse of society, my favorite scene in the episode wasn't about action or stealth but was when Joel went to visit his therapist, Gail played by Catherine O'Hara.</p>

<p>While paying for his session with a massive bag of weed, Joel is offered a drink. Gail, while remaining professional (aside from the drink) laments that this is her "first birthday without [her] husband in 41 years," a statement that makes Joel tense.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-last-of-us-season-2-joel-and-gail-therapist.jpg?itok=UsuKSzf4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-last-of-us-season-2-joel-and-gail-therapist.jpg?itok=z9tOT-XZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>O'Hara gives an amazing performance as Gail speaks her mind about how mundane Joel's problems are. She verbalizes her internal monologue of having to say the scary things, otherwise nothing will be done about them, and then an incredible delivery of why she hates Joel, how she's tried to forgive him, but that she also knows that she can't.</p>

<p>Those who have played the game know that the rest of the season is fueled by revenge--the revenge of Abby for the climactic finale of season 1, and then the retaliatory revenge of Ellie. To have a moment in episode one of someone taking the higher road, expressing their hatred and anger at another, and accepting that you can not forgive someone but also not want to retaliate back,is a perfect way to set up just how poorly every decision from here on out will be made.</p>

<p>When Gail then asks Joel to "say the thing you're afraid to say," the camera lingers on Joel as he responds to her questions, unable to answer and reveal that the world could have been healed. Then he stands up and defiantly states, "I saved her," and walks out.</p>

<p>I had chills watching Pascal as Joel, recognizing on his face that he knows what he did was for him, and not for her… and definitely not for the world.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-last-of-us-season-2-ellie-and-dina-dance.jpg?itok=PIFBlmuQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-last-of-us-season-2-ellie-and-dina-dance.jpg?itok=gprejDqT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2><em>The Last Of Us </em>Season 2 Episode 1 Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>There's a lot crammed into this episode. It doesn't exactly go anywhere, aside from knowing Abby's group is nearby. The plot doesn't move forward, but the episode does a great job to show where we are five years later.</p>

<p>We know where Joel and Ellie are at, we know Dina and her relationship with the major cast, and we know the plans and strategies of the settlement. We've been perfectly welcomed back into the world and caught up so that as things begin to go awry, we're ready to worry about our heroes (and villains).</p>

<p>I'm very excited for the continuation of this show. It makes sense that a game that many already described "as a movie" is being so wonderfully adapted for TV, but all of the little details and the stellar performances from the cast really elevate the show to be something not just for those who played the games, but for a wider audience.</p>
