            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/baby-steps-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ahead of the demo’s debut on Steam Next Fest, we got the opportunity to play the first chapter of the upcoming game developed by Gabe Cuzzillo and Maxi Boch (<em>Ape Out</em>), Bennett Foddy (<em>Getting Over It</em>), and published by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/pepper-grinder-review" rel="nofollow">Devolver Digital</a>, <em>Baby Steps</em>.</p>

<p>If you’re familiar with Bennett Foddy in particular, you're getting what you expect: a game that makes movement difficult in service of creating frustrating platforming, that eventually pays off once you finally get everything just right. What excited me most about this demo, though, were the things I didn’t expect: presentation in line with much larger studios, and a game that delivers on humor better than other games in years.</p>

<h2>One Small Step for Man</h2>



<p><em>Baby Steps</em> in particular reminds me a lot of <em>QWOP</em>, Foddy’s breakout browser game. In <em>QWOP</em>, you played as a track star for whom running is, surprisingly, quite difficult. This time, using a controller in place of <em>QWOP</em>'s signature keyboard controls, even the most basic steps are a bit of a struggle. The level design is expertly paced around this struggle, though. Right when I started getting the hang of movement, a new ledge or set of steps came to throw me off my game.</p>

<p>This sort of movement has become a staple of any game with his name on it, and <em>Baby Steps</em> is no different. What is different, though, is the scale.</p>

<p><em>Baby Steps</em> looks great and runs smoothly, even in a very expansive world. Compared to the usual style of Foddian games, which steered more towards the minimalist side, <em>Baby Steps </em>feels like a premium, large-scale experience that spared no expense. I'm quite excited to see what locales show themselves next, as there are more varied locales shown in trailers than what I saw in my short slice of gameplay.</p>

<h2>One Giant Leap</h2>



<p>The most notable thing about <em>Baby Steps </em>wasn’t the Foddian locomotion system or presentation, though: it was the humor. Being a funny video game is no easy feat, but the team behind <em>Baby Steps</em> is delivering in spades.</p>

<p>The protagonist of the game, Nate, is perhaps the most pathetic man I’ve ever met, real or fictional. After he’s teleported by a mysterious power to a large mountain, he avoids human contact at all costs.</p>

<p>At one point in the demo, a fellow traveller remarks that he could probably use a map. Finally! A way to get some direction, and really get a grip on where exactly he is.</p>

<p>Nope. Nate says he’s actually fine without it, all in the name of avoiding any additional human conversation or contact. Barring a big shift in him, it feels like Nate will be actively working against the player at every step of the way.</p>

<p>In any game, or any story for that matter, there’s always some kind of force working against the protagonist. This feels like a rare time in games where a protagonist is working against themselves. Beyond creating a lot of funny scenes and situations, I’m excited to see where this game goes narratively, both for Nate and the mysterious world surrounding him, something I didn’t expect going in.</p>

<h2><em>Baby Steps</em> | Final Thoughts</h2>



<p><em>Baby Steps</em>, like most Foddian games, will almost certainly find an audience on streams. Foddy’s games like <em>Getting Over It</em>, and Foddy-inspired ones like <a href="https://techraptor.net/originals/coverage-club-jump-king-takes-frustration-platforming-to-new-heights" rel="nofollow"><em>Jump King</em></a> and <em>Only Up</em>, were sensations on the platform, and I imagine this game will be no exception.</p>

<p>However, this slice of the game convinced me that this might be the best Foddy game from a player perspective yet. From the increased production value to the sharp wit, there is a lot here that justifies playing it yourself. Whether you’ve been closely following the creator since <em>QWOP</em> or this is your first exposure, this is a game that is poised to be a joy to play. Even if you play it and find it isn’t your thing, even if you play <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/white-knuckle-early-access-preview-falling-from-cloud-9" rel="nofollow">games with similar ideas </a>this year, I promise that you won’t play anything else quite like <em>Baby Steps</em>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ambrosia Sky Preview - Fighting Against Fungus]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ambrosia-sky-preview-fighting-against-fungus.1212537/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/ambrosia-sky-preview-fighting-against-fungus<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There's just something so satisfying about cleaning up a mess -- provided it's in a video game. Real-life messes are no fun, but for some reason, power-washing that house is just too satisfying. The upcoming&nbsp;<em>Ambrosia Sky</em>&nbsp;provides that same satisfaction, but with a deadly twist.</p>

<p>Indeed, usually nothing is fighting back against you as you clean, but in&nbsp;<em>Ambrosia Sky</em>, a deadly fungus seeks you out. A so-called first-person, immersive "clean 'em up" from developer Soft Rains,&nbsp;<em>Ambrosia Sky's&nbsp;</em>fungal foe is truly terrifying.</p>



<h2>It's Time for Cleanup&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Let's set the stage. It's far into the future and you're a "Scarab," essentially an undertaker that helps the deceased pass on. She's also something of a space "disaster specialist," armed with tools to clean up the contamination.</p>

<p>We begin the demo in a space station. The aim is to find a body and help it pass on, but this fungus is everywhere. Working our way through the space station, going past deadly fungus some of it is electric, and other variants literally&nbsp;<em>seek you out</em>.</p>



<p>This is where&nbsp;<em>Ambrosia Sky&nbsp;</em>really impressed me. This fungus is forming around you quickly, and it's so fast that you become surrounded. Just seeing this amalgamation build up around you is an impressive technical feat.</p>

<p>Not only that, it's how you can clean up this fungus that is equally impressive. Soft Rains has developed a technology called "Quantized Impact Field." It's a mouthful, but hey, it works quite well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The fungus are voxels, but the tech hides it very well. Cleaning the fungus with various sprays at your disposal break it down; in other words, volumetric cleaning.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Spray it All Away</h2>

<p>The sprayer you have is a cool tool. Like I said, cleaning is satisfying, and so is spraying down the fungus and having it crumble away. There are various sprays, like the basic, which is great for cleaning, but also others like fire and electric.</p>

<p>Fire can spread, by the way, and I haven't found a good use for it yet. Electric spray, on the other hand, allows players to activate doors without a direct line to power. Shoot spray at the top of the door and keep spraying until it hits an active power source, and there you go, it's on!</p>

<p>You can also change the nozzle, so the spray can go straight, vertical, or horizontal. In one segment, the gravity in the space station is turned off. Because of that, the spray no longer arcs due to gravity and allows you to clean all the more effectively.</p>



<h2><em>Ambrosia Sky</em> Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>It's also worth nothing, the developers aren't necessarily aiming for a highly detailed art style, but the Quantized Impact Field makes up for a lot of it. Combined with excellent use of lighting,&nbsp;<em>Ambrosia Sky</em>&nbsp;is a promising game.</p>

<p>While it'll likely take several more years to develop, a demo is available today on Steam, so if cleaning up some deadly shrooms tickles your fancy, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3716830/Ambrosia_Sky_Demo/" rel="nofollow">check it out</a>!</p>
