            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This year's Gamescom Opening Night Live aired just last night, and it came packed with a ton of reveals and new information about existing games. Here's everything that was announced during the show, including the pre-show stream!</p>

<hr>

<p>We'll begin with everything that was revealed during the pre-show segment, which ran for a little under half an hour. Believe it or not, it was packed with news as well. Here we go!</p>

<h3><em>Bubsy 4D</em></h3>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bubsy-4d-gamescom-opening-night-live-2025.jpg?itok=WK7OwcgS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bubsy-4d-gamescom-opening-night-live-2025.jpg?itok=K8gPjW2i 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Bubsy&nbsp;</em>is back, baby.</figcaption></figure><p>First up, we got a look at a brand new 3D platformer from Atari and Fabraz, namely&nbsp;<em>Bubsy 4D</em>. That's right; everyone's (least?) favorite feline mischief-maker is still around, and his latest game is coming to PC and consoles sometime in the near future.</p>

<h3><em>Battlestar Galactica: Scattered Hopes</em></h3>

<p>The next game on Gamescom's 2025 agenda was&nbsp;<em>Battlestar Galactica: Scattered Hopes</em>, a roguelite strategy game in which you must "take command of a fleet escaping the annihilation of the Twelve Colonies". Early 2026 for this one.</p>

<h3><em>Outlaws</em></h3>

<p>Nightdive continues its mission to single-handedly revive all of retro gaming with a remaster of the 1997 Western-themed FPS&nbsp;<em>Outlaws</em>. You can expect to check this one out on November 20th.</p>

<h3><em>Denshattack!</em></h3>




<p>I'm not sure how to describe&nbsp;<em>Denshattack!</em>. Train platformer? On-rails skating racer?&nbsp;<em>Yellow Train Goes Choo-Choo</em>?&nbsp;Well, at any rate, it's coming in 2026, and it looks like exactly the kind of off-the-wall insanity the indie industry excels at.</p>

<h3><em>Keeper</em></h3>

<p>Next on the agenda was an interview with&nbsp;<em>Keeper&nbsp;</em>creative director Lee Petty, who told us a little more about the way Double Fine's upcoming lighthouse sim (?) will work. As a reminder, the game is due to launch on October 17th.</p>

<h3><em>He-Man and the Masters of the Universe: Dragon Pearl of Destruction</em></h3>

<p>Try saying that name ten times fast.&nbsp;<em>He-Man and the Masters of the Universe: Dragon Pearl of Destruction&nbsp;</em>is a classic-style pixel-art beat-'em-up featuring iconic characters like He-Man, She-Ra, and Man-at-Arms, and it's coming soon.</p>

<h3><em>Absolum</em></h3>

<p>We got a look at another beat-'em-up next in the form of&nbsp;<em>Absolum</em>, which launches on October 9th. If you want to know more about this one, you can read our very own Andrew's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/absolum-features-gorgeous-story-and-flashy-combat-to-keep-you-coming-back-over-and" rel="nofollow">preview of it right here</a>.</p>

<h3><em>Long Gone</em></h3>

<p>Hey, have you had enough of zombies yet? <i>Long Gone&nbsp;</i>sure hopes you haven't. It's a narrative survival adventure inspired by "games of old", according to developer Hillfort Games, and it launches soon.</p>

<h3><em>Valor Mortis</em></h3>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/valor-mortis-gamescom-opening-night-live-2025.jpg?itok=RKOayitY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/valor-mortis-gamescom-opening-night-live-2025.jpg?itok=2FrLM7Xh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Wouldn't want to run into him on a dark&nbsp;<em>rue</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>The developers behind&nbsp;<em>Ghostrunner&nbsp;</em>are trying their hands at a Soulslike, it turns out, and that Soulslike is&nbsp;<em>Valor Mortis</em>. It's a rather distinctive-looking first-person action game set to debut next year, so keep an eye out for this one.</p>

<h3><em>Planetenverteidigungskanonenkommandant</em></h3>

<p>It's okay; you can just call this one&nbsp;<em>PVKK&nbsp;</em>if you want. It's a sim that sees you operating a planetary defense cannon amidst an interplanetary invasion, and you'll have to press all the right buttons if you want to fend said invasion off.</p>

<h3><em>Routine</em></h3>

<p>Yeah, that's right,&nbsp;<em>Routine&nbsp;</em>is still alive! Remember this one from back in the day? The narrative-based horror game is still very much alive (although there's no guarantee you'll stay that way during your playthrough), and it's coming in late 2025.</p>

<h3><em>Swords of Legends</em></h3>

<p>Okay, okay, I know this one's from an established franchise, but come on.&nbsp;<em>Swords of Legends</em>? They may as well have called it&nbsp;<em>Quest of Hero</em>. In any case, it's a single-player action Soulslike set to arrive...uhh, sometime in the future.</p>

<h3><em>Road Kings</em></h3>

<p>From Saber Interactive and Focus Entertainment comes&nbsp;<em>Road Kings</em>, a "next-gen truck simulation" that has you hauling cargo across the American South while dealing with natural disasters along the way. It's coming in 2026.</p>

<h3><em>Pac-Man&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>are getting crossover DLC packs</h3>

<p>Next, we got to see DLC packs for both&nbsp;<em>Pac-Man World 2 Re-Pac&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Sonic Racing CrossWorlds</em>, both of which are getting DLC themed around the other game.&nbsp;<em>Pac-Man</em>'s comes in late 2025, while&nbsp;<em>Sonic</em>'s arrives early next year.</p>

<hr><h2>Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025 - Main Show Announcements</h2>

<p>Well, that's everything from the pre-show, so now we're getting into the meat of things. Here's everything we got to see during the main Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025 ceremony!</p>

<h3><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em></h3>

<p>Ahead of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/major-hollow-knight-silksong-announcement-set-for-this-week" rel="nofollow">big announcement for&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>tomorrow</a> (which is almost certainly going to be a release date), we got to see some new gameplay footage, and hey, it certainly looks like&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight</em>. Hype is building yet again for this one.</p>

<h3><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em></h3>

<p>Next up, it's a look at the characteristically bonkers-looking&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>, and a giant man smashing his fist into one of the game's campaign stages is just one of the weird sights you're going to see when the shooter launches on November 14th.</p>

<h3><em>Lords of the Fallen 2</em></h3>




<p>CI Games announced its Soulslike followup&nbsp;<em>Lords of the Fallen 2&nbsp;</em>next (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lords-of-fallen-2-2026-epic-exclusive" rel="nofollow">well, officially, anyway</a>), and it's got more of the pseudo-Biblical designs and ruined kingdoms that the first game loved so much. It's coming in 2026.</p>

<h3><em>Sekiro: No Defeat</em></h3>

<p>No, it's not a followup to 2019's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sekiro-shadows-die-twice-sales" rel="nofollow">hugely popular</a>&nbsp;<em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em>, but an anime adaptation of the game with some pretty gnarly-looking art. It's coming exclusively to Crunchyroll next year.</p>

<h3><em>Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</em></h3>

<p>You're in luck if you love Batman and Lego, because this new game will marry the two once again. It's a sort of anthology experience that takes in many of the Dark Knight's most iconic movie, TV, and comic appearances, and it's coming next year.</p>

<h3><em>Warhammer 40k: Dawn of War IV</em></h3>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-dawn-of-war-iv-gamescom-opening-night-live-2025.jpg?itok=SsQ15cXt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-dawn-of-war-iv-gamescom-opening-night-live-2025.jpg?itok=7nhSeNXN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dawn of War IV&nbsp;</em>brings the franchise back to its roots, by the looks of things.</figcaption></figure><p>The iconic RTS franchise returns, although it's not being helmed by its usual custodian Relic Entertainment this time around, instead being developed by&nbsp;<em>Iron Harvest&nbsp;</em>studio King Art. Happily, though, it looks exactly like&nbsp;<em>Dawn of War&nbsp;</em>should. 2026 for this one.</p>

<h3><em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</i>cross over</h3>

<p><em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>has crossed over with&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>before, and they're about to do so again when&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy</em>'s iconic Omega monster finds its way into <i>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</i>in late September.&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>is also getting itself a new&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>encounter in October.</p>

<h3><em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</em></h3>

<p>Next, Capcom showed off its upcoming hack-and-slash revival&nbsp;<em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</em>, and hey, it sure looks like an&nbsp;<em>Onimusha&nbsp;</em>game, complete with lots of fancy swordwork and creepy-looking enemies. No release date beyond 2026 for this one yet.</p>

<h3><em>Arknights: Endfield</em></h3>

<p>We got to see a moody trailer for the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Arknights&nbsp;</em>spinoff&nbsp;<em>Arknights: Endfield&nbsp;</em>next, and it'll marry action RPG gameplay with, uh, base-building and factory simulation. This one doesn't yet have a release window.</p>

<h3><em>Europa Universalis V</em></h3>

<p>If you're one of the players who was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-vii-slow-start-take-two" rel="nofollow">disappointed</a> by&nbsp;<em>Civilization VII</em>, then perhaps Paradox's (admittedly more complex)&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paradox-europa-universalis-v-project-caesar-maybe" rel="nofollow">Europa Universalis V</a>&nbsp;</em>will work better for you. We got to see it in action during Gamescom ONL, and it's coming on November 4th.</p>

<h3><em>Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion</em></h3>

<p>I didn't have a sequel to&nbsp;<em>Daemon x Machina&nbsp;</em>on my 2025 bingo card back when it was announced in 2023, but here we are. We got to see a new trailer for it during yesterday's ceremony, too. It's set for launch on September 5th.</p>

<h3><em>Void/Breaker</em></h3>

<p>Playstack and Stubby Games' futuristic roguelite shooter&nbsp;<em>Void/Breaker&nbsp;</em>is next, and hey, wouldn't you know it, the game is out right now. You can check it out right this instant if you think you'd be interested!</p>

<h3><em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>season 2</h3>




<p>Prime Video's second season of its acclaimed&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>show got itself an airing following&nbsp;<em>Void/Breaker</em>, and we got to see some clips of the show, which will be heading to New Vegas <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-season-3-confirmed-season-2-december" rel="nofollow">when it begins airing</a> on December 17th.</p>

<h3><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle&nbsp;</em>is coming to Switch 2</h3>

<p>A trailer for&nbsp;<em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle&nbsp;</em>confirmed that the game will be making its way to the Nintendo Switch 2 sometime next year, which is a pretty impressive feat of porting prowess. No specific release date for this yet, though.</p>

<h3><em>Deadpool VR</em></h3>

<p>Yep,&nbsp;<em>Deadpool VR&nbsp;</em>is still a thing, and we got to see a new trailer for it during Gamescom Opening Night Live last night. It looks exactly as irreverent and silly as you'd expect a&nbsp;<em>Deadpool&nbsp;</em>game to look, so bonus points for that, I guess.</p>

<h3><em>World of Tanks 2.0</em></h3>

<p>The "biggest update" in&nbsp;<em>World of Tanks</em>' history is scheduled to launch in early September, and it'll bring an entirely new tier of vehicles, a brand new map, and plenty more. If you're a&nbsp;<em>World of Tanks&nbsp;</em>devotee, you won't want to miss this.</p>

<h3><em>John Carpenter's Toxic Commando</em></h3>

<p>Saber Interactive's co-op FPS is shaping up to be the perfect tribute to the 80s oeuvre of its titular filmmaker, and a new trailer last night further confirmed that the game is going to be full of over-the-top insanity when it arrives next year.</p>

<h3><em>Death Scrolling</em></h3>

<p>Now here's something you don't see every day: an auto-scroller that scrolls upwards, not sideways.&nbsp;<em>Death Scrolling&nbsp;</em>comes to us from legendary publisher MicroProse and equally legendary developer Ron Gilbert, and it has plenty of fantasy-inflected action for you.</p>

<h3><em>Zero Parades</em></h3>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zero-parades-gamescom-opening-night-live-2025.jpg?itok=vdQ41vm_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zero-parades-gamescom-opening-night-live-2025.jpg?itok=-a6TkDmi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>ZA/UM has a lot to prove with&nbsp;<em>Zero Parades</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>ZA/UM's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zaum-project-c4-disco-elysium" rel="nofollow">new RPG</a> is called&nbsp;<em>Zero Parades</em>, and it's a "story-rich espionage RPG" in which you must "untangle a bloody web of intrigue at the End of History". Here's hoping ZA/UM, or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/disco-elysium-developer-zaum-confirms-game-cancellation-and-layoffs" rel="nofollow">what's left of it</a>, can pull this one off.</p>

<h3><em>Neverness to Everness</em></h3>

<p>A new trailer for Hotta's&nbsp;<em>Neverness to Everness&nbsp;</em>showed us that yes, the game definitely does look like a big ol' melange of everything HoYoverse is currently running, and no, we still don't have a release date.</p>

<h3><em>Unbeatable</em></h3>

<p>In this rhythm-action game, "music is illegal and you do crimes", according to D-Cell Games and publisher Playstack. I've got a bit of a bee in my bonnet about "rock'n'roll can save the world" stories, but I guess we'll see if this one can change my mind on November 6th.</p>

<h3><em>Honor of Kings: World</em></h3>

<p><em>Honor of Kings: World&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honor-of-kings-world-cross-platform-action-rpg" rel="nofollow">still exists</a>, and we got to see more of its, erm, world during a trailer last night. It all looks very grandiose and fantastical, although we still don't have any idea when we can actually play this one.</p>

<h3><em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em></h3>

<p>We're just a few weeks away from&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 4&nbsp;</em>now, and just in case the story was the part of this frenetic hack-and-slash game in which you're most interested, that's what last night's trailer focused on. More slashing, please!</p>

<h3><em>Cinder City</em></h3>




<p>Turns out NCSoft's Project LLL is actually&nbsp;<em>Cinder City</em>, an MMO shooter that takes place in an alternate-future version of Seoul devastated by a mysterious crisis. This one looks suitably ambitious, combining squad-based tactics, vehicles, and more.</p>

<h3><em>Time Takers</em></h3>

<p>Time (ahem) to see another live-service shooter now in the form of&nbsp;<em>Time Takers</em>, a team-based game in which "time is your lifeline - and every second is earned, spent, or lost in combat". It's another NCSoft game, and a playtest is coming to Steam soon.</p>

<h3><em>Silent Hill f</em></h3>

<p>We got another look at upcoming survival horror&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f&nbsp;</em>next, and though it looks a bit more action-oriented than I'm used to from this franchise, it seems as though Konami has its mojo back. We'll find out in late September.</p>

<h3><em>La Divina Commedia</em></h3>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/la-divina-commedia-gamescom-opening-night-live-2025.jpg?itok=6O4PKbXu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/la-divina-commedia-gamescom-opening-night-live-2025.jpg?itok=2cYJvMEG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Previous attempts at adapting&nbsp;<em>The Divine Comedy&nbsp;</em>haven't exactly been roaring successes.</figcaption></figure><p>Perhaps this attempt at adapting Dante Alighieri's famous&nbsp;<em>The Divine Comedy&nbsp;</em>into an action game will be more successful than EA's famously mid effort, although its "procedural extraction dungeon generation" system doesn't exactly fill me with confidence.</p>

<h3><em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em></h3>

<p>Yup, Bloober Team's upcoming survival horror game sure looks like a horror game alright. I'm on record as a Bloober hater, but perhaps, between this and&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2</em>, the studio can redeem itself in my eyes. I'm sure they're itching to do just that.</p>

<h3><em>The Outer Worlds 2</em></h3>

<p>Obsidian's RPG has some pretty big shoes to fill, not to mention an entire first game to apologize for (sorry, I'm on record as a hater for that as well). Let's hope the studio has learned its lesson and can deliver a satisfying RPG experience this time around!</p>

<h3><em>inZoi: Island Getaway</em></h3>

<p>Next, we got to see a DLC pack for Krafton's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-generative-ai-characters-pubg-inzoi" rel="nofollow">AI-filled</a>&nbsp;<em>Sims</em>-like&nbsp;<em>inZoi</em>, with&nbsp;<em>Island Getaway&nbsp;</em>bringing tons of idyllic new scenery and other features. It's out today, so if you love&nbsp;<em>inZoi</em>, you can already check it out!</p>

<h3><em>Fate Trigger</em></h3>

<p>Yup, that's right: it's another anime-style live-service shooter.&nbsp;<em>Fate Trigger&nbsp;</em>launches in the first quarter of 2026, and I can only speak for myself, but its art style makes it a little difficult for me to get particularly hyped for this one.</p>

<h3><em>The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin</em></h3>

<p>We got to see this anime action RPG in, well, action next, and there's a closed beta test on the cards as well, so if you want to get a chance to try out Netmarble's game, you can do just that.</p>

<h3><em>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault</em></h3>

<p>Next, we learned that Digital Sun and 11 bit studios'&nbsp;<em>Moonlighter 2&nbsp;</em>will be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/moonlighter-2-early-access-release-date" rel="nofollow">launching in Early Access on October 23rd</a>, bringing more action-RPG-slash-shop-management shenanigans with it.</p>

<h3><em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</em></h3>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-gamescom-opening-night-live.jpg?itok=xGJQwcRB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-gamescom-opening-night-live.jpg?itok=BBUMHq1E 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Could all the roadblocks finally have been removed?</figcaption></figure><p><em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>finally, finally, finally has a release date, and I really, really hope The Chinese Room and Paradox don't delay it again (unless it's absolutely necessary for quality, of course). October 21st for this one.</p>

<h3><em>Enshrouded</em></h3>

<p>Update 7 is coming soon for&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded</em>, and "Wake of the Water", as it's known, will bring lots of sunken treasures for you to plunder. The update is in the works now, although we don't know when it's landing just yet.</p>

<h3><em>Age of Empires IV</em></h3>

<p>The latest title in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Age of Empires&nbsp;</em>series of real-time strategy games is coming to the PlayStation 5, together with its&nbsp;<em>Dynasties of the East&nbsp;</em>DLC. The game launches for Sony's machine on November 4th.</p>

<h3><em>Cult of the Lamb</em></h3>

<p>Devolver Digital's beloved roguelite action-slash-management game (the composer of which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cult-of-lamb-composer-narayana-johnson-dies" rel="nofollow">we sadly lost last year</a>) is getting a "massive paid expansion" in the form of&nbsp;<em>Woolhaven&nbsp;</em>next year, bringing new weapons and much more for you to intimidate your followers with.</p>

<h3><em>World of Warcraft: Midnight</em></h3>




<p>Next up, we got a new cinematic trailer for the&nbsp;<em>World of Warcraft&nbsp;</em>expansion&nbsp;<em>Midnight</em>, which forms the next part of Chris Metzen's Worldsoul Saga, as well as some gameplay. It's coming next year, so make sure you're leveled accordingly.</p>

<h3><em>Project Spectrum</em></h3>

<p>You might not be able to tell it from the creepy and evocative trailer, but&nbsp;<em>Project Spectrum&nbsp;</em>is actually a multiplayer game; it's kind of like&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>meets&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown</em>, by the sound of things. No release date for this one yet.</p>

<h3><em>Ghost of Yōtei</em></h3>

<p>Hey, look at that.&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yōtei&nbsp;</em>is getting its own&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/co-op-is-coming-to-ghosts-of-tsushima" rel="nofollow"><em>Tsushima</em>-style multiplayer DLC</a> next year, bringing a "fantastical, supernatural setting" to contrast against the core game's historically-accurate locations. Cool stuff!</p>

<h3><em>Resident Evil Requiem</em></h3>

<p>If you were hoping for some actual, y'know, gameplay from&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>, you'd have left yesterday night's show disappointed, but perhaps more will be on the way soon. At any rate, we did get to see a fun and spooky snippet of new gameplay, so that's something, at least.</p>

<h3><em>Black Myth: Zhong Kui</em></h3>




<p>Lastly, we got to learn that Game Science is working on a brand new followup to last year's&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/black-myth-wukong-review-serious-monkey-business" rel="nofollow">which I rather liked</a>.&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Zhong Kui&nbsp;</em>will follow the titular Chinese folk hero and is currently in development.</p>

<hr><p>Well, that's everything! I hope you've enjoyed this recap of all things Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025.</p>
