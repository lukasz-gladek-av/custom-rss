Diamond Comic Distributors, the parent company of Alliance Game Distributors, filed for bankruptcy. This may impact the future of physical tabletop game supply.</p>

<h2>The Alliance Game Distributors Bankruptcy Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official <a href="https://diamondcomics.com/Article/279611-Diamond-Comic-Distributors-Files-Voluntary-Petition-for-Relief-Under-Chapter-11" rel="nofollow">press release</a> on their website, Diamond Comic Distributors has filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code.</p>

This money will go towards operating expenses and working capital to meet obligations with various associates and suppliers. This means this filing shouldn't affect any pre-existing shipping agreements they've had with distributors.</p>

<p>In addition, the report mentions a bid to purchase Alliance Game Distributors, a $39 million stalking horse bet by Canadian shipping company Universal Distribution. Alongside this bid is a signed non-binding letter by the company of intent to purchase Diamond UK. Naturally, this deal isn't set in stone, another company can up the bid, but $39 million is the current floor.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Universal Distribution is looking forward to working with the Alliance and Diamond UK teams to bring a stronger balance sheet and growth opportunities to retailers and suppliers. Both companies have deep roots in the industry, and we look forward to continuing that into the future,” said Angelo Exarhakos, President and CEO of Universal.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is major since Alliance Game Distributors is one of the tentpole distribution companies in the tabletop industry. Providing over 250 vendors board games, miniatures, TTRPGs, and gaming accessories worldwide. The company even published a tabletop consumer guide, Game Trade Magazine.</p>

<p>Alliance Game Distributors isn't the only one of Diamond's businesses up for sale. Other units up for sale are Diamond Book Distributors, Collectible Grading Authority, DIamond Select Toys, and the company's main toy, comic book, and collectible distribution lines.</p>

<p>If the purchase of Alliance Game Distributors goes through, Universal may be primed to be a new big name within the tabletop industry.</p>
