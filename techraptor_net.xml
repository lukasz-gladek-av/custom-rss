            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Game</em> has gone live on Kickstarter. Shout! Studios and Cryptozoic Entertainment aim to bring the quirky energy of the cult show about riffing on cheesy movies to gaming tables, and it is already a major success.</p><h2>The <em>Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Game</em> Kickstarter Campaign</h2><p>As the campaign page explains, <em>Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Game</em> is a competitive experience where you and your friends riff on key moments in chintzy sci-fi movies.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>In the broadest strokes, the game is similar to <em>Apples to Oranges</em> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cards-against-humanity-sues-spacex-for-15-million" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Cards Against Humanity</em>.</a> A Movie Moment card is drawn at random and placed in the playspace. This moment is from a notoriously bad movie featured on <em>Mystery Science Theater 3000</em>, including <em>Manos: The Hands of Fate</em>, and <em>Santa Claus Conquers the Martians</em>.</p><p>Each player has a hand of riff cards with different responses, and one player rotates as The Mads, or the judge. All players submit a riff card randomly to the judge, and whichever riff is the funniest gets that player points. Whoever has the most points at the end of the game is declared the winner.</p><p>Interestingly, the game does have some extra modes for more creative tables. Instead of Movie Moment cards, you can simply play a random movie and pause it at certain parts, prompting riff responses. The game even includes several dry-erase cards for submitting your own custom riff. With the right people, this game can turn into a competitive bad movie night blast.</p><picture>

<p>As part of the LinkedIn post, Sperry includes a sizzle reel of "features, updates, and creative ideas" that Three Fields was planning to bring to <em>Wreckreation </em>in the future.</p><p>She says she hopes that the reel might provide an "opportunity" in the form of another publisher who sees the "potential" of what the team was trying to build with the racing sandbox, but that even if this doesn't happen, the video will "stand as a testament" to Three Fields' "vision".</p><p>Although <em>Wreckreation </em>likely won't receive any further updates in future, there is one more planned before Christmas which will bring crossplay to the game, ensuring that you can play it alongside your friends on other platforms.</p><p>Three Fields is just one of a number of indie teams struggling with an increasingly difficult industry. Other studios, like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hyper-light-breaker-development-ending-layoffs" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="52ab77a2-436b-4612-9359-a78aaa4748d6" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Hyper Light Breaker </em>developer Heart Machine</a> and <em>Metal: Hellsinger </em>studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-hellsinger-the-outsiders-shut-down-funcom" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7586356a-08b1-450a-a88c-9b10c217225a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">The Outsiders</a>, have been hit by layoffs or closures as well, and it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crystal-dynamics-layoffs-november-2025" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9d6386f8-4642-4532-8c75-667f88869d6e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">not just indie outfits either</a>.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see whether Three Fields' work gets picked up by another publisher, but for now, unfortunately, it looks like the team won't get the chance to bring their vision for <em>Wreckreation </em>to fruition.</p><p>If you do want to check the game out, you can pick it up now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1594040/Wreckreation/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4389-PPSA09823_00-WRECKCREATION000" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/wreckreation/9n0llb6pg0r4" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
