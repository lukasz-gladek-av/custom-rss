            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has announced that it's moving some of&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' upcoming endgame content forward, so it'll no longer be appearing in the forthcoming Title Update 3, but much sooner instead.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2246340/view/534356720697222823" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post on Steam</a>, the studio says that while the endgame content in question was originally planned for Title Update 3 (which is scheduled for late September), it'll now be arriving on August 13th as part of a smaller update instead.</p>

<p>You can now look forward to a new quest difficulty level and a new rewards system arriving in just a few weeks. The reward system will grant you Talismans with "random skill combinations" for completing quests at the new tier, according to Capcom.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-endgame-content-august-flying.jpg?itok=kkTyDZw- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-endgame-content-august-flying.jpg?itok=kn6YQvAu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>More endgame content is coming to&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, and sooner than you might think.</figcaption></figure><p>This does mean that update 1.021, which was originally going to be a more straightforward balance update, will arrive slightly later than planned. However, it'll now contain adjustments for "more weapons than originally planned", so it's not all bad news.</p>

<p>Presumably, since the new quest level and Talisman system are moving out of Title Update 3, Capcom will have something substantial planned to replace those features in order to bring the update in line with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-1-release-date" rel="nofollow">scope</a> of previous <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">Title Updates</a>.</p>

<p>The studio is remaining tight-lipped about that for now, however, so it's probably going to be a while before we hear more about exactly what's coming as part of&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' third major update.</p>

<p>In the meantime, though, Capcom has announced that the Flamefete event, which is currently underway, will be extended by another week in order to give you more time to unlock its various rewards and try out its quests. It'll now be coming to a close on August 13th.</p>

Although it's been met with a rather <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">varied response</a> from its player base, that hasn't stopped the game from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-10m" rel="nofollow">breaking sales records</a> for Capcom, both for its franchise and for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-steam-player-record" rel="nofollow">the company as a whole</a>.</p>
