            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Laps Games has announced the Early Access release date for <em>Valorborn</em>, a sandbox RPG in which the world continues "with or without the player".</p><p><em>Valorborn </em>will be arriving in Early Access on April 15th, and if you're a fan of systems-driven RPGs like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/kingdom-come-deliverance" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6e4b0179-74b4-44fb-9823-e5f2d834f37f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em></a><em> </em>or even the <em>Stalker </em>series, then it sounds as though <em>Valorborn </em>will be right up your alley.</p><p>Laps Games describes <em>Valorborn</em>'s world as one "built around systemic simulation", so you can expect villages to continue about their business even when you're not around, as well as faction power struggles and "dangers moving across the land whether [you] intervene or not".</p><figure role="group">

<p>Laps Games also says that <em>Valorborn</em>'s world will be fully realized, which means that "every building, cave, and point of interest is fully enterable" and there will be "no fake doors or decorative entrances".</p><p>You'll be able to choose on what level you want to engage with <em>Valorborn</em>. Will you be a sellsword, fighting off threats for coin? Perhaps you'll take the role of a hunter, living off the land and eschewing the benefits of civilization.</p><p>Whatever you choose to be, you'll be able to take on <em>Valorborn </em>alone or assemble a party to experience the game's world with you. Bear in mind, though, that this is very much a single-player project, so you won't be able to play alongside your friends.</p><p>According to Laps Games, permadeath will be "a core part of the experience" in <em>Valorborn</em>, but setbacks are intended to be "part of each player's story rather than a dead end".</p>
<p>Over the course of <em>Valorborn</em>'s time in Early Access, you can expect more kingdoms to explore, more starting options for new journeys, and "more ways for adventurers to define their own origin".</p><p><em>Valorborn </em>arrives on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3372530/Valorborn/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on April 15th. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Paizo may have announced their latest <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/pathfinder" rel="nofollow"><em>Pathfinder</em></a> supplement earlier than expected. Their website recently listed the new book, <em>Pathfinder: Feybound</em>, but has recently removed the announcement. In that brief time, however, details were gleamed.</p><h2>The <em>Pathfinder: Feybound</em> Announcement and Removal</h2><p>According to the keen reporting of <a href="https://www.enworld.org/threads/paizo-accidentally-reveals-pathfinder-feybound-book.718090/" rel="nofollow">EN World's</a> Christian Hoffer, Paizo posted on their website details on <em>Pathfinder: Feybound</em>. As the name implies, the book is a Fey-themed supplement for the world of Golarion, giving adventurers and GMs further insight and knowledge about the beings of fairy tales.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>Unfortunately, further information on the book is scarce. But, since this is the internet, some details have made it out into the wild. This includes the book including a gazetteer on the First World: the infinite plane of wilderness home to traveling faerie courts and extreme, unpredictable weather, and new information on the Eldest, the ancient godlike beings who reside there.</p><p>As for player options, the book will contain new fey-themed character archetypes and new fey ancestries like the faun, nymph, gremlin, and sprite. There are also new fadrim versatile heritages, allowing you to add a bit of fey magic to other characters. Lastly, the book will contain new spells, including curses, transformations, and memory manipulation.</p><p>For now, that is all that is available on <em>Pathfinder: Feybound</em>. Links to the book's listing go to a dead page. No MSRP. No release date. It can be speculated that book may be part of an upcoming Paizo Live stream, which highlights upcoming adventure paths and supplements for the game.</p><p>This makes sense since the book marks the debut of fey material in <em>Pathfinder Second Edition</em>. Which is made more intriguing since the prior edition was light on fey-material. There were a handful of adventure paths featuring fey, but that's about it. By contrast, getting a setting on the level of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/pathfinder-lost-omens-highhelm-review" rel="nofollow">Highhelm</a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/pathfinder-returns-to-tian-xia-this-october" rel="nofollow"><em>Tian Xia</em></a> &nbsp;is sure to make fans excited to learn more.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p><span><div>
