      <div><p>Capcom has revealed the global release timings for&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, so we now know what time each region around the world will be able to get its hands on the game.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1894620982939193800" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Capcom both reveals the timings and also reminds players that pre-load is now available, so if you want to be able to play&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>as soon as it launches in your region, you can download the relevant data now.</p>

<p>For many regions, there will be a slight delay between the game's launch on PC and its arrival on consoles, and the timing isn't the same around the world, either.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fear-gog-preservation-program-monolith<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GOG has announced that it's adding 2005 horror shooter&nbsp;<em>F.E.A.R.&nbsp;</em>to its Preservation Program ahead of schedule in order to "recognize" the contributions of shuttered developer Monolith.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1894753901540196781" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, GOG says that while&nbsp;<em>F.E.A.R. Platinum&nbsp;</em>- which collects the base game and its expansions - was due to be added at "a later timeframe", the release has been accelerated to honor Monolith Productions.</p>

<p>For context, it was revealed yesterday that Monolith was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monolith-productions-and-more-reportedly-closed-by-wb-games" rel="nofollow">closed down by parent company Warner Bros</a>, and that the studio's upcoming&nbsp;<em>Wonder Woman&nbsp;</em>game has been canceled.&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus&nbsp;</em>developer Player First was also shut down following the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-flop-warner-bros-100m" rel="nofollow">failure of the crossover fighter</a>, as was mobile studio Warner Bros San Diego.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/f.e.a.r.-gog-preservation-program-shooting.jpg?itok=NhAk4SMW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/f.e.a.r.-gog-preservation-program-shooting.jpg?itok=p7q3MxAQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>F.E.A.R. Platinum&nbsp;</em>is now a part of the GOG Preservation Program.</figcaption></figure><p>Along with&nbsp;<em>F.E.A.R.</em>, GOG says that "other Monolith icons" will join the Preservation Program, and that "even more news" will be shared regarding the Program tomorrow as well. These are exciting times for game preservation.</p>

<p>If you're wondering what the GOG Preservation Program is, it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gog-preservation-program" rel="nofollow">an initiative</a> started by the GOG folks to ensure that certain PC games will always be supported, regardless of whether they're receiving official support from their publishers or not.</p>

<p>Many games have already been added to the program, including titles that have been delisted by their publishers, like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gog-preservation-program-warcraft-delisting" rel="nofollow">the first two&nbsp;<em>Warcraft&nbsp;</em>games</a>. Other games that are already part of the project include classics like&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil</em>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dino-crisis-1-2-gog-rerelease" rel="nofollow"><em>Dino Crisis</em></a>, and&nbsp;<em>Fallout</em>, plus many more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gog-preservation-program-dino-crisis.jpg?itok=4wiGnRzs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gog-preservation-program-dino-crisis.jpg?itok=gSSQcij3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dino Crisis&nbsp;</em>is just one of many games already bearing the GOG Preservation Program stamp.</figcaption></figure><p>Other Monolith games that might make it to the Preservation Program include the likes of classic FPS&nbsp;<em>Blood</em>, cult shooter <i>The Operative: No One Lives Forever</i>, and, of course, the two&nbsp;<em>F.E.A.R.&nbsp;</em>sequels.&nbsp;<em>Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor&nbsp;</em>is already part of the program, but&nbsp;<em>Shadow of War&nbsp;</em>has yet to be added.</p>

<p>Sadly, Monolith and Player First are just two of the latest casualties in what is somehow becoming an increasingly tumultuous time for the industry. Other studios to close in recent months include NetEase's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-studio-shockingly-closed-by-netease-laying-off-everyone" rel="nofollow">Seattle&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>studio</a>, Dr. Disrespect's ex-studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/midnight-society-shutdown-dr-disrespect" rel="nofollow">Midnight Society</a>, and some of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing" rel="nofollow">Ubisoft's studios</a> as well.</p>

<p>If you want to support GOG and its efforts to preserve Monolith's games, you can check out&nbsp;<em>F.E.A.R. Platinum&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/fear_platinum" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right now via the storefront</a>.</p>
