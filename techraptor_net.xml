            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/mixtape-preview-bygone-era-captured-beautifully<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Mixtape </em>is the perfect encapsulation of the wonderfully weird feelings of growing up, standing on the edge and looking at the fall to adulthood. Every frame is gorgeous, every emotion powerfully evocative.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As is no surprise, <em>Mixtape </em>is designed around music. You play one of three teenage friends who are determined to make their last night together one they’ll never forget. Each track of the tape is announced with a key frame showing the song and the artist before it starts playing.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Growing Up is Weird and Wonderful</h2>

<p>Preparing for that last night together, each one of those tracks from the eponymous mixtape sends you off into a memory of some formative event in growing up. Each memory is lovely and powerfully relatable, ranging from a first kiss to running from the cops crashing a house party.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In essence, <em>Mixtape </em>is a John Hughes film made in the modern age through the medium of video games. It’s about the awkwardness of growing up, the sadness of leaving things behind, and the rebellious attitude of youth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In one, you remember your first kiss. In silhouette, your character leans in to get a kiss from a boy who she doesn’t much care for but wanted to get her first kiss out of the way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cut to an insanely detailed set of teeth and tongues. Each thumbstick controls its own tongue as the writhe, slap, and slither together. It is awkward, hilarious, and a perfect way to show just how weird it all can be.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Every memory is a little story told about their lives that is a great window into the era the game is portraying. Quick cuts to static images doodled on in the background, like MTV, and flourishes of art are everywhere.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Simply put, <em>Mixtape </em>has a stellar aesthetic that is impeccably drawn together. It is extremely effective.</p>

<h2>Mixtape's Visual, Sound, and Gameplay Design Come Together Perfectly</h2>

<p>Even just the visual design of the neighborhoods and the roads the characters skate on works. There is an authentic realism to them that fits the somewhat cartoonish characters that inhabit it very well.</p>

<p>The opening scene sees you and your friends skating down a huge hill, each of you yelling out "Car!" when one is coming to avoid it, while leaves litter the ground and the greenery passes you by. It is a beautiful introduction into the world, and the lighting ties it all together into one of the better looking stretches of games in memory.</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, seeing as all of the memories and the game is named after a mixtape, the tracks fit the moods of whatever is going on perfectly. <em>Mixtape </em>features a huge list of amazing artist, like&nbsp;The Smashing Pumpkins, the Cure, DEVO, Iggy Pop, and a whole lot more.</p>

<p>Obviously, the music is great in and of itself, but a lot of thought and care has been put into making sure each track enhances what we see and play on screen. Gaming's best moments are when gameplay, visuals, and sound all come together as one, and <em>Mixtape </em>is designed to hit you over the head with that again and again as we move from track to track down memory lane.</p>

<h2>Mixtape Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>My brief preview of <em>Mixtape </em>makes me confident in saying that it will be the best coming of age story put to video games that I can think of. It’s a classic story of teenagers moving through the world as they try to figure it out.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I can’t wait to soak it all in and vibe with a soundtrack that will transport me to a past I may never have experienced, but it’s one that everyone will relate to. If I had to guess, I imagine there will be a fair few people that find many aspects of it eerily biographical.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/postal-2-remake-postal-2-redux<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Team Beef, as well as publishers Flat2VR Studios and Running With Scissors, have announced&nbsp;<em>Postal 2 Redux</em>, a ground-up remake of the original&nbsp;<em>Postal 2&nbsp;</em>that's hitting Kickstarter sometime later this summer.</p>

<p>According to a press release,&nbsp;<em>Postal 2 Redux&nbsp;</em>will serve as "part modernization, part love-letter". It'll utilize the Unity engine, rather than the original's "creaking Unreal 1.5 engine", and it'll boast a host of other improvements and tweaks besides.</p>

<p>Team Beef and Flat2VR say the goal with&nbsp;<em>Postal 2 Redux&nbsp;</em>is to "deliver the ultimate, no-excuse&nbsp;<em>Postal 2&nbsp;</em>sandbox". The game's world will apparently be "rebuilt with no limits, ready for every screen you own, and still happy to let you finish your errands with a shovel".</p>

<p>Additionally, you can expect a world with "zero" loading times, as well as smarter crowd AI with "improved pathfinding", new weapon and explosion physics, and "fully propped, breakable interiors". Not only that, but lovable dog Champ is also getting a "Champ 2.0" overhaul.</p>

<p>The three studios say that&nbsp;<em>Postal 2 Redux&nbsp;</em>is aiming to land on "every modern box that'll boot", including the Switch 2, by the sounds of things. Notably, the list of platforms doesn't include the Xbox One, so hopefully, you've upgraded to a Series X|S if you want to play&nbsp;<em>Postal 2 Redux</em>.</p>

<p>Whether or not the game does come to all of those platforms, however, will be dependent on how the upcoming <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/postal2redux/postal-2-redux" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Kickstarter campaign</a> performs. Despite that, however, Team Beef's Grant Bagwell says the campaign is just an opportunity to "shove even more nonsense in", so it seems the game will happen either way.</p>




<p>This remake follows in the footsteps of 2016's&nbsp;<em>Postal Redux</em>, albeit handled by a different development team to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/postal-redux-review-no-return-address" rel="nofollow">that game</a>. It'll also technically serve as the seventh full game in the&nbsp;<em>Postal&nbsp;</em>franchise (not counting mobile games and joke titles, of course).</p>

<p><em>Postal 2 Redux</em>'s Kickstarter campaign begins later this year, although we don't have a concrete date for it yet. Stay tuned for more.</p>
