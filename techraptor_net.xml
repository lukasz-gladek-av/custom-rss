            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-summer-show-date-2025-the-outer-worlds-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Summer Game Fest organizer Geoff Keighley has revealed the date for this summer's Xbox Games Showcase, and a major upcoming Xbox Game Studios project will be getting some coverage during the show.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1909954474078319008" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, the show will air on June 8th, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/summer-game-fest-2025-date-revealed" rel="nofollow">two days after</a> Keighley's main Summer Game Fest show. Unlike that presentation, however, Xbox's show will be digital-only, so there's no way to attend it in person, unfortunately.</p>

<p>Xbox's show will be directly followed by an extended presentation for&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>, which Keighley says will serve as "a deep dive into Obsidian's new RPG". Given that the game is currently scheduled for a 2025 release, I wouldn't be surprised if we got a release date during the show.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-outer-worlds-2-xbox-summer-show-gun.jpg?itok=7Eeb8_RU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-outer-worlds-2-xbox-summer-show-gun.jpg?itok=VOJspjv6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Outer Worlds 2&nbsp;</em>will be shown in detail during the upcoming Xbox show.</figcaption></figure><p>Xbox is promising "a look at upcoming titles from across [its] first-party studios" during the presentation, as well as "incredible new titles from [its] third-party partners across the globe".</p>

<p>The show for&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>, meanwhile, will "bring you inside the walls of Obsidian Entertainment", and you can expect "new gameplay, details, and developer insights" too. In short, if you've been waiting for more information about Obsidian's new RPG, then Xbox's summer event will have you covered.</p>

<p>According to Xbox, the summer show will be available on several platforms in more than 40 languages, and both British and American Sign Language will be included. You'll also be able to access audio descriptions in English.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fable-xbox-summer-games-showcase-2025.jpg?itok=42gbWQrC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fable-xbox-summer-games-showcase-2025.jpg?itok=T5mfThg5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Could we see more&nbsp;<em>Fable&nbsp;</em>during the Xbox show?</figcaption></figure><p>Other upcoming Xbox games include the likes of Playground Games'&nbsp;<em>Fable</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fable-reboot-delayed-2026" rel="nofollow">delayed until 2026 back in February</a>. It's possible Xbox will reveal more about the game during the summer show, but don't expect a release date.</p>

<p>We might also hear more about <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/inxile-clockwork-revolution-xbox-games-showcase" rel="nofollow">inXile's upcoming RPG&nbsp;<em>Clockwork Revolution</em></a>, as well as Team Ninja and PlatinumGames'&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em><em>.&nbsp;</em>Rare's&nbsp;<em>Everwild</em>, which has essentially been absent from Xbox's slate <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-trailer-shown-at-xbox-games-event" rel="nofollow">since 2020</a>, could also get a reveal, but don't hold out hope for that one.</p>

<p>In any case, the Xbox Summer Games Showcase airs on June 8th at 1pm Eastern (that's 10am Pacific and 6pm GMT). Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/magic-gathering-final-fantasy-leak-tells-us-plenty-about-set<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>While <em>Tarkir: Dragonstorm</em> may just be releasing now (along with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/tarkir-dragonstorm-commander-deck-reviews" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Tarkir: Dragonstorm Commander Deck Reviews - Roaring Fun!"><em>Tarkir: Dragonstorm </em>commander decks</a>), shipping errors from Wizards of the Coast are pulling eyes to June’s release: <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Magic: The Gathering">Magic: The Gathering </a>- Final Fantasy</em>.</p>

<p>First reports came in that some prerelease kits were sent to Brazil by mistake instead of <em>Tarkir: Dragonstorm </em>ones, but those have managed to remain underwraps. Over the weekend a second leak emerged: the <em>Magic: The Gathering – Final Fantasy </em>Starter Kit was leaked in Spanish and it can tell us a number of things about the upcoming Universes Beyond set.</p>

<h3>A New Land Subtype</h3>

<p>In the beginner friendly starter decks, we see new dual lands for both Sephiroth and Cloud, producing mana in their colors. These lands follow what we often see in these types of products: they come into play tapped and produce one mana of either type. What’s special is that there is a new land subtype here: City.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-city-lands-spanish.jpg?itok=2SqKAT2X 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-city-lands-spanish.jpg?itok=Rc1991sT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Neither of the lands do anything with the type, but in the past this has been used with types like <a href="https://scryfall.com/search?q=type%3Agate+game%3Apaper&amp;unique=cards&amp;as=grid&amp;order=name" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Gates in MTG">Gates</a>(in <em>Battle For Baldur’s Gate </em>and <em>Foundations</em>), <a href="https://scryfall.com/search?q=type%3Adesert+game%3Apaper&amp;unique=cards&amp;as=grid&amp;order=name" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Deserts in MTG">Deserts</a> (most recently in <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/outlaws-of-thunder-junction-most-wanted-review-and-upgrade-guide" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Outlaws of Thunder Junction Most Wanted Review and Upgrade Guide"><em>Outlaws of Thunder Junction</em></a>), and several other times. These lands are not among those unique to the starter sets based on their collector numbers (those over 500 like the rares), so they can be expected to be seen in the main set, along with some payoffs for having them.</p>

<h3>Choose A Job: A New Living Weapon Variant</h3>

<p>For the second time we’re seeing a variant on the mechanic <a href="https://scryfall.com/search?q=o%3A%22living+weapon%22+game%3Apaper&amp;unique=cards&amp;as=grid&amp;order=name" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Living Weapon cards">Living Weapon</a>, as Choose a Job follows the ground it and <a href="https://scryfall.com/search?q=o%3A%22For+Mirrodin%22+game%3Apaper&amp;unique=cards&amp;as=grid&amp;order=name" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="For Mirrodin! cards">For Mirrodin!</a> previously explored, for the first time without any mirrans or phyrexians around. Honoring the job system that has a long legacy in Final Fantasy, each of these equipment represent one job that might be chosen and taught to one of your troops, or in this case a nameless and colorless 1/1 Hero brought with it.</p>

<p>That Hero token is equipped with the equipment which also gives it a creature type, a buff, and maybe an ability. We see what is Warrior’s Blade for example costing 3R, and giving equipped creature +3/+2 and turning it into a Warrior. Meanwhile Samurai Katana is only 2R giving +2/+2, trample, haste and the Samurai creature type. It’s not only red as the White Mage’s Rod shows a non-sword type weapon at 1W, giving equipped creature +1/+1, cleric, and whenever the creature attacks, you gain 1 life.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-equipment_0.jpg?itok=5fgPn1fc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-equipment_0.jpg?itok=XMJecO9X 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The equip costs on these are pretty expensive, 5 for Warrior’s Blade, and Samurai Katana, and 3 for White Mage’s Rod. That fits what we’ve seen in the past, as what you are paying for on the front generally is the creature, and then the equip is the cost to move around, rather than a split with most equipment you see. Warrior’s Blade gives you a 4/3 Hero Warrior, Samurai Katana a 3/3 Trample, Haste, Hero Samurai, and White Mage’s Rod a 2/2 Hero Cleric who gains life.</p>

<p>Not all equipment in the set will be Choose A Job either if that concerns you. Ultima Weapon fills the role of a very big equipment without any of that, and is a rare unique to the starter decks. It costs 7, and also equips for 7 but gives +7/+7 to the creature barring it, who when it attacks can destroy target creature an opponent controls.</p>

<h3>Dragoons Represent</h3>

<p>Dragoons have a long history in Final Fantasy, being a common job in it, and the jumping lancer is an iconic part of the series. With Dragoon’s Lance (another Choose A Job equipment) we see that they are reasonably being typed as Knights, as that equipment gives +1/+0, and makes them a Knight. The biggest part here is how they are capturing the Dragoon flavor though.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragoons-lance.jpg?itok=gMWitMgx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragoons-lance.jpg?itok=b8lCDoO5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It jumped in at the last chance!</figcaption></figure><p>For this, they are using a <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/plst/M10-59/jump" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Jump">Jump</a> type effect. During your turn, the creature has flying, meaning it can attack from above, but it can’t defend there. It’s a great flavor fit, and one imagines that we’ll see multiple cards with it in the set.</p>

<h3>More 9999 Representation</h3>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/343/jumbo-cactuar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Jumbo Cactuar">Jumbo Cactuar</a> got everyone’s attention with it’s ability to get +9999/+0 on attack when it was revealed in the early <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/final-fantasy-magic-gathering-crossover-brings-classic-art-and-new-mechanics" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Final Fantasy Magic: The Gathering Crossover Brings Classic Art and New Mechanics"><em>Magic: The Gathering – Final Fantasy </em></a>showing, but it isn’t the only card that’s going to represent it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/overkill.jpg?itok=GYoxsS3t 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/overkill.jpg?itok=vcnS2tWd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sure, it might translate more to Exterminate, but Overkill fits the English FF localizations.</figcaption></figure><p>With what I believe is ‘Overkill’ (translations are divided on this as it’s not just strict translation, but considering also <em>Final Fantasy </em>translations), we see a removal spell that channels this energy. A 2B costed Instant, it gets target creature -0/-9999 until end of turn, killing almost any creature you can find in <em>Magic: The Gathering </em>that has been the beneficiary of an infinite, or near-infinite combo. Like the rest of the non-rares, it is also from the main set, so you can expect to see it running around as an uncommon in Play Boosters too.</p>

<p>There’s even more to be found throughout the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MTGRumors/comments/1jt1xyj/ff_starterkit/?share_id=YeMj8UkrS2dqmlOVPeuDV" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="MTG Rumors Subreddit thread with leaked images and translations">leaked images</a>, including the fact that we’re seeing a fair number of Japanese artists on these, the starter kits will have beautiful full art lands, and there’s rich representation of games across the series.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/diablo-4-roadmap-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/diablo-4-roadmap-for-2025-promises-plenty-of-new-stuff-through-the-year.1159314/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/diablo-4-roadmap-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Blizzard has revealed the roadmap for&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4&nbsp;</em>throughout 2025, and it's got plenty of new stuff to tide you over until 2026, although it's apparently proven controversial among the game's player base.</p>

<p>In a post on the official&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4&nbsp;</em><a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24189529/the-age-of-hatred-persists-diablo-iv-2025-roadmap" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, Blizzard says the&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4&nbsp;</em>roadmap will allow you to "experience the spread of Mephisto's influence through new seasonal themes and questlines", continuing the game's overarching "Age of Hatred" theme, which began with its launch back in 2023.</p>

<p>New sets of Powers will come in each quarter of the year, but here's the catch: they won't be permanent additions. Instead, they'll work on Blizzard's so-called "borrowed power" philosophy, whereby you'll be able to unlock certain upgrades but they won't persist between seasons.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/diablo-4-roadmap-2025-full.jpg?itok=IbhZaV7V 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/diablo-4-roadmap-2025-full.jpg?itok=RVJoC8CH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Diablo 4</em>'s roadmap has plenty of stuff for you, but a lot of it is temporary.</figcaption></figure><p>As you'll know if you've been playing&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4&nbsp;</em>for the past few months, witchcraft is the major theme of January through April, which brought new Witchcraft Powers, Occult Gems, and more.</p>

<p>Between April and July, Belial's Return will bring Boss Powers, a new activity, and, perhaps most important of all, an earnable feline pet to keep you company through those long dungeon treks.</p>

<p>Sins of the Horadrim brings Horadric Powers (as you might expect) and Dungeon Escalation, which will allow you to ratchet up the intensity of&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4</em>'s dungeons. Finally, at the end of the year, Infernal Chaos brings changes to the Infernal Hordes mode, as well as new Powers and more.</p>

<p>As you can probably imagine, fans <a href="https://www.icy-veins.com/d4/news/year-of-borrowed-powers-for-diablo-4/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">don't seem to be happy</a> about&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4</em>'s continuation of the "borrowed powers" system, and there also seems to be some consternation about Blizzard's failure to communicate exactly what the aforementioned Powers will actually add to players' arsenals.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/diablo-4-roadmap-2025-gameplay.jpg?itok=69eR5sGD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/diablo-4-roadmap-2025-gameplay.jpg?itok=NpsXD0uO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Players have reacted with consternation to&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4</em>'s borrowed powers updates.</figcaption></figure><p>Permanent changes are, however, on their way to&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4</em>. They include new quality-of-life improvements, new Lair Bosses, and keyboard and mouse support for console, plus more.</p>

<p><em>Diablo 4&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2344520/Diablo_IV/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/diablo-iv/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/diablo-iv-standard-edition/9n8117tm8jl3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.
