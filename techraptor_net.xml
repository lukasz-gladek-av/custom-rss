            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>developer Heart Machine has announced that it's ending development on the game, and that several of its staff members will be laid off as well.</p>

<p>In a statement provided to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/heart-machine-making-layoffs-and-ending-development-on-hyper-light-breaker" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Game Developer</a>, Heart Machine says it intends to "wrap up" work on the open-world roguelike action game, and that as a result, the studio will be "part[ing] ways with a number of talented team members".</p>

<p>According to Heart Machine, this outcome was "the only one available given the circumstances". The developer puts the layoffs and&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker</em>'s development closure down to "shifts in funding, corporate consolidation, and the uncertain environment" faced by many studios of a similar size to itself.</p>

Heart Machine also told Game Developer that it intends to leave the game in as "meaningful and as polished and complete" a state as possible prior to ending work on it.</p>

<p>As such, an update for the game is set to arrive in January, which the studio says will attempt to "refine what [it] can, complete key systems, and have the game culminate in a satisfying punctuation point".</p>

<p>However, Heart Machine doesn't clarify whether&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>will be getting a 1.0 release or whether it'll essentially remain an Early Access game in perpetuity. The studio simply says there won't be any more updates or question-and-answer sessions for the game this year.</p>

<p><em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>launched in January this year to a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hyper-light-breaker-fixes-coming" rel="nofollow">mixed response from its players</a>, who cited the game's performance, accessibility issues, and gameplay imbalance as drawbacks. A <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hyper-light-breaker-roadmap-first-update" rel="nofollow">roadmap arrived in February</a> promising to address many of those issues, but it doesn't seem to have turned any fortunes around.</p>
