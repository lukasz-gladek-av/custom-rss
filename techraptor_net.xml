            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-player-count-5m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Focus Entertainment has announced that the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>player count has hit a pretty impressive milestone just under three months after the game's initial launch.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/Focus_entmt/status/1862442675590377854" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post on social media platform X</a>, Focus says that&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>has attracted five million players since its release on September 9th. The studio specifically hasn't framed this number as sales, so it's possible it includes those who are streaming the game as part of subscription services like GeForce Now.</p>

<p>Still, five million players is pretty solid, and it's likely the bulk of that number is players who've bought the game, so Focus and Saber can rest assured that they've kept the legacy of original&nbsp;<em>Space Marine&nbsp;</em>developer Relic Entertainment (which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sega-relic-entertainment-layoffs" rel="nofollow">recently went independent</a>) intact.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-player-count-fight.jpg?itok=GRYEJTDP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-player-count-fight.jpg?itok=-T3M2HQp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>proves there's still an audience for good old-fashioned games.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>was originally announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-announcement-from-game-awards-2021" rel="nofollow">during the 2021 Game Awards ceremony</a>, alongside the likes of Bokeh Game Studio's&nbsp;<em>Slitterhead&nbsp;</em>and Remedy's&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2</em>.</p>

<p>It sees original game protagonist Captain Titus making a return, although this time, he's not battling the greenskin hordes; instead, he's fighting Tyranids, as well as Chaos Space Marines.</p>

<p>Story-wise, the game sees Titus disgraced following the events of the original game. After serving his penance, Titus is admitted back into the Ultramarines chapter, where he's tasked with exterminating a Tyranid infestation on the planet of Kadaku.</p>




<p>In gameplay terms,&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>&nbsp;is, much like its predecessor, a third-person shooter that emphasises both ranged and melee combat. Titus has access to a variety of&nbsp;lore-faithful weapons, including the all-important bolter, as well as a chainsword and a range of explosives.</p>

<p>Alongside its single-player campaign (which can also be enjoyed in co-op),&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>also offers a co-op Operations mission mode and PvP multiplayer, and Focus and Saber have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-roadmap" rel="nofollow">pledged to update the game regularly with new content</a>. What's more, these updates will <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-marine-2-no-microtransactions" rel="nofollow">never take the form of microtransactions</a>.</p>
