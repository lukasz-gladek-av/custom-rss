  </picture><p>The board game's official <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/manticgames/dreadball-all-stars-the-sci-fi-sports-game" rel="nofollow">Kickstarter page</a> does into further detail. <em>Dreadball: All Stars</em> is a standalone version of the game. You don't need any prior knowledge, miniatures, or materials to enjoy it. That accessibility continues to its game components and its rules. Miniatures are preassembled, team rosters are fixed, and the rules have been streamlined, letting players get into the action immediately.</p><p>The team bringing the game together are recognizable tabletop veterans. The design team team includes Alessio Calvatore (<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bolt-action-3rd-edition-review-snapping-into-action" rel="nofollow"><em>Bolt Action</em></a>, <em>Warhammer 40,000</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/mordheim-city-of-damned-review-doesnt-give-damn" rel="nofollow"><em>Mordheim: City of the Damned</em></a><em>)</em>, artist Stefan Kopinski, and the original creator of the iconic <em>Blood Bowl</em>, Jervis Johnson.</p><blockquote><p>"If Blood Bowl is like American Football, then All-Stars is like a full-contact version of NBA Basketball, with lots of opportunities to score, and just as many opportunities to flatten the opposition!" - Jervis Johnson.</p></blockquote><p>A copy of <em>Dreadball: All Stars</em> will contain everything you need for two players to start playing. It will include a four-team box, and additional pledge levels will include more teams, arenas, rules for championship play, and 6-player battle royale. The game is designed for players ages 12 and up and a single match can be completed in about 60 minutes.</p><p>The Kickstarter campaign for the game will go live on March 17.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
