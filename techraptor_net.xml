            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-chroma-color-blindness<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has released a free color blindness simulation tool to help developers understand how to make their games accessible to those with three major types of color blindness.</p>

<p>The tool's name is Chroma, and it's available on <a href="https://github.com/ubisoft/Chroma" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a> as an open-source kit. It won't cost you anything to use it, either, so if you're a developer and you want to know how to make your game better for colorblind folks, Ubisoft's got you covered.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-gb/article/72j7U131efodyDK64WTJua" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Ubisoft's official website, Chroma's purpose is to "accurately replicate" the experience of colorblind gamers and help developers to "create accessible content to meet [those players'] needs".</p>

<p>Since Chroma is open-source, developers are welcome to "benefit from it, provide feedback, and contribute to its future development", according to Tisserand. That's a pretty nice touch.</p>

<p>You can use Chroma on either single or dual screens, and it's hotkey-compatible as well. What's more, you can customize its overlay to make it look the way that works best for you.</p>

<p>QC product manager Jawad Shakil says Chroma was created to "mak[e] color blindness accessibility a natural part of the creative and testing process", and that the Chroma team's work is "already making a difference in how we design games with accessibility in mind".</p>

Games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/naughty-dog-showcases-expansive-last-of-us-part-1-accessibility-features" rel="nofollow"><em>The Last of Us Part 1</em></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-accessibility-options" rel="nofollow">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a></em>, among many others,&nbsp;are launching with options like color blindness modes and audio descriptions, and titles that don't launch with these concessions often receive them as updates.</p>

<p>Ubisoft's color blindness tool Chroma is available to download and use right now for free.</p>
