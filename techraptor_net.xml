            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Just like the seasons, everything changes in the Jwar Isles. These developments are reflected in the Cycle Decks, and we've been given a first look at some of the cards in the next. In this article, we'll exclusively reveal 5 new cards from the <em>Bushido</em> Consequences Cycle Deck, which is available to preorder now.</p>

<p>We've been covering <em>Bushido&nbsp;</em>for years, so if you'd like to learn more about the game, check out <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/bushido-risen-sun-guide" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">our guide to <em>Bushido Risen Sun</em></a>, our <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bushido-two-player-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">review of the <em>Bushido Risen Sun</em>&nbsp;2-player starter set</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/start-collecting-bushido-risen-sun-part-1-introduction-and-developer-interview" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">our "Start Collecting" guide to <em>Bushido</em></a>, which includes an interview with the game's developer.

<h2>Seasonal Changes</h2>

<p>Cycle Decks in <em>Bushido</em> are a way for GCT to easily incorporate new cards, rather than packaging them with specific miniature releases. The Concequences Cycle Deck, like the Weeping Sky Cycle Deck before it, contains 54 cards for a mixture of factions and card types, including:</p>

<ul><li>Events, usually actions that can be played during the game</li>
	<li>Terrain, which can be deployed onto the battlefield for specific effects</li>
	<li>Enhancements, are attached to units to offer effects and abilities</li>
	<li>Themes, offer new abilities if the warband construction restrictions are followed</li>
</ul><p>We don't know the full breakdown yet, but there are usually a few faction-specific cards, along with Ronin cards that can be used by all. GCT has stated that the newest factions, such as Awoken, will receive dedicated cards in upcoming releases like Kuna, rather than in this cycle deck. This allows them to focus on fully developing these factions, however, Awoken players can still incorporate Ronin cycle cards into their warbands.</p>

<p>Below we reveal 5 cards from the new cycle deck, with comments on their design and lore from the GCT Studios team ahead of our own thoughts.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Amidst the mystical upheaval in the celestial realm, it's vital to anchor the narrative through the eyes of the Jwar Isles' people. The Shiho Clan has been quietly rebuilding its power base since Hiroto's return. Though they lack the resources to field a standing army like the Prefecture of Ryu, they’ve uncovered pockets of Ashigaru veterans, disciplined fighters whose loyalty, training and battlefield organisation remain intact. These seasoned warriors are well-suited to open combat, a necessity if the Shiho are to reclaim their former influence.</p>

<p>Theme cards play a pivotal role in shaping a faction’s identity, unlocking fresh warband configurations and tactical possibilities. The New Eagle Army theme exemplifies this. Reflecting the elite band of Shiho Ashigaru, once the envy of the land, these soldiers gain powerful advantages when managing Virtue Tokens, making them reliable in both melee and ranged engagements.</p>

<p>Strategically, the Theme enhances warband efficiency by offering free Warband Terrain &nbsp;and / or Enhancements, along with cost reductions for Ashigaru profiles. While the Theme forges the Shiho’s hallmark flanking warfare, it introduces a compelling “take and hold” playstyle, rich with nuanced micro-movements that the faction is celebrated for.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a Shiho player, I'm looking forward to trying this out. Even as a Wolf player, it reduces the cost of the Wolf Ryoshi and Spears, and adds in the free Terrain and Enhancements. It might just pull me away from my Open Rebellion theme!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sojobo’s machinations continue to unfold, and the stakes have never been higher. Having already fractured an Asura, the act that drew the gaze and anger of Rajin, he has now unleashed the Awoken to keep the heavens turning, but at what cost? One thing is clear: desperate times demand desperate measures.</p>

<p>From a gameplay perspective, Sojobo has fallen out of favour with the Kami and is now relentlessly struck by lightning, a punishment few could endure. Even a king, it seems, is not immune to the consequences of his actions.</p>

<p>So why include the card in your warband? Despite the divine backlash, Sojobo's card offers a substantial cost discount, making him a compelling choice. This allows players to field a high-value defender at a low cost, unlocking new possibilities for list-building and tactical flexibility. It’s a risky play, but one that could pay off handsomely for those bold enough to use it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sojobo is a 24-cost Ronin that can join&nbsp;Shiho Clan, Temple of Ro-Kan, and The Descension warbands and is a very effective fighter who can make it harder for ranged attacks across the entire battlefield, and also push units away from them. As the team says above, reducing their cost to 19 at the risk of them taking damage each turn could really pay off.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After the great Tsunami, rising waters forced the spiders from their hidden lairs into human settlements and forests, spreading dread wherever they crept. Once again, the common folk came to fear the spider’s presence and so Grandmother, and her corrupted followers, took on this form, one that mirrors her essence and the spirit of her death-bringing cycle.</p>

<p>Now, Sojobo must confront the embodiment of the returned Thirteenth Cycle. If he is to fulfill his mission, he cannot avoid this malevolent force. With such powers unleashed, even the Yokai are being reshaped and twisted into new forms that reflect the corruption of nature itself. The Cult of Yueri stands as a chilling benefactor to this transformation.</p>

<p>This card presents a true conundrum. Your Yokai will blaze with additional Ki Tokens, surging with unnatural energy throughout the game. But this power comes at a price: the stolen energies will eventually consume them. It’s a classic twist on risk-reward mechanics, and one that many Yueri players will find irresistible, offering bold new strategies for those willing to gamble with fate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Adding this to a Yokai unit with a high Ki empowers them more and means they'll survive longer, but each time they use a Ki feat, they'll drop by 1, which means they might not be as effective late game, but if you want to storm them into combat, and watch them burn out taking down enemies, then this Enhancement for the Cult of Yurei is glorious.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Each cycle is marked by a celestial Asura, a divine embodiment of that cycle’s spirit and nature. For generations, it was believed there were only twelve cycles, but ancient calendars and forgotten dates revealed a hidden truth: a missing cycle, long obscured, whose absence caused the Heavenly misalignment that Sojobo now seeks to correct.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the return of the Thirteenth Cycle, a much older cosmic order begins to reassert itself. At this pivotal moment, Master Bat’s influence surges, and as the heavens realign with his domain, his growing power manifests through this event card.</p>

<p>Mechanically, this event disrupts many effects that would normally remove Bleeding Markers, including Heal. As a result, any model with the Bleed Trait becomes significantly more lethal, its damage lingering. Ideal for warbands that lean into damage-over-time mechanics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With the recent release of the Master Bat Ronin unit (who gives Bleed tokens on their attacks) and Nagato, who opened up the House Bleeding Moon Shadow Wind Clan theme, this Event means that those Bleed tokens are definitely going to be there in the end turn to do damage.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bushido-consequences-cycle-deck-6.jpg?itok=_fyRFbIG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bushido-consequences-cycle-deck-6.jpg?itok=xQ5exTGY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Weeping Sky’s Influence</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>The skies themselves are said to weep, mourning the faltering celestial order. As the heavens tremble, the consequences ripple through both the mortal realm and the spiritual plane, reshaping the balance of power across the Jwar Isles.</p>

<p>At the heart of this upheaval stands Lord Toad, master of the previous cycle and a divine force whose influence endures. Even King Sojobo, no stranger to ambition, offers him respect. Lord Toad is far from finished. He revels in the bounty his cycle has unleashed, and the signs of his lingering power are unmistakable.</p>

<p>From the quagmire and shadowed tunnels, the lifeless legions of the Imperial Court have begun to rise. Their emergence is no coincidence, it is a reaction to Lord Toad’s enduring will for change.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This card offers a powerful early-game advantage: it prevents long-range attacks during Turn One, shielding your warband from opportunistic enemy volleys before formations are set. Whether you're protecting fragile units or setting up a bold advance, this effect can dramatically shift the tempo of the opening round.</p>

<p>The battlefield even becomes a quagmire, Lord Toad, ever the opportunist, thrives in this environment. The movement boost granted by the Quagmire effect plays perfectly into his slippery tactics, allowing him to reposition with ease.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lord Toad was a recent Ronin release that can be used across all 14 factions. While in a quagmire, Lord Toad's movement is boosted by 2 to 6 and ignores all terrain and other models for the purposes of movement, rushing them ahead to make use of their Swallow Up ki feat to remove an enemy unit from the battlefield for a turn.</p>
