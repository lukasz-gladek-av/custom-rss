            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/esa-announces-iicon-not-e3<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The ESA, the driving force behind E3, has announced a new event by the name of iicon, but don't get your hopes up; it really doesn't sound a heck of a lot like E3 at all.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.theesa.com/entertainment-software-association-unveils-iicon-game-changing-thought-leader-summit-to-harness-the-power-of-interactive-entertainment-and-shape-the-future-of-business-and-culture/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on its website, the ESA (which stands for Entertainment Software Association) describes iicon as an event aiming to "connect visionaries, thought leaders and innovators from across industries to harness the power of interactive entertainment".</p>

<p>In short, it sounds like iicon is much more corporate-minded than E3; it's more for business executives and industry figures than the general public, so don't expect to see any jaw-dropping game or console reveals.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/iicon-stanley-pierre-louis-esa-head.jpg?itok=Wb8qOeuy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/iicon-stanley-pierre-louis-esa-head.jpg?itok=ohqdHDQe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>ESA head Stanley Pierre-Louis says iicon will create "a space for visionaries" to "come together, connect, and reimagine what's possible through interactive entertainment".</figcaption></figure><p>The new event's <a href="https://www.iicon.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official website</a>&nbsp;has lots of copy aimed primarily at brands, offering them the chance to "align" with a "rapidly growing industry" and to "harness video game technology, innovations, and communities to elevate your brand".</p>

<p>According to the site, iicon promises "visionary keynotes, engaging discussions and workshops, and elite networking opportunities" with execs "shaping the future of entertainment, business, and technology".</p>

<p>The event won't just be about gaming, either; it also promises to incorporate other industries adjacent to gaming and interactive media, like film, TV, and music, as well as "sports, healthcare, education, finance, and more".</p>

<p>The ESA says that attendance will be "by invitation only", so it doesn't sound like you'll just be able to buy a ticket and rock up as a member of the public, which seems like it's in keeping with iicon's more exclusive approach.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/e3-2019-esa.jpg?itok=_bGvK2N_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/e3-2019-esa.jpg?itok=7r0mPMqU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The ESA's new iicon event does not sound much like E3.</figcaption></figure><p>Companies like Take-Two, Ubisoft, and Xbox have already signed up for iicon, which should provide another clue that the event won't be anything like E3; after all, some of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-wont-actually-be-at-e3-2023-but-will-still-host-live-event-in-los-angeles" rel="nofollow">companies</a> confirming their attendance publicly <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-nintendo-sony-skipping-e3-2023" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">shunned</a> E3 in the years before its demise.</p>

<p>In case you need a reminder, the ESA officially killed E3 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/e3-is-officially-dead" rel="nofollow">in December 2023</a>&nbsp;following a chaotic couple of years that included show cancellations and studios turning down appearances at the convention.</p>

<p>That's another reason iicon will almost certainly be nothing like E3; it would be a very unusual (and arguably foolish) business move to create an event exactly like one that was canned not even a year and a half ago.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in ESA news, meanwhile, the trade body recently took President Trump to task over his <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/esa-trump-tariffs-comments" rel="nofollow">newly-introduced tariffs</a>, which the organization says could cause "significant harm to everyday Americans". Trump has paused tariffs on Canada and Mexico, but has gone ahead with a 10% tariff on China-imported goods.</p>

<p>In any case, the inaugural iicon event will take place between April 27th and 30th next year at the Las Vegas Fontainebleau Resort. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-early-access-mixed-reviews-50k-players</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/civilization-7-debuts-to-50k-early-access-players-and-mixed-steam-reviews.1102104/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-early-access-mixed-reviews-50k-players<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Players are starting to get their hands on the early access (as distinct from Early Access) release of&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7</em>, and while the numbers are pretty impressive even for an iconic franchise like this one, player impressions are decidedly mixed.</p>

<p>In case you need a refresher,&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7</em>'s early access period started today for those who bought either the Deluxe or Founders Edition of the game. This isn't an "Early Access" release; it's the full game, but some players are getting to check it out ahead of the full release <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-pc-specs" rel="nofollow">on February 11th</a>.</p>

<p>First, the good news for publisher 2K.&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7</em>'s early access launch has debuted to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1295660/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">over 55,000 players</a> on Steam at time of writing, which surely portends well for the full release of the game. I wouldn't be surprised if&nbsp;<em>Civ 7&nbsp;</em>smashed&nbsp;<em>Civ 6</em>'s 162,657 <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/289070/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">concurrent player record</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/civilization-7-early-access-mixed-reviews-city.jpg?itok=FGHaDJ2s 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/civilization-7-early-access-mixed-reviews-city.jpg?itok=pFGxgtT4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>has debuted in early access to high player numbers and mixed reviews.</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately for 2K, the picture painted by the game's Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1295660/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_VII/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reviews</a> is perhaps a more ambiguous one.</p>

<p>At time of writing,&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>has attracted a Mixed rating across 2,587 reviews, with just 41% of those reviews being positive. Admittedly, the figure represents less than 5% of the game's overall early access player base, but that's still not a great look.</p>

<p>Common complaints from players include criticisms aimed at the game's user interface, as well as accusations that the game feels <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/NDYEE/recommended/1295660/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">"unfinished"</a> and that game customization is <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/machine001/recommended/1295660/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">lacking</a>.</p>

<p>Even some positive reviewers express dissatisfaction with the UI; one <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198049076071/recommended/1295660/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reviewer says</a> the "pros...outweigh the cons" when it comes to&nbsp;<em>Civ 7</em>, but describes the user interface as "abysmal".</p>




<p><em>Civilization&nbsp;</em>has been through cycles similar to this before; players often criticize new installments of the series for making changes to previous versions, and reception gradually improves as updates and DLC packs get released.</p>

<p>Time will tell whether or not that's what's happening here. We'll probably learn more about what the overall player impression of&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>is when it launches in full on February 11th for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1295660/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_VII/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/sid-meier-s-civilization-vii/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-for-xbox-series-xs/9N23HJHSC6BL" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/2k-project-ethos-studio-head-fired-report</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/2k-reportedly-fires-project-ethos-studio-head-after-underwhelming-reveal.1102053/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/2k-project-ethos-studio-head-fired-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>2K Games has reportedly fired Michael Condrey, the president of&nbsp;<em>Project Ethos&nbsp;</em>developer 31st Union, following what the publisher sees as a disappointing reveal for the game last year.</p>

<p>If you don't remember&nbsp;<em>Project Ethos</em>, I don't blame you. It's a roguelike hero shooter that was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/project-ethos-2k-roguelike-hero-shooter" rel="nofollow">announced by 2K back in October</a>, but it's been relatively quiet since then, and if this report is anything to go by, I guess we now know why.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://kotaku.com/michael-condrey-projet-ethos-31st-union-2k-games-1851756173" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Kotaku</a> (which cites "sources familiar with the studio"), Condrey was removed from his position as the studio head of 31st Union three days ago, but he'll remain as an advisor on the project, although what exactly that will entail is unclear.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/2k-games-project-ethos-shooting.jpg?itok=XceoEUKS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/2k-games-project-ethos-shooting.jpg?itok=uZqdKru4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Project Ethos&nbsp;</em>developer 31st Union's studio head has apparently been fired.</figcaption></figure><p>In a statement given to Kotaku, 2K commends Condrey's "dedication, passion, and work ethic", but says that he will be "transitioning his role in the short term to focus on advising on the future of&nbsp;<em>Project Ethos</em>".</p>

<p>The studio says it's still "very committed" to finding a "forward path" for&nbsp;<em>Project Ethos&nbsp;</em>"and the people and culture of the 31st Union studio", so it doesn't sound like the game will be canceled or the studio will be shut down, at least.</p>

<p>As Kotaku points out, however, Take-Two is set to announce its quarterly financial results later today, and it's entirely possible that the studio could make some kind of reference to&nbsp;<em>Project Ethos&nbsp;</em>and its future then.</p>

<p>Of course, at the moment, there's a much bigger prize in Take-Two's eyes, namely the impending release of&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-released-early-following-leak-coming-in-2025" rel="nofollow">still apparently set for this year</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/grand-theft-auto-6-take-two.jpg?itok=r9oyPo9u 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/grand-theft-auto-6-take-two.jpg?itok=r8qCJkT4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>'s release is still on the cards for 2025.</figcaption></figure><p>If 2K's parent company Take-Two does cancel&nbsp;<em>Project Ethos&nbsp;</em>and shut down 31st Union, it wouldn't be the first time the company has done something like that.</p>

<p>Although it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-denies-roll7-intercept-closure" rel="nofollow">denied doing so</a>, Take-Two reportedly closed down two of its subsidiaries, namely&nbsp;<em>OlliOlli World&nbsp;</em>developer Roll7 and&nbsp;<em>Kerbal Space Program 2&nbsp;</em>studio Intercept Games, last year.</p>

<p>Additionally, the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-private-division-sale" rel="nofollow">sold its indie label Private Division</a> to a then-undisclosed buyer in November, with that buyer subsequently reported to be a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-annapurna-staff-private-division-ips" rel="nofollow">company made up of ex-Annapurna Interactive staffers</a>&nbsp;following mass resignations at that company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/annapurna-interactive-staff-resign-after-company-spin-off-talks-fail" rel="nofollow">in September</a>.</p>

<p>At any rate, for now, at least,&nbsp;<em>Project Ethos&nbsp;</em>remains in development and 31st Union remains an active studio. We'll have to wait and see how long that lasts. Stay tuned for more.</p>
