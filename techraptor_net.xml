            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GSC Game World has released&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>Update 1.5, which brings yet more improvements to the game's much-talked-about A-Life system, as well as new threats to face and more.</p>

<p>Following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-patch-14" rel="nofollow">May's Update 1.4</a>, Update 1.5's main feature is a big boost to the A-Life AI system, which, I think it's fair to say, was released in a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-a-life-20-gsc-game-world" rel="nofollow">fairly incomplete state</a> when the game launched in November.</p>

<p>Per the official <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/525346350588494399" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">patch notes</a>, the A-Life system now means "life in the Zone is now simulated for all characters, not just those in the player's view". This means characters will continue to pursue their goals and live their lives away from what you're seeing, and there are other A-Life changes intended to make the game's AI more immersive as well.</p>

<p>Of course, the new update also brings a ton of bug fixes and balance tweaks with it, so you might want to head back into the Zone if you've been having trouble with glitches. There's obviously no guarantee your particular issue (or "anomaly", hem hem) will have been fixed, but it's worth a go, eh?</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>, it's the long-awaited sequel to 2007's&nbsp;<em>Stalker: Shadow of Chornobyl&nbsp;</em>(which was recently renamed to reflect the Ukrainian spelling of the city upon the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-legends-of-zone-enhanced-edition-release-date" rel="nofollow">release of the remastered version</a>).</p>

<p>Like the original, the game will have you exploring the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone in search of artifacts, and you'll meet a full cast of characters, who have now been even further enhanced by the A-Life system.</p>




<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/stalker-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. No mention of a PS5 version has been made yet, but given the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-ps5-release-date-enhancements" rel="nofollow">friendliness</a> with which Xbox has been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gears-of-war-reloaded-announced" rel="nofollow">approaching</a> PlayStation in recent months, I wouldn't be surprised if a release is on the cards for the future.</p>
