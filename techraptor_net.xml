<figcaption><em>Rainbow Billy: The Book of Fears </em>was an unexpected followup, but not an unwelcome one.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>According to Manavoid, you can expect an investigative experience in which "clever puzzles" will "guide the story forward and reward curiosity", so hopefully, this won't be your typical "press A on the thing to win" adventure game.</p><p>The story revolves around the appearance of "curious creatures known as Fearlings" that were "never supposed to exist". They're a manifestation of the worries of the campers at an otherwise-cheerful summer camp, and it'll be your job to deal with them.</p><p>Manavoid says the Fearlings will be central to your journey, and that each "has a reason for being there", making learning the proper way to deal with them "essential" for achieving success in <em>Rainbow Billy: The Book of Fears</em>.</p><p>Since Manavoid is still all about inclusivity and emotional intelligence, however, <em>The Book of Fears </em>will remain "warm and inviting" throughout its runtime from a tonal perspective, offering a "thoughtful and quietly meaningful experience".</p>
<p><em>Rainbow Billy: The Book of Fears </em>is set to arrive on PC via Steam sometime this year. While you wait for it, you can remind yourself what our Will thought of the original by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/rainbow-billy-curse-of-leviathan-review" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="60f57fd7-77ff-406f-9d21-c8465c90e3d3" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">checking out his review</a>.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <guid>1441114</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer DON’T NOD has had their hands in a lot of different pies following their work on the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/life-is-strange-remastered-collection" rel="nofollow"><em>Life is Strange</em></a> series. Over the last several years, they’ve dipped their toes into games such as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/tell-me-why-episode-1-impressions" rel="nofollow"><em>Tell Me Why</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/lost-records-bloom-rage-tape-1-review-rocking-in-90s" rel="nofollow"><em>Lost Records: Blood and Rage</em></a>.</p><p>Continuing on their self-publishing journey brings us to their latest title: <em>Aphelion</em>, which is a linear sci-fi adventure game promising a big focus on narrative. While <em>Aphelion</em> isn’t out until this Spring, we did get a chance to go hands-on with a preview build to see the kind of new story the team has been working on.</p><p>Taking place in the not-so-distant future, <em>Aphelion</em> introduces us to a fictional world taking place in the year 2060, where Earth has been ravaged by climate change. With the discovery of a 9th planet known as Persephone, both Ariane and Thomas have been tasked with venturing on a scientific mission to survey the planet for future habitability.&nbsp;</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aphelion-escape-the-wreckage.jpg?itok=CK37hO0_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p><br>However, their mission goes awry not long after entering the atmosphere, with their ship crash-landing onto the icy planet and the pair finding themselves separated from each other from the jump. There’s a sense of desperation right out of the gate as the urgency for survival sets in.</p><p>The demo puts us squarely into chapter one, which is a good starting point to get to know one of the dual protagonists. We start with Ariane, whose goal is to make it clear of the ship’s wreckage after waking up and ultimately find what happened to Thomas.</p><p>This is the bulk of the opening chapter, and there’s a level of cinematic feel with the way everything is framed, and also through things like interacting with the environment. Once Ariane opens that initial door, all hell breaks loose, and she’s sliding down the side of the ship, explosions raging, and there’s a struggle to not get caught in the debris.&nbsp;</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aphelion-pathfinder-tool.jpg?itok=lBYLnV2Z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p><br>From there, it’s all about climbing, and it’s here Aphelion feels like it’s taking a page out of the <em>Uncharted</em> playbook a bit. Going vertical is the key, as is jumping across chasms and up ladders. Ariane can scope out the area to determine a possible way out.</p><p>Once that’s settled, Ariane has to keep holding tight as she ascends, taking care with specific button prompts if things get too shaky. There’s a level of tension here because it’s hard to know if anything could go wrong at any moment, especially when some grips can fail.</p><p><em>Aphelion</em> offers up more than climbing on ledges as well. Ariane can make use of a winch (grappling hook) to get up to specific places quickly as she looks for Thomas. It’s a tool that seems like it’s going to get a lot of use as she makes her way through the wreck of the ship.</p><p>As she finally gets through, just as the ship breaks away, the demo takes us to the surface of Persephone, which is a vast, frozen wasteland at first glance. After making some calls, Ariane has to find a viewpoint, and from there, further wreckage awaits.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aphelion-nemesisencounter.jpg?itok=GpC_OxHR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p><br>The second chapter in <em>Aphelion</em>, which we were able to play, took place further along in the story. Ariane is still on her own, but she’s investigating anomalies called singularities and will eventually confront an antagonistic force called the Nemesis.</p><p>This part of the preview still had many of the climbing and traversal elements from the opening, but with further exploration of the landscape in an area known as the Onyx Forest. Ariane makes her way through an icy cave-like system, and a lot of the gameplay revolves around finding the right path using a Pathfinder tool and avoiding treacherous elements like falling ice and collapsing ledges.</p><p>Deeper into the cave, Ariane can use a light to peer through the darkness, and it’s here where things start to get more closed in and claustrophobic – there’s this sense of being trapped and not knowing how to get out.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aphelion-ice-cave.jpg?itok=QjXrUSs_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aphelion-ice-cave.jpg?itok=3SRj-oKE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p><br>It doesn’t take long before this all coalesces into a hidden force – a creature with a red glow of sort begins to launch an attack on Ariane, and it’s going to take a lot of stealthy silence to escape.&nbsp;</p><p>The creature reacts to movement, so the key is to tread slowly and quietly. If she moves too quickly or loudly, the creature will attack, and then it’s game over. There’s a lot of patience involved here, but eventually she can get to the right crevice in the wall and get out.</p><p>Even with just those two sections of gameplay, <em>Aphelion</em> is already shaping up to be something beyond the typical space sci-fi outing. The grounded realism feels more akin to movies like Gravity or Interstellar, so it'll be interesting how far those elements extend - especially with the noted involvement of the real-life European Space Agency.&nbsp;</p><p>While we didn't get to explore the other protagonist, Thomas, the state of his condition, and how that will factor into gameplay, leaves plenty to look forward to when <em>Aphelion</em> launches later this Spring.</p><hr><p><em>TechRaptor was invited to preview <strong>Aphelion</strong> on PC with a code provided by the publisher.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/aphelion-interview</link>
            <guid>1441111</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With DON’T NOD’s latest outing, <em>Aphelion</em>, well on its way to release, we had a chance to sit and chat with the game’s developers <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/aphelion-preview-close-encounters" rel="nofollow">following a brief hands-on play session</a>. Speaking with us today is creative director Florent Guillaume, who gives us some insight on what <em>Aphelion</em> is about and how it uses the sci-fi genre to the strengths of its dual protagonists.</p><p>When approaching a game like <em>Aphelion</em>, which features a science-fiction space setting, we can’t help but be curious as to the why. What sort of design philosophy did the team subscribe to while making the game? And what sparked that particular interest in space and action?</p><p>“After working on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/tell-me-why-episode-1-impressions" rel="nofollow"><em>Tell Me Why</em></a>, which was grounded in a very contemporary setting, we felt the desire to explore new horizons, both narratively and in terms of gameplay,” said Guillaume.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aphelion-previews-broll.mp4_snapshot_03.03-2026.02.18_22.29.27.jpg?itok=7oO0BJ0v 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aphelion-previews-broll.mp4_snapshot_03.03-2026.02.18_22.29.27.jpg?itok=6G1p32hT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p>“As science fiction fans, our team was eager to craft an epic sci-fi adventure while staying true to DON’T NOD’s core identity: character-driven storytelling centered around intimate human relationships.</p><p>“With <em>Aphelion</em>, our philosophy was to merge large-scale, spectacular science fiction with deeply personal drama. We wanted to place players in a near-future anticipation setting, something believable and grounded, and explore broader gameplay possibilities than our previous titles. Moving into a more action-adventure framework allowed us to explore new forms of tension, traversal, and environmental interaction, while still keeping the emotional journey of our two protagonists at the heart of the experience.”</p><p>Scale seems to be the core theme of <em>Aphelion</em>, and that includes things like the vastness of space, the hostility of the unknown, and the fragile nature of human connection. There's a specific balance between epic and intimate woven into the design philosophy. Building on that philosophy, the team digs into some specific pieces of media such as movies, TV shows, or music that influenced the development of <em>Aphelion</em>.</p><p>“We drew inspiration from a wide range of sources across film, television, and games,” explained Guillaume.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aphelion-previews-broll.mp4_snapshot_06.26-2026.02.18_22.29.48.jpg?itok=oqteucbe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aphelion-previews-broll.mp4_snapshot_06.26-2026.02.18_22.29.48.jpg?itok=_U4DMUeB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p>“Films like <em>Interstellar</em> and <em>Arrival</em>, and series such as <em>The Expanse</em>, were important references for their grounded approach to science fiction and their focus on human stakes within vast cosmic settings. On the game side, titles like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/last-of-us-review" rel="nofollow"><em>The Last of Us</em></a> and <em>Alien: Isolation</em> influenced us in different ways — particularly in how tension, survival, and character-driven storytelling can coexist within gameplay.”</p><p>However, that doesn’t mean the team is set on replicating what they’d call “hard science fiction." There’s an effort to create an original universe that’s rooted in a near-future that is very believable.</p><p>“The sci-fi genre is highly competitive and filled with iconic worlds, so for us, singularity came from grounding the story in realism and emotional authenticity. By anchoring the fiction in something plausible and contemporary, we could focus on dramaturgy, character arcs, and the human consequences of extraordinary events."</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aphelion-previews-broll.mp4_snapshot_19.29-2026.02.18_22.30.40.jpg?itok=7YyX_UyT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p>In creating this universe for <em>Aphelion</em>, DON’T NOD reached out to the European Space Agency to collaborate on the project for the dream of a lifetime.</p><p>“Their involvement helped us establish a strong scientific foundation for the project,” Guillaume explained. n“We began with real science, research, hypotheses, and existing theories, and then extrapolated from there to build a compelling work of fiction.</p><p>“For example, Planet Nine, the planet that we explore in the game, is based on a real scientific hypothesis currently being studied. Working with ESA allowed us to approach the setting with credibility and respect for actual space research, even as we shaped it into a dramatic adventure. The goal was not to create a hard sci-fi setting, but rather to build a grounded world that would make the fiction feel plausible in order to enhance immersion and make the epic dimension of the story feel more tangible and emotionally impactful."</p><p><em>Aphelion</em> is a unique case because it features not one, but two protagonists. They won’t play the same, however, as DON’T NOD aims for unique experiences tailored to their unique circumstances. These characters are Ariane and Thomas, the latter of which has been injured in the crash that kicks off the main story.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aphelion-previews-broll.mp4_snapshot_17.14-2026.02.18_22.30.27.jpg?itok=bg2vfuHW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p>“The two characters are placed in very different circumstances following the crash, and that distinction naturally shaped their gameplay,” said Guillaume. “Ariane is physically capable and in control of her faculties, so her gameplay leans more toward action, traversal, and forward momentum. Thomas, on the other hand, is severely injured. His sequences focus more on survival, investigation, and vulnerability.</p><p>“This alternation serves both gameplay and narrative. Mechanically, it creates rhythm and variety—shifting from intensity to tension, from agency to fragility. Narratively, it reinforces their separation and the emotional stakes of their situation. Experiencing the world through both perspectives deepens the player’s understanding of their bond and the obstacles that divide them.”</p><p>With two different characters we were curious how the gameplay split would go. Does Thomas get more screen time than Ariane? Or vice versa?</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aphelion-previews-broll.mp4_snapshot_19.29-2026.02.18_22.30.40_0.jpg?itok=DI-03MzW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aphelion-previews-broll.mp4_snapshot_19.29-2026.02.18_22.30.40_0.jpg?itok=67KlQTPP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p>“Roughly 70% of the experience is played as Ariane, who is the primary protagonist of the game. Thomas represents about 30% of the playable time,” said Guillaume.</p><p>“Ariane represents the main story arc, while Thomas’ sequences enrich the narrative structure. The alternation between them is a deliberate storytelling device: They are separated and unable to communicate, the player becoming the invisible link between the two. By controlling both characters, the player holds knowledge that neither of them fully possesses, which strengthens emotional engagement and dramatic tension.”</p><p>That dramatic tension is further emphasized through the fact that <em>Aphelion</em> is a linear action game, but linear does not mean restrictive in the traditional sense. Guillaume said, “The level design alternates between confined, more tightly directed spaces and larger environments that offer multiple paths leading to the same destination.”</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aphelion-previews-broll.mp4_snapshot_04.30-2026.02.18_22.29.41.jpg?itok=QfANNBfu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aphelion-previews-broll.mp4_snapshot_04.30-2026.02.18_22.29.41.jpg?itok=MYgHho9r 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p>“While the overall progression is fixed, players will encounter larger areas that encourage exploration, environmental storytelling, and optional discoveries.&nbsp;</p><p>“One of the main intentions behind the game was the relationship between the characters and the scale of the planet, the immense distances that separate them. So even if we’re not making an open world, we are offering large vistas and explorable spaces that emphasize this sense of isolation and discovery. It reinforces both gameplay and narrative themes, reminding players that they are navigating something far bigger than themselves.”</p><p>So there you have it. <em>Aphelion</em> looks to be leaning big on story, its characters, and the sense of discovery in its own way. There's surely more to discover when it launches later this spring.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
