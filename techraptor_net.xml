            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We recently reviewed <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/witcher-path-of-destiny-review-when-theme-is-only-skin-deep" rel="nofollow">The Witcher: Path of Destiny</a>, and while we were unimpressed by its lack of strategic depth and paper-thin&nbsp;<em>The Witcher </em>theme, we persevered with the available expansions to see if they added anything more to it. Some of these expansions are crowd-funding only, and we'll specify which are available and retail and which aren't.</p>

<p>We previously covered <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/witcher-old-world-review" rel="nofollow">The Witcher: Old World</a> and its <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/witcher-old-world-expansions-review" rel="nofollow">expansions</a>, as well as the recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/unmatched-witcher-realms-fall-and-steel-and-silver-review" rel="nofollow">Unmatched sets</a>, featuring characters from <em>The Witcher</em>. You can also read our review of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/witcher-3-wild-hunt-review-new-benchmark-for-rpgs" rel="nofollow">The Witcher 3</a>, and check out our&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/witcher-4-official-reveal" rel="nofollow">news</a> for the upcoming <em>The Witcher 4</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-witcher-path-of-destiny-expansions-2.jpg?itok=ELtz6eF_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-witcher-path-of-destiny-expansions-2.jpg?itok=rDRLM61Y 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Witcher Path of Destiny</em>&nbsp;Stretch Goals boxes includes more of the same from the core box, but also with some fantastic legacy elements.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Witcher: Path of Destiny Stretch Goals</h2>

<p>In <em>The Wticher: Path of Destiny</em> Stretch Goals box from the crowdfunding campaign, there are several new characters, stories, and extra play options, some of which will be available at retail eventually, and some are exclusive to the crowdfunding.</p>

<p>The <em>Path of Destiny</em> stretch goals box includes:</p>

<ul><li>5 new characters</li>
	<li>5 new tales</li>
	<li>Companion and Villain additional play options</li>
	<li>Voice of Reason additional play options</li>
	<li>A new solo opponent board</li>
</ul><p>The 5 new characters offer more of the same from the core game. They're a welcome addition, providing multiple options, including for solo opponents, but they still lack the depth and feeling I'd like in order for them to feel like real characters. Dijkstra and Letho feel the most thematic, with Dijkstra's initiative interaction and card selection abilities, and Letho's messing with other players, but they're all still let down by the once-per-game abilities that don't have a consistent enough impact to make you feel any different from any other character.</p>

<p>The 5 new tales offer a huge amount of replayability from those in the core set, giving 8 in total when all combined, but they all suffer from the core mechanics' lack of depth. The Skellige tale is the most stand-out, with a built-in mini-game where you try to work out who the killer could be.</p>

<p>The Companion and Villain cards add some more interaction with a companion card being placed by one of the face-up card drafts and offering use of their ability if the player picks those cards. 5 companions are available, each with 5 cards (except Zoltan, who has 6, including the crowdfunding exclusive Field Marshal Windbag card). The villains are all crowdfunding exclusives, with 2 of them, Leo and Vilgefortz, having 3 of their cards suffed into the normal card deck, gaining the players victory points when they're defeated, and Gaunter offering a pact, with a victory point bonus or loss if its condition is met or not.</p>

Once the conditions on the envelopes are met, they can be opened and their components added to your game. We won't spoil any here, but it is very cool to have elements permanently added when playing through new tales, especially if you're playing with the same group, or through a solo play-through campaign.</p>

<p>The stretch goals also include a double-sided solo board for playing against the Crimson Avenger/Crimson Asshole, which adds a bit more variety on top of the 5 extra solo boards for the new characters in this pack.</p>

<p>The first retail release that includes the strech goals products is Triss A Grain of Truth, which has the Triss character, the Grain of Truth tale and the miniatures for both in the pack.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-witcher-path-of-destiny-expansions-4.jpg?itok=pIUNfgm2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-witcher-path-of-destiny-expansions-4.jpg?itok=AsjAYn7u 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Witcher Path of Destiny </em>Legendary Monsters pack remove the tales cards and as a result, improves its grasp of theme and makes it more fun.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Witcher: Path of Destiny Legendary Monsters</h2>

<p>The Legendary Monsters expansion for<em> The Witcher: Path of Destiny </em>feels like what I wanted the core game to be. The focus is on fighting 1 of 4 available monsters, Ancient Leshen, Hym, Katakan, and Aguara. There are no tale cards, and the sole symbol is the fight symbol, with players needing to convert the other symbols to deal damage, or keep them to meet condition cards to gain experience.</p>

<p>This focus feels like it should have been the core gameplay all along. It doesn't even need to be monsters, the story cards could have contained the element players needed to work towards, chipping away at the target number, rather than the disconnected focus of trying to get symbols and work out what others might be getting. It's such a simple change, but the Legendary Monsters expansion completely changed my <em>Path of Destiny</em> experience and brought the theme to the front. The characters still don't feel unique or thematic enough for me, but the end experience was much more rewarding, it's just a shame it focuses on combat and not the other elements that make <em>The Witcher</em> so great.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-witcher-path-of-destiny-expansions-5.jpg?itok=JoCwos2c 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-witcher-path-of-destiny-expansions-5.jpg?itok=G6CmsxGm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Witcher Path of Destiny </em>Wild Hunt makes the core game 1 v many, and again improves the gameplay considerably.</figcaption></figure>

<p>The Wild Hunt is another great <em>The Witcher: Path of Destiny</em> expansion that changes the gameplay to either 1 player controlling the Wild Hunt vs all the other players, or a solo player playing against the automa Wild Hunt. It uses the expansions' own Tale and follows mostly the same rules as the core game, only this time you are competing directly against the Wild Hunt, with their own character board.</p>

<p>On top of their character board, there is also a general's play mat that each of the 4 Wild Hunt generals advances on a track, gaining effects as they do. Each general also has an ability card that usually causes issues for the other players. These abilities, combined with the standard abilities on the player board, go some way to making the Wild Hunt feel thematically worthwhile, which will leave the other player feeling pretty jealous with their bland characters with limited in-game effects.</p>

<p>As with Legendary Monsters, it's such a shame that this is an expansion, and not the core gameplay, because it locks you into the single tale in this pack, rather than being able to take the most thematically feeling parts of the expansions, and use them in the core game. This means that while both of these expansions are fun, the replayability is limited, while the core, more lifeless game, has 8 tales for a lot more replayability.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-witcher-path-of-destiny-expansions-6.jpg?itok=f7ga5e3x 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-witcher-path-of-destiny-expansions-6.jpg?itok=0oY6SPtk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Witcher Path of Destiny </em>Naglfar expansion adds to the Legendary Monsters and Wild Hunt expansion sets.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Witcher: Path of Destiny Naglfar</h2>

<p>The Naglfar mini expansion for <em>The Witcher: Path of Destiny</em> is a crowdfunding excuslive expansion for the Wild Hunt, or Legendary Monsters expansions, and requires the core game and one of those expansions to use.</p>

<p>In the Wild Hunt, the Naglfar ship protects a general from the players, and the players get access to the Broken Sextant cards to offset that, which do things like ignore the ability of the general protected by the Naglfar. In Legendary Monsters, you can use the Naglfar expansion to make the Wild Hunt a monster against which the players battle.</p>

<p>It's a nice expansion, adding another dynamic to the game, but if you missed it at crowdfunding, it's not an essential gameplay inclusion, unless you love Legendary Monsters, in which case this adds more than it does to the Wild Hunt expansion.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-witcher-path-of-destiny-expansions-7.jpg?itok=08UKpNpN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-witcher-path-of-destiny-expansions-7.jpg?itok=xLXMJznG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Witcher Path of Destiny </em>Geralt on Roach <em>expansion&nbsp;</em>adds a mounted Geralt option to your game, but only really adds some randomness to the once-per-game abilities and nothing more.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Witcher: Path of Destiny Geralt On Roach</h2>

<p>The Geralt on Roach expansion for <em>The Witcher: Path of Destiny</em> is a crowdfunding-only expansion and won't be available at retail. Luckily, it doesn't add much to games, so if you missed it, you're not missing out on much. The expansion includes a miniature, a player board, and 5 starting cards for Geralt on Roach.</p>

<p>The miniature, as you would expect, shows Geralt mounted on Roach, drawing one of his trademark swords from his back. The player board changes Geralts' once-per-game abilities from the core set, adding in some randomness, allowing you to reveal a random card for an effect. The 5 starting cards are exactly the same as those in the core set, just with different art.</p>

<p>The one area that would have made this expansion interesting would have been a change to the starting cards. They're what gives you the most strategy in game, and differentiate the characters the most from each other. The once-per-game effects have little serious effect, and Geralt on Roach's are completely random, so beyond using the expansion once for fun, you'll be back using the core set Geralt.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-witcher-path-of-destiny-expansions-8.jpg?itok=VnvQn4H1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-witcher-path-of-destiny-expansions-8.jpg?itok=FYJKYBSd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Witcher Path of Destiny Ronin </em>looks absolutely glorious on the tabletop, it's just shame it won't be out much.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Witcher: Path of Destiny Ronin</h2>

<p><em>The Witcher: Path of Destiny Ronin</em> isn't an expansion for <em>The Witcher: Path of Destiny,</em>&nbsp;it's a standalone game that uses most of the rules from the core game, with a few subtle differences. The main difference in the mechanics is that between each player, an alliance board is placed. These boards allow players to unlock their partner's abilities for use, which is done by playing matching symbols on the cards used in the draft, which include teacups facing different directions. Players need to play these cards facing each other to progress on the alliance board.</p>

<p>The other difference is that the tale cards don't have any text on them, the chapter cards simply detail which symbols are the active symbol for that chapter, and 2 of the 4 active symbol cards are put on the board. Victory and experience points are also reversed from the core game, with players now scoring victory points for the active symbol they have the least of, and experience points for the active symbol they have the most of.</p>

<p>Aside from the aesthetics, which are thematically glorious, <em>Path of Destiny: Ronin</em> doesn't feel that much different from the core game, which is still that the characters don't feel much different from each other, and apart from the focus on partnerships, it doesn't really feel much like <em>The Witcher,</em> and the card playing to match symbols feels a bit lifeless when compared to the art and components.</p>

<p>The art throughout is great, and when combined with the bamboo play mat, it looks amazing on the tabletop. It's just a shame that it won't be out much, because the core gameplay isn't up to scratch, and the fact that it is completely standalone, so the good parts of Legendary Monsters, the Wild Hunt, and the tale elements of the core game can't even be used as part of it.</p>

<h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On The Witcher: Path of Destiny Expansions?</h2>

<p><em>The Witcher: Path of Destiny</em> has some great expansions. Wild Hunt and Legendary Monsters both make the game feel like <em>The Witcher</em>, and should have been the core game. The fact that most are incompatible with each other just emphasizes the lack of join up with the products. The stretch goals, with the extra characters and tales, just add more of the same, and don't help the mechanics grip the theme, or add much variety beyond the tales' flavor text and once-per-game abilities of the characters. The voice of reason envelopes are a great addition, and add a fantastic legacy feel to the game, especially when playing in a consistent group, but I'm not sure the mechanics have the scope for that level of replayability, when all the new character and tale variety just add more of the same lack of depth.</p>

<p><em>Path of Destiny Ronin</em> looks glorious, and the gameplay changes are interesting, but it changes nothing in terms of how light the gameplay feels, and the lack of difference between the characters fails to capture any feeling of theme with them. It's also frustrating that it's completely standalone, and none of the other expansions, which are what save the core game, can be added to this.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizard of the Coast's and Archetype Entertainment's <em>Exodus</em> TTRPG is now out. This tabletop adaptation of the AAA sci-fi game, announced with <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/upcoming-sci-fi-game-exodus-is-getting-official-ttrpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">limited info in 2024</a>, is shipping out, and it provides a spacefaring twist on the rules of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>.</p>

<h2>The Exodus TTRPG Release</h2>

<p>On their official webpage, Wizards of the Coast are selling two <em>Exodus</em> TTRPG books. The <em>Traveler's Handbook</em> contains rules for both players and Game Masters to help them get started. The <em>Exodus Encyclopedia</em> contains rules on alien creatures, beings that inhabit abandoned starships, and uncharted worlds.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/exodus-ttrpg-book-artwork.jpg?itok=A5qt_aNP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/exodus-ttrpg-book-artwork.jpg?itok=UzYIC2rs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The <em>Exodus</em> videogame was announced at the 2023 Game Awards. The game's creative head is James Ohlen, a game industry veteran whose work includes the original <em>Baldur's Gate</em>, <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em>, and <em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</em>. Aside from some pre-rendered trailers and an episode in the Prime Video anthology series, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/secret-level-brings-videogame-anthology-to-prime-video" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Secret Level</em></a>, not much else is known about its core gameplay or its setting.</p>

<p>The <em>Exodus</em> TTRPG helps shed some light in this regard. According to a deep dive <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/exodus/dnd-launch" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">by Wargamer</a>, players take on the role of Travelers. They are a community of space explorers who seek riches and advanced technology to bring back to their home world. The catch is that there is time dilation with FTL travel, meaning by the time they return home, years will have passed.</p>

<p>As for the RPG system at its core, it's <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Fifth Edition with some sci-fi tweaks. Gameplay caps at level 10 instead of level 20, but players' stats increase faster thanks to a Constellation tattoo mechanic. The game features four classes, each with two subclasses. Lastly, magic and magic items are replaced with substantive equipment, gear, augmentations, and spaceships.</p>

<p>The <em>Exodus</em> TTRPG is the latest part of a transmedia marketing approach to the Exodus game. This transmedia approach includes a novel, and the Star Heist actual play series.</p>

<p>The <em>Traveler's Handbook</em> is available at an MSRP of $28.55. The <em>Exodus Encyclopedia</em> is being sold for $35.99. Alternatively, the two-book bundle is available for $64.54.</p>
