            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>According to a hastily-deleted news post on the Ubisoft website, a&nbsp;<em>Far Cry&nbsp;</em>TV series is in development, and it sounds like it'll be taking a similar approach to the games in terms of focus.</p>

<p>The post, which is no longer available to view on the Ubisoft website, was caught before deletion by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/farcry/comments/1mlalqt/far_cry_series_adaptation_in_the_works_at_fx/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Redditor iwascuddles</a> (aww). As noted by fellow Redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/farcry/comments/1mlalqt/comment/n7p386g/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Kiribaku</a>, the show's description states that it will take the form of an anthology, with each season focusing on "a new world with a different cast of characters".</p>

<p>Beyond that, we don't know too much about how the show will work, including whether its seasons will adapt existing&nbsp;<em>Far Cry&nbsp;</em>games or whether entirely original stories will be produced for the series.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/far-cry-tv-show-far-cry-6.jpg?itok=aCoeyn7Q 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/far-cry-tv-show-far-cry-6.jpg?itok=bHGxSog7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A&nbsp;<em>Far Cry&nbsp;</em>TV series appears to be in the works.</figcaption></figure><p>If the post is accurate, however, then the&nbsp;<em>Far Cry&nbsp;</em>show will star&nbsp;<em>It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia</em>'s Rob Mac, formerly known as Rob McElhenney. He also serves as one of the show's co-creators, alongside&nbsp;<em>Fargo&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Alien: Earth&nbsp;</em>writer Noah Hawley, who will be&nbsp;<em>Far Cry</em>'s showrunner.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that this show technically hasn't officially been announced, so a lot of these details could be subject to change. Still, the announcement seems a little too comprehensive to be fake, so I'd imagine the <i>Far Cry&nbsp;</i>TV show will be officially unveiled sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>If the show does go ahead, it'll be the first major&nbsp;<em>Far Cry&nbsp;</em>project since 2023's&nbsp;<em>Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix</em>, which served as both a loose adaptation of 2013's&nbsp;<em>Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon&nbsp;</em>and an homage to Ubisoft's franchises in general.</p>

<p>The mainline series itself appears to have stalled somewhat; the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/far-cry-6" rel="nofollow">last major installment</a> was released back in 2021, and since then, no official&nbsp;<em>Far Cry 7&nbsp;</em>announcement has been made.</p>




<p>In any case, if the&nbsp;<em>Far Cry&nbsp;</em>TV show is real, it's probably going to be a while before we see any more of it, so for now, you'll have to content yourself with replaying the current games in the series. Stay tuned for more.</p>
