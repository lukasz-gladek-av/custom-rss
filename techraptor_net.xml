            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dd-beyond-releases-dungeons-dragons-2024-artificer-unearthed-arcana<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has announced new Unearthed Arcana for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>. Specifically, they have revealed official Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024 Artificer playtest material, meaning the class may be returning to the game in a future supplement.</p>



<p>In an <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/ua/the-artificer" rel="nofollow">official post</a> on D&amp;D Beyond, Wizards of the Coast has released the Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024 Artificer Unearthed Arcana for all users. The post includes a half-hour YouTube interview with Todd Kenrick and D&amp;D's lead designer, Jeremy Crawford.</p>

<p>The playtest material is notable since the Artificer class was absent in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-player-handbook-review-mixed-messaging-around-strong" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024</em> Player Handbook</a>. This updated version of the fantasy TTRPG rules was marketed as an update and consolidation of core player options, so the community saw its omission as a slight.</p>

<p>The class's core appeal is still intact: creating gadgets and gizmos that run on magic. The big change is that magical infusions, the ability to imbue mundane items with magic abilities, have been replaced with the ability to make magic items.</p>

<p>There's still a limitation on how many can be made based on Artificer level. But being able to just make Bags of Holding or Sending Stones is a notable upgrade. Furthermore, artificers can destroy these magic items to regain spell slots in a pinch. The benefits of the 2014's Artificer infusions are now separate magic items which can be made with the 2024 Artificer's class features.</p>

<p>The <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024</em> Artificer's late-game features are also tweaked. Flash of Genius can be used in response to a dice roll failing and can be used multiple times equal to their Intelligence modifier. And Soul of Artifice doesn't require a Reaction anymore, just destroy a magic item when you drop to 0 HP and you're back in the fight with 20 HP.</p>

The Alchemist's Chemical Mastery feature has been redesigned, allowing them to cast the 2024 spell Tasha's Bubbling Cauldron.</p>

<p>The Armorer's Perfect Armor has gotten a damage boost. The Artillerist's Eldritch Cannons have gotten more tactical options and explosive punch. Lastly, the Battle Smith's Steel Defender has gotten some adjustments to its health and damage output.</p>

<p>The release of the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024</em> Artificer Unearthed Arcana may hint at the class returning in a future supplement. It is hard to tell since certain UA material like the Mystic class has been lost to the ages. But given the Artificer's popularity, this may hint at good things on the horizon.</p>

<p>The feedback survey for this Unearthed Arcana goes live December 24, 2024.</p>
