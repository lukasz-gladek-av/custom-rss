            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>R. Talsorian Games has launched a new TTRPG project on Kickstarter. The RPG, <em>Shadow Scar</em>, is a genre-bending experience about dimension-hopping ninjas. It is also the passion project of the son of the creator of the RPG,&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk</em>.</p>

<h2>The <em>Shadow Scar</em> Kickstarter Campaign</h2>

<p>The campaign page for <em>Shadow Scar</em> dives straight into its high-concept worldbuilding. In the setting, yokai conspire across multiple worlds in the multiverse, referred to as The Mosaic, to resurrect Izanami, the Goddess of Death. Since this would shred the fabric of reality itself, a covert organization of shinobi, called the Shadow Scar Agency, are sent to these worlds to foil the yokai's plans.</p>

They are sent on missions throughout The Mosaic to stop the dangerous yokai with the power of stealth, social manipulation, and ancient ninjutsu arts. These are important since not only do yokai possess supernatural abilities like night vision and keen hearing, but the multiverse must not be aware of this secret Veil War.</p>

<p>The conceit is a bold mash-up of genres and ideas. This is clearly seen in the four established worlds in the game's Core Rulebook. Those settings include a version of 17th-Century Japan with magic, a steampunk fantasy version of industrial Britain, a pulp-noir version of 1920s New York full of masked crimefighters and weird science, and the space-faring far future.</p>

<p>Character creation in the <em>Shadow Scar</em> RPG should be familiar to veterans. Character creation includes creating a unique background, using a variation of <em>Cyberpunk's</em> Lifepath system, and creating a handler to help them in the field. As a character advances, they'll rise through the ranks of the Agency and gain access to new high-level abilities, as well as a wider array of tools, poisons, weapons, and magical artifacts.</p>

It revolves around pools of d6s and involves simple resolution mechanics. The system covers deadly combat, a stealth system tailored for ninja antics, and social mechanics packed with intrigue. Notably, the system emphasizes abilities over bonuses. This is a game where you don't +1 shurikens, but a game where you access more tools.</p>

<p>The lead designer of the game is Cody Pondsmith, the son of Cyberpunk creator Mike Pondsmith. Cody does have some strong experience under his belt, contributing to both <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/cyberpunk-red-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Cyberpunk Red</em></a> and the official <em>Witcher RPG</em>. The game is a passion project by the designer, one that was originally started as a Naruto RPG before expanding into its current form.</p>

<p>The pledge tiers of the <em>Shadow Scar</em> campaign are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Core Rulebook PDF for $19:</strong> A digital copy of the Core Rulebook fulfilled by DriveThruRPG</li>
	<li><strong>Hardcover Core Rulebook for $49:</strong> A physical and digital copy of the Core Rulebook</li>
	<li><strong>Core Rulebook and Starter Sets for $79:</strong> Physical and digital copies of the Core Rulebook and a Starter Set containing the Mask of the Green Demon prewritten adventure</li>
</ul><p>At the time of writing, the <em>Shadow Scar</em> campaign has raised&nbsp;$15,009, which is just over its initial funding goal of $14,500. The campaign ends November 1.</p>
