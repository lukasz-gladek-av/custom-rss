            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/as-we-descend-delayed-may<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Roguelike deckbuilder&nbsp;<em>As We Descend&nbsp;</em>has been delayed until May, but a concrete release date for the game has been revealed, so it won't be too much longer until you get to play it.</p>

<p>Back in February, it was announced that&nbsp;<em>As We Descend&nbsp;</em>would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/as-we-descend-early-access-release-date" rel="nofollow">arrive in Early Access in March</a>, but Kevin Chang, director of developer Box Dragon, says the game needs "a little more time in the oven" before it's ready.</p>

<p>As a sweetener, though, the game's demo, which is currently available on Steam, has been localized into 11 languages, including French, German, and Ukrainian, so more folks around the world can check it out before deciding to make a purchase.</p>

He goes on to say that the game's Early Access launch is "just the beginning".</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>As We Descend</em>, it's a roguelike deckbuilder set in a post-apocalyptic world "where resources are scarce and monsters threaten humanity’s very existence". Well, it wouldn't be much of a post-apocalyptic world without life-threatening danger.</p>

<p>Gameplay-wise,&nbsp;<em>As We Descend&nbsp;</em>is split between its card-battling combat and its diplomacy systems, which will see you building relationships with key figures in order to stave off crises and make critical alliances.</p>

<p>According to Box Dragon, you can expect&nbsp;<em>As We Descend</em>'s setting to offer a "desperate city that evolves and crumbles in unique ways based on the player’s decisions", so it sounds like you'll need to be careful what you choose during conversations.</p>




<p><em>As We Descend&nbsp;</em>is coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1769830/As_We_Descend/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on May 28th, and a demo is available to try out right now if you want to see whether the game is your cup of (presumably poisoned) tea or not.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/v-rising-11-update-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/v-rising-1-1-update-brings-new-biome-and-more-next-month.1146666/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/v-rising-11-update-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Stunlock Studios has revealed the release date for&nbsp;<em>V Rising&nbsp;</em>Update 1.1, which will serve as the vampire survival game's first major update since its 1.0 release.</p>

<p>The developer first promised a big new update for the game back in January, when&nbsp;<em>V Rising&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/v-rising-sales-top-5-million" rel="nofollow">crossed five million sales</a>. Now, that update, named "Invaders of Oakveil", has a release date: April 28th.</p>

<p>Invaders of Oakveil's first major addition to&nbsp;<em>V Rising&nbsp;</em>is the eponymous Oakveil Woodlands, a new biome filled with "deadly enemies, new bosses, and dark magic techniques" for you to discover. As the name suggests, it's a forest biome.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/v-rising-update-1.1-invaders-of-oakveil.jpg?itok=2LPD8amB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/v-rising-update-1.1-invaders-of-oakveil.jpg?itok=snKXy4JZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>V Rising</em>'s 1.1 update is coming in April.</figcaption></figure><p>It's not just the new biome, though. Update 1.1 will also bring the ability to build custom duel arenas within your castle, then challenge your friends (or anyone you like) to a duel. Don't worry, though; duels won't have any consequences, so you can fight to your heart's content.</p>

<p>Three new weapons will be added in the form of the Claws, the Twinblade, and the Throwing Daggers, each of which, Stunlock says, will unlock "fresh combat strategies and unique playstyles". They'll be accompanied by seven new spells for you to test out.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to&nbsp;<em>V Rising</em>'s "biggest combat overhaul yet", which the developer says will bring "a deep stat rework, rebalanced gear, completely overhauled blood types, and powerful new customization tools".</p>

<p>All of this and more will be introduced as part of Invaders of Oakveil, and you can watch the debut trailer for the update (which admittedly doesn't give a whole lot away) right here.</p>




<p><em>V Rising&nbsp;</em>is an open-world survival game in which you play the vampiric lord of a castle. You must sally forth into the mortal world to collect resources, do battle with powerful rivals, and establish your dominion as a lord.</p>

<p>The game is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1604030/V_Rising/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/v-rising/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and its Invaders of Oakveil update lands on April 28th.</p>
