            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In another sign that the industry is doing very well and everything is going completely fine, it'll soon be possible to pay for certain in-game DLC purchases in installments rather than in one lump sum.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/now-you-can-buy-in-game-dlc-and-pay-it-off-later/1100-6532906/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gamespot</a>, buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) company Affirm has teamed up with commerce outfit Xsolla in order to allow players to "pay off in-game purchases of $50 or more on payment plans" (that's Gamespot's wording).</p>

<p>Essentially, you'll see Affirm as another payment option when you make a DLC purchase of this magnitude. You'll then be subject to a credit check, and if you pass that check, you'll be able to buy your DLC across several installments.</p>

Xsolla works with lots of studios and publishers, but it hasn't announced which companies have signed up for the Xsolla-Affirm partnership.</p>

<p>However, as Gamespot points out, Epic Games has been confirmed as a partner for the studios, which means we could start seeing BNPL-based DLC purchases in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>before long.</p>

<p>If you're wondering what kind of ungodly&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>skin could cost that much, you might be overlooking in-game currency; a bundle of 13,500 V-Bucks will <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/item-shop/v-bucks?lang=en-US" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">set you back $90</a>, so hey, why wouldn't you want to pay that back piece by piece?</p>

<p>This deal comes at a time when many of the most popular games around right now are free-to-play (<a href="https://store.rockstargames.com/buy-gta-v-shark-cash-cards" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">and paid</a>!) titles <a href="https://store.ea.com/apex-legends/en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">complete</a> with in-game purchases, and many of those can run $50 or more, so it's easy to see why this decision has been made.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/apex-legends-dlc-installments.jpg?itok=wEA6LQ0Z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/apex-legends-dlc-installments.jpg?itok=a93Lseoq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Paying for expensive&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends&nbsp;</em>currency bundles might get "easier" in future.</figcaption></figure><p>Still, it's hard not to see this as an indictment of an industry that appears to be getting greedier with players' wallets; perhaps I'm old-fashioned, but I'm just not sure $50 and upwards in DLC or microtransaction purchases can be healthy, unless it's a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree" rel="nofollow">substantial expansion</a> (and even then, you're unlikely to pay that much).</p>

<p>It's worth noting here that no game has adopted this system yet, and that it might be a while until we see it crop up as part of in-game stores. Still, that's almost certainly on the cards for the future. Yay!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Everwild Canceled as Xbox Studio Rare Hit by Layoff Wave]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/everwild-canceled-as-xbox-studio-rare-hit-by-layoff-wave.1234161/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rare appears to have become caught up in Microsoft's round of layoffs today, and the developer's long-running project&nbsp;<em>Everwild&nbsp;</em>also seems to have been canceled, according to a new report.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sources-everwild-has-been-cancelled-as-xbox-layoffs-hit-rare/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">VGC</a>,&nbsp;<em>Everwild</em>, which hasn't been heard from in some time (barring a somewhat vague update from Xbox boss Phil Spencer earlier this year), has been shut down. Additionally, employees at Rare are "likely to lose their jobs" (that's VGC's wording, but the publication is citing "people with knowledge of the project").</p>

<p>It's all part of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" rel="nofollow">massive round of layoffs</a> at Microsoft that began earlier today, with&nbsp;<em>Candy Crush&nbsp;</em>studio King and Bethesda's parent company ZeniMax already affected by job cuts. Other studios, like Rare, were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-layoffs-next-week-report" rel="nofollow">widely expected</a> to enter Microsoft's crosshairs as part of these cuts.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/everwild-xbox-layoffs-rare.jpg?itok=buQfwUTQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/everwild-xbox-layoffs-rare.jpg?itok=lFkBDB39 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Everwild&nbsp;</em>has been canceled, according to "people familiar with the project".</figcaption></figure><p>Although&nbsp;<em>Everwild&nbsp;</em>is almost certainly one of the victims of this layoff wave, which could see upwards of 9,000 employees losing their jobs, it hasn't been without its own troubles in the past as well.</p>

<p>The game was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-is-beautifully-serene-game-from-rare" rel="nofollow">announced all the way back in 2019</a>&nbsp;with a rather evocative trailer, albeit one that didn't show too much in the way of concrete gameplay.</p>

<p>That would turn out to be a consistent theme with&nbsp;<em>Everwild</em>; another trailer was shown <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-trailer-shown-at-xbox-games-event" rel="nofollow">during the Xbox event in July 2020</a>, and while it was certainly visually striking, it once again failed to show exactly what kind of game&nbsp;<em>Everwild&nbsp;</em>would be.</p>

<p>Between then and now, Xbox didn't say much about&nbsp;<em>Everwild&nbsp;</em>at all, but rumors swirled that the game's development had essentially been rebooted, suggesting that Rare and Xbox weren't entirely sure in which direction they wanted to take their latest project.</p>




<p>It's hard to say whether&nbsp;<em>Everwild&nbsp;</em>would have been granted more of a reprieve were these layoffs not being put into effect. Its lengthy, seemingly troubled development gives the impression of a game that nobody was quite sure about, so it may well have ended up falling by the wayside anyway.</p>

<p>In any case, with&nbsp;<em>Everwild&nbsp;</em>now dead, Rare doesn't have another publicly-announced project in the works. Xbox doesn't seem to be shuttering the studio (for now, at least; there's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown" rel="nofollow">certainly past form in this area</a>), so we'll just have to wait and see what happens next.</p>
