            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Asmodee has acquired another board game IP. Specifically, the tabletop publishing giant has acquired the rights to the cosmic horror board game <em>Cthulhu: Death May Die</em> from the struggling tabletop studio CMON. This may hint that Asmodee is investing in crowdfunding.</p>

<h2>Asmodee's Acquisition of <em>Cthulhu: Death May Die</em></h2>

<p>In a recent report by <a href="https://boardgamewire.com/index.php/2025/10/20/asmodee-continues-push-into-crowdfunding-by-buying-cthulhu-death-may-die-series-from-struggling-cmon/" rel="nofollow">Board Game Wire</a>, Asmodee has bought the rights to <em>Cthulhu: Death May Die</em> from CMON for an undisclosed amount of money. As part of this acquisition, Asmodee will fulfill the Gamefound campaign for the latest expansion for the board game, <em>Forbidden Reaches</em>, which raised more than $3.9 million last December.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cthulhu-death-may-die-game-board.jpg?itok=zgf4RBTc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cthulhu-death-may-die-game-board.jpg?itok=lMorj_ib 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>Cthulhu: Death May Die</em> is the second of CMON's IPs that Asmodee has acquired, following the co-op zombie game <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/asmodee-acquires-zombicide-ip-from-board-game-publisher-cmon" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Zombicide</em></a>. This is due to CMON's ongoing financial struggles as a result of reckless, disruptive trade tariffs devastating the industry.</p>

<p>The resulting trade and production chaos has led to the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cmon-reduces-staff-and-pauses-board-game-development-amid-us-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reducing staff</a>, adding extra charges for certain backers, and selling off other IP such as <em>Rising Sun</em> and <em>Blood Rage</em>.</p>

<p>Notably, a lot of CMON's board game library were a result of crowdfunding. Given the recent acquisitions and the hiring of CMON former COO David Preti to Asmodee's new crowdfunding and miniatures operation, it is a strong possibility the tabletop giant may be looking to crowdfunding platforms for certain future projects.</p>

<p>As a result of these financial issues, CMON has announced it will be moving away from large box, miniature-focused board game experiences. Instead, tey will be pivoting to small box games released directly to retail.</p>

<p>Cthulhu: Death May Die was originally developed in 2018 via Kickstarter campaign. Since then, the board game has received critical acclaim and several crowdfunded expansions such as Fear of the Unknown and R'lyeh Rising. The game was designed by Rob Davlau (<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/pendemic-legacy-season-2-review-infectious" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Pandemic Legacy</em></a>, <em>Unmatched: Cobble and Fog</em>) and Eric Lang (<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/mass-effect-board-game-review-back-to-reaper-war" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Mass Effect: The Board Game</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bloodborne-board-game-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Bloodborne: The Board Game</em></a>)</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sometimes finding the correct box set for your Strike Team in Star Wars: Shatterpoint can be hard. But don't worry because we have you covered on that front, with a series of expansions that you should be keeping your eyes on to help you dominate the galaxy (or table). I just r<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/star-wars-shatterpoint-fall-2025-expansions-elegant-weapon-for-more-civilized-0" rel="nofollow">eviewed some newer releases from the line</a>, and now Asmodee USA sent me review copies of all the expansions mentioned below, so let's take a quick look!</p>

<h2>Plans And Preparations</h2>

<p>Admittedly, one of the main reasons that lured me towards this box was that it had Clone Commandos attached. This more or less worked in my favor because one of the main factions I'm trying to stick with is the Galactic Republic.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_172113252.portrait.jpg?itok=GproN-PH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_172113252.portrait.jpg?itok=Z501NKsD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Lots of plans.</figcaption></figure><p>Many of the keywords for the characters in this unit buff other Galactic Republic/Jedi characters. If you already have the Hello There or This Party's Over box, you can easily pair them together for real damage. If you want to get creative with it, Jedi Master Luminara Unduli works well with virtually anyone in the Galactic Republic without trying too hard.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_172128732.portrait-1.jpg?itok=Ndmh7iA0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_172128732.portrait-1.jpg?itok=hcRH5bkD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Lots of preparation.</figcaption></figure><p>Perhaps the thing I appreciated about this set was how dynamic the Clone minis were. They're posed extremely well, and one even comes with some slight cover to help make it feel more alive. Little details like that really help bring the whole set together.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_172213398.portrait.jpg?itok=ipzF1Nkn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_172213398.portrait.jpg?itok=fVgUdLpd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Best boys.</figcaption></figure><h2>Witches of Dathomir</h2>

<p>The Witches of Dathomir is a really interesting one, because they don't have a lot of synergy with many other troops, and the only one with the Separatist Alliance keyword is Savage Orpress.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_171820615.portrait.jpg?itok=zzAmPxMW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_171820615.portrait.jpg?itok=gX7TzRrd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Just in time for spooky season.</figcaption></figure><p>That being said, it's not all doom and gloom because everyone in this set does share the Force User keyword, so you can pair them up with others who buff characters with the same trait. With all of that said, though, I still couldn't think of a more fun unit to play. Mother Talzin has a lot of incredible abilities that buff other characters with the Dathomiran keyword, one of which allows them to heal right after a character has been injured. While Savage Opress is about getting up close and personal, the Nightsister Acolytes can support from afar.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_171907132.portrait.jpg?itok=dRXPipsV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_171907132.portrait.jpg?itok=yXPbSZu1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Get this guy up close for some serious damage.</figcaption></figure><p>This set, in particular, caters to many different play styles while encouraging you to try something new. Even if you're not entirely sold on them, each character in this unit can pack a serious punch in combat, and they are all some of the best models in the game. And I had the most fun when it came to painting these.</p>



<p>If I'm being perfectly honest, I had no business getting this set at all. The reason why I got this was 100% based on the rule of cool. Because if having a squad full of Ewoks fighting Vader and friends doesn't sound like a good time, I don't know what does.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_172626799.portrait.jpg?itok=9jWTjk75 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_172626799.portrait.jpg?itok=AGudJd4z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some Yubs.</figcaption></figure><p>What's unique about this set is that it comes with five models, but the trade-off is that each doesn't have a lot of health, so you have to be smart about how you use them. Thankfully, each character in this team is stacked to the brim with all sorts of abilities, and it does a great job at capturing the guerilla warfare vibes we see them do in the film.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_172635938.portrait.original.jpg?itok=rqBk4szT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_172635938.portrait.original.jpg?itok=fodno0Ir 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some Nubs.</figcaption></figure><p>To make things even better, they have a Battle Tactic card centered on trapping your opponent in one way or another. The only downside to this squad is that most of the synergy is based around other Ewoks, so if you pair them up with anything else, you won't get a lot of mileage out of them.</p>

<h2>High Ground Terrain Pack</h2>

<p>Terrain is one of those things that you can never have too much of, and the High Ground is a perfect addition for any game. As the name suggests, it offers a lot of elevated areas for your strike team to use.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_172732955.portrait.jpg?itok=MRfUKqdV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_172732955.portrait.jpg?itok=_EvrtvZJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>They said the thing!</figcaption></figure><p>The one thing I especially enjoy about this set is the four bridges it comes with, because it adds an extra layer to a fight when the objective marker is right below you. The great thing with Shatterpoint Terrain is that each pack can be perfectly paired with the other. They all fit together more or less like a puzzle piece, so you never really have to worry about one set being out of place.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_172748487.portrait.jpg?itok=r0fpMagl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_172748487.portrait.jpg?itok=XxQDRpV0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This is great for having a lot of elevated fights.</figcaption></figure><p>Hopefully, this tiny list made things a bit easier for you when deciding what to purchase in Star Wars: Shatterpoint. Many of these units can be used in various ways and offer unique play styles that encourage you to try new things. As I previously said, you can never go wrong with terrain because each offers something unique that adds flavor to the fight.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The galaxy is under threat from the brutal aliens known as the Komplex, and humanity's only hope are the pilots of the Forge, an elite squadron of ships with interchangeable parts that allow them to adapt to any situation, known as Snap Ships. In this article, we'll check out the <em>Snap Ships Tactics</em> Starter Box.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/snap-ships-tactics-starter-box-2.jpg?itok=wGAkaFS4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/snap-ships-tactics-starter-box-2.jpg?itok=j38D-XMX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The <em>Snap Ships Tactics</em> Starter Box contains 2 ships, 1 for each faction, that can be built in a variety of ways.</figcaption></figure><h2>Ships That Snap?</h2>

<p>Before there was <em>Snap Ships Tactics</em>, there were <em>Snap Ships</em>, customisable ships that players could build from the multitude of options available. These ships, like other building-style toys, have instructions to build fixed builds, or players are able to create their own freestyle ideas.</p>

<p>The starter set contains 2 ships, 1 from each of the 2 factions (Komplex and Forge), with over 100 individual parts and 8 possible builds (4 for each). The different elements of the ships fit together very cleanly, and the instructions are clear and easy to follow.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/snap-ships-tactics-starter-box-6.jpg?itok=5cCjN_gh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/snap-ships-tactics-starter-box-6.jpg?itok=5ECgtg7T 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Each part card has a corresponding physical part for which to build your Snap Ship.</figcaption></figure><h2>How Much Tactics?</h2>

<p><em>Snap Ships Tactics</em> is a tabletop wargame ruleset that allows you to pit your creations against others. At a glance, it feels very much like a lite version of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/star-wars-x-wing-minatures-game-2nd-edition-core-set-review-perfect-time-to-join" rel="nofollow">Star Wars X-Wing</a>, but with much larger ships, and more choices for each ship each turn, because the interchangeable parts for the ships aren't just cosmetic. Each part also has a card that gives part actions you can perform.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/snap-ships-tactics-starter-box-7.jpg?itok=705IBcic 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/snap-ships-tactics-starter-box-7.jpg?itok=VrD4AWWE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>To preform the C6-3 Gatling Gun attack, you need to put 2 power and 1 heat on the part, which then allows you to roll 6 attack dice.</figcaption></figure><p>Each turn in <em>Snap Ships Tactics</em>, when you activate a ship, you complete the chassis actions for that ship, fixed actions such as venting to remove power and heat cubes from a part card, or the fixed minimum movement for your ship. You can then perform part actions, which have a power/heat cost for which cubes of the corresponding type are added to the part card when used. Each chassis has a fixed number of power cubes, and you can complete as many actions as you have power cubes for. A part with any type of cube on it can't be used, so you need to plan each turn when venting cubes from cards.</p>

<p>Multiple types of actions can be performed each turn, depending on your part cards, from extra movement, attacks, repair, evade, ramming, reactions (played in your opponent's turn in response to their action) and launch actions, such as firing missiles, which take longer to hit than standard attacks, and allows you opponent time to take anti-missile actions in their turn.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/snap-ships-tactics-starter-box-3.jpg?itok=T-zcyfUz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/snap-ships-tactics-starter-box-3.jpg?itok=Kg_qS3Q6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Snap Ships Tactics</em> movement tool has a short and long movement part, and notches to align turning.</figcaption></figure><p>The movement and attack mechanics are kept simple using custom dice and all the required details on the part cards. Attacks use custom D10s, with the to-hit number and number of dice detailed by the attack card, which is usually modified by your opponent's evasion value. Movement happens using a custom movement tool with handy clicks for rotation and short and long movement lengths that the ship's bases fit into.</p>

<p>The game itself is pretty fun, and the turn flow works well, with plenty of choices for actions depending on your ship's build. The ships feel massive compared to other dog-fight style wargames, which is fine in the 1 vs 1 of the starter set, but it probably limits the number of ships you'll be able to play with by the size of the surface you have to play on. It's also worth noting that in a 1 vs 1 game, it's almost entirely decided by which ship can complete the tightest turn after the first pass.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/snap-ships-tactics-starter-box-5.jpg?itok=VdUomkOb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/snap-ships-tactics-starter-box-5.jpg?itok=QOlmxV0_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The cards above detail 2 possible build options for the KLAW Interceptor in <em>Snap Ships Tactics</em>.</figcaption></figure><h2>Customization!</h2>

<p>Out of the starter set, there are a few options for different builds. Both ships have 4 core chassis, which don't change the ship's core stats, but instead offer a different passive ability, like the default Sabre XF-23 Fighter, which allows you to choose which part is disabled on the first critical hit, or the Sabre XR-01 Fast Recon, which can rotate for free after you complete a long move.</p>

<p>The real customisation comes from the part cards, of which each ship gets 14. The cockpit for both is fixed, but there are 2 thrusters and 2 wing choices for both fighters, and 9 system parts to fill out the final 3 part cards. The systems cards are your weapons, armor, and fins for extra maneuverability, allowing you to choose to fully kit out your ship with 2 weapons and missiles, or a single weapon and 2 sets of fins in order to guarantee your target is always within your firing arc. Or a balanced mix of armor, fins, and weapons, or some other combination, including other options like the KLAW's BZ2 Booster for extra speed, or the KX Power Cycle vent to allow you to use a part twice a turn.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/snap-ships-tactics-starter-box-4.jpg?itok=B9HxErLO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/snap-ships-tactics-starter-box-4.jpg?itok=WJAGpA7I 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The <em>Snap Ships Tactics</em> starter box includes 4 different chassis cards and builds for the Sabre.</figcaption></figure><h2>Snap Ship Tactics Starter Box Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>The <em>Snap Ships Tactics</em>&nbsp;Starter Box is a fun little set. The core rules are simple and easy to follow, with the variety of gameplay coming from the different build options. The 2 different ships, with chassis and part options, do provide a lot of variety, and the 1 vs 1 game can be fun, but it usually does come down to maneuverability, and there isn't a lot of variety in this set for that, so further expansion is required to get the full tactical experience. The ships do feel quite large coming out of other wargames, but there is a very satisfying aspect to physically clipping on your parts as you build your ship.</p>
