            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>US sales analysis firm Circana has published its data for January 2026, and a certain perennially popular first-person shooter franchise has topped the all-format chart once again.</p><p>That's right: according to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3mfcbfnjphk2r" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Circana's Mat Piscatella</a>, <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 </em>is once again at the top of the chart across all platforms, and that includes both physical and digital sales. Not bad for a game that's just had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/uk-asa-bans-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ad" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="62705299-3fce-436c-813b-920cf2f9c7f2" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">an ad banned in the UK</a>.</p><p>The rest of the chart honestly isn't too surprising. <em>NBA 2K26 </em>is in second place, and <em>Madden NFL 26 </em>brings up third. That's to be expected; they're both from hugely popular sports franchises, after all. Fourth place is occupied by <em>Minecraft</em>, and <em>Battlefield 6 </em>is in fifth.</p><figure role="group">

            <guid>1441687</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Finji, the publisher behind indie hits like <em>Tunic </em>and <em>Night in the Woods</em>, has accused social media platform TikTok of creating "racist" and "sexist" generative AI ads for its games without its permission.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tunic-night-in-the-woods-publisher-says-tiktok-is-creating-and-running-racist-genai-ads-for-its-games-without-permission" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">IGN</a>, Finji first became aware of these ads through comments on its non-AI ads from concerned fans. One ad reportedly depicts the protagonist of Finji's game <em>Usual June</em>, a Black woman, in a way that, in IGN's words, seemingly "invokes a harmful stereotype".</p><p>Creatives and businesses on TikTok can choose to opt into a program called Smart Creative, which essentially grants TikTok permission to remix their content and ads with generative AI. You've probably already guessed this, but Finji's account had this option resolutely switched off.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Usual June </em>and <em>Night in the Woods </em>publisher Finji has some harsh words for TikTok, and rightly so.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Needless to say, Finji CEO Rebekah Saltsman raised this issue with TikTok's support center, and what follows can only be described as a descent into Kafkaesque absurdity.</p><p>At first, TikTok seems supportive, with a support agent pledging to "raise a ticket" to alert the relevant teams to what's going on. Following that, however, Finji and Saltsman received a response claiming that there was no "indication" of generative AI being used for the ads in question.</p><p>Naturally, a Finji rep then responds by providing evidence that this is not the case, upon which TikTok backtracks and promises to "initiate an internal escalation".</p><p>Finji still can't breathe easy at this point, though, because upon following up with TikTok, the studio was told that it was included in an automated ad initiative, again without its consent, and that said initiative "typically [brings] a 1.4x return on ad spend lift" for those enrolled.</p>
<p>Saltsman and Finji demand that the issue be re-escalated, and TikTok demurs, claiming that it's already passed the issue on to "the highest internal team" available, and that said team has "already provided [its] final findings and actions".</p><p>Finji replies yet again, upon which TikTok pledges to "re-escalate" the problem, but according to IGN and Saltsman, that's the last the studio heard from TikTok, and a followup message sent a few days ago yielded nothing.</p><p>Generative AI is already an intensely controversial topic in the gaming industry, with some studios <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/divinity-larian-gen-ai-concept-art" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="456b3d42-117f-4386-bca9-617e6237ee89" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">throwing their weight behind it</a> and others <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hooded-horse-no-gen-ai-contracts" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4bf049e2-a4f8-41a0-b834-8030bfbcc977" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">opposing it for all they're worth</a>.</p><p>To me, though, it seems like this usage of the technology - generating AI ads without the consent of the studio concerned, then seemingly deflecting and even essentially gaslighting the studio into believing that no, it's a good thing, actually - is beyond the pale.</p><p>We'll have to wait and see whether Finji and TikTok's issue gets resolved in future, but judging by the correspondence shared by the studio thus far, I don't think there's much cause for optimism. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/skate-map-paywall-season-3</link>
            <guid>1441645</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has reneged on one of its promises for last year's <em>Skate </em>reboot, namely that the game will feature "no map areas locked behind paywalls".</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/skate/news/dev-update-s3-skatepass-grom-and-the-future" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">news post</a> outlining what's coming to <em>Skate </em>in the future, EA says that the game's third season will introduce the new Isle of Grom map, which has been expanded and filled with new areas to explore.</p><p>Initially, only <em>Skate </em>Pass Premium holders will be able to explore the Isle of Grom, but after the first month, the map will be opened up to everyone for a "very special multi-week event". That event is limited, though; afterwards, you'll have to pay in one form or another to access the Isle of Grom.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Skate</em>'s new map is pretty much locked behind a paywall. Yuck.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>After the aforementioned "very special" event, you'll either need to hold the <em>Skate </em>Pass Premium or pay in-game Rip Chips to access the Isle of Grom, and the latter will only net you a 24-hour pass, so it's not permanent.</p><p>Technically speaking - and I mean real fine-print technical here - the new map isn't really locked behind a paywall per se, because you can theoretically access it without paying real money.</p><p>Still, though, I'd say this is a contravention of what EA <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/skate-4-now-titled-skate-will-be-free-to-play" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="966b1818-c2c5-4648-9899-942a622c5274" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">promised all the way back in 2022</a> in spirit, if not absolutely in letter. It's not a great look to need to argue the finer detail rather than the broader picture.</p><p>Perhaps more insultingly, in response to a player asking why EA stepped away from the no-maps-behind-paywalls promise, the company rather dismissively <a href="https://x.com/skate/status/2024539083259654345" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">says</a> that "plans have to change" sometimes, and that "that's part of the deal when you're building in public".</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Welp.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In fact, one X <a href="https://x.com/its6767/status/2024645684272480620" rel="nofollow">user</a> points out that just one week ago, <em>Skate</em>'s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260213192103/https://www.ea.com/games/skate/skate/faq" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">website FAQ</a> declared that "new areas of San Vansterdam (the game's world) will always be free and available to all players...if it's there, you can go there". Suffice it to say the FAQ <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/skate/faq" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">no longer</a> features that passage.</p><p>Of course, the obvious question to ask here is this: if EA can walk back this promise, what's to stop the company ditching the others in the above image too? How long before <em>Skate </em>features pay-to-win elements, paid loot boxes, or paid gameplay advantages?</p><p>For now, at the very least, if you want to access <em>Skate</em>'s Isle of Grom map beyond May, you're going to have to pay for it in some form. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

<p>We already know one thing that's going to be featured during the show, namely the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-firered-leafgreen-switch" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="057d121c-d519-4dfa-af54-03ce59fa9f52" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Switch release of <em>Pokemon FireRed and LeafGreen</em></a>, which was confirmed earlier today. The games will launch just after the showcase concludes.</p><p>What else we'll see during this Pokemon Presents is a mystery for now, although we can make some educated guesses; it's likely that mobile games <em>Pokemon Cafe ReMix </em>and <em>Pokemon Masters EX</em> will appear, as they usually do, and we'll probably hear from <em>Pokemon Unite </em>as well.</p><p>Outside of the realms of virtual certainty, I'd be very surprised indeed if this presentation doesn't contain at least a nod to the upcoming tenth <em>Pokemon </em>generation. Back in October, a massive <em>Pokemon </em>leak <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-leak-2025-gen-10-more" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c5a709d9-d361-46d9-823d-aa0957eba8ed" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">seemingly revealed details about gen ten</a>, so the clock's ticking on an official reveal.</p><p>We may also see more DLC announced for last year's <em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>. The game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-a-sales" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2d5d3818-49a2-4447-89bf-e19e298fa0df" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">sold very well indeed</a>, so a second DLC pack after <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension-dlc-release-date" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1a7fab66-8e9f-461b-8e80-b39e300cbd1a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">December's <em>Mega Dimension</em></a><em> </em>seems like a good idea.</p>
<p>Whatever gets announced, the next Pokemon Presents will be airing on February 27th at 6am PT/9am ET/2pm GMT.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has revealed that <em>NieR: Automata </em>has crossed another major sales milestone, and if a new teaser is to be believed, more <em>NieR </em>could finally be on the way.</p><p>Per <a href="https://x.com/NieRGame/status/2024800054004138394" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a message</a> on the official <em>NieR </em>X account, <em>NieR: Automata </em>has officially sold over 10 million copies. That figure counts across both digital and physical sales, naturally, and it also includes all platforms on which the game is currently available.</p><p>The new sales figure means that <em>NieR: Automata </em>has racked up another million sales for itself <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nier-automata-sales-9m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="144a48d3-7eae-44a0-bba4-85056ad4cc63" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">since December 2024</a>.

<figcaption><em>NieR: Automata </em>has hit 10 million sales worldwide.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There's reason to hope that more <em>NieR </em>could be coming, too. At the conclusion of a new video celebrating the 10 million achievement, a message simply reads "<em>NieR: Automata </em>to be continued...".</p><p>It's worth noting that the rest of the video is entirely in Japanese, so it's possible that this is a mistranslation, or that the message simply points to more <em>NieR: Automata </em>media in future. Perhaps a current-gen port could even be on the cards.</p><p>Still, <em>NieR: Automata </em>remains the last new mainline release in the <em>NieR </em>series at time of writing, so I don't think it's unreasonable to hope that Square Enix could be gearing up to give Yoko Taro another chance to hold the reins this year.</p><p>You can watch the aforementioned video, which celebrates <em>NieR: Automata</em>'s achievements over the years, right here.</p>
