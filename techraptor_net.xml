            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/jackbox-games-announces-fakin-it-card-game-bringing-their-party-games-to-gaming<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A Fakin' It card game is on its way. This is a tabletop adaptation of one of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/jackbox-games-10-years-of-laughing-quipping-and-fibbing" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Jackbox Games'</a> large catalog of digital party games. It is also the studio's first foray into making a physical card game.</p>

<h2>The <em>Fakin' It</em> Card Game Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, the <em>Fakin' It</em> card game is, understandably, a social deduction card game based on the <em>Fakin' It</em> videogame designed for 3-6 players.</p>

Each card has a task written on it, that the players must read through their secret wallets. The twist is that one of these wallets won't reveal what the card says, meaning the player has to fake the task to score points.</p>

<p>The <em>Fakin' It</em> card game is broken up into five categories. Hands of Truth involves players raising their hands or keeping them down. Number Pressure has players raising a certain number of fingers between 1-10. You Gotta Point has you pointing fingers at another player or yourself. Face Value is about making facial expressions. Finally, Text You Up is about answering the question on the card truthfully.</p>

<p>If you enjoy a rowdier, raunchier party environment, the <em>Fakin' It</em> card game will be releasing alongside <em>Fakin' It All Night Long</em>, a version of the game aimed at the 17+ crowd.</p>

<p>This marks the first tabletop game released by Jackbox Games. The studio has made a reputation for itself with entertaining digital party games that can be played on PCs, consoles, or smart phones. Their past work includes <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/jackbox-survey-scramble-review-wed-like-to-play-steve" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Survey Scramble</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/review/quiplash-review-perfect-you-your-friends-or-strangers-internet" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Quiplash</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/jackbox-naughty-pack-review-spicier-but-not-too-crass" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Naughty Pack</em></a>.</p>

<p>Given their body of work has consistently been about simple but fun party game shenanigans, the move from digital to physical is an understandable one.</p>

<p>The Fakin' It card game will be available on Amazon storefronts November 1. Fakin' It will contain 300 cards and will be sold at an MSRP of $19.99. Fakin' It All Night Long will include 150 cards and will be available at an MSRP of $9.99.</p>
