The global board game publisher's future was uncertain after its spin-off from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-splitting-three-companies" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Embracer Group</a> and being saddled with <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/asmodee-group-saddled-with-eu900-million-debt-by-embracer-group" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">considerable debt</a>. But thanks to recent events, their new strategy is mostly unchanged from their old one.</p>

<h2>Asmodee Group's Future Acquisition Plans</h2>

<p>According to its Capital Markets Day <a href="https://ir.financialhearings.com/asmodee-cmd-2024" rel="nofollow">presentation</a>, Asmodee Group plans to restart its strategy of buying smaller board game publishers and distributors following their separation from Embracer Group.</p>

The broad group of companies under Asmodee's ownership includes <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/z-man-games-announces-arkham-horror-lovecraft-letter-eldritch-twist-on-classic" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Z-Man Games</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/star-wars-unlimited-shadows-of-galaxy-announced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Fantasy Flight Games</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/catan-is-coming-to-board-game-arena" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Catan Studios</a>.</p>

<p>In the presentation, Asmodee Group's CEO, Thomas Koegler, states they have a pipeline of more than 20 acquisition opportunites. Those opportunities include social and party game studios across the US and EU, and local distribution players to help strengthen their position in established companies.</p>

<p>According to Koegler, the acquisition targets being monitored are companies Asmodee knows well. Most of them are business partners the company interacts with on a daily basis spread across distribution and publishing. None of these companies were explicitly named.</p>

Those circumstances include being bought by Embracer Group in 2021. This was part of a string of purchases by Embracer, including <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Space Marine 2</em></a> developer Saber Interactive and The <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-lord-of-the-rings-prototypes" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Lord of the Rings</em></a> IP.</p>

<p>This came to an end when one of Embracer Group's deals fell through and they were saddled with <a href="https://boardgamewire.com/index.php/2023/06/13/asmodee-owner-embracer-group-to-make-layoffs-to-help-tackle-1-5bn-debt-pile/" rel="nofollow">$1.45 billion</a> in debt. This lead to layoffs, selling studios, spinning off Asmodee Group and saddling them with €900 million in debt.</p>

<p>That debt is less daunting thanks to an investment by Embracer. As part of the proceeds of selling mobile game developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-financials-q2-2024" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Easybrain</a>, Embracer <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-intends-to-contribute-eur-400m-to-asmodee-and-presents-asmodees-financial-targets-dividend-policy-and-net-financial-debt/" rel="nofollow">is investing</a>&nbsp;€400m into Asmodee Group.&nbsp;€300 million will go towards the debt, the&nbsp;€100 million remainder will go to strengthening their balance sheet ahead of their company listing, allowing them to continue their M&amp;A business strategy.</p>
