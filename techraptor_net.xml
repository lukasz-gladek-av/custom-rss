            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-roadmap-legends-of-zone-next-gen-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>developer GSC Game World has revealed that it will release the game's content roadmap at the beginning of next year, and there's good news if you've been waiting for a certain next-gen patch as well.</p>

<p>In its <a href="https://x.com/stalker_thegame/status/1870106910751703303" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">end-of-year message</a> on social media platform X, GSC Game World pledges to continue updating&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>throughout next year. As a reminder, the company recently released a major patch for the game that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-update-1-1-a-life" rel="nofollow">features over 1800 fixes</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, the studio promises to share the&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>roadmap at the start of 2025, although it doesn't commit to a specific date. It's likely we'll get to see what GSC Game World has planned for its latest game sometime in January or February at the very latest.</p>

Though the update was promised for Xbox Series X|S, it seems to be coming to PS5 as well, if GSC Game World's message is anything to go by.</p>

<p>In the post, GSC Game World says the next-gen patch for "the console versions" of&nbsp;<em>Legends of the Zone Trilogy&nbsp;</em>will arrive next year, and the PC versions of the games will also bring the enhancements introduced by said patch.</p>

<p>They'll include "additional graphical enhancements and other features", as well as mod support, although the latter may be a while away yet.</p>

We'll just have to wait and see.</p>

<p>In the meantime,&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/stalker-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and the&nbsp;<em>Legends of the Zone Trilogy&nbsp;</em>can be found on <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UB0046-CUSA43979_00-0336574734560734" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/stalker-legends-of-the-zone-trilogy/9n4gffdg41jr" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/s-t-a-l-k-e-r-legends-of-the-zone-trilogy-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> (although you'll technically be playing the last-gen ports on PlayStation and Xbox until the next-gen version arrives).</p>
