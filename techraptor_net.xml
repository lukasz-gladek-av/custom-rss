            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/avalon-hill-talisman-betrayal-expansions<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Avalon Hill has announced major expansions for&nbsp;<em>Betrayal at House on the Hill&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Talisman</em>, and they're both on their way to retailers later this year.</p>

<p>First up,&nbsp;<em>Talisman&nbsp;</em>is getting a new expansion by the name of&nbsp;<em>Talisman Nemesis: Call of the Hunt</em>. It'll bring new "one vs. many" gameplay, in which one player will take on the rest of the table across three new "unique and mysterious" campaigns that unlock "new evil creatures and game mechanics".</p>

<p><em>Talisman Nemesis: Call of the Hunt&nbsp;</em>follows on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/talisman-alliances-review-work-together-for-even-harder-challenge" rel="nofollow">November's&nbsp;<em>Talisman Alliances</em></a>, which feels pretty appropriate; where that expansion brought players together, this one creates a rift between them (although hopefully not in the real world).</p>

It'll set you back $34.99, and pre-orders open on July 31st.</p>

<h2><em>Betrayal at House on the Hill&nbsp;</em>is also getting a new expansion</h2>

<p>It's not just&nbsp;<em>Talisman&nbsp;</em>getting in on the new expansion fun, either. Avalon Hill's popular&nbsp;<em>Betrayal at House on the Hill</em>, arguably an inspiration for this year's indie video game hit&nbsp;<em>Blue Prince</em>, is also getting a terrifying new set.</p>

<p><em>Betrayal at the Neibolt House: The Evil of Pennywise&nbsp;</em>is an expansion that, as the title suggests, brings everyone's favorite murderous clown to the world of&nbsp;<em>Betrayal</em>. Inside, you'll find three new minis, new rooms, and new items and characters based on the movie&nbsp;<em>It: Chapter Two</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/betrayal-at-house-on-the-hill-pennywise-expansion.jpg?itok=gMar-vXR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/betrayal-at-house-on-the-hill-pennywise-expansion.jpg?itok=9ONPtxWh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Betrayal at House on the Hill&nbsp;</em>is getting an&nbsp;<em>It</em>-themed expansion soon.</figcaption></figure><p>This one's arriving sooner than the&nbsp;<em>Talisman&nbsp;</em>set; you can expect&nbsp;<em>Betrayal at the Neibolt House&nbsp;</em>to arrive on August 1st. You'll pay $24.99 for it, and like the previous set, it'll be available via Amazon or via local game stores.</p>

<p><em>Neibolt House&nbsp;</em>won't be&nbsp;<em>Betrayal</em>'s first crossover, either. The game has matched wits with the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/betrayal-mystery-mansion-preview" rel="nofollow"><em>Scooby-Doo</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering</em>, and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/betrayal-at-baldurs-gate-tabletop-game-announced" rel="nofollow">Baldur's Gate</a>&nbsp;</em>in the past, so I'm sure Pennywise will feel right at home.</p>
