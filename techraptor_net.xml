            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The tabletop community has lost another prolific creative voice. Australian designer Steve Dee, who was a pillar of the community thanks to his outspoken social advocacy, has passed away.</p><h2>The Passing of Steve Dee</h2><p>According to a social media post <a href="https://www.facebook.com/622121166/posts/10162318714106167" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">on Facebook</a>, the body of Steve Dee was found by his romantic partner, Hilary Kincaid, on Friday January, 2nd.

  </picture><p>Steve Dee, also known as Steve Darlington, had a considerable impact on the tabletop industry. His work credits include officially licensed work like <em>Doctor Who Adventures in Time and Space</em>, <em>Vampire: The Requiem</em>, and multiple editions of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-fantasy-roleplay-4th-edition-review" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay</em></a> system.&nbsp;</p><p>Dee also published several board games under his own imprint, Tin Star Games. He has won several Ennies for a few of these published titles, including 2023's card-based heist game <em>The Score</em>, 2021's co-op improvised story game, <em>Partners</em>, the mystery TTRPG <em>Relics</em>, and the 2019 detective game <em>There's Been a Murder</em>.</p><p>But above all, Steve Dee was a vocal member of the community. In an in-depth post by <a href="https://www.rascal.news/steve-dee-game-designer-tin-star-games-obituary/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Rascal News</a>, many tabletop developers spoke up about Dee's passion for the medium and his active advocacy. Indie Game Developer Network's own James Kerr highlighted one of Dee's blogs on the network discussing the importance of worldbuilding. A blog so successful it became a book, titled <em>Worldbuilding for Game Designers</em>.</p><p>But Dee's biggest platform was on his personal blog, Just Do Something. This blog was an account of Dee educating himself on the atrocities happening in Gaza and discussing the use of genocide as a system of control. The ultimate goal of the blog was to encourage others to speak out and, well, do something, in light of horrible events.&nbsp;</p><p>The last post on the blog was a rough draft for a resource management and accrual game called NAKBA. A game where the goal is prevent genocide before it begins. Dee was designing the game as part of the <a href="https://www.games4palestine.it/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">games4palestine</a> initiative.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
