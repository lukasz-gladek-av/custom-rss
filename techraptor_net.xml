            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new "experienced collective of video game leaders" has snapped up the IP rights to Phoenix Labs'&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm</em>, and the group says it plans to ensure the game's "enchanting online experience continues to flourish".</p>

<p>Per a press release, the collective, which consists of four distinct gaming-related entities, has acquired the rights to both the existing&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm&nbsp;</em>game and "ongoing IP" concerns. This appears to mean the game's online services, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fae-farm-updates-ending-september" rel="nofollow">shut down earlier this month</a>, will once more be made available to players.</p>

<p>Not only that, but it seems the collective intends to do more with the&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm&nbsp;</em>IP; in the press release, the group says players can "look forward to exciting future announcements that will add even more magic to their Azoria adventure".</p>

There are four entities that are now responsible for&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm</em>, namely Gambit Digital, Game Cloud Network, Pure Wonder Interactive, and Phatty Acid.</p>

<p>Gambit Digital is a publisher based in Montreal, Canada, and it's part of the city's <a href="https://www.indieasylum.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Indie Asylum</a> collective. The publisher says its mission is to put its weight behind "bold games and the teams behind them".</p>

<p>Game Cloud Network <a href="https://www.gamecloudnet.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">says</a> it's "on a mission to create the world's largest brand engagement network", so it seems the company is more focused on the marketing and engagement side of things rather than out-and-out publishing.</p>

<p>As for the final two entities in the list, I wasn't able to find much on Pure Wonder Interactive, but Phatty Acid, assuming it's the same company, <a href="https://phattyacid.studio/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">appears to be</a> a "generative AI studio". That doesn't bode particularly well for&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm</em>'s future.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm</em>, it's a cozy life sim taking place in the "enchanted world of Azoria". You'll meet "charming characters", take part in activities like cooking and potion-making, and generally make a comfortable little life for yourself in this fantasy land.</p>

<p><em>Fae Farm&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2230110/Fae_Farm/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010439" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/fae-farm/9N0QS2277QHF" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/fae-farm-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.
