            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Monomi Park has announced that its cozy critter-rearing sim&nbsp;<em>Slime Rancher 2&nbsp;</em>is leaving Early Access this September, gaining new story content, new gameplay features, and more in the process.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Slime Rancher 2</em>&nbsp;will be exiting Early Access and hitting its 1.0 release on September 23rd. By the time it launches in full, it will have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/slime-rancher-2-release-date-announced" rel="nofollow">been in Early Access for three years</a>.</p>

<p>When the 1.0 version arrives, Monomi Park says you can expect plenty of extras for the cute farming sim, first among them being new Labyrinth sections that you can explore in order to "solve the [game's] ongoing mysteries and save the Far, Far Range".</p>

<p>All in all, Monomi Park is calling 1.0 "the best and most complete version of the&nbsp;<em>Slime Rancher 2&nbsp;</em>experience to date", so if you've been holding off until the game is done, September is the date you're going to want to aim for.</p>

<p>As well as announcing the 1.0 release, Monomi Park has also revealed physical versions of&nbsp;<em>Slime Rancher 2</em>&nbsp;for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, which will launch in January. They'll sport artwork from&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>artist Yusuke Naora, as well as a fold-out poster.</p>

<p>You can check out a trailer for the&nbsp;<em>Slime Rancher 2&nbsp;</em>release date, as well as a sneak preview of the artwork created by Naora for the physical releases of the game, right here.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Slime Rancher 2</em>, it is, as you've probably guessed, the sequel to the original&nbsp;<em>Slime Rancher</em>, which left its Early Access period <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/slime-rancher-leaving-early-access-this-august" rel="nofollow">all the way back in August 2017</a>.</p>

<p>Less than a week after its Early Access launch,&nbsp;<em>Slime Rancher 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/slime-rancher-2-sales-cross-300k-in-first-week-with-zero-crunch" rel="nofollow">managed to pick up over 300,000 sales</a>, and Monomi Park proudly says it did so with "zero crunch", so hey, there's another reason to grab the game if you haven't already.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Monster Hunter Wilds Endgame Content Bumped Up to Mid-August]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-endgame-august</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has announced that it's moving some of&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' upcoming endgame content forward, so it'll no longer be appearing in the forthcoming Title Update 3, but much sooner instead.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2246340/view/534356720697222823" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post on Steam</a>, the studio says that while the endgame content in question was originally planned for Title Update 3 (which is scheduled for late September), it'll now be arriving on August 13th as part of a smaller update instead.</p>

<p>You can now look forward to a new quest difficulty level and a new rewards system arriving in just a few weeks. The reward system will grant you Talismans with "random skill combinations" for completing quests at the new tier, according to Capcom.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-endgame-content-august-flying.jpg?itok=kkTyDZw- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-endgame-content-august-flying.jpg?itok=kn6YQvAu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>More endgame content is coming to&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, and sooner than you might think.</figcaption></figure><p>This does mean that update 1.021, which was originally going to be a more straightforward balance update, will arrive slightly later than planned. However, it'll now contain adjustments for "more weapons than originally planned", so it's not all bad news.</p>

<p>Presumably, since the new quest level and Talisman system are moving out of Title Update 3, Capcom will have something substantial planned to replace those features in order to bring the update in line with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-1-release-date" rel="nofollow">scope</a> of previous <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">Title Updates</a>.</p>

<p>The studio is remaining tight-lipped about that for now, however, so it's probably going to be a while before we hear more about exactly what's coming as part of&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' third major update.</p>

<p>In the meantime, though, Capcom has announced that the Flamefete event, which is currently underway, will be extended by another week in order to give you more time to unlock its various rewards and try out its quests. It'll now be coming to a close on August 13th.</p>




<p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>is the latest game in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>series. Although it's been met with a rather <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">varied response</a> from its player base, that hasn't stopped the game from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-10m" rel="nofollow">breaking sales records</a> for Capcom, both for its franchise and for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-steam-player-record" rel="nofollow">the company as a whole</a>.</p>
