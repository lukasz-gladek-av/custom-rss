            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and Polyphony Digital have released a brand new car database for <i>Gran Turismo 7</i>, which contains information on the 500-plus vehicles currently available to drive in the racing sim.</p>

<p>The database, which you can access <a href="https://www.gran-turismo.com/gb/gt7/carlist" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>, contains 539 cars for you to peruse, and it looks like new ones will be added when the game gets further updates as well.</p>

<p>A number of different organization methods are available for the new&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>car list; you can view cars sorted by manufacturer, by the country or region from which they originate, and even by individual specs like drivetrain, power, and weight.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gran-turismo-7-car-database-racing.jpg?itok=j6ehMQIA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gran-turismo-7-car-database-racing.jpg?itok=lmSY8HL1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I don't know what this car is, but I bet the new&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>database does.</figcaption></figure><p>Clicking on each car will give you a detailed breakdown of that car's specs, including stats like its displacement, max power (I got it from a hairdryer), and max torque, among other things.</p>

<p>You'll also be able to see a gallery of images of the car from different angles, so this new&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>car database really is a gearhead's dream. If you've ever wanted to just chill out and read info about cars, this is the place to do it.</p>

<p>You can view the car list either as a series of images of each car or as a more prosaic text list, so if you're just looking for cars of a particular weight class or max BHP value, then you can simply switch to the text view and find what you're looking for.</p>

<p>Released in 2022,&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>has received a number of updates since launching, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-update-161" rel="nofollow">latest of which</a> gives you the chance to drive an incredibly rare car (in the game, of course, not in real life, as fun as that would be).</p>

<p><em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/gran-turismo-7/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">both PS5 and PS4</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sega Sales and Profit Fall Due to "Weaker" Back Catalog]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega has released its financial summary for the first quarter of the 2025-26 fiscal year, and things aren't looking too good for the&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Persona&nbsp;</em>studio, although the outlook for the rest of the year is a little rosier.</p>

<p>As revealed in Sega's latest financial <a href="https://www.segasammy.co.jp/cms/wp-content/uploads/pdf/en/ir/20250808_q1_presentation_e.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">presentation</a>, sales and income for the company's core gaming segment have fallen when compared to the same period last year. Sega puts this down to "repeat sales", i.e. sales of games from its back catalog, performing "weaker compared to expectations".</p>

<p>Indeed, across the board, Sega's sales are down by around 23%, with income also falling significantly. Despite this, Sega says its first quarter "exceeded expectation", with the company's pachislot and pachinko machine segment getting "off to a good start" this year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sega-financials-q1-2025-raidou-remastered.jpg?itok=y_Rk1x5n 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sega-financials-q1-2025-raidou-remastered.jpg?itok=_fKB5D03 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sega's first-quarter releases haven't made up for a shortfall in back catalog sales.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Sega, its releases for this quarter, which include titles like June's&nbsp;<em>Raidou Remastered</em>&nbsp;and a remaster of&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Space Marine</em>, performed "as expected", as did the company's existing free-to-play offerings.</p>

<p>Additionally,&nbsp;<em>Persona 5: The Phantom X</em>, a free-to-play game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-5-phantom-x-release-date-leaked" rel="nofollow">released in the West</a>&nbsp;in June, has gotten off to a steady start, according to Sega. Unfortunately, these games weren't enough to make up for a shortfall in back catalog sales for Sega.</p>

<p>The company's forecast for the rest of the year is looking a little more optimistic, however. Sega reckons it'll do better this year than last when it comes to sales, driven largely by the release of new&nbsp;<em>Sonic Racing&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Football Manager&nbsp;</em>titles later in 2025.</p>

<p>Indeed, Sega's first quarter may have been a little more lucrative had the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-25-canceled" rel="nofollow">not canceled&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-25-canceled" rel="nofollow">Football Manager 25</a>&nbsp;</em>in order to focus on its successor earlier this year, but from a quality perspective, that was likely the right decision to take.</p>
