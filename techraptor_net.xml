Hasbro Entertainment has partnered with Legendary Pictures to produce an official feature film of the acclaimed card game. In addition, they will help produce television shows based on the property.</p>

<h2>The <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Movie Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, Hasbro and Legendary will be focusing on producing a live-action <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> film. Given that <em>Magic</em> is Hasbro's $1 billion brand with over thirty years of rich characters, settings, and stories to adapt, there is plenty of source material ripe for adaptation.</p>

<p>Legendary Pictures has a solid track record producing film and television for beloved brands. They're the studio behind the "Monsterverse" which adapted Toho's <em>Godzilla</em> monsters into blockbuster feature films alongside the Apple TV series, <em>Monarch: Legacy of Monsters</em>. A second success is producing the two live-action <em>Dune</em> movies and the spin-off show <em>Dune: Prophecy</em> for the Max streaming service.</p>

<p>This approach is similar to another brand that Hasbro tried to expand: <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>. After producing the critically well-received but commercially underwhelming <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves</em>, they had plans for spin-off shows, one of which was being produced by Joe Manganiello.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><br>
&nbsp;Mary Parent, Legendary’s Chairman of Worldwide Production, said, “We pride ourselves on being thoughtful caretakers of singular, beloved IP, and no property better fits that description than Magic: The Gathering. Alongside the fantastic Hasbro team, we look forward to creating a multimedia universe that thrills longstanding fans and creates a broad wave of new ones.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hasbro and Legendary attempting to make a<em> Magic: The Gathering</em> movie may be the next chapter in companies trying to adapt the brand. It is a dense, imaginative world full of interdimensional wizards, evil dragons, demonic crime syndicates, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/aetherdrift-commander-living-energy-review-and-upgrades" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">high-octane racing competitions</a>. Netflix announced an animated adaptation in 2019, but that project was quietly <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-netflix-series-is-officially-canceled" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">canceled</a>.</p>
