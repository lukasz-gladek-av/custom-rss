            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile-delisted<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Activision has delisted&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile&nbsp;</em>from both major mobile storefronts, so if you want to play a round of the battle royale FPS, you'd better hope you've already got it installed.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/WarzoneMobile/status/1923470814357385447" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message on Friday</a>, Activision said that while it's proud of its "accomplishment" in creating an "authentic" mobile version of&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em>, the mobile edition of the game hasn't "met [Activision's] expectations" in the same way as the PC and console versions have.</p>

<p>As such, new gameplay updates and seasonal events will no longer be added to&nbsp;<em>Warzone Mobile</em>, and you won't be able to buy in-game points or the BlackCell battle pass using real currency either.</p>

However, if you didn't have&nbsp;<em>Warzone Mobile&nbsp;</em>installed on your device before today, then it's gone for good.</p>

<p>It doesn't sound like you can redownload it if you previously gave it a shot, either; you've got to have it on your device already, or your access to the game has been permanently revoked.</p>

<p>If you're lucky enough to have&nbsp;<em>Warzone Mobile&nbsp;</em>on your phone or tablet, then you can continue to play it, and cross-progression will still be available, as will servers complete with matchmaking for online play.</p>

<p>You can also continue to spend whatever COD Points you have left over on "available content in the Store"; you just can't purchase any more with your real currency.</p>




<p>For a limited time, if you sign up to&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Mobile&nbsp;</em>using your Activision account (and you're a&nbsp;<em>Warzone Mobile&nbsp;</em>player), you can nab yourself some&nbsp;<em>Mobile&nbsp;</em>COD Points by way of an incentive.</p>

<p>More info about this, as well as all other things pertaining to&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile</em>'s shutdown, can be found via Activision's official <a href="https://support.activision.com/warzone-mobile/articles/warzone-mobile-service-changes" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">FAQ</a> on the matter.&nbsp;If you're a&nbsp;<em>Warzone&nbsp;</em>player on PC or console, don't fret; that version of the game isn't going anywhere.</p>
