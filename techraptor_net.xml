            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/hyper-light-breaker-preview-journey-worth-taking<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Heart Machine gained worldwide fame for its stellar debut title, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hyper-light-drifter" rel="nofollow"><em>Hyper Light Drifter</em></a>. Its mysterious world filled with vibrant ruins and dangerous foes is making the transition to 3D in the upcoming follow-up, <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/heart-machine" rel="nofollow"><em>Hyper Light Breaker</em></a>.</p>

<p>I had a chance to play <em>Hyper Light Breaker</em> at Summer Game Fest Play Days <a rel="nofollow">earlier this year</a>, and I called it your "next roguelite addiction." I still agree with that sentiment, perhaps even more so now that I had a chance to try out a co-op session with two other players.</p>



<h2>Lootin', Shootin', and Slashin' in Hyper Light Breaker</h2>

<p>So I don't end up retreading old territory, be sure to check out <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/hyper-light-breaker-preview-your-next-roguelite-addiction" rel="nofollow">my preview</a> from June. I'll give the basics of <em>Hyper Lift Breaker</em>'s gameplay before I dive into some new thoughts from my cooperative session. It is, of course, <a href="https://techraptor.net/genre/roguelite" rel="nofollow">a roguelite</a>, so all the mechanics we expect from such a genre (metaprogression, random generation, tough difficulty, etc..) are there.</p>

<p>With a range of melee weaponry from swift striking claws to a one-handed sword, and guns from an electric shotgun to a large beam cannon, playstyles will differ vastly based on your kit. There's a lot of different weapons and I didn't have nearly enough time to try them out, but there's sure to be a great deal of variety for players.</p>

<p>The fact that <em>Hyper Light Breaker</em> drops in Early Access means there's going to be even more weapons, upgrades, and characters to play, so we're only seeing the beginning of things. Right now, players will be satisfied with the loot they might come across as they explore the large, randomly generated environments.</p>



<h2>Scouring the Ruins <em>of Hyper Light Breaker</em></h2>

<p>Speaking of environments, this is where <em>Hyper Light Breaker</em> shines. The world I explored during this demo was different than the one I played earlier this year. With two experienced co-op buddies tagging along, I got a better idea of where to look for loot.</p>

<p>There's a large amount of verticality in <em>Hyper Light Breaker</em>. In this vast, open map, ruins are scattered all over the environment and tower above the player. These ruins are massive, and a series of jump pads help players get to the top. My co-op partners explored every inch of these towers and we found loot tucked away, meaning a keen eye goes a long way.</p>



<p>It's quite marvelous to see just how high you can climb these ruins. At one point, we reached the top of a tower. There wasn't any loot, but I thought the scenery from being all the way at the top of the world was worth it. You could see various stunning landmarks, like a giant sword jutting out of the earth in the distance.</p>

<p>With a handy map, we chose our next destination and jumped off the tower. Like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-wild-review-switching-things-up" rel="nofollow"><em>Breath of the Wild</em></a>, you can use a glider to slow your descent and prevent fall damage. Indeed, it feels like <em>Hyper Light Breaker</em> takes great inspiration from <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, with its open, almost directionless exploration and stamina meters.</p>



<h2><em>Hyper Light Breaker</em> Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>And again, fun is multiplied when friends are along for the ride. I can just imagine myself and some buddies checking out our map, charting where we want to go next. Taking on a bunch of foes is also a bit less daunting when you have two other players by your side.</p>

<p>We collected some keys scattered around this large map and unlocked a boss fight. Teleporting into an arena, this fearsome boss spawned a bunch of minions and a frantic fight to the death ensued. Whether you're in <em>Hyper Light Breaker</em> for its fast-paced, snappy combat or its grand exploration, you're bound to have fun.</p>

<p><em>Hyper Light Breaker</em> received a delay earlier this year, which was sad to see. Nonetheless, developers don't delay a game lightly and I'm sure <em>Hyper Light Breaker</em> is much better for it. Everything felt more polished from my first demo. Heart Machine is cooking up something special, and you won't have to wait long to play: <em>Hyper Light Breaker </em>launches in Early Access on January 14, 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-vp-reveals-dungeons-dragons-2024-sales-and-digital-usage<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last week we got to hear from Jeremy Crawford and Wes Schneider, Co-Leads for the 2024 <em>Monster Manual</em>, about what we can expect when the third part of the 2024 Core Rulebooks release in a little over a month. Before that though Jess Lanzillo, VP of Franchise and Product for <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, walked us through 2024 as a year for <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> including some interesting comparisons to the 2014 5th Edition release.</p>

<h2><em>D&amp;D</em> and D&amp;DBeyond in 2024</h2>

<p>Lanzillo began by discussing the way Wizards of the Coast have been tracking the sales for the 2024 Core Rulebooks released so far; the <em>Player's Handbook</em> in September 2024 and the <em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em> in November 2024. In the past four months these two books have already sold as many copies as it took the 2014 edition three years to meet including all language versions.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-2024-core-rulebooks.jpg?itok=OwOpkzsT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-2024-core-rulebooks.jpg?itok=VyrHyN9d 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This is an impressive amount of growth, but also not an incredibly surprising number considering the monumental boom that Dungeons &amp; Dragons has had in popularity over the past 10 years including the popularity of Actual Plays like <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a9a9913f-42e9-4189-bbde-08061c01a7e8" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/matthew-mercer-interview" rel="nofollow">Critical Role</a>, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="55a80c6c-ea7c-4151-9523-d332db6f6cd5" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/how-brennan-lee-mulligan-created-never-stop-blowing-up-love-letter-to-80s" rel="nofollow">Dimension 20</a>, </em>and<em> <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="19bf4cd8-4ab1-421c-9264-de00ad57fcc0" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/discussing-start-of-acquisitions-incorporated-first-actual-play-with-jerry" rel="nofollow">Acquisitions Incorporated</a>,</em> the increase in play seen over the pandemic and past that, and even the releases of a movie and popular video games like Baldurs Gate III.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can check out our reviews for the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ed2ad5c2-7b7b-4a5a-84ff-eb15f1121885" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-player-handbook-review-mixed-messaging-around-strong" rel="nofollow"><em>Player's Handboo</em></a>k and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="56eebec3-a321-4403-b71c-54e4edf91d0c" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-dungeon-masters-guide-review-true-dms-best-friend" rel="nofollow"><em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em></a>, and be sure to look out for a review of the Monster Manual before too long.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lanzillo expressed that now that the final Core Book is almost released they're looking forward to 'finally beginning'.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"We're going to have this really nice base of what's going to be setting up <em>D&amp;D</em> for the future. [...] It's going to be a springboard for all of the exciting stuff that we are going to be doing in the future."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After discussing that Wizards of the Coast was happy with the engagement in the new Core Rulebooks Lanzillo discussed some other milestones that they were seeing across other D&amp;D related platforms.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ddbeyond-vtt.jpg?itok=_cTYeCIf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ddbeyond-vtt.jpg?itok=85vBlW6B 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>For D&amp;DBeyond she was able to reveal that over 3.6 million characters have been made on D&amp;DBeyond with the 2024 ruleset, there are over 19 million registered users on D&amp;DBeyond, and that 1.3 million maps have been used in the D&amp;DBeyond VTT (This is not including the new 3D VTT that we know is on the way).</p>

<p>Lanzillo bookmarked all of the statements about <em>D&amp;D</em> and D&amp;DBeyond by mentioning that all of these milestones also don't include all of those who are playing the game completely physically.</p>

<h2>The Greater <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Brand</h2>

<p>Talking about <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> outside of the Tabletop experience Lanzillo brought up the continued success of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2158b818-8ae7-45f2-997e-44a5977e48f4" href="https://techraptor.net/games/baldurs-gate-3" rel="nofollow"><em>Baldurs Gate III</em></a> which continues to be in the top 10 most played games on Steam and regularly breaks into 100K+ concurrent players. There was also mention of continued support from Larian into 2025 with new sub-class options.</p>

<p>Finally to wrap up the discussion on the D&amp;D Brand Lanzillo was able to reveal that in 2024 around 85 million fans have engaged in D&amp;D across movies, video games, merchandise purchases, or just by playing the game.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Oblivion Remake Reportedly Confirmed With Plenty of Gameplay Improvements]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/oblivion-remake-reportedly-confirmed</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/oblivion-remake-reportedly-confirmed-with-plenty-of-gameplay-improvements.1080912/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/oblivion-remake-reportedly-confirmed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The long-rumored&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remake is apparently very real indeed, and it'll pack plenty of visual and gameplay improvements, including changes to combat, the HUD, various gameplay systems, and more.</p>

<p>According to an <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/the-elder-scrolls-oblivion-remake-real-gameplay-improvement-details" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">MP1st report</a> (which cites "a mistake made" by an ex-employee of support studio Virtuos), the remake of&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion&nbsp;</em>will be built in Unreal Engine 5 and that it'll be a full remake rather than a simple remaster.</p>

<p>Supposedly, the website includes information regarding changes to certain gameplay systems. Blocking, for instance, will be more heavily inspired by Soulslike games thanks to the "boring" nature of shield-based combat in the original&nbsp;<em>Oblivion</em>, and sneaking will also be improved.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/oblivion-remake-report-shield.jpg?itok=Xmh9t8-d 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/oblivion-remake-report-shield.jpg?itok=y9W5Mlgd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remake will apparently make a number of changes to the original game's systems.</figcaption></figure><p>Other changes include a reworked stamina system that MP1st says will be less "frustrating" for players, as well as a new HUD that's "easier to understand and more aesthetically appealing to young players" (again, that's MP1st's wording, not the Virtuos employee's).</p>

<p>If you're wondering whether the unannounced project that's set to be revealed during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-developer-direct-january-2025-announced" rel="nofollow">next week's Xbox Developer Direct event</a> is the&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remake, MP1st says that's not the case, so don't expect a Bethesda announcement during that showcase.</p>

<p>However, as the MP1st report points out, rumors had already begun to swirl about an&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remake potentially launching in June courtesy of insider <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/elder-scrolls-oblivion-remake-release-date-june-2025-rumour/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">NateTheHate</a>, so if those rumors are correct, Microsoft likely won't want to wait too long to announce the project.</p>

<p>As ever, since there's no first-party source for this information, you should take it with a pinch of salt, but hopefully, we'll hear more about the&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remake in the coming weeks.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/oblivion-remake-report-cave.jpg?itok=WVZTx-lm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/oblivion-remake-report-cave.jpg?itok=o24ZABRy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Will the&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remake be announced soon? Let's hope so.</figcaption></figure><p>If you somehow haven't heard of&nbsp;<em>Oblivion</em>, it's the fourth mainline entry in the&nbsp;<em>Elder Scrolls&nbsp;</em>series. Released in 2006, it's the precursor to the phenomenally popular&nbsp;<em>Skyrim</em>&nbsp;and the followup to the cult hit&nbsp;<em>Morrowind</em>.</p>

<p>A sixth&nbsp;<em>Elder Scrolls&nbsp;</em>game is in development at Bethesda right now, although it's been a very long time indeed since the project's official announcement. It is, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elder-scrolls-vi-after-2026-no-ps5" rel="nofollow">according to an internal Microsoft document</a>, set for release in "2026 or later".</p>

<p>You can pick up&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/22330/The_Elder_Scrolls_IV_Oblivion_Game_of_the_Year_Edition/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, although if these reports are correct, then you may want to hold off a little while as we wait for more info about the remake.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/ranking-units-from-new-warhammer-40k-death-korps-army-box</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ranking-units-from-the-new-warhammer-40k-death-korps-army-box.1080876/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/ranking-units-from-new-warhammer-40k-death-korps-army-box<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Games Workshop sent us along a brand new box of their <em>Warhammer 40K</em>&nbsp;Death Korps of Krieg Army Box, and I set to work reading through the rules (the box contains data cards and a nice glossy version of the Astra Militarum Codex) and checking out the models. Now that I've got a good handle on everything, let's run through a quick ranking of the models in the Army Box.</p>

<h2>#4 - Death Riders</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-death-korps-death-riders.jpeg?itok=nk37L9oj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-death-korps-death-riders.jpeg?itok=vSKukE9W 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Death Riders gallop in at the top of our list! Image: Games Workshop</figcaption></figure><p>Okay, okay... here's the big secret with this list: all of the models included in this Army Box are pretty damn good. But I set out to challenge myself to rank them from "worst" to "best." So I'm shocking even myself by saying that the Death Riders - while looking extremely cool on their enhanced Krieg Steeds - don't quite live up to the excitement of the rest of the models in the box.</p>

<p>With a 10" move (doesn't that feel a little slow for cavalry? The Attilan Rough Riders have a 12" move) and bearing a lascarbine and a frag lance, they're fine at a distance, but nothing extraordinary. They also have a power sabre and their steeds' claws for when you're done charging. They also have a special ability "Screening Line," allowing them to make a Normal 6" move whenever an enemy gets within 9" of them.</p>

<p>None of this is bad, in fact they can be quite a handful on the table... but there's just not much too them!</p>

<h2>#3 - Lord Marshal Dreir</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-death-korps-lord-marshal-drier.jpeg?itok=ru9Egrl- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-death-korps-lord-marshal-drier.jpeg?itok=Rm6Jm5Vv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Lord Marshal leads from horseback, hard to get him into a tank! Image: Games Workshop</figcaption></figure><p>Hmm... maybe I'm just a horse hater? Coming in at number three is Lord Marshal Dreir, an epic hero and officer for Krieg who can be attached to the aforementioned Death Riders. He's also got a 10" move, and has 6 wounds. Those 6 wounds aren't as bad as they sound, as he has "Feel No Pain 6+" and the "Tough To Kill" special ability which basically allows you to re-set him up if he's destroyed by rolling a 2 or better once per game.</p>

<p>Not too shabby! Add to that his "Leading the Charge" special ability, which gives his unit's melee weapons the "Devastating Wounds" ability (crits can't be invuln saved against). Speaking of weapons, he is an infantry chopper with his Sabre of Sacrifice, which has Anti-Infantry 4+ (pairing nicely with the Devastating Wounds from a charge).</p>

<p>But that's... pretty much it for him. Yes, he has the ability to give up to 3 Orders to his units, but other than that he's just armed with a laspistol. For a character larger than life like Dreir, it would have been nice to see him kitted out a bit more.</p>

<h2>#2 - Kreig Combat Engineers</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-death-korps-combat-engineers.jpeg?itok=KaCymLlK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-death-korps-combat-engineers.jpeg?itok=DJoPc0sg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Now THIS is what I think of when I think about Death Korps! Image: Games Workshop</figcaption></figure><p>Now we're talkin'! Of all the new <em>Warhammer 40K</em> Death Korps units included in this box, the Krieg Combat Engineers bring a lot of flexibility and some serious firepower. Each model comes with a standard Auto pistol and trench club, but you can upgrade individual models with flamers, combat shotguns, and more to suit your needs.</p>

<p>Also, these little dudes are meant to get moving on the battlefield with their "Scout 6"" ability, and their "Remote Mine" ability (which sports an incredible miniature to serve as a marker) can really do some damage. It reads: "Once per battle, at the start of your Shooting phase, you can select one enemy unit within 12" of the bearer and roll one D6: on a 3+, that enemy unit suffers D6 mortal wounds, or D3+3 mortal wounds instead if it is a Vehicle or Fortifications unit." OUCH!</p>

<p>I also love the look of them... maybe that's one of the reasons I'm instantly drawn to them. Krieg just look kinda off on horses. They should be crawling on their bellies through razorwire, not galloping on mutated horses!</p>

<h2>#1 - Artillery Team</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-death-korps-artillery-team.jpeg?itok=4o-Ew-eD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-death-korps-artillery-team.jpeg?itok=fHEX1Ng8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>When you truly need to bring the BOOM! Image: Games Workshop</figcaption></figure><p>Finally, let's get to the most gorgeous model in the set - and in my opinion the one that packs the most punch! While not tied specifically to Death Korps, the Artillery Team model is a slow-rolling source of death for all unlucky enough to fall within its sights. While it only has a 3" move, as you'd expect from an Artillery Team, the unit has a 7 toughness, a 3+ save, and 10 wounds!</p>

<p>But what really makes this so nasty is the choice of builds here. You can build the Artillery Team with a Heavy Mortar (pictured), a siege cannon, a heavy quad launcher, or a multiple rocket launcher. Siege and heavy quad are fun options, but for me it's all about either the heavy mortar (48" range, D6+3 attacks, 5+ BS, 8 strength, -1 AP, 2 Damage per hit) or the multiple rocket launcher (48" range, D6+3 attacks, 5+ BS, 2 strength, -1 AP, 1 Damage per hit).</p>

<p>If you're looking to punch through heavy armor, take the high-strength heavy mortar. But if you want to whittle down infantry, the multiple rocket launcher has Anti-Infantry 3+ (meaning you wound infantry on a wound roll of 3 or better!) and is a really strong option.&nbsp;</p>

<p>No matter the build, you add to that the "Remorseless Barage" ability which reads: "In your Shooting phase, after this model has shot, if one or more of those attacks made with an Indirect Fire weapon [Giaco's note: all the options have Indirect Fire] scored a hit against an enemy unit, that unit must take a Battle-shock test (if an Infantry unit is hit by one or more attacks made by a multiple rocket launcher, they must subtract 1 from their Battle-shock test when doing so)."</p>

<p>So those are my rankings! How wrong am I? Please sound off in the comments and show me the error of my ways!</p>
