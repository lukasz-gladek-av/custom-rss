            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suikoden-star-leap-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Konami has finally announced a new entry in the&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>series after thirteen years, but&nbsp;<em>Suikoden Star Leap&nbsp;</em>might not be what you want it to be.</p>

<p>During a&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suikoden-program-march-3rd-announced" rel="nofollow">news broadcast</a> held earlier today, Konami revealed that&nbsp;<em>Suikoden Star Leap&nbsp;</em>will be a free-to-play mobile RPG, although it will be set in the main&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>timeline, so it won't be an alternate-history spinoff or anything like that.</p>

<p>The game will take place a few years after&nbsp;the events of&nbsp;<em>Suikoden V</em>, which itself served as a prequel to the original game. That, of course, also means that we might well see some of both games' characters appearing in&nbsp;<em>Star Leap</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/suikoden-star-leap-mobile-rpg-viki.jpg?itok=bjiUk453 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/suikoden-star-leap-mobile-rpg-viki.jpg?itok=02oowrx5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Familiar faces may well be making an appearance in&nbsp;<em>Suikoden Star Leap</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>In fact, one of the screenshots shown on the <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/suikoden/star_leap/us/en-us/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official website</a> for&nbsp;<em>Suikoden Star Leap&nbsp;</em>appears to show Viki, a recurring character who serves as your method of fast travel in every mainline&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>game to date.</p>

<p>Of course, Viki is heavily implied to be able to travel through time as well as through space, so her presence here probably shouldn't come as a shock. It does, however, reinforce that this isn't just a spinoff, but a game that wants to take its place alongside the main series.</p>

<p>The trailer for the game also appears to show Gregminster, the capital city of the Toran Republic and one of the key locations in the original&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>(as well as the site of a brief but memorable stopover in the sequel).</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Suikoden Star Leap&nbsp;</em>right here. Honestly, I know it's a mobile RPG, but the art style and overall presentation has me cautiously excited for it.</p>




<p>According to Konami,&nbsp;<em>Suikoden Star Leap&nbsp;</em>will be a free-to-play game with "in-game purchases", although the studio doesn't say what form those purchases will take. I hate to say it, but&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>is ripe for some kind of character gacha mechanic, so that's probably what it'll be.</p>

<p>In addition to&nbsp;<em>Star Leap</em>, Konami is also gearing up to release remasters of the first two&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>games, which are due to land later this week, having been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suikoden-i-ii-hd-remaster-delayed" rel="nofollow">delayed</a> beyond their <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suikoden-and-suikoden-2-remaster-confirmed-for-2023" rel="nofollow">original release window</a> of 2023.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out those remasters when they launch on March 6th across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1932640/Suikoden_III_HD_Remaster_Gate_Rune_and_Dunan_Unification_Wars/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/JP0101-PPSA18305_00-SUIKODENREMASTER" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/suikoden-iii-hd-remaster-gate-rune-and-dunan-unification-wars-pre-order-bonus/9P9FM62WZXR2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/suikoden-i-and-ii-hd-remaster-gate-rune-and-dunan-unification-wars-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.&nbsp;<em>Suikoden Star Leap&nbsp;</em>is due to arrive at some point in the future on iOS and Android, although we don't know when yet.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-breaks-8m-sales-in-just-three-days.1124649/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-8m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has revealed the first sales figures for&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, and it probably won't surprise you to learn that the game has dwarfed the two most recent entries in the series in terms of launch weekend figures.</p>

<p>Per a Capcom <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e250304.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a>,&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>managed to reach eight million sales within the first three days of its launch. That, as Capcom points out, is the quickest a&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>game has reached that figure.</p>

<p>For comparison's sake,&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter World&nbsp;</em>hit <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/monster-hunter-world-shipped-5-million-units-in-a-weekend" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">five million</a> sales within the same period, while&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Rise</em>, which was initially exclusive to the Nintendo Switch, reached four million.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-8m-hunting-horn.jpg?itok=1dV9mxLT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-8m-hunting-horn.jpg?itok=cX-gdTxy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's fair to call&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>a runaway success.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, this isn't just the fastest a&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>game has reached that eight million milestone; it's also the fastest any Capcom game has managed to do so. It's fair to say Capcom has a bona fide success on its hands with&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>.</p>

<p>If you've been following&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' launch, its impressive sales performance probably won't surprise you. The game debuted to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-steam-player-record" rel="nofollow">well over a million players on Steam at launch</a>, breaking records for both the&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>franchise and Capcom as a whole.</p>

<p>The signs were there even before launch;&nbsp;<em>Wilds</em>' first open beta, which was held across PC and consoles back in November, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-steam-records" rel="nofollow">attracted more Steam players</a> than any game in the series had managed up to that point.</p>

<p>Indeed,&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>was expected to do so well before launch that&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>developer Pocketpair <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-pocketpair-monster-hunter-wilds-day-off" rel="nofollow">gave the majority of its staff the day off</a> on Friday, recognizing that many employees would just call in sick to play the game anyway.</p>




<p>The game's success hasn't come without a cost. Although critical reviews are broadly positive, players have provided much more mixed feedback for&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, especially <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on PC</a>, with many pointing to lackluster performance and poor multiplayer implementation.</p>

<p>If you'd like to check out&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>for yourself, you can play it right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/monster-hunter-wilds/9NMT6XFN0LVD" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. For what it's worth, our own Tyler liked the game a lot, and you can check out his review here.</p>
