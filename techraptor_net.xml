            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gears-of-war-e-day-people-can-fly<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Gears of War: Judgment&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Bulletstorm&nbsp;</em>developer People Can Fly has announced that it is returning to the series to work as a co-developer on the upcoming <i>Gears of War: E-Day</i>.</p>

<p>In an announcement <a href="https://peoplecanfly.com/partnership-announcement/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on its website, People Can Fly reveals that it'll be working on the game alongside The Coalition, the studio which has stewarded&nbsp;<em>Gears of War&nbsp;</em>since 2016's&nbsp;<em>Gears of War 4</em>.</p>

<p>People Can Fly says&nbsp;<em>Gears of War&nbsp;</em>is "deeply embedded in our studio's history" and that the studio has "always been passionate about the series and its legacy". It doesn't reveal exactly what it'll be providing with regards to <i>E-Day</i>'s development.</p>

<p>Development director Guillaume Barry adds that People Can Fly is made up of "dedicated&nbsp;<em>Gears of War&nbsp;</em>fans", and that the studio is "pouring everything we have into creating an experience that will exceed expectations".</p>

<p>For his part, The Coalition studio head Mike Crump says&nbsp;<em>E-Day&nbsp;</em>represents "a return to what makes&nbsp;<em>Gears of War&nbsp;</em>games special and authentic", and says his studio is "pleased" to partner with People Can Fly on the project.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Barry also says People Can Fly "can't share more just yet", so if you were hoping for more details than the scant teaser trailer provides, then you're sadly out of luck.</p>




<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Gears of War: E-Day&nbsp;</em>is, it's a prequel set fourteen years before the events of the original&nbsp;<em>Gears of War</em>.</p>

<p>Announced during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-xbox-showcase-2024-announcement" rel="nofollow">last year's Xbox summer showcase</a>, the game will once again star Marcus Fenix and Dom Santiago as they deal with the beginnings of the Locust invasion.</p>

<p>We don't know a lot about&nbsp;<em>E-Day&nbsp;</em>yet, although we do know it'll <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/gears-of-war/gears-of-war-e-day-director-says-the-new-shooter-will-absolutely-be-doing-more-linear-levels-instead-of-gear-5s-open-ended-maps/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">focus more</a> on the linear levels for which the series became known rather than the open-ended levels of&nbsp;<em>Gears 5</em>.</p>

<p><em>Gears of War: E-Day&nbsp;</em>is set to launch for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3010850/Gears_of_War_EDay/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/gears-of-war-eday" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, although we don't have a release date for it yet. Stay tuned for more.</p>
