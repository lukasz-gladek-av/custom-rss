            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft--report-new-gaming-entity-core-ip<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>studio Ubisoft is reportedly considering creating a new gaming-focused business entity that will include some of its core IP, including the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>series.</p>

<p>Per a Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-14/assassin-s-creed-creator-ubisoft-is-said-to-seek-gaming-backers" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a> (which is behind a paywall), Ubisoft has contacted some of its shareholders, including Tencent, to see if they have any interest in purchasing a minority stake in the new venture.</p>

<p>Bloomberg, which cites "people familiar with the situation", says that no final decision has been made as yet and that considerations are still ongoing. If this report is true, though, it's probably part of Ubisoft and its shareholders' ongoing <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-bosses-tencent-private-buyout-report" rel="nofollow">exploration of options</a> regarding what has been a pretty rough time for the studio recently.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-new-gaming-entity.jpg?itok=GVElqXqh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-new-gaming-entity.jpg?itok=in6gTTpI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ubisoft is reportedly considering creating a new entity for its core gaming IP.</figcaption></figure><p>Back in September, Ubisoft announced it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-february" rel="nofollow">delaying upcoming flagship RPG&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em></a>, and as part of the same report in which the delay was revealed, the company also acknowledged that open-world game&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>had underperformed.</p>

<p>Following that announcement, an activist Ubisoft shareholder <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activist-ubisoft-investor-open-letter-change" rel="nofollow">called for "strategic and structural change"</a> at the company, and Ubisoft's woes continued to mount with employee strikes, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-lawsuit-data-policy" rel="nofollow">data policy lawsuit</a>, and, uh, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-nft-game" rel="nofollow">weird NFT game launch</a>.</p>

<p>As part of its fiscal report for the first half of last year, Ubisoft revealed it was effectively <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-h1-2024-25-fiscal-results" rel="nofollow">hemorrhaging money</a>, and the studio would go on to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing" rel="nofollow">shut down FPS&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing" rel="nofollow">XDefiant</a>&nbsp;</em>and close down <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-layoffs-leamington-closure" rel="nofollow">three of its locations</a> in an effort to cut costs.</p>

<p>Whether or not the new venture would solve any of these problems remains to be seen, but it seems like an attempt to spin off the more successful elements of the business in order to drum up interest and value.</p>




<p>As for what effect the new entity would have on Ubisoft's strategy with regards to its games, that remains to be seen. After all, let's not forget Ubisoft hasn't officially confirmed this move, nor has it been finalized according to Bloomberg's sources. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/silent-hill-f-officially-revealed-for-pc-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s.1134675/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-f-officially-revealed-konami<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Konami and developer NeoBards Entertainment have officially revealed&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f</em>, the newest entry in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>series of psychological horror games.</p>

<p>The game was first <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-and-more-all-but-confirmed" rel="nofollow">revealed back in October 2022</a> as part of a&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>Transmission showcase, but at the time, Konami didn't show much more than a short teaser trailer hinting at some of the game's concepts and story elements.</p>

<p>Now, Konami has fully unveiled the game, although we still don't know exactly how it will play since the debut trailer mostly seems to consist of narrative setup and cinematic cutscenes rather than actual moment-to-moment gameplay.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/silent-hill-f-revealed-hinako.jpg?itok=dEf64WpE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/silent-hill-f-revealed-hinako.jpg?itok=5nv9pSg4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Silent Hill f&nbsp;</em>has officially been revealed by Konami.</figcaption></figure><p>The game will focus on Hinako Shimizu, a young girl who lives in the remote Japanese town of Ebisugaoka. Of course, this being a horror game, Ebisugaoka is "consumed by a sudden fog", turning Hinako's home into a "haunting nightmare". Sounds like&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>alright.</p>

<p>Konami says&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f&nbsp;</em>will have you "solving complex puzzles and confronting grotesque monsters" as you navigate the foggy streets of Ebisugaoka. It also looks like the town will transition between its regular appearance and a classic&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill</em>-style haunted otherworld, which seems to have a strong floral motif this time around.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f&nbsp;</em>right here. It's more of a mood piece than an informative trailer; while you won't find much gameplay, you can see what kind of direction Konami and NeoBards are heading in with the game.</p>




<p><em>Silent Hill f&nbsp;</em>will boast writing by visual novel scribe Ryukishi07, who's best known for the&nbsp;<em>When They Cry&nbsp;</em>series. Music will, of course, be handled by longtime series composer Akira Yamaoka.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>news, Konami revealed back in January that the Bloober Team-developed&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">surpassed two million sales</a>. The two studios are currently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloober-team-konami-new-game-ip" rel="nofollow">working together on another project</a>, although we don't yet know if it's a&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>game or not.</p>

<p><em>Silent Hill f&nbsp;</em>doesn't have a release date yet, but when it does launch, it'll be coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2947440/SILENT_HILL_f/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XIV Patch 7.2 Release Date Revealed]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-patch-72-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-xiv-patch-7-2-release-date-revealed.1134672/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-patch-72-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has announced the release date for&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>Patch 7.2, which will bring more raids, a new dungeon, and more later this month.</p>

<p>Per the recent Letter from the Producer showcase,&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>Patch 7.2 officially launches on March 25th (which, coincidentally, puts it one day before the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-5-5-release-date" rel="nofollow">release of&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.5</a>, so it's going to be a busy couple of days if you play both).</p>

<p>As <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-patch-7-2-march" rel="nofollow">previously revealed</a> by Square Enix,&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>Patch 7.2 will continue the post-<em>Dawntrail&nbsp;</em>narrative and pick up where <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-patch-71-release-date" rel="nofollow">Patch 7.1 left off</a>, and it will also bring new raid encounters, as well as the new Occult Crescent activity, which is set to continue the legacy of&nbsp;<em>Shadowbringers</em>' Bozja or&nbsp;<em>Stormblood</em>'s Eureka.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-xiv-patch-7.2-release-date-raids.jpg?itok=elf4Qwc6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-xiv-patch-7.2-release-date-raids.jpg?itok=BL-nOJpu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>'s Patch 7.2 launches on March 26th.</figcaption></figure><p>As usual, the new story will bring with it a new dungeon, the Underkeep, for you and your friends (or randoms!) to explore, and you can also expect four more Arcadion raid encounters to test your mettle, as well as a trial to face during the main story.</p>

<p>The real star of the show this time around, however, is the Occult Crescent, a new Field Exploration activity that you can take on alongside many other&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>players. It won't be arriving until Patch 7.25, though.</p>

<p>Patch 7.2 will also bring with it a new Unreal-difficulty Hells' Kier trial, in which you'll be able to take on a significantly more powerful Suzaku. This one's going to take all your skill (probably).</p>

<p>The full patch notes for&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>Patch 7.2 have not yet been released, but you can likely expect them closer to the update's launch, so you'll need to wait a little bit to see whether they've nerfed Dark Knight. Knowing my luck, probably.</p>




<p><em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>Patch 7.2 launches on March 26th. The game, and its latest expansion&nbsp;<em>Dawntrail</em>, are available to play right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/39210/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/final-fantasy-xiv-online/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/final-fantasy-xiv-online" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

<p>Your second new fighter in&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.5 is 4-star Electro Polearm wielder Iansan, who serves as a support character by buffing and healing her allies.</p>

<p>Varesa and Iansan will both debut in the first half of Version 5.5's cycle, with a rerun coming for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-introduces-new-five-star-anemo-character-xianyun" rel="nofollow">Xianyun</a> during that period as well. In the second half, reruns for Xilonen and Venti will be available.</p>
