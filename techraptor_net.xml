            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-kill-team-blood-and-zeal-expansion-brings-ferocity-and-faith-to-warhammer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Games Workshop has announced a new expansion for <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000-kill-team" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000 Kill Team</em></a>. The aptly named <em>Kill Team: Blood and Zeal</em>, will not just introduce new factions to the skirmish game, but the introduction of two new mission decks.</p>

<h2>The <em>Kill Team: Blood and Zeal</em> Announcement</h2>

<p>In an official <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/qtq917vz/kill-team-blood-and-zeal-how-the-latest-expansion-set-changes-the-game/" rel="nofollow">Warhammer-Community post</a>, Games Workshop goes into detail about the <em>Kill Team: Blood and Zeal</em> expansion. First, the expansion will introduce new units to the game: Khorne's bloodthirsty Goremongers and the militant Sanctifiers.</p>

Those cards are divided into two new mission categories: Blood and Zeal. Zeal mission cards represent protection and guidance, reducing wounds or preventing death. Alternatively, Blood cards are aggressive, providing bonus damage, extra movement, and even double Fight and Shoot actions.</p>

<p>Players can draw and play from either of these decks during the Strategy phase and whenever an opponent scores Victory Points. In addition, these cards can be used with any faction in the game. In addition, you can score additional Victory Points if you played the most Blood or Zeal cards during a match. This means no matter what you play, you have some extra options at your disposal.</p>

<p>These cards play into another new feature in <em>Kill Team: Blood and Zeal</em>. There is a shrine statue in the set; a focal point of supernatural power. While controlling the statue, your operatives can perform two new actions. Praise/Blaspheme lets you remove cards from your hand or discard pile and draw a new one. Hallow/Defile, allows you to draw a new card into your hand.</p>

<p>This means controlling the shrine statue can grant players a major advantage. It can lead to valiant standoffs or devastating slaughter depending on how the dice go.</p>

<p>These new mission decks will not stop with <em>Kill Team: Blood and Zeal</em>. The post continues stating each new Kill Team battle box will contain new mission packs. It mentions an upcoming box, Kill team: Brutal and Cunning, which will facilitate attacker/defender scenarios.</p>

<p><em>Kill Team: Blood and Zeal</em> will be available for pre-order this upcoming Saturday.</p>
