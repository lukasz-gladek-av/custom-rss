            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new <em>Evangelion </em>series is on the way, and <em>NieR </em>auteur Yoko Taro will be penning it, with that series' composer Keiichi Okabe also providing the music.</p><p>The news was <a href="https://www.evangelion.jp/news/260223-1/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">announced</a> via the official <em>Evangelion </em>website as part of the iconic anime series' 30th anniversary celebrations. We're using machine translation for the article announcing the <em>Evangelion </em>revival.</p><p>Yoko Taro will be scripting the series, with production being handled by CloverWorks and <em>Rebuild of Evangelion </em>outfit Studio Khara. Keiichi Okabe, who's written music not only for <em>NieR </em>but also for its predecessor series <em>Drakengard </em>(as well as <em>Hyrule Warriors </em>and more), will be on composition duties.</p><figure role="group">

</figure>
<p>Direction will be handled by <em>Rebuild of Evangelion</em>'s Kazuya Tsurumaki and <em>Chainsaw Man</em>'s Toko Yatabe, but beyond the staffers mentioned, we don't know much else about the new <em>Evangelion </em>series, including whether it'll be a reworked version of the original or an entirely new story.</p><p>What we do know, however, is that Yoko Taro has <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellar-blade-x-nier-automata-taro-yoko-hyung-tae-kim" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">spoken in the past</a> about how <em>Evangelion </em>influenced his work, and it's not hard to see how; like <em>Evangelion</em>, Taro's work combines high-octane action with deep philosophical themes (and, some might say, similarly nonsensical endings).</p><p>Whether or not production of the new <em>Evangelion </em>affects Taro and Okabe's work on <em>NieR </em>remains to be seen. It's worth noting that a new <em>NieR </em>game hasn't been released for around nine years; the last was 2017's <em>NieR: Automata</em>.</p><p>However, there may be cause to hope on that front. In a recent trailer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nier-automata-sales-10m-followup-tease-possibly" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c8a6dece-ec13-453e-8894-717f0a1a0350" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">announcing 10 million sales</a> for the game, a closing message simply read "<em>NieR: Automata </em>to be continued...", suggesting that more <em>NieR </em>(and perhaps even more <em>Automata</em>) could be on the way.</p>
<p>We'll likely have to wait a little while before we get more information about Yoko Taro's plans for <em>Evangelion</em>, and, indeed, his plans for <em>NieR</em> as well. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Narrative-driven survival game <em>Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown </em>has managed to reach a big sales milestone within its first four days on release, according to a new report.</p><p>As reported by German news publication <a href="https://www.gameswirtschaft.de/marketing-pr/star-trek-voyager-across-the-unknown-verkaufszahlen-jumpgate-230226/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Games Wirtschaft</a> (which was spotted by ResetEra user <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/star-trek-voyager-across-the-unknown-more-than-100-000-copies-sold-in-4-days.1443433/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nerun</a>), the game, which is published by Daedalic Entertainment, has hit 100,000 sales in under a week.</p><p>We're using machine translation for the article, but in it, Daedalic says <em>Across the Unknown</em> marks the "most successful console launch" in its history. In <a href="https://www.gameswirtschaft.de/marketing-pr/star-trek-voyager-across-the-unknown-daedalic-launch-190226/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">another Games Wirtschaft piece</a> (for which, again, we're using machine translation), Daedalic seems to suggest the game is the most successful launch in its history, period.</p><figure role="group">

<p>A quick look at <a href="https://steamdb.info/publisher/Daedalic+Entertainment/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SteamDB's stats for Daedalic</a> as a publisher suggests that <em>Across the Unknown</em> hasn't achieved its highest peak concurrent player count on PC yet, although there's plenty of time for it to do so.</p><p>It's certainly Daedalic's most successful PC launch within the last few years, at any rate; the only game to rival it within the last three years is <em>Barotrauma</em>, which achieved a peak player count of just under 20,000 upon its exit <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dive-into-europas-depths-in-barotrauma-now-available-in-steam-early-access" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="dc2e1274-bfa3-46d9-823e-918d872ca94f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">from Early Access</a> in March 2023.</p><p>The publisher arguably sorely needs a success like this; while <em>Barotrauma </em>proved a success in 2023, that same year's <em>The Lord of the Rings: Gollum </em>was so disastrous for Daedalic that it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lord-of-rings-gollum-studio-reportedly-abandons-game-development" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b8cc9b20-8e39-4bf6-a4db-fd132661ca91" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">closed down its development division</a> following the game's failure.</p><p>Since then, things haven't exactly been rosy for Daedalic. Let's hope this one continues to sell well and keeps everyone at the studio in a job.</p>
<p><em>Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown </em>is available now for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch 2. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things Daedalic Entertainment as and when we get them.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
