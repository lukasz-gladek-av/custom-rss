            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/helldivers-2-board-game-fully-funded-in-12-minutes-on-gamefound<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, the crowdfunding campaign for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/helldivers-2-board-game-coming-courtesy-of-steamforged-games" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Helldivers 2 Board Game</em></a> went live. This tabletop adaptation of Arrowhead Studios' satirical sci-fi shooter was an instant success on Gamefound, reaching its funding goal 12 minutes after going live.</p>

<h2>The <em>Helldivers 2 Board Game</em> Gamefound Campaign</h2>

<p>On its official <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/projects/steamforged-games/helldivers-2-board-game" rel="nofollow">campaign page</a>, the <em>Helldivers 2 Board Game</em> brings the fight for managed democracy to gaming tables. Much like the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/helldivers-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Helldivers 2</em></a> videogame, it is a co-op experience for 1-4 players. Players choose one of four classes, mission difficulty, and a planet on which to deploy.</p>

According to the campaign page, a single game takes 120-180 minutes to complete.</p>

<p>The base version of the <em>Helldivers 2 Board Game</em> includes many game pieces and elements that fans expect: damage dice, <em>Helldivers</em> miniatures, stratagem boards, and various status effect tokens. As for enemies, the base game only supports the insectoid Terminid enemies.</p>

<p>Thankfully, developer Steamforged Games included various expansions at different pledge levels and as add-ons. These include the Patriot Exosuit expansion, bringing mech power to the squad, and various boss enemies like the Bile Titan, Factory Strider, and Impaler. Finally, there is an Automatons expansion, bringing the robotic terrors of Malevelon Creek to the game.</p>

<p>There are three pledge levels for the <em>Helldivers 2 Board Game</em>. They are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Commander Pledge for&nbsp;£61.00:</strong> The base version of the <em>Helldivers 2 Board Game</em>.</li>
	<li><strong>Galactic Commander Pledge for&nbsp;£92.00:</strong> The base game, the Patriot Exosuit expansion, and two mystery expansions set to be announced at a later date.</li>
	<li><strong>Hell Commander Pledge for&nbsp;£246.00:</strong> The base game, Patriot Exosuit, Impaler, Bile Titan, Factory Strider, Automaton, and mystery expansions</li>
</ul><p>In addition, anyone who backs the crowdfunding campaign will receive a Gamefound exclusive <em>Helldivers</em> commemorative turn tracker coin at no additional cost.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, the <em>Helldivers 2 Board Game</em> campaign has raised&nbsp;£383,714, more than six times its initial funding goal of&nbsp;£60,000. The campaign concludes April 22.</p>
