            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dwarf-fortress-adventure-mode-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Bay 12 Games and publisher Kitfox Games have announced that the&nbsp;<em>Dwarf Fortress&nbsp;</em>Adventure Mode will be launching out of beta later this month.</p>

<p>In an update on Steam, Bay 12's Tarn Adams and Kitfox's Alexandra Orlando reveal that Adventure Mode will arrive on January 23rd, having been available as part of <i>Dwarf Fortress</i>' beta branch <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/975370/view/4186734162819864096" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">since April</a> last year.</p>

<p>Just in case you're not aware of Adventure Mode, it's effectively a roguelike-style RPG gameplay mode in which you can explore the worlds you've generated as part of&nbsp;<em>Dwarf Fortress</em>' main colony management gameplay, taking on quests and discovering all manner of exciting things.</p>

<p>Rather, there will be "many updates" for both Fortress Mode and Adventure Mode in future, and the two say there's "more to add" to the roguelike mode as well, so you'll be getting extra features in the months to come.</p>

<p>As well as the Adventure Mode release date announcement, a new&nbsp;<em>Dwarf Fortress&nbsp;</em>beta update has also arrived today. Beta 28 adds tons of new features including new graphics, changes to character creation, and tons of gameplay tweaks.</p>

<p>If you want to read the beta update's full patch notes, then you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/975370/view/530961267633946651" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">do so here via Steam</a>. It's well worth checking them out if you want to see some of the super-granular changes Kitfox and Bay 12 have made to the game's beta branch.</p>




<p>If you're somehow not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Dwarf Fortress</em>, it's a colony management sim in which you must oversee a colony of dwarves attempting to survive in a hostile procedurally-generated world.</p>

<p>The game is well-known for its emergent gameplay; the procedural generation and multiple interlocking systems of&nbsp;<em>Dwarf Fortress&nbsp;</em>often allow amusing things to happen, many of which will be unique to each player's playthrough.</p>

<p>The original&nbsp;<em>Dwarf Fortress&nbsp;</em>was released all the way back in 2006, but the version being updated today is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dwarf-fortress-steam-release-date-unleashes-chaos" rel="nofollow">the 2022 paid version</a>, which updates the game's presentation and makes various other quality-of-life improvements.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Dwarf Fortress&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/975370/Dwarf_Fortress/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/second-monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has announced that a second&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>open beta will be held next month, giving you another chance to check out the next major installment in the&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>franchise.</p>

<p>The first open beta <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta" rel="nofollow">took place in November</a>&nbsp;and was so popular that it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-steam-records" rel="nofollow">broke Steam player count records</a> for the series, despite essentially being a playable demo. No wonder Capcom wants to hold a second beta test.</p>

<p>According to Capcom, this second beta is for players who "were unable to participate the first time or simply wish to play again", so if you did miss the first open beta, now's your chance to check it out once more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-second-open-beta-burning-room.jpg?itok=v8VFE1IO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-second-open-beta-burning-room.jpg?itok=c45ccVbn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A second&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>open beta is coming in February.</figcaption></figure><p>As before, the beta will be held across PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, and it'll take place across two three-day periods. The first starts on February 7th and ends on the 10th, while the second runs between February 14th and 17th.</p>

<p>This second beta will contain all of the content featured in the first test, as well as the chance to take down the returning Gypceros monster, which made its last mainline appearance in&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Generations</em>.</p>

<p>You'll also be able to create your character, remake it "as many times as you like", and even design your Palico companion. Naturally, character creation data will also carry over into the full version of the game, and you can use the character you made in the first beta as well.</p>




<p>If you take part in the beta, you can also net yourself some unique rewards for the full game, including a bonus pendant and some extra items.</p>

<p>The second beta period will be held not long before the main game releases;&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>is due to launch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/monster-hunter-wilds/9NMT6XFN0LVD" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on February 28th.
