            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/humble-games-showcase-2025-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Indie publisher Humble Games has announced that it's hosting a new Humble Games Showcase next week, and it'll feature updates on some of the publisher's upcoming games, plus two brand new titles.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/03/humble-games-showcase-2025-set-for-march-12" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gematsu</a>, the 2025 Humble Games Showcase will air on March 12th, which is exactly one week today. It'll be available at 12pm Eastern, which works out as 9am Pacific and 5pm GMT.</p>

<p>The showcase will be hosted by content creator and streaming personality <a href="https://www.ashsaidhi.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">AshSaidHi</a>, and it's set to feature reveals for a number of games being published by the Humble Games label in the next few months.</p>

The developer, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bossa-studios-layoffs-restructuring" rel="nofollow">hit by layoffs earlier this month</a>, recently announced it would focus on launching&nbsp;<em>Lost Skies&nbsp;</em>before pivoting towards smaller projects that could be released sooner.</p>

<p>Developer Pocketwatch Games will also unveil new information about stealth game&nbsp;<em>Monaco 2</em>, and since both games are yet to get a concrete release date, I wouldn't be surprised if just such a thing were to be announced next week.</p>

<p>We'll also get some more information about the heavily&nbsp;<em>Chrono Trigger</em>-inspired&nbsp;<em>Threads of Time</em>, as well as a new look at musical 3D platformer&nbsp;<em>Billie Bust Up</em>. Updates on recently-released games&nbsp;<em>On Your Tail&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Wizard of Legend 2&nbsp;</em>are also expected.</p>

<p>Lastly, Humble Games says it will reveal two "never-before-seen world premieres", so we'll be getting a look at two brand new Humble Games titles as well. Of course, we'll have to wait for the show to find out what they are.</p>

At that time, it was believed that Humble Games was to shut down, but that demonstrably turned out not to be the case.</p>

<p>The Humble Games Showcase airs on March 12th at 9am Pacific/12am Eastern/5pm GMT. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[PS3 Software Update Released Almost Nine Years After Discontinuation]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps3-software-update-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ps3-software-update-released-almost-nine-years-after-discontinuation.1125843/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps3-software-update-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has released a system software update for the PS3 almost nine years after the seventh-generation console was discontinued in the US.</p>

<p>Of course, the update is a pretty <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/support/hardware/ps3/system-software/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">small</a> one; it doesn't add any major new features to the console, nor does it fix any obvious, glaring issues. Instead, much like the two updates before it, it simply "improves system performance", which usually involves smaller under-the-hood changes.</p>

<p>According to Sony, you're going to need 200MB of free space on your PS3 if you want to download this update. You can either update your system software through the console itself or via PC using a USB drive or other removable storage media.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ps3-update-2025-original.jpg?itok=5H4eFQdb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ps3-update-2025-original.jpg?itok=Pa7-dXr2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The PS3 has received a new system update almost nine years after its discontinuation.</figcaption></figure><p>Additionally, if you're looking to play Blu-ray discs on your PS3, you'll need to update, as Sony says you'll need a renewed encryption key to play the discs. You can get that key by - you guessed it - updating your console.</p>

<p>The PS3 was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-3-production-ending-soon" rel="nofollow">discontinued back in 2017</a>, which means it was supported by Sony for around eleven years. That's not a bad innings for a console, and it's roughly the same time period for which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-discontinues-production-of-xbox-360" rel="nofollow">Microsoft supported the Xbox 360</a>.</p>

<p>Sony released the console in late 2006, and while it went on to achieve the lowest hardware sales of its respective generation, it was up against the Xbox 360 and the Nintendo Wii, so that's hardly a surprise.</p>

<p>Iconic franchises like&nbsp;<em>Uncharted</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us</em>, and the&nbsp;<em>Souls&nbsp;</em>series got their start on the PS3, and many of its games have been remade or remastered for subsequent generations.</p>




<p>The PS3 was also the first console to feature a Blu-ray disc drive; Xbox instead opted for the doomed HD DVD format, although that decision would be reversed in time for the launch of the Xbox One in 2013.</p>

<p>In 2021, Sony <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-store-on-ps3-consoles-closes-this-july" rel="nofollow">announced it would shut down the PlayStation Store</a> across PS3 and its two handhelds, but widespread backlash saw the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-store-will-stay-online-for-ps3-and-vita" rel="nofollow">reverse that decision swiftly</a>, at least in the case of the PS3 and the PS Vita.</p>

<p>Sadly, this PS3 update almost certainly doesn't herald some kind of phoenix-like revival for the console, but hey - if you're still playing your PS3, at least you know it hasn't been totally forgotten. Stay tuned for more.</p>
