            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-financials-2024-payday-3<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Payday 3&nbsp;</em>developer Starbreeze Studios has released its yearly financial report for 2024, and things are looking pretty grim for a studio that was already arguably on the ropes at the end of the previous year.</p>

<p>In its latest <a href="https://corporate.starbreeze.com/en/press/press-releases/starbreeze-ab-publ-full-year-2024/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, Starbreeze says its net sales for 2024 fell by about 70% when compared to the previous year; it raked in just 185.9 million Swedish kronor this year compared to 633.5 million last year, with both&nbsp;<em>Payday&nbsp;</em>games dropping well into the double digits (having achieved triple-digit sales last year).</p>

<p>Pretty much all of Starbreeze's numbers are down when compared to 2023, but it looks like the Swedish developer is trying to keep a brave face, with acting CEO Mats Juhl describing the year as "intense but in many ways also successful".</p>

<p>The acting CEO, who's currently in the position following the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-studios-ceo-steps-down" rel="nofollow">departure of former CEO Tobias Sjögren&nbsp;in March last year</a>, also says Starbreeze has been focusing on "establishing a strong foundation for [its] third-party publishing" this year.</p>

<p>As a reminder, the studio published "Lovecraftian Stone Age" base-builder&nbsp;<em>The Tribe Must Survive&nbsp;</em>this year, as well as the FPS roguelite&nbsp;<em>Roboquest&nbsp;</em>towards the tail end of 2023. We don't currently know what else is on Starbreeze's publishing slate for the future.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-gold-point-scheme-ending-march<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced that its Gold Points reward scheme will be coming to an end in March, but you'll still be able to spend the points you've accrued after the closing date.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://my.nintendo.com/news/7db7f9327a48ec83" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official announcement</a> on its website, the Japanese gaming giant says you'll no longer earn Gold Points for Switch purchases after March 25th. However, since Gold Points expire twelve months after purchase, any you have left over will still be valid until a year after you acquired them.</p>

<p>Naturally, this means that not only will you not be able to earn Gold Points through buying games on Switch, but you also won't get them through Nintendo's website or through redeemed download codes anymore.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-gold-points-ending-cycle.jpg?itok=sj9DujkX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-gold-points-ending-cycle.jpg?itok=rKUvpCaw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nintendo's Gold Point scheme is coming to an end soon.</figcaption></figure><p>If you pre-order anything via the Nintendo eShop prior to March 24th, you'll still earn the Gold Points for that pre-order, even if the payment is processed after March 25th.</p>

<p>However, if you cancel that pre-order, then you won't get Gold Points anymore, even if you re-up your pre-order at some point later down the line. Bear that in mind if you're umming and ahhing about one of your pre-orders right now.</p>

<p>Nintendo confirms later in the announcement post that you'll still be able to spend your Gold Points for up to a year after you get them, even if you're spending them after the cutoff date. You just won't earn any more from that point onwards.</p>

<p>No reason is given in the post for Nintendo's decision to end the Gold Point scheme, but I'm assuming that it has something to do with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">impending arrival of the Switch 2</a>, which may bring a scheme that replaces Gold Points with it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-gold-points.jpg?itok=1ivxFvzf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-gold-points.jpg?itok=_xII6sKn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Nintendo Switch 2's arrival is imminent, which could have something to do with the discontinuation of Gold Points.</figcaption></figure><p>In case you're not aware of Gold Points, they're a reward scheme by which you earn points for certain Switch games or other software you buy. You can then use those points to get discounts on future store purchases.</p>

<p>If you're thinking of buying anything on Switch, it's probably best to do it before March 25th so you can get your hands on those sweet, sweet Gold Points. Stay tuned for more.</p>
