            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Some of the hardest gamers to get gifts for these days are the dedicated TCG players in your life. Do they like this set of cards or think it was a dud? Do they have everything they need from the newest release? These are the questions the wrack many a gift giver’s mind! That’s why I thought it would be useful to check out a whole suite of new product releases from&nbsp;Gamegenic, my fave TCG accessory maker, to see what’s new and worth your consideration.</p>

<h2>Epically Huge Game Boxes</h2>

<p>I first fell in love with Gamegenic with their smaller-sized deck boxes. Expertly crafted, they're perfect for storing a Commander Deck, your favorite rares, and more. But it wasn't until checking out this latest batch of new releases that I've finally seen the light on their larger (heck, downright&nbsp;<em>huge</em>) game boxes.</p>

<h3>Collectors' Lair 2000+</h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gamegenic-collectors-lair.jpeg?itok=ng3e9ULB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gamegenic-collectors-lair.jpeg?itok=kBoc7vWo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Just look at the size of this massive beast! Able to hold over 2000 cards (hence the 2000+ in the name), the Collectors' Lair is now my go-to for storing multiple decks safely and securely. The picture above shows it next to the Gamegenic Watchtower 100+ Convertible for scale. If you're not familiar with the Watchtower... it's not tiny!</p>

<p>My friend and I are foolish enough to have embarked on the 36 deck challenge, where we challenge ourselves to build 32 different&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering</em>&nbsp;Commander decks (one for each of the different possible color combos, plus mono-colored decks and colorless), and I desperately needed a storage solution.</p>

<p>I'm nowhere near completing the goal, but the Collectors' Lair is exactly what I need to store my growing collection of decks. Just check out the pic below to see how I put it to work!</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gamegenic-collectors-lair-box-top-opened.jpeg?itok=ZIVWGLAh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gamegenic-collectors-lair-box-top-opened.jpeg?itok=Ej7H7eVr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Whether storing full-on deckboxes in here, or just a loose assembly of cards, everything in this deck box is ready, safely stored, and good to go. But what if I want a (somewhat) more portable option?</p>

<h3>Dungeon Pro Convertible</h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gamegenic-dungeon-pro-convertible-.jpeg?itok=f_fjFeU5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gamegenic-dungeon-pro-convertible-.jpeg?itok=QAE5znrQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The Gamegenic Dungeon Pro Convertible has quickly become my new go-to for all my on-the-go gaming needs. Now, obviously, this isn't the kind of box I bring to a game night where we're only hoping to grind out a few games, but when I know I've got a full day of gaming ahead of me -- this is the box I load up and take with me.</p>

<p>Included with this box, and this is really my favorite part, is a very handy bag - which instantly turns my collection into a mobile backpack full of janky decks!</p>

<p>The "Convertible" aspect of this deck box comes from the inclusion of a removable acrylic divider, which I keep in here to make sure my deck boxes stay orderly. Truly one of my favorite new ways to cart like... I dunno, half my collection around!</p>

<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gamegenic-sidekick-pro-100-convertible-in-teal-pink.jpeg?itok=ZLuhf6cU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gamegenic-sidekick-pro-100-convertible-in-teal-pink.jpeg?itok=vk46sJw7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Now THIS is a "Giaco-coded" deck box - I love the lean here into these neon, bright, vibrant, and totally 1990s colors. For a retro geek like me, there's nothing better!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Moving away from the gargantuan releases, this deck box comfortably holds a sleeved up deck of 100 cards. As you can see from the photo above, there are a few fun bells and whistles here, too. First off, there's the acrylic slide for you to put your commander (if you're playing Commander), or another feature card in your deck/collection.</p>

<p>Along with that, and a feature in a lot of their deck boxes, is the little tray at the bottom designed to hold other little treasures. I keep my dice in these to make sure I'm never fumbling through my bag looking for a few d6's.</p>

<h2>Gamegenic Stranger Things Hellfire Club Official Accessories</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gamegenic-stranger-things-new-releases.jpeg?itok=-QMrj2pW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gamegenic-stranger-things-new-releases.jpeg?itok=kRtF8JZc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>While it's hard to see anything Hellfire Club branded and not shed a tear for our favorite shredder (if you know, you know), it's hard to deny just how rad these new Gamegenic&nbsp;<em>Stranger Things</em>&nbsp;officially licensed accessories look. In an exciting turn for Gamegenic, they're moving further into the Tabletop RPG space with these new releases.</p>

<p>Of all the products in this line -- which includes a playmat, metal dice (not pictured above), a dice tower, dice bag, sleeves, and more -- I think my favorite of the batch are the set of d6's. The 6 on these dice are represented by the Hellfire Club logo, and the dice themselves have a great feel, rounded edges, and I love the creepy swirl of red and blue.</p>

<h2>Gamegenic Official&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering&nbsp;</em>Accessories</h2>

<p>Finally, let's take a look at some recent official collabs with&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering</em>, including some of my favorite new releases.</p>

<h3>Spider-Man Shiny Playmats</h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gamegenic-prime-playmat.jpg?itok=nueaDbQb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gamegenic-prime-playmat.jpg?itok=Do1fxv5F 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>I think some of my favorite artwork from the recent&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering&nbsp;</em>set comes from this cycle of full-art basic lands, where Spider-Man's webbing traces out the mana symbol. Gamegenic made five of these - one for each color - and they've got a nice, high-quality design and a gorgeous, subtle shine to them.</p>

<h3>Spider-Man Soft Crate 80+</h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gamegenic-soft-crate-spider-man.jpg?itok=8KLFHOWQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gamegenic-soft-crate-spider-man.jpg?itok=RLSAxl3V 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The new Spider-Man set also gave us some incredible artwork of Spider-Man and Spider-Gwen swinging into action, which they've translated nicely into this new Soft Crate 80+ deckbox. The deckbox "officially" holds 80 double-sleeved cards, but if you don't double-sleeve your deck you can - in my opinion - absolutely fit a whole commander deck in here.</p>

<p>That just about wraps up our rundown of some of my favorite new releases from Gamegenic. Whether you're looking for a little gifting inspiration,&nbsp;<em>or</em>&nbsp;you're just searching for a new, great storage solution, I really don't think there's much better on the market than Gamegenic.</p>
