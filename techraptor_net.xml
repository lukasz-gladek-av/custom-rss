            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-major-baldurs-gate-3-update-patch-notes<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's the end of an era. Larian Studios has released the final major&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>update, and there's plenty in it to tide you over until the studio's next release, including crossplay, a photo mode, and more.</p>

<p>Patch 8 follows on from the last major numbered patch, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-patch-notes" rel="nofollow">September's Patch 7</a>. While it'll serve as the final major patch for the hugely popular CRPG, Larian does say it will continue to support&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>with "minor bug fixing".</p>

<p>Larian says that it has "told [its] stories the way [it] needed to tell them" with&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>, and that it's "time for the team to go back to our cave and hang the armor on the wall" in order to focus on the next Larian game.</p>

Cross-platform progression has also been added, so you can pick up where you left off on PC or console.</p>

<p>If you're looking to play with mods, then you and your fellow players must have the same version of the mods in question installed. Some mods aren't available across all platforms, so make sure you're using compatible mods.</p>

<p>A photo mode has also been added to&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>, allowing you to "position and pose your party, play around with camera settings, and whack a few stickers on there" in order to create your very own bespoke&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>screenshots.</p>

<p>In order to celebrate the release of Patch 8,&nbsp;Larian has created a new animated short in conjunction with Spud Gun Studios, and you can check that short out here. Just make sure to have a tissue handy to dry your tears.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/devolver-digital-revenue-2024-25<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Devolver Digital has released its financial information for the 2024-25 fiscal year, and the studio's revenue is up, largely driven by the success of back catalogue games like&nbsp;<em>Cult of the Lamb</em>.</p>

<p>According to Devolver's latest financial presentation, the studio's revenue is up 13% on last year, rising to $104.8m as compared to a total of $92m in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/human-fall-flat-2-delayed" rel="nofollow">the 2023-24 fiscal year</a>. Devolver says this is down to "strong back catalogue" and "success of lead titles".</p>

<p>The presentation also includes the latest revenue figures for a number of Devolver's titles, including&nbsp;<em>Cult of the Lamb</em>, which has now passed the $90m revenue mark.&nbsp;<em>Astroneer&nbsp;</em>is Devolver's next best-selling game at over $80m revenue, and the&nbsp;<em>Stronghold&nbsp;</em>series, which Devolver acquired in 2021, is sitting at over $50m.</p>

No cause of death was revealed, but I hope it comes as some small comfort to his loved ones to know that so many people are enjoying the game on which he worked.</p>

<p>Later in Devolver's presentation, the studio says the Switch is its most successful console, with over nine million units sold across all of its games.</p>

<p>Devolver calls the recently-revealed Switch 2, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">which launches in June</a>, an "opportunity", pointing to several games highlighted during the recent Switch 2 Direct show:&nbsp;<em>Human Fall Flat 2</em>,&nbsp;<em>Starseeker: Astroneer Expeditions</em>, and <i>Enter the Gungeon 2</i>.</p>

<p>As for what's coming up on Devolver's software slate (as well as the aforementioned, of course), upcoming games include&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tron-catalyst-mike-bithell-2025" rel="nofollow"><em>Tron: Catalyst</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-train-2-announced-demo-now" rel="nofollow"><em>Monster Train 2</em></a>, and Bennett Foddy's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/baby-steps-bennett-foddy" rel="nofollow"><em>Baby Steps</em></a>, among many others planned for the next twelve months or so.</p>
