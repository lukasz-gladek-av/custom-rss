            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced a brand new Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase for tomorrow, so while we won't be getting info on first-party Nintendo titles, we will get to learn what third-party publishers are cooking up for the gaming giant's ecosystem.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1950541896012493166" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on social media, the Partner Direct showcase for July 2025 will air tomorrow, July 31st, at 6am Pacific/9am Eastern. That's around 2pm BST and about 3pm CEST, so make sure to set your alarm accordingly.</p>

<p>According to Nintendo, you can expect "roughly 25 minutes" of info about upcoming Switch 2 and Switch games from the company's "publishing partners", although none of those partners are mentioned by name in Nintendo's post.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-star-wars.jpg?itok=au-Yq94W 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-star-wars.jpg?itok=I76n2xBt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>could get another, erm, outing during tomorrow's Nintendo Direct.</figcaption></figure><p>We already know that games like&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>are <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-release-date-dlc-2" rel="nofollow">set to arrive on the Switch 2 in the near future</a>, so Ubisoft could choose to show off some more gameplay footage of its open-world adventure running on Nintendo's new hardware.</p>

<p>It could also be time for some third-party publishers to reveal ports of some of their most popular games for the Switch 2; Capcom could choose to bring more&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>games to the platform, for instance, or EA could reveal that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-6-revealed-release-date-october-maybe" rel="nofollow">the recently-revealed&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-6-revealed-release-date-october-maybe" rel="nofollow">Battlefield 6</a>&nbsp;</em>is, in fact, also making its way to the Switch 2.</p>

<p>Of course, this being a third-party showcase, one game is likely to be on everyone's mind, namely Team Cherry's&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>. Will we finally get to hear about a release date during this Direct?</p>

<p>I'd say there's a non-zero chance of that happening. Xbox recently announced that&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-gamescom-demo" rel="nofollow">will be playable at its booth</a> during this year's Gamescom, so that might line up pretty nicely with a Direct release date announcement.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase.jpg?itok=54K-Wd15 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase.jpg?itok=RiUxOJy7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Come on, Nintendo. Please? For us?</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, since Team Cherry is sort of hitching its wagon to Xbox (what with the game landing on Game Pass on day one and its inclusion as part of Xbox's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">new ROG Ally reveal this summer</a>),&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>might be a no-show during tomorrow's Direct as well.</p>

<p>Either way, you can check the show out tomorrow, July 31st, at 6am Pacific/9am Eastern. Join us here tomorrow for all of the reveals and news from that show as well!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[It Looks Like Battlefield 6 Won't Cost You $80]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-6-no-80-pricing</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/it-looks-like-battlefield-6-wont-cost-you-80.1256976/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has declared that it has no intention of raising its games' prices to $80 anytime soon, so it looks like upcoming releases like&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>, as well as already-confirmed titles like&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC 26</em>,&nbsp;will still cost you $70 this year.</p>

<p>In an earnings call with investors (courtesy of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-ceo-says-no-80-games-for-now-were-not-looking-to-make-any-changes-at-this-stage" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">IGN</a>), EA CEO Andrew Wilson answered an investor's question about whether EA was considering pricing its games at $80, since some of its competitors are beginning to do so.</p>

<p>Wilson said that EA wants to "capture the full spectrum of pricing so that we can serve players in the best way possible", and that while the company will continue to seek "opportunities to deliver great value...through various pricing schemes", there are "no dramatic changes planned yet".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-6-80-ea-andrew-wilson-explosion.jpg?itok=m4An-f78 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-6-80-ea-andrew-wilson-explosion.jpg?itok=Z8pd041E 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>EA says it doesn't have any plans to change its games' prices yet.</figcaption></figure><p>Wilson's comments come after Nintendo revealed earlier this year that&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">main launch title</a> for the Switch 2, would cost $80 (although that cost is drastically reduced if you pick the game up as part of a console bundle).</p>

<p>Xbox was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-prices-raised-hardware-software" rel="nofollow">originally due to follow suit</a> with its holiday releases, including Obsidian's&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2&nbsp;</em>and Activision's&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>, but after widespread criticism, the company revealed recently that its main lineup this year <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-outer-worlds-2-70-dollars-xbox" rel="nofollow">will remain at $70</a>.</p>

<p>As for Sony, the Japanese gaming giant seems to be maintaining its $70 pricing structure for now, with recent release&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>coming in at that price alongside future titles like&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yōtei&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Lost Soul Aside</em>.</p>

<p>Of course, just because these companies say their games will remain at $70 for the time being, that doesn't mean they won't suddenly increase prices next year, or the year after. It's tough to say at this stage.</p>

If some rather telling pre-sell text is to be believed, it looks like it's set for an October release, and we'll be getting our first glimpse of gameplay tomorrow.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Pokemon TCG Pocket Immersive Ho-Oh Card Pulled over "Production Issue"]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-ho-oh-production-issue-plagiarism</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pokemon-tcg-pocket-immersive-ho-oh-card-pulled-over-production-issue.1256943/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has pulled a new immersive&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em> card depicting Generation II Pokemon Ho-Oh, citing a "production issue" and pledging to conduct a "broader investigation" into the ways in which it commissions artwork.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/uk/pokemon-news/notice-regarding-new-illustrations" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>website, the company says that the card in question has been "replaced with a temporary placeholder", as has its Lugia counterpart (although the issue doesn't appear to apply to the Lugia card as well).</p>

<p>Just in case you're in the dark on this one, Redditor SPARKisnumber1 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1mc1y2b/leaked_hooh_immersive_art_seemingly_plagiarized/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">posted a Reddit thread</a> yesterday alleging that artwork for an immersive Ho-Oh card for the latest&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>expansion&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-wisdom-of-sea-and-sky-expansion" rel="nofollow">Wisdom of Sea and Sky</a>&nbsp;</em>was plagiarized from a 2021 fanart piece.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-ho-oh-lugia.jpg?itok=JwCokNKF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-ho-oh-lugia.jpg?itok=eWp07F3p 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>has pulled a Ho-Oh card over a "production issue" (although not the one shown here; that's just for illustrative purposes).</figcaption></figure><p>According to The Pokemon Company, the artist who drew the card in question, Sie Nanahara, was given "incorrect materials as official documents", so it sounds as though the company gave her the aforementioned fanart and essentially told her to copy or trace it.</p>

<p>However, without further official details, all we can do on that front is speculate. What we do know is that the Ho-Oh card is no longer in the game (although The Pokemon Company stops short of admitting plagiarism, of course), and it will be replaced with new art "as soon as it's ready".</p>

<p>Additionally, the company says it will conduct "a broader investigation to ensure no similar issues exist elsewhere in the game", so if there is any other plagiarised art based on fan work in&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>, it'll likely be found and replaced soon.</p>

<p>Let's hope that's not the case, though. I'm sure The Pokemon Company doesn't want to end up in a similar situation to&nbsp;<em><a href="https://x.com/Destiny2Team/status/1671927000498597888" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Destiny 2</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-marathon-art-stolen" rel="nofollow">Marathon</a>&nbsp;</em>developer Bungie when it comes to plagiarized art.</p>




<p>We'll have to wait and see how this situation develops, but in the meantime,&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>'s new&nbsp;<em>Wisdom of Sea and Sky&nbsp;</em>expansion is out now on both Android and iOS.</p>
