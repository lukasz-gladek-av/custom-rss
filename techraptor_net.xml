            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/frosthavens-video-game-adaptation-creates-no-fuss-experience-at-sgf-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At SGF this year, TechRaptor got a chance to check out the upcoming SGF demo for <em>Frosthaven</em>, a digital adaptation of 2022's hit strategy game. This faithful recreation of the board game presents a 'no mess' version of an incredible (and difficult) board game with deep legacy mechanics as you not only explore the world and develop your characters, but build up the settlement of <em>Frosthaven </em>to offer more gameplay opportunities and build up defences.</p>

<p>Before getting my hands on the game, I was lucky enough to not only speak with Hristo Petkov, the game director for <em>Frosthaven</em>, as well as Isaac Childres, the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9f351387-1805-4afa-833a-e32039d2d562" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/frosthaven-review" rel="nofollow">designer behind the <em>Frosthaven </em>board game</a>.</p>

<h2>Adapting <em>Frosthaven </em>From The Board To The Screen</h2>

<p>Knowing that <em>Gloomhaven</em>, the previous game in the 'Haven' series, had already been adapted into a Video Game, I asked what it was like adding on additional elements to suit <em>Frosthaven</em>.</p>

<p>In praise of Childres and the new mechanics that were created, he said, "Each character has a very individual playstyle and mechanics, so we needed to actually change quite a lot from Gloomhaven."</p>

<p>The largest addition that had to be created was the Outpost phase. This is the part of the game in between the combat missions where you can "create buildings, craft potions, and so on. You also need to defend it from attackers that approach the city."</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/frosthaven-exploration.jpg?itok=DSb1iGft 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/frosthaven-exploration.jpg?itok=niup-9WX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As a legacy game, <em>Frosthaven </em>iterates from session to session as you and your friends develop their characters and build out the town. I was excited to hear that even if you're playing a game with friends, if one friend isn't able to make it, the game adapts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Let's say you have a four-person party and one of the guys cannot come today. You can still play with or without their character for a couple of missions, and he can come back after. It's not a problem, just like the board gam,e it's very adaptable in terms of the number of players."</p>

<p>It was highlighted that even in a scenario where one player ends up at a lower level than the rest of the players, then the game will adjust to the average level of the party.</p>

<p>I turned to Childres to ask if he'd considered a digital edition of <em>Frosthaven </em>while developing it, and he commented that he had only been focusing on making the board game. "Once it was made Twin Sales, who was the original publisher, approached us and asked, 'Do you want to do this one digital too?' and I said, 'Sure, why not?'"</p>

<p>Talking about the collaboration, I wanted to get a better idea of what it looked like as development continued and how it made sure to stay true to Childres' vision. Childres explained, "we have monthly meetings where they show me all the new assets and I'm like 'Oh, it looks awesome!'" while knowing he was easy to be pleased Childres also expressed appreciation that he gets to be so involved in the process.</p>

<p>Petkov also echo'd that sentiment "the approval process is very good, there are some things that we need to change, obviously, but generally speaking most things are approved first time."</p>

<h2>From Imagination To Screen</h2>

<p>Petkov did let me in on the idea that "the most challenging things, and the things that we had the most to talk about were things that didn't exist."</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/frosthaven-environments.jpg?itok=X7a6hnxM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/frosthaven-environments.jpg?itok=gdE4Nlia 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's easy to say or read that something is burning, but bringing it to life is something totally different.</figcaption></figure><p>He began to list off a variety of aspects of the game where there's a written description, but nothing visual. A Metallic Ruin to explore, a zombie blacksmith boss that just used a guard token, or a moving elevator that is represented on your dining room table.</p>

<p>In Board Games it's easy to substitute miniatures or describe an environment in text, but adapting that to a video game means you need to create assets for it all. Luckily for all of these places where there wasn't art the artists at Snapshot Games were excited to create these unique elements.</p>

<h2><em>Frosthaven </em>Steam Next Fest Demo</h2>

<p>From there I sat down with the Steam Next Fest Demo of the game, ready to get into the tutorial mission and explore <em>Frosthaven</em>.</p>

<p>Starting the game I was brought to a party creation screen, selecting Bonechiller and Drifter, I could quickly review cards and abilities and purchase starting equipment. Asking how players had reacted to the Closed Beta that was held earlier it was the look of Bonechiller and Drifter that had actually received quite a bit of feedback.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/frosthaven-characters.jpg?itok=Xd9-c7td 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/frosthaven-characters.jpg?itok=QhmACOBh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Updated feedback to these characters makes them more terrifying (and less ewok-y)</figcaption></figure><p>For Bonechiller, players though she should have more/deeper scars to reflect her tortured gameplay style, taking damage to summon creatures to fight for her. On the other hand, the Drifter was thought to have a face "too much like an Ewok".</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Early Access Stats</strong><br>
When <em>Frosthaven </em>releases in Early Access there will be Six playable characters for you to play as and unlock. There will be 30 Scenarios from the Board Game made available, that means of the total 136 Scenarios approximately 22% of the game will be available.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Entering the first cutscene it was explained that the games events are fully voiced, this audio comes from the <em>Official Frosthaven Companion App</em>. By working together they were able to avoid reinventing the wheel and create a premium experience.</p>

<p>Loading into the first scenario Bonechiller and Drifter were placed on the board. Where the Board Game uses different dual sided hex tiles the world of <em>Frosthaven </em>has been more built out. In the snowy forest where I faced a group of Algox raiders the edges of the playable space were built up with rocks and foliage before drifting off into a haze. It didn't feel like the landscape stopped, but that it just wasn't in focus, leading to a better sense of immersion in the world.</p>

<h2>UI And Player Tooltips</h2>

<p>Speaking of the Beta feedback UI/UX was one that Petkov highlighted to me. "That's why we're doing the demo, that's why we are doing Early Access. It's so important because this game is really hard to do when it comes to UI. You want to shortcut things, then some people get mad because they want the agency, right?"</p>

<p>Character portraits appeared to the left, a list of combat participants to the top of the screen, and a list of selectable cards flew out in front of me. Each card I hovered over presented all of the information required in a quick and easy to digest format.</p>



<p>Petkov also showed me with a single key additional tool tips could be expended out related to just about anything your cursor is hovering over. If you want to know what the symbols are on a card, what any character has in their inventory, or even more information about an enemy fighter you can quickly gather it.</p>

<p>This is the kind of efficiency that I can imagine getting a lot of use out of at the start of the game, that would make me far more glad in the late game when I don't need any of that information and want less text and windows to progress.</p>

<p>That being said, while playing I did notice that there were a lot of 'confirmation' steps, that took place. You'd select two cards and then confirm, select where you want a character to move and have to confirm, pick the only enemy next to your character and have to confirm the attack.</p>

<p>At any point where it looked like my clicks weren't working around the screen my eyes began to learn to dart to the bottom of the screen to see if a red "Confirm" box had appeared.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/frosthaven-settlement-builder.jpg?itok=IvrGOpej 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/frosthaven-settlement-builder.jpg?itok=4z35xhhK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>While I won't give the full play by play my Drifter and Bonechiller were able to swiftly dispatch the Algox in the first room and approach a door made of Ivy to open up the second room. Before reaching the (currently burning) gates of <em>Frosthaven </em>you could see a hint of it in the fog surrounding the map. A neat tease for something big you're about to open up a door into.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Differences In Difficulty and Enemy AI</strong><br>
Alongside the standard <em>Frosthaven </em>gameplay, there is also a Story mode as well as a mode with increased difficulty. Based on feedback from the Open Beta they have made it that the enemy AI tends to move in a way that's better for the player, as that's how a lot of people play at home</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Skipping through the rest of the battle I was introduced to the settlement building phase. Here there were a wide variety of options presented to me. Build and upgrade buildings, purchase new equipment or try to upgrade it with resources, and even potion creation where trial and error can lead to the discovery of new recipes.</p>

<p>This isometric view of <em>Frosthaven</em>, with plenty of empty plots of land, showed off just how far you'll be able to go when you get your hands on the game.</p>



<p><em>Frosthaven</em>, the board game, is an epic experience. <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="0f8e2e88-4e90-4808-88d3-e7f73952c19d" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/frosthaven-unboxing-is-lengthy-and-almost-perfect" rel="nofollow">A heavy box filled with all manner of characters, cards, boards, maps, and booklets</a>. If you're able to get the box, a consistent group of friends, and the time to play it's well worth the experience. It's also understandable that for many getting the stars to align in such a way can just be impossible.</p>

<p>With the <em>Frosthaven </em>video game a lot of the stress of time and setup is washed away, with voice acting and beautiful (and scary) environments this is already shaping up to be an incredible way to experience <em>Frosthaven </em>without a number of the barriers to entry.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/aether-iron-sets-up-beautiful-world-for-gritty-noir-story<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Imagine a 1930s New York where technology had been created to float parts of the city into the sky, flying cars were common, and everyone spoke with enough pulp to put Humphrey Bogart to shame. This is the world of <em>Aether &amp; Iron</em>, a new detective game, by Seismic Squirrel.</p>

<p>At SGF we had a chance to sit down with Tyler Whitney, Narrative Lead, and Joshua Enz, Producer, to talk about what inspired the game, what experience players can look forward to, and even got some time hands on to explore a picturesque bar in the clouds, take on a mysterious man in car on car combat, and explore our home base.</p>

<h2>What A World To Live In</h2>

<p>In <em>Aether &amp; Iron</em>, players take on the role of Gia, a down-on-her-luck detective who has had one too many jobs go sideways. Returning to her employer, Mr Black, she's handed the job of escorting Nellie to the Lowers.</p>

<p>This job quickly escalates as both Gia and Nellie are thrown into danger and important and mysterious documents that Nellie was holding close are stolen.</p>



<p>The game is broken up into two gameplay styles, the first is exploration. As Gia you'll be able to interact with scenes and locations, having conversations with those you come across, or perhaps find an item or two to pick up for use later.</p>

<p>My first experience of exploration was in a bar with a glass floor, the view extending down to nothing but clouds below, the interior decked out as you'd expect a speakeasy of the time, but with a 'Neo-Decopunk' aesthetic.</p>

<p>When asked about what led to the idea of merging the past, of 1930s New York with a futuristic concept like that of Aether, the simple response from Whitney was that "we know that we want to have something beautiful, but was different." Whitney also offered up his love of movies like 2004's Sky Captain And The World Of Tomorrow, though he jokingly accepted that he might be in the minority for that.</p>

<p>Seeing the gleaming skyline of the city it reminded me of the Metropolis of Superman's Silver Age. Beautiful skyscrapers that tell you that this is a safe and glorious place to live, that's ignoring the other locations in this game.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aether-iron-interior.jpg?itok=DHq_o0fO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aether-iron-interior.jpg?itok=iPyhMbLv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>After picking up a bottle of booze and prodding the passed-out drunk, I approached the bar to open dialogue with the barkeep, a fellow employee of Mr Black.</p>

<h2>Explore And Interact With The World of <em>Aether &amp; Iron</em></h2>

<p>Dialogue in<em> Aether &amp; Iron</em> is fully voiced, letting you really get sucked into the noir dialogue filled with flowery phrasing and an internal monologue that exposits without feeling like it's spoonfeeding information to the player.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Additional Voice &amp; Text Options On The Way<br>
It was explained to me that after <em>Aether &amp; Iron</em> launches at the end of the year they will be adding Spanish and Chinese text localization, as well as working to add Spanish and Japanese Voices</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whitney attributed the passion for this genre with characters like Phillip Marlowe. He spoke about how he was given reign to write and that he then made it "flowery as hell." He wanted to write in a way that would make you feel, he laughed referencing the line "walking a knifed edge with bare feet" and how even now the thought of that made his toes curl in response.</p>

<p>At various points in conversation you'll be prompted with choices, these might be of no consequence merely moving the conversation forward, could only be possible if you have a certain item, or could be settled with a speech check.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aether-iron-taxi-rank.jpg?itok=-OlNwGYd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aether-iron-taxi-rank.jpg?itok=7agGhhh2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>An element of the speech checks that I loved were the inclusion of dice rolls. Each would prompt you to roll two dice, add your relevant stats, and any companion bonuses to try to meet the difficulty level of the check. You might be trying to fool someone, get some additional information out of them, or press your luck with an intimidating statement.</p>

<h2>The Choices… And Consequences Of Dialogue</h2>

<p>While I cleared most of the speech checks during my time playing, earning additional experience and earning additional money for Gia, there was one extremely difficult check that I failed. This didn't lead to any immediate negative repercussions but instead a funny moment where Nellie made fun of Gia and her very obvious attempt at lying.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It might not have earned me experience as a character, but as a player, it showed a side to this new character I hadn't seen yet and endeared me further to her.</p>

<p>I asked about what kinds of negative repercussions there could be, and if you failed enough, if there were "fail states" where you'd have to revert to a save. The answer I got was quite surprising as there could definitely be scenarios where you keep talking back and end up getting shot because of it.</p>

<p>Each of these fail states are presented with the idea of a retro newspaper spinning up towards the screen. When one happens it's something monumental enough that it would make the front page, Whitney explained that internally they "view them as hidden collectibles."</p>

<p>The choices that you make during the story of <em>Aether &amp; Iron</em> each have varying weights and some can even lead to exclusive branched narrative paths.</p>

<p><em>Aether &amp; Iron</em> is expected to take about 20 hours for an initial playthrough, and Whitney mused that if you knew exactly what you were doing it would take about three playthroughs to see everything, but I'm guessing if you're going in blind it might take a lot longer.</p>

<p>Due to the way you not only interact with the world, but also pick up and develop relationships with different characters and factions of <em>Aether &amp; Iron</em> there are currently ~16 different endings. These aren't all wholly unique but much like a game like Fallout has endings for individual character stories, faction plots, and the overall game each of the permutations can lend to one another.</p>

<p>Outside of exploration and interrogation when making your way across the city there are events that can prompt such as road combat.</p>

<p>Here the combat is turnbased, functioning on a grid where every turn you have a certain number of actions you can perform. You can ram your car or unleash a shotgun blast, or simply shift from lane to lane.</p>

<p>A neat element of movement is that while shifting lanes left and right you'll use up a point of stamina, but going up and down (accelerating and decelerating) you have complete freedom.</p>

<p>Other dynamic elements of this combat were other drivers on the road, that you could use to get inbetween yourself and whoever you're facing, and also lanes that appear and disappear during combat. Just like real life you may be asked to merge or shift lane so as to stay on the road, be sure to pay attention!</p>

<h2>Rooted In History</h2>

<p>An interesting aspect of <em>Aether &amp; Iron</em> for history buffs is that there are certain characters and elements that are rooted in the real life history of New York. An example given was that of the White Wings, the group of uniformed cleaners for New York established in 1895 by Colonel George E. Waring Jr.</p>

<p>Each of the segments of New York that have taken to the skies in <em>Aether &amp; Iron</em> function like company towns, with an organization at the head, and one of these factions is a militaristic group of cleaners.</p>

<p>It's by creating the world first, and then creating a story that inhabits it that the team hopes to create "a world that others feel so immersed in that when they walk away they continue to play in their heads."</p>
