You get a plot of land and a decent enough tutorial, and then you're off to explore a game filled with tons of fun activities. It seemed like an ambitious project, and I was not disappointed by how the devs delivered.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>The tutorial does a good job of guiding you through the basics and introducing you to the world. Your charming starter home certainly doesn't hurt, either!</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Returning Home</h2><p>As is typical for the genre, <em>Starsand Island</em> starts by giving you the basics — character creation, a short story introduction, a small plot of land, and a serviceable tutorial. This game also maintains the tradition of a high amount of player freedom; once you've started, you have a lot of different ways to play.</p><p>A central aspect of <em>Starsand Island </em>is its profession system. There are five Professions in total — <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/starsand-island-crafting" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d06320e2-d098-442b-862b-cc5a7b880f1f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">crafting</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/starsand-island-farming" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1aeb3b5b-3678-439b-8ff5-bcceb96f1b99" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">farming</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/starsand-island-fishing-guide-fish-list" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="dc294a1e-1a2d-4599-80fb-5ccdee4f307a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">fishing</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/starsand-island-ranching" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="33313204-45f2-4ad0-a830-46657fcf40b1" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">ranching</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/starsand-island-exploration" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4f81fb0e-0351-4f4d-bfb6-86178e7ee5bd" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">exploration</a> — and each of them has unique quest chains that allow you to advance deeper into their respective crafting trees.</p><blockquote><p>Starsand Island lets you decide exactly how you want to play and how fast you want to go through its content.</p></blockquote><p>Crafting, in particular, is essential to life on the island, and this is why the tutorial recommends that you work on it first. You'll need to use the workbenches and crafting materials you make with the crafting profession to create equipment for the other four professions at one point or another, unless you want to do things the slow way.</p><p>That's not to say the profession system is overly restrictive, mind. I started the quest chains for all five professions and played through them concurrently, bouncing back and forth based on my interests at the time. <em>Starsand Island </em>lets you decide exactly how you want to play and how fast you want to go through its content.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>You can farm as much or as little as you'd like, but it's labor intensive to do it at scale until you unlock better tools and get the materials to make them.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Growing Your Farm</h2><p>Naturally, farming is a big part of a game like this. <em>Starsand Island</em> offers a fairly robust farming system with seasonal crops, fruit trees, and multiple ways to plant your favorite foods. The pacing with this particular profession, however, is a little bit unusual.</p><p>Any <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/stardew-valley" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="98bb9fc6-d071-4d2f-9670-92bbc1934cec" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Stardew Valley</em></a> veteran worth his salt will tell you that sprinklers are essential to farming at scale, and you can usually start to make them fairly early. Conversely, <em>Starsand Island</em> buries the required equipment about halfway through the farming and crafting professions, respectively; it takes quite some time to get there.</p><p>You'll need a fair amount of materials to make sprinklers, too, and that means a <em>lot</em> of runs into <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/starsand-island-moonlit-forest-map-mining" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6f6e5d31-1253-4ac8-93bf-3b367a1048ca" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">the Moonlit Forest</a> to go mining for resources. Essentially, having the most basic of automation on your farm requires a fair amount of progress in three of the five professions.</p><p>Farming gets easier as you go, but it's not quite the cozy <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/how-to-make-money-in-starsand-island" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="db0a0c64-2a9f-4840-bb10-50b7b8479970" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">moneymaker</a> that you'd expect from some other Farming RPGs. Sowing, watering, weeding, and harvesting crops are all done one at a time until you can progress deeper into multiple professions and craft yourself some better equipment.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Though it has its limitations, the building system lets you reach a level of detail better than you'd normally expect from a game like this.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Building Your Homestead</h2><p>One of <em>Starsand Island's</em> most notable features is its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/starsand-island-building" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="cfa93844-ef2b-4c84-a0d9-a024896405ec" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">building system</a>. Many games in the Farming RPG and survival genres allow you to build structures piece by piece, but <em>Starsand Island</em> gives you what I believe to be one of the most robust building systems ever seen in a game of this style.</p><p>You're automatically given a cozy one-room, Asian-style shack as your home. It has enough space for the basics, but you might want to expand if you want to avoid having dozens of crafting stations strewn about on your front lawn. This is where you have two choices: layouts and free building.</p><blockquote><p>In addition to the nearly one thousand furniture items you can unlock in the game, you can also place nearly every other item in the game as decoration, such as crops, cooked food, tools, and some (but not all) of the crafting materials you come across.</p></blockquote><p>If desired, you can purchase a pre-made layout and simply plop it down on some empty land. There are a few choices of varying architectural styles, and you can additionally modify the design yourself once it's placed.</p><p>The much more attractive option (to me, at least) is the free building system. You can place blocks, roof pieces, doors, and windows piece by piece. You can scale them to larger sizes. You can change their texture. You can build yourself a simple grey box for your stuff, or you can spend hours building the perfect home.</p><p><em>Starsand Island</em> takes things even further with its decorations. In addition to the nearly one thousand furniture items you can unlock in the game, you can also place nearly every other item in the game as decoration, such as crops, cooked food, tools, and some (but not all) of the crafting materials you come across.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>None of the regular enemies or minibosses are particularly challenging; they soon turn into more of an annoyance than an actual challenge.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Fighting Through the Forest</h2><p>Peaceful as it may seem, this beautiful island paradise is not free from conflict. The Moonlit Forest pulls double duty as both the main dungeon and the mines, and you're going to have to visit it a lot to get all of the raw materials you need to advance your professions and make useful equipment.</p><p>The Moonlit Forest is one of the weaker areas of <em>Starsand Island</em> in its current state. You can run end-to-end and encounter fewer than 10 enemies and a grand total of three minibosses. Combat doesn't feel particularly challenging, either.</p><p>Though lacking in enemies, the Moonlit Forest more than makes up for it with an abundant amount of unique plants, trees, and raw ore. These items spawn in the same place every day, and you'll likely find yourself visiting the same spots daily to collect another <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/how-to-upgrade-your-backpack-in-starsand-island" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="cbf3814c-7ff0-4758-bfdd-6963d3b2ffe9" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">backpack</a> full of iron or gold.</p><p>Mining in the Moonlit Forest was always one area where I never felt like I had enough time or energy. If I needed certain materials, I'd easily burn up half of my day slogging through the dungeon to get everything I need. This aspect of <em>Starsand Island</em> could do with some improvement in the future.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Strangely, the relationships system doesn't yet make any mention of romance or marriage.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Forging Friendships</h2><p>The one element I haven't yet addressed in <em>Starsand Island</em> is the friendship system. There are friendship meters, a gifting system, and a way to hire certain townspeople to work for you once you've advanced your relationship enough.</p><p>That said, there's a near-total lack of meaningful story development with any of the characters, outside of the mentors you interact with during the five profession quest chains. There isn't much in the way of heart events or unique stories to uncover from what I've seen.</p><blockquote><p>Maxing out a friendship meter allows you to invite your "friend" to move in with you — a feat I've yet to achieve — but there is no clear language on romance or marriage just yet. It's a strange omission.</p></blockquote><p>In Seed Sparkle Lab's defense, this is one of the elements that many Farming RPGs tend to roll out in stages. <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/fields-of-mistria" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f307c748-d146-4487-92e4-644ef6216cf5" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Fields of Mistria</em></a>, for example, only had the most basic of story events in its Early Access launch version; many other games in this space tend to use the same playbook.</p><p>I am further confused by the vague language surrounding romance. Maxing out a friendship meter allows you to invite your "friend" to move in with you — a feat I've yet to achieve — but there is no clear language on romance or marriage just yet.

<h2><em>Starsand Island</em> Preview | Final Thoughts</h2><p>All in all, <em>Starsand Island</em> is definitely one of the better Early Access Farming RPGs that I've played in recent years. The few bugs I've encountered have been relatively small, and many of them were fixed in the course of my time with a pre-launch version of the game.</p><p>While it's currently a little weak on the story and combat aspects, <em>Starsand Island</em> is mechanically robust, engaging, and — most importantly — fun. The building system is especially entertaining to me, and I struggled to resist the urge to spend countless hours building out the island home of my dreams.</p><p>As always, the main concerns with an Early Access game are how fast it can squash bugs and deliver new content. As important as this is, what you'll get with the Early Access launch version is an estimated 100 hours of gameplay. I'd wager you'd get even more than that if you take your time to enjoy it.</p><p>I'm excited to see how <em>Starsand Island</em> grows and develops in the coming months. If you're a fan of Farming RPGs and life sims (or if you're even remotely interested in these genres), then I can confidently say that <em>Starsand Island</em> is the first must-play game of the year in this space. Give it a chance — you won't be disappointed.</p><hr><p><em><strong>Starsand Island</strong></em> was previewed over approximately 85 hours of gameplay on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2966320/Starsand_Island/" rel="nofollow">Steam</a> with a key provided by the publisher.
