            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/11-bit-studios-project-8-shutdown-new-projects<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>11 bit studios CEO&nbsp;Przemysław Marszał has provided some more context regarding the studio's recent cancellation of its story-based, console-focused game&nbsp;<em>Project 8</em>, and he's also teased two new projects in the works at the studio.</p>

<p>In an interview with Polish publication <a href="https://biznes.pap.pl/wiadomosci/firmy/11-bit-studios-rozpoczelo-prace-nad-dwiema-grami-nie-planuje-emisji-akcji-wywiad" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PAP Biznes</a> (via <a href="https://gameworldobserver.com/2024/12/25/games-industry-severe-crisis-11-bit-studios-ceo" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Game World Observer</a>),&nbsp;Marszał says that the gaming industry is "going through a severe crisis" at the moment, and that 2024 was a tough year for 11 bit "in some areas".</p>

<p>As a reminder, 11 bit revealed the cancellation of&nbsp;<em>Project 8&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/11-bit-studios-layoffs-project-8" rel="nofollow">last week</a>, along with a reduction in staff that would see several of the project's developers laid off. Others, however, would apparently be reallocated to other 11 bit projects.</p>

<p>However,&nbsp;Marszał reiterates that he believes the market has changed since&nbsp;<em>Project 8&nbsp;</em>began development, and that games like the aforementioned titles aren't doing particularly well in the current climate.</p>

<p>He says that&nbsp;<em>Project 8&nbsp;</em>was suffering from a number of issues both big and small, and that correcting them would have required more development time than management was comfortable with, so the game was shelved.</p>

<p>Marszał also reveals two new 11 bit studios projects, although he doesn't go into detail about either of them. The first is a 25-developer project with a smaller budget that's targeting a 2027 release, while the second will be "bigger" and take around "four years" for production.</p>

<p>To remind you, the studio doesn't just publish its own games; it's also a third-party publisher, with games like surreal adventure&nbsp;<em>Indika</em>, sci-fi head-scratcher&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/invincible" rel="nofollow"><em>The Invincible</em></a>, and CRPG&nbsp;<em>The Thaumaturge&nbsp;</em>being some of the games on its publishing slate.</p>

<p>In any case, it sounds like both of the newly-revealed 11 bit projects are still a little ways away from being ready, so it might be a while before we hear what they are. Stay tuned for more.</p>
