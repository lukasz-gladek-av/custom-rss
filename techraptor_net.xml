            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Original&nbsp;<em>Guitar Hero&nbsp;</em>publisher RedOctane has been revived, and the new version of the studio is apparently already hard at work on a brand new rhythm game.</p>

<p>As revealed on the studio's <a href="https://www.redoctane.games/https/redoctanegamessquarespacecom/news/press-release" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, the new version of RedOctane will be helmed by Simon Ebejer, who worked as production director on a number of&nbsp;<em>Guitar Hero&nbsp;</em>titles while employed at <em>Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock&nbsp;</em>developer Neversoft.</p>

<p>The announcement also says that the newly-revived RedOctane "includes creators and developers who helped create and scale&nbsp;<em>Guitar Hero&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>DJ Hero&nbsp;</em>nearly two decades ago", and that newer developers and creatives from the rhythm gaming space are also joining the studio.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/guitar-hero-redoctane-multiplayer.jpg?itok=HA11ll9o 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/guitar-hero-redoctane-multiplayer.jpg?itok=TnPCjfFM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>RedOctane oversaw the creation of the&nbsp;<em>Guitar Hero&nbsp;</em>franchise in its original form.</figcaption></figure><p>Charles and Kai Huang, the brothers who originally started RedOctane back in the 2000s, will "join a special advisory board" for the revived iteration of the studio, which will bring "deep heritage and insight" into RedOctane's "future direction".</p>

<p>Ebejer says that RedOctane is currently working to deliver "the next evolution in rhythm gaming". In an accompanying <a href="https://www.redoctane.games/https/redoctanegamessquarespacecom/news/blog-1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a>, RedOctane's Lee Guinchard says the project "won't be&nbsp;<em>Guitar Hero</em>,&nbsp;<em>DJ Hero</em>,&nbsp;<em>Guitar Freaks</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>Rock Band</em>", but "something new".</p>

<p>Guinchard, along with several other staffers joining the ranks of the new RedOctane, is part of the <a href="https://crkd.gg/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">CRKD team</a>, a studio that creates modern rhythm game peripherals for old-school&nbsp;<em>Guitar Hero&nbsp;</em>games, as well as the likes of&nbsp;<em>Fortnite Festival&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Clone Hero</em>.</p>

<p>It's not entirely clear whether RedOctane's new game will utilize one of these peripherals (or, indeed, whether it'll come with an entirely new piece of hardware), but given Guinchard and company's expertise, it would seem odd if that wasn't the case.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Video Game History Foundation (VGHF) has announced that it's acquired the rights to&nbsp;<em>Computer Entertainer</em>, an influential video game magazine from the 1980s that may well be able to claim a number of firsts.</p>

<p>In a press release, the foundation calls&nbsp;<em>Computer Entertainer&nbsp;</em>"one of the most important video game magazines of the industry's 'golden age'", which is the motivating factor behind the charity's mission to "locate and meticulously digitize" the magazine's "entire eight-year run" between 1982 and 1990.</p>

<p>According to the VGHF,&nbsp;<em>Computer Entertainer&nbsp;</em>is the first female-owned gaming magazine in history; it was owned and operated by sister duo Marylou Badeaux and Celeste Dolan. Not only that, but it was also "the only console-focused magazine" to survive the infamous '80s gaming industry crash.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/computer-entertainer-video-game-history-foundation-page.jpg?itok=ieD3_i-I 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/computer-entertainer-video-game-history-foundation-page.jpg?itok=-7G0LaaL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Computer Entertainer&nbsp;</em>is a real blast from the past.</figcaption></figure><p>Thanks to VGHF's efforts,&nbsp;<em>Computer Entertainer</em>'s entire back catalog is now available to read for free via the foundation's <a href="https://archive.gamehistory.org/folder/519c0dbd-0f5d-45fe-83c2-355a756391a95a756391a9" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Digital Archive</a>, a repository of gaming-related materials that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/video-game-history-foundation-free-online-library" rel="nofollow">opened earlier this year</a>.</p>

<p>The library is free for anyone to access, and thanks to its Creative Commons 4.0 license, you can even use it commercially if you wish. Since the VGHF is a nonprofit, though, a <a href="https://gamehistory.org/donate/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">donation or two</a> might not go amiss if you're intending to do so, eh?</p>

<p><em>Computer Entertainer</em>'s firsts go beyond its origins and its longevity; it may, according to VGHF, have been the only English-language gaming magazine to cover the original&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Bros.&nbsp;</em>at launch, and it was also one of the first publications to review games like&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Metroid</em>.</p>

<p>You can check out a video detailing the Video Game History Foundation's acquisition of&nbsp;<em>Computer Entertainer</em>, as well as a history of the magazine and its importance in the industry, right here.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>THQ Nordic and developer Grimlore Games have announced that their action RPG&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest II&nbsp;</em>has hit a big sales milestone just three days out from its release.</p>

<p>Speaking on <a href="https://x.com/TitanQuestGame/status/1952717544046915624" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">social media</a>, the two studios confirmed that&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest II</em>, which was released in Early Access on PC via Steam on August 1st, managed to hit 300,000 sales just under 72 hours after its launch.</p>

<p>The game has already managed to reach number 17 on Steam's top sellers list at time of writing, beating out longtime stalwarts like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/sims-4" rel="nofollow"><em>The Sims 4</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/rimworld" rel="nofollow"><em>RimWorld</em></a>, and Valve's own&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/team-fortress-2" rel="nofollow"><em>Team Fortress 2</em></a>&nbsp;(two of which are, admittedly, free-to-play, but microtransactions are a big business, after all).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/titan-quest-ii-sales-300k-72-hours-combat.jpg?itok=B4QWuFGx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/titan-quest-ii-sales-300k-72-hours-combat.jpg?itok=b0dMkBX_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Titan Quest II&nbsp;</em>has hit 300,000 sales in just 72 hours.</figcaption></figure><p>On Steam's weekly top sellers list, meanwhile,&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest II&nbsp;</em>is sitting at number six, putting it ahead of hits like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/peak-2m-sales" rel="nofollow">indie smash&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/peak-2m-sales" rel="nofollow">Peak</a>&nbsp;</em>and NetEase's free-to-play comic book hero shooter extravaganza&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/marvel-rivals" rel="nofollow"><em>Marvel Rivals</em></a>.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest II&nbsp;</em>is, it's the sequel to the 2006 action RPG&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest</em>, which was developed by the Massachusetts-based studio Iron Lore.</p>

<p>Sadly, following the release of the original&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest</em>, Iron Lore folded, but former members of the studio would go on to found Crate Entertainment, whose name you might recognize from action RPG (and unofficial&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest&nbsp;</em>spiritual successor)&nbsp;<em>Grim Dawn</em>.</p>

<p>The new game, meanwhile, is being helmed by German outfit Grimlore Games, the studio responsible for fantasy RTS&nbsp;<em>SpellForce 3&nbsp;</em>(but not for 2023's spinoff&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/spellforce-conquest-of-eo" rel="nofollow"><em>SpellForce: Conquest of Eo</em></a>, if you're still following me).</p>




<p><em>Titan Quest II&nbsp;</em>pits you against Nemesis, the Goddess of Retribution, who is "corrupting the Threads of Fate and condemning all who oppose her to Eternal Punishment". You'll be battling creatures from Greek mythology in&nbsp;<em>Diablo</em>-style action RPG combat to put a stop to her schemes.</p>

<p>You can grab&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest II&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1154030/Titan_Quest_II/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>, where it'll set you back $23.99 (at time of writing; it's available at a 20% discount right now).</p>
