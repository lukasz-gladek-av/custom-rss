            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Cygames has revealed that&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy: Relink&nbsp;</em>sales have hit another major milestone, around a year and a half after the game's initial release.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/881020/view/506206686159045888" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on Steam,&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy: Relink&nbsp;</em>has passed the two million sales mark, which means it's earned another million sales for itself since February last year.</p>

<p>That milestone was reached in around eleven days; it seems that sales have slowed pretty significantly since then, but two million is a very respectable number indeed for an action RPG based on what remains a relatively niche property.</p>

Taking place in a land known as the Sky Realm, the game casts you as "the captain of a skyfaring crew", with whom you'll embark on adventures galore.</p>

<p>The game has had a long road to release; it was first revealed back in 2016 as a collaboration with PlatinumGames, but by 2019, the&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Wonderful 101&nbsp;</em>studio was no longer involved with the project.</p>

<p>Following that, it would spend a few more years in development before being <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/granblue-fantasy-relink-gets-spectacular-new-trailer-release-in-2023-confirmed" rel="nofollow">slated for a 2023 release</a>, although it was subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gamescom-opening-night-live-here-are-all-trailers-news-reveals" rel="nofollow">delayed to February 2024</a>. Thankfully, that's a date the action RPG did manage to make.</p>

<p><em>Relink&nbsp;</em>isn't the only&nbsp;<em>Granblue&nbsp;</em>spinoff to grace PC and consoles, either. It's joined by the 2020 fighting game&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy Versus</em>&nbsp;and its 2023 sequel&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising</em>, both of which pit characters from the world of&nbsp;<em>Granblue&nbsp;</em>against one another in one-on-one bouts.</p>
