            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/two-killer-soulslikes-we-saw-at-summer-game-fest-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Very few Soulslikes land for me, outside of ones developed by FromSoftware themselves. Still, there's always potential for a hit, as was the case with last year's <em>Black Myth: Wukong. </em>For 2025 and beyond, I'm actually optimistic about the future of the genre, especially after seeing a few potential bangers at&nbsp;Summer Game Fest 2025.</p>

<p>I'm talking about&nbsp;<em>Code Vein II&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers.&nbsp;</em>In the case of&nbsp;the latter, I had a chance to play through the opening hour, though it didn't feel nearly enough to fully grasp what it had to offer.&nbsp;For&nbsp;<em>Code Vein II</em>, we were given a presentation that left me optimistic about this exciting sequel.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Code Vein II</em> - Bigger, and With a Motorcycle!</h2>

<p>Darn, this is one I really wanted to get my hands on. Unfortunately, I only have words and hands-<em>off </em>gameplay to go off of here, but let me tell you why I'm so excited for&nbsp;<em>Code Vein II.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>The first&nbsp;<em>Code Vein</em>&nbsp;was probably the first Soulslike -- again, outside of FromSoftware's own games -- to click with me. The slick anime aesthetic and faster pace of combat resonated with me, and when I was speculating what game this might be based on my SGF appointment's vague description, I hoped it was&nbsp;<em>Code Vein II.</em></p>

<p>And here we are, a sequel! Well, kind of. It's a sequel in name, but Bandai Namco also describes it as a reimagining. Expect some familiar elements, but&nbsp;<em>Code Vein II&nbsp;</em>is very much its own game. The lore behind this sequel is actually quite exciting, too.</p>



<p>Essentially, we'll be traveling between past and present timelines with the help of our player's companion, Lou MagMell. Hopping between timelines, 100 years to the past and then back to the present, is a daunting narrative challenge but one I am excited to see the developer tackle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Players can befriend various legendary Revenants -- essentially, the vampire-like beings from&nbsp;<em>Code Vein --&nbsp;</em>in both past and present. You are, of course, the hero of your own story. <em>Code Vein</em> was known&nbsp;for its robust character creator, so you'll be happy to know it's expanded to be better than ever.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We only got a taste of actual combat in&nbsp;<em>Code Vein II</em>. Footage is fast-paced and more akin to a traditional hack-and-slash action game than a Souls-like, at least at first glance. I doubt it will deviate much from its Soulsy roots, but there's potential for&nbsp;<em>Code Vein II</em>&nbsp;to grow more into its own thing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One returning mechanic are blood codes, which essentially dictate the class of the player and the weight of its stats. As this is a sequel, no doubt we'll see new Blood Codes in this one. We have some new mechanics called Jails and Formae, both of which essentially boil down to providing more abilities and techniques to utilize during combat.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There's also a motorcycle. This seems to be a focal point in&nbsp;<em>Code Vein II</em>, because the Bandai Namco booth at SGF had a prop motorcycle that was&nbsp;<em>very</em>&nbsp;cool. This is used to traverse the world, which will be much bigger this time around. I'm not going to say it's on&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s scale, but having to use a mount in a Soulslike game has me thinking big.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em> - Wuxia Souls</h2>

<p>I also had an hour to play&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>, but darn it all, I wish I had more. One, because it's a mechanically rich Soulslike game, but also because it was quite enjoyable!&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>&nbsp;is, no doubt, one of the least clunky games I've played in the genre, which is a pitfall far too many fall into.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This demo takes place right at the start of&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers.&nbsp;</em>There's some emphasis on story here, and essentially, you're afflicted with an ailment called Feathering. It looks exactly as it sounds, but Wuchang, the eponymous protagonist of this game, uses it to her advantage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wuchang is extremely capable with all form of weapons, and there were various styles I could try out in this demo. I landed on using the base longsword, as it felt like it catered to my playstyle of slightly heavier, longer weapons wielded with two hands. There are faster and slower styles players can use, of course.</p>

<p>The core mechanic to&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>&nbsp;revolves around Skyborn Might. As I understand it, perfectly dodging attacks and other actions grant you more power, so combat puts an emphasis on player skill. If you like to cheese your bosses, it's probably possible, but I feel like it's not quite that simple in this one.</p>



<p>Our character, Wuchang, has plenty of abilities at her disposal. Charging up your heavy attack and hitting the back of certain enemies stuns them and allows you to pull off a powerful attack. We can also cast spells, so if an enemy is pressuring you, take a step back, cast a spell, and do some decent damage on them.</p>

<p>There are plenty of other mechanics that are at play here, but I was still in the midst of getting these explained to me by the time my demo ended. Still, I made it to the first boss of the demo and defeating them in a thrilling battle. Combat left me very satisfied, so I'm eager to see how far&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>&nbsp;can go.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/future-clair-obscur-expedition-33-updates-new-content<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sandfall Interactive, the studio behind the hugely successful turn-based RPG&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, has confirmed it's actively considering "new content" for future updates, as well as various other improvements.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/expedition33.bsky.social/post/3lrpzry3pnk2f" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Bluesky, Sandfall says it's "currently exploring a wide range of future improvements" for&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>updates, including "accessibility features", "new content", and "all sorts of bits and bobs".</p>

<p>One of the major improvements Sandfall says it's thinking about involves expanding localization options for the game, allowing folks to play it in more languages. However, the studio <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/expedition33.bsky.social/post/3lrpzry3ujs2f" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">cautions</a> that it doesn't have "specific timelines or confirmed languages" yet.</p>

<p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>takes place in a world ravaged by a monstrous figure known as the Paintress, who paints a new number each year. Everyone of that age dies at the conclusion of the year, so humanity sends out "expeditions" to try and defeat the Paintress before the next number is painted.</p>

<p>Gameplay-wise, the game appears to take several cues from classic turn-based RPGs in franchises like&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest</em>, although it has a much darker and more bleak tone than the latter.</p>

<p>It's also got a parry system, being a modern game, and so you'll have to factor in parrying or dodging enemies' attacks as well as strategizing during turn-based combat.</p>




<p>Since launch,&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>has proven immensely popular. It <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-500k" rel="nofollow">sold 500,000 copies</a> within just 24 hours, going on to reach <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">two million in under two weeks</a>. At last count, it had hit the satisfying total of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-3-3m-33-days" rel="nofollow">3.3 million sales in 33 days</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Donkey Kong Bananza Nintendo Direct Scheduled for This Week]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-direct-announced</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-direct-scheduled-for-this-week.1219368/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-direct-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced that it will be airing a&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>-themed Direct presentation later this week, so we'll finally get to learn more about the iconic ape's upcoming platformer.</p>

<p>As revealed on the Nintendo Today news app, the&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>Direct airs on June 18th (that's this Wednesday at time of writing). It'll last around 15 minutes and will (quite obviously) focus entirely on&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, so put your&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>hopes away.</p>

<p>Announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2" rel="nofollow">back in April</a> as part of the Nintendo Switch 2's big reveal,&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>will serve as DK's first 3D platformer in 26 years. Naturally, I'm not counting the newer&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Country&nbsp;</em>games; their models might be 3D, but they're 2D platformers at heart.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-announced-dk.jpg?itok=FoXmj90V 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-announced-dk.jpg?itok=Rpz_cQ8B 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Direct airs in two days, DK. I'd go find something else to do in the meantime.</figcaption></figure><p>The game will see you playing as the titular ape as he attempts to recover priceless golden banana-shaped jewels from the nefarious VoidCo, for if Donkey Kong is involved, then it must be the rescue of bananas that motivates him.</p>

<p><em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>will take the form of a 3D platformer with all the good stuff you've come to expect from the genre: collectibles, bad guys to fight, and, of course, plenty of chasms to jump across.</p>

<p>The game will also feature destructible environments, with initial trailers showing off the ability to smash up elements of the stage to get underground or to collect more stuff. That's the kind of thing the original Switch probably wouldn't have been able to handle.</p>

<p>You can remind yourself of how fun&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>looks (very, in case you need a refresher) by checking out the debut trailer from back in April below.</p>




<p>The&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>Direct presentation airs on June 18th at 9am Eastern (that's 6am Pacific). The game itself launches <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">exclusively for Nintendo Switch 2</a> on July 17th.</p>
