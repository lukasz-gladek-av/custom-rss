            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-20m-players<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hideo Kojima has announced that his most recent game&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>has passed another big player milestone ahead of the release of the hotly-anticipated sequel later this year.</p>

<p>Speaking on social media platform <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:2jd64ychnmuu4x6eghptdvco/post/3llo4343bk222" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>, Kojima Productions revealed that&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>has passed 20 million players around the world, thanking "everyone who built bridges, paved roads, and delivered cargo" for the "incredible milestone".</p>

<p>It's worth noting that Kojima Productions is referring not just to sales of the game, but to the player count as a whole. That figure therefore likely includes players who have experienced the game on PlayStation Plus and Xbox Game Pass; it's currently available on the former on both PS4 and PS5.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/death-stranding-20m-players-box.jpg?itok=PtkmihIz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/death-stranding-20m-players-box.jpg?itok=zi3L6yvs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>has passed 20 million players worldwide.</figcaption></figure><p>The new player milestone for <i>Death Stranding&nbsp;</i>comes as Kojima and his studio prepare to release the game's sequel,&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">set for a June launch on PlayStation 5</a>.</p>

<p>It looks like the game will be exclusive to Sony's console for the foreseeable future, but given that Kojima <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-xbox-release-kojima-ip" rel="nofollow">now owns the IP rights</a> to&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding</em>, I really wouldn't be surprised to see the game get a multiplatform release at some point.</p>

<p>Of course, there's also the&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>movie, which will be a co-production between <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-movie-a24" rel="nofollow">Kojima's studio and movie house A24</a>, to look forward to. We still don't know who will be starring in that or when we can expect to see it, however.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding</em>, it's Hideo Kojima's first major project after <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/report-hideo-kojima-leaves-konami-forms-new-studio" rel="nofollow">leaving Konami back in 2015</a>. He's best known for the&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear&nbsp;</em>series, although he's also worked on other games like&nbsp;<em>Policenauts&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Zone of the Enders</em>.</p>




<p><em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>tells the post-apocalyptic story of Sam Porter Bridges, a courier who must deliver packages in a world devastated by a mysterious cataclysm. Of course, if you know Kojima's work, you'll know that's hardly doing the game justice.</p>

The sequel, <i>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</i>, is <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">launching for PlayStation 5</a> on June 26th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-10m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has announced that&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>sales have hit yet another milestone, cementing the game's legacy as the studio's fastest-selling game and breaking another company record in the process.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e250331.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a> issued earlier today,&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>has passed 10 million sales, a milestone that also sets a first-month sales record for Capcom. The game already broke franchise and company records earlier this month, hitting <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-8m" rel="nofollow">eight million sales in just three days</a>.</p>

<p>As for how&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>achieved this goal, Capcom puts its performance down to the introduction of crossplay for the first time in series history, as well as "the fusion of numerous new elements with&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter</em>'s appeal" creating "significant excitement".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-10m-charge.jpg?itok=1XN3KhWT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-10m-charge.jpg?itok=cwpzN1Cp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>continues to sell very, very well indeed for Capcom.</figcaption></figure><p>By way of comparison, it took previous mainline entry&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Rise</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-rise-sales-hit-8-million-units-worldwide" rel="nofollow">around ten months</a> to achieve the same sales figure, although that might be a slightly unfair comparison since&nbsp;<em>Rise&nbsp;</em>was a Switch exclusive until January 2022.</p>

<p><em>Monster Hunter World</em>, meanwhile, took over two months to achieve eight million sales, although again, the game was initially only released for PS4 and Xbox One, with a PC version subsequently launching in August 2018.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>still clearly stands as the series' most successful entry to date, although it's still currently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sitting at a Mixed rating</a> on Steam, thanks in large part to what appear to be ongoing performance issues for many players' PCs.</p>

<p>Hopefully, Capcom will address those performance issues in future updates.&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-1-release-date" rel="nofollow">first Title Update</a> is due to land later this week, and it's bringing a big new monster to fight, plus lots of other goodies.</p>
