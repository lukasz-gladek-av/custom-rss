            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has revealed the release date for&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version Luna I, a brand new update that's kicking off a year-long series of events themed around the moon.</p>

<p>Version Luna I, also known as "Song of the Welkin Moon: Segue", breaks with&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>tradition by eschewing the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-58-july" rel="nofollow">numbered designations</a> of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-57-release-date" rel="nofollow">previous updates</a>. It's due to land on all platforms on September 10th.</p>

<p>First off, Version Luna I introduces the new region of Nod-Krai, where you'll "become entangled in rising conflicts between factions", as well as meeting three new Nod-Krai natives who you'll have a chance to recruit for your team.</p>

<p>Of course, it wouldn't be a&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>update without new characters to recruit, and the first of three new warriors for your team in this update is Lauma, a five-star Catalyst wielder who can boost Bloom damage and transform into a new half-human, half-deer form.</p>

<p>Joining her is Flins, a five-star Electro polearm user who can unleash powerful Lunar-charged strikes and "hear the whispers of the Wild Hunt during exploration". Lastly, Aino, a four-star Hydro Claymore user, adds "playful new interactions" to&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact</em>, and you can recruit her for free.</p>

<p>We also got some more information about&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact</em>'s user-generated content system, otherwise known as the Miliastra Sandbox, which will allow you to create your own experiences within the game,&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>-style. It's coming as part of the next update after this one.</p>




<p>As always, news of the new&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>update also came alongside codes you can use to get yourself some free goodies in the game, and here they are!</p>

<ul><li>LunaI0910 - 100 Primogems, 10 Mystic Enhancement Ore</li>
	<li>LaumaNodKraiFlins - 100 Primogems, 5 Hero's Wit</li>
	<li>HiFiveTraveler - 100 Primogems, 50,000 Mora</li>
</ul><p>News of&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact</em>'s latest update comes after developer HoYoverse announced it will <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-ps4-support-ending" rel="nofollow">stop supporting the PS4 version</a> of the gacha RPG next year.</p>

<p>The date of Version Luna I is also the day on which you'll no longer be able to download&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>on Sony's last-gen machine if you've never done so before, but don't worry; you can still play if you've downloaded it already, and what's more, the PS5 version will be unaffected by this change.</p>
