            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic Games has announced the latest band to make its way into&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>as a crossover, and it's none other than legendary French house duo Daft Punk, who will feature in the game as an "experience" later this week.</p>

<p>As revealed in an <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/party-harder-better-faster-stronger-in-fortnite-with-the-daft-punk-experience?lang=en-US" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official blog post</a>,&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s Daft Punk Experience will begin on September 27th, and rather than just consisting of a few songs for&nbsp;<em>Fortnite Festival&nbsp;</em>or a couple of skins, it'll serve as a full-scale "sonic journey", according to Epic.</p>

<p>In the post, Epic says the experience will take players to a "transformative dancefloor destination" where they'll be able to "remix Daft Punk's music at Dream Chamber Studios" or "blast hordes of robots with a soundwave laser in the Robot Rock Arena".</p>

Furniture company Hervet Manufacturier, which has worked with Daft Punk in the past, will also have several virtual pieces displayed throughout the experience.</p>

<p>Epic is also promising an "afterparty" for the Daft Punk experience, but the studio is keeping the details close to its chest for now, promising to reveal more info about that "at a later date".</p>

<p>Of course, if you do want to pick up some Daft Punk skins for your&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>character, you can do so with a new bundle that launches this Thursday. It's got two new outfits and a bunch of accessories for you to spruce up your battle royale-ing with.</p>

<p>Daft Punk is far from the first artist to feature in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>. The duo follows on from the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-festival-hatsune-miku-crossover" rel="nofollow">Hatsune Miku</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-festival-reveals-first-glimpse-of-weeknd-gameplay" rel="nofollow">The Weeknd</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-the-big-bang-eminem" rel="nofollow">rap legend Eminem</a>, among many others.</p>

<p><em>Fortnite</em>'s Daft Punk collab lands on September 27th, and the "grand opening" for the event kicks off at 2pm Eastern that day, so make sure to be there if you want to see it all begin.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-largest-investment-2025</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Xbox has revealed that this year marks its "largest investment" in the Xbox Game Pass subscription service to date, so it's clear the company isn't too fazed by discussions around whether the service is good for developers or not.</p>

<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inside-xboxs-increasingly-vital-indie-publishing-operation" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>, Xbox indie boss Chris Charla confirms that 2025 has seen the biggest investment in Game Pass in the service's history, and he also reveals that Xbox has "signed deals with more than 150 partners to expand the catalog".</p>

<p>Charla says that "the majority" of studios whose games have been included as part of Game Pass "want to bring their future titles to the service", too, so the somewhat ambivalent buzz doesn't seem to be deterring developers who've got experience with the platform either.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-game-pass-largest-investment-there-are-no-ghosts-at-the-grand.jpg?itok=zEhnasiB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-game-pass-largest-investment-there-are-no-ghosts-at-the-grand.jpg?itok=AxI2P82x 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Xbox Game Pass is attracting indie titles like the upcoming&nbsp;<em>There Are No Ghosts at the Grand</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Xbox making its largest investment in Game Pass yet comes after a couple of high-profile industry figures expressed concern that the service might be doing more harm than good for developers, whether they be first-party or third-party studios.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, former Bethesda exec Pete Hines said subscription services were "worth jack shit" without companies making the effort to "figure out how to balance the needs of the service" with those who are "providing the content".</p>

<p>PlayStation boss Shawn Layden appeared to agree, linking Hines' comments on social media platform LinkedIn and asking whether subscription services were "healthy and helpful" for those who make games.</p>

<p>Layden's comments drew agreement <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-shannon-loftis-comments" rel="nofollow">from former Xbox VP Shannon Loftis</a>, who added that game adoption on Game Pass "comes at the expense of retail revenue" and that the service creates "weird inner tensions" among developers.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/human-fall-flat-xbox-game-pass_0.jpg?itok=xY9tfjwL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/human-fall-flat-xbox-game-pass_0.jpg?itok=wGw6bsPt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Game Pass hits like&nbsp;<em>Human: Fall Flat&nbsp;</em>haven't stopped some wondering whether the service is good for developers.</figcaption></figure><p>Whether or not Game Pass is actually good for developers is a question that's likely to continue to spark debate, but one thing's for sure: Xbox is still sure the service works. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things Game Pass-related.</p>
