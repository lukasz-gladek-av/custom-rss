            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher THQ Nordic and developer Three Fields Entertainment have announced the release date for vehicular destruction sandbox&nbsp;<em>Wreckreation</em>, and it's causing some serious car-nage next month.</p>

<p>As revealed in a new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Wreckreation&nbsp;</em>will land on PC and current-gen consoles (but no Nintendo Switch 2, unfortunately) on October 28th. It'll let you - and, optionally, your friends - loose in MixWorld, a "400 square kilometer racing realm that is yours to create, shape - and wreck".</p>

<p>As the title suggests,&nbsp;<em>Wreckreation&nbsp;</em>is built mainly around its core arcade racing loop, which combines high-speed racing and driving with&nbsp;<em>Burnout</em>-style crashes and stunts. If you're still waiting for&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wreckfest-2-early-access-release-date" rel="nofollow"><em>Wreckfest 2&nbsp;</em>to come out of Early Access</a>, this one should do more than just tide you over.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wreckreation-release-date-loops.jpg?itok=izuzCDGo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wreckreation-release-date-loops.jpg?itok=1HDUGAN1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Wreckreation&nbsp;</em>brings vehicular chaos in October.</figcaption></figure><p>The game's main attraction, however, is the aforementioned MixWorld, where you can place whatever crazy loops, ramps, and pipes your brain can conjure, before tasking your friends to take on your impossible gauntlet.</p>

<p>As THQ Nordic and Three Fields say,&nbsp;<em>Wreckreation</em>'s MixWorld will offer you the chance to "build roads on and off-road", as well as "out to sea or up in the sky", so if you love to spend hours with&nbsp;<em>GTA Online</em>&nbsp;players' racing creations,&nbsp;<em>Wreckreation&nbsp;</em>is for you.</p>

<p>You can also customize your vehicle, as well as the gameplay challenges you're asking players to complete. Even time of day, weather conditions, and whether there's any traffic on the road can be customized and controlled.</p>

<p>If you want to get a sense for what&nbsp;<em>Wreckreation&nbsp;</em>will play like (as well as seeing some pretty gnarly crashes), then you can check out the game's release date announcement trailer right here.</p>




<p><em>Wreckreation&nbsp;</em>is scheduled to launch for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1594040/Wreckreation/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10005975/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/wreckreation/9n0llb6pg0r4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on October 28th. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things THQ Nordic-related.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pigface-preview-cleaning-out-the-house.1299201/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You've just woken up in a grimy, dark warehouse. There's a throbbing in your head. The voice on the radio says he just implanted a bomb in your brain. Do what you're asked, or it's lights out. Forever.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Pigface</em>&nbsp;makes a strong first impression. I came in expecting more of a horror slant, as it publisher <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/dread-xp" rel="nofollow">DreadXP's</a> specialty, but was met with something more akin to an <a href="https://techraptor.net/genre/immersive-sim" rel="nofollow">immersive sim</a>&nbsp;combined with&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/genre/first-person-shooter/games" rel="nofollow">retro shooter elements</a>. This Early Access build of&nbsp;<em>Pigface</em>&nbsp;offers a brief, but thrilling look at what we can expect in its full release, and now I'm chomping at the bit to see what's next.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pigface-gunplay.jpg?itok=5lgN0AH9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pigface-gunplay.jpg?itok=b1G5XmNf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Spray and pray.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><h2>Contract Killing in&nbsp;<em>Pigface</em></h2>

<p>In&nbsp;<em>Pigface,&nbsp;</em>you're tasked with taking on various hits. You're essentially a cleaner, a professional at killing. Boot up your old, early 2000s laptop in the rundown apartment you live in and get to work. The first job is a farmhouse; apparently, some folks called "The Smilers" need killing. While you're at it, you'll need to grab a sample of their drugs and folders with info on their other hideouts.</p>

<p>With the money that you earn on jobs, you're able to purchase new equipment. This mostly comes in the form of guns, and as you progress, players can buy even better firearms and attachments for them. There are also melee weapons, body armor, morphine, and tools like landmines. Whatever you need to get the job done.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pigface-gameplay-farmhouse.jpg?itok=lOgdaQLQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pigface-gameplay-farmhouse.jpg?itok=jrN5Cg5a 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I can here them walkin' around up there...</figcaption></figure><p>So for this first job, you're short on cash and it's actually pretty tricky with few tools at your disposal. The farm is inhabited by over 20 armed thugs, and you're given, essentially, nothing but the most basic items. The good news is, you can approach&nbsp;<em>Pigface</em>'s levels in many different ways, which makes it feel quite a bit like an immersive sim.</p>

<p>Since I was surrounded by all sides by goons armed to the teeth, sneaking around was key. I didn't hit the farmhouse first since it was chock full of The Smilers, so I went to the barn and took out some thugs in a frantic firefight.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Eventually, I make my way to the house on the property. It's a mini fortress, with sentries up high and patrols all around. Thankfully, I've got more ammo for a TEC-9 I scavenged.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pigface-gun.jpg?itok=sa_efju9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pigface-gun.jpg?itok=LISkHjZl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The dreaded silenced .357.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Pigface</em>'s Tools of the Trade</h2>

<p>Scavenging seems like a key component to&nbsp;<em>Pigface</em>, too, since ammo is a finite resource. You're not running around, picking up floating ammo refills. You'll have to make do with the guns of your enemies once you run out of your main weapon's ammo. If all else fails, use a melee weapon like a hammer, but that makes you extremely vulnerable. Use of cover and not rushing in head-on seems crucial.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You're pretty susceptible to gunfire in&nbsp;<em>Pigface</em>, but enemies are equally so. Unlike, say, a boomer shooter, enemies drop down a bit quicker. A headshot is immediately lethal, but depending on the weapon, even a shot to the body may drop them for good.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pigface-shotgun.jpg?itok=piP08M5l 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pigface-shotgun.jpg?itok=X7NhqAUm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>He won't see this coming.</figcaption></figure><p>While at first you feel at a disadvantage with the number of enemies, later missions start to feel easier. Levels grow in both size and complexity, but the weapons and tools available to you level the playing field. I appreciate the flexibility players are given with their build, especially with weapon variety.</p>

<p>There are pistols, rifles, and machine guns, all of which behave different. Some of them have optional scope or silencer attachments, while others don't. Gunplay feels more realistic than your usual shooter. There isn't a reticle, so you're reliant on iron sights, though some guns don't even have that.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pigface-sniper.jpg?itok=CWbRcN6h 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pigface-sniper.jpg?itok=Euj3Daz4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Like fish in a barrel, really.</figcaption></figure><h2>Death From Afar</h2>

<p>Some weapons could use some balancing, though, as they make&nbsp;<em>Pigface'</em>s missions far too trivial. I equipped myself with a scoped .357 magnum and sniped enemies from afar. They weren't able to tell where my bullets came from, so it was just a matter of picking everyone off one by one.</p>

<p>This was without a silencer attached to the magnum, by the way. Using a silencer would have made things even&nbsp;<em>easier</em>&nbsp;since enemies can detect noise, so my choice in not using one was to add just a little bit of a challenge. Hopefully, in later builds, highly accurate, long-range weapons have a trade-off, so it's not so easy to abuse this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I hope the core gameplay loop of&nbsp;<em>Pigface</em>&nbsp;stays true to how it is currently. Completing objectives like eliminating certain targets or destroying drug-making materials in any manner I see fit is simple but enjoyable. The gunplay ticks all the right boxes, even if it doesn't feel like a traditional shooter, and if I can get even more fun guns to play with, all the better.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pigface-humor.jpg?itok=Y7-mRYpO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pigface-humor.jpg?itok=_aAmU8Rz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I'm coming on Friday!</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Pigface </em>Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>The aesthetic for&nbsp;<em>Pigface</em>&nbsp;is not necessarily completely original, but I enjoy look it's going for. The low-poly graphics and the piss-colored filter gives off a certain dark, brooding, edgy feel. It's an uncompromising, dirty, and extremely violent shooter involving some dirty work, so it all fits thematically.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Whether you're trudging through the sewers of a dilapidated suburb or shooting your way through a rinky-dink motel full of drugs and thugs, the Early Access for&nbsp;<em>Pigface</em>&nbsp;is a promising first look. Who knows, there might even be a few surprises waiting for players in the future. I can't wait to see for myself!</p>
