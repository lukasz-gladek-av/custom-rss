            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The latest entry in the <em>Skate </em>franchise is releasing in Early Access on September 16. Fans have been fighting to have a new <em>Skate </em>title recognized for the better part of a decade, but with a deeper lean into community, live service activities, and seasonal content, is <em>Skate </em>asking too much of its fans?</p>

<p>For the past week, I've had access to a pre-alpha edition of the game and with it the chance to skate around San Vansterdam (San Van), explore the various neighborhoods, and compete in a variety of challenges.</p>

<h2>Drop Into <em>Skate.</em></h2>

<p>Before you get a chance to hop into free roam, there's a lengthy tutorial that takes you carefully through just about everything you'll need to know to get your feet on the ground (board). Led by Vee, your sassy AI companion, you'll get to ollie, grind, perform grab and flip tricks, and get introduced to the city and its various activities.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skate-early-access-preview-backflip.jpg?itok=yiniN6oQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skate-early-access-preview-backflip.jpg?itok=M8CZ1RYY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>While the tutorial did feel like it dragged a bit for a new player, it's going to be more than worth it to set them up for success as they drop into a world inhabited by other skaters.</p>

<p>Past the Tutorial, there is a story to <em>Skate </em>in the lightest sense. Your challenge completions earn you acclaim, ranking up your standing in the different regions of the world. You'll meet City Councilmembers — who are also skaters — who give you access to more challenges and locations. All of the communication is done over the phone, so expect to hear a lot of voices and not much in terms of world interactivity.</p>

<h2>Skating In San Van</h2>

<p>The core of the game, skating, is just as good as you'd hope it to be for a franchise that hasn't seen the light of day in 15 years.</p>

<p>After learning the basics, you'll be unleashed upon the open world. A nice mix of realistic environments and skatable locations makes San Van feel like a mostly functional city, but one that is filled with fun lines to put your skills to the test.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skate-early-access-preview-tutorial.jpg?itok=RATm_uOw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skate-early-access-preview-tutorial.jpg?itok=X8yd34gV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As you'd expect for <em>Skate</em>, you steer with your left thumbstick, and how you move your right stick will decide what your feet, and ultimately your board, are up to. Holding down on the right stick will position your skater to jump, and flicking it directly up will cause you to pop an Ollie.</p>

<p>The <em>Skate </em>formula, balancing between sim and arcade, is a delicate line and while there's certainly an art and skill to performing the trick you're after, there's plenty of open space for a beginner to just wildly toggle and still pull off something entertaining.</p>

<p>To get the perfect line, you can use tools to set a mark and return to it quickly, allowing you to perfect your line without having to worry about setup time. When the game, and some of the challenges in it, require you to perform a pretty specific set of activities, the incredibly low time to reset is a godsend for letting you just have fun and not worry about not getting it the first, second… or twentieth time…</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skate-early-access-preview-san-van.jpg?itok=62DVleNd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skate-early-access-preview-san-van.jpg?itok=VfwGXX1n 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>If you're someone who loves <em>Skate 3</em> for its skateboarding mechanics, this sequel really is "all that and more" in terms of allowing you to create your favorite lines, show off with friends, and even cut together footage. I expect once this releases, I'll start seeing clips of crazy moments or simple and perfectly executed kickflips all over my social feeds.</p>

<p>Additionally, there are a number of settings to make the <em>Skate </em>sim experience a bit easier, or at least more familiar to those who might only have arcade skateboarding game experience. Things like holding forward to push, or easier pumping, let you keep your speed up more consistently, so you can nail those tricks a bit easier.</p>

<p>There's a good level of tweaking in the setting that lets you take baby steps, or leap, when you want to push the game further into the sim style of play.</p>

<h2>Off-Board Exploration</h2>

<p>An interesting addition to <em>Skate </em>is the freedom to explore the world off your board. While you can get off the board and perform simple actions like running and jumping, there's a climbing system in <em>Skate </em>that will allow you to reach new heights.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skate-early-access-preview-climbing.jpg?itok=P-mHVCac 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skate-early-access-preview-climbing.jpg?itok=63_n-R8w 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Look for ways to climb up buildings, and you might find a new place to drop in from, or just a place to test out your diving abilities.</p>

<p>This also means in a quite vertically stacked city like San Van, with building plazas at different heights, you can climb a wall from the street level to find a new skating spot, complete with a variety of grindable art installations.</p>

<h2>Customize Your Skater</h2>

<p>As you complete challenges, you'll begin to earn reputation (Rip Score) for the neighborhood you completed the challenge in, as well as currency that can be spent at any shop. Each shop has a variety of 'boxes' for you to purchase that could contain different outfit pieces or customizable options for your board, like deck patterns, decals, and more.</p>

<p>These boxes are interesting because while what you get from them is random, there's a small pool that you pull from, and after pulling an item, that is then removed from the pool. This means if at first a box has 12 potential items, after pulling 5 items, if you still don't have the piece you're after, there are only 7 potential items left to pick.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skate-early-access-preview-customization.jpg?itok=Cpz2JM7i 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skate-early-access-preview-customization.jpg?itok=ARqArxJq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>While it would be nice to just be able to purchase the piece you're specifically after, it feels like a balance was struck here to allow players to have a better chance to pull what they wanted, but also still prompt the players to complete more challenges to earn enough to get what they want. There have been countless games I've played where currency just ceases to be important after I pick up the four or five outfit pieces I want.</p>

<h2>Live Service All Around You</h2>

<p>Something that is extremely clear from playing <em>Skate </em>for even an hour is just how heavily it leans into the live service experience.</p>

<p>Each neighborhood in the world is filled with a few static challenges, but is primarily populated with rotating challenges. Complete all of the challenges, and in a few hours, they'll all be swapped out with new ones to experience. Each neighborhood offers higher rewards and more difficulty, but the cycle is very transparent.</p>

<p>On top of that, each challenge offers just a little bit more reputation and loot if you're playing in a party, promoting getting together and skating with friends.</p>

<p>Something that I was a little bit surprised to see was that there are also daily and weekly challenges for you to complete. Do you want to earn a bit more cash? Make sure you log in and perform 5 Laser Flips today.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skate-early-access-preview-challenges.jpg?itok=L6vGcQNn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skate-early-access-preview-challenges.jpg?itok=HkYP8cNK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>These rotating challenges and daily/weekly checklists promise to the player that no matter when they log in, there will be something for them to do. Unfortunately, quantity doesn't always equate to quality. Knowing that each challenge is so replaceable and that there's no 'completion' to be had allows you to progress in the sense of seeing your reputation get higher, but there isn't really a sense of progression in the world.</p>

<h2><em>Skate </em>is back</h2>

<p>From my time playing, the skating was smooth, the music was great to jam to, and the casual atmosphere of pulling off a simple and clean line was intact. For fans of <em>Skate 3</em>, you'll be able to hop in and enjoy a variety of familiar and enhanced features.</p>

<p>If you're just here for a chill skate or to play with friends, then you'll have a great time.</p>

<p>If you're looking for real progression or a story that really shows you rising in the ranks, then the heavy lean into live service robs a lot of that from the experience in exchange for a never-ending wave of challenges.</p>

<p>As we get closer to the free-to-play launch, there's a lot riding on the audience to participate and stick around to make the world feel full and entertaining; otherwise, you'll just be skating around an empty city on a hamster wheel.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With the original&nbsp;<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="cd8a1852-2307-4184-b0df-b9afab69154e" href="https://techraptor.net/games/outer-worlds" rel="nofollow"><em>The Outer Worlds</em></a>&nbsp;being one of my best friend's favorite games and as&nbsp;an RPG lover myself, I jumped at the chance to get my hands on the sequel through the preview. It was exactly what I thought I would experience, with whacky dialogue options, time-distorting technology, and brain damage. Here's what we learned in <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f7b9881c-df25-4849-881d-eafe092b40f7" href="https://techraptor.net/games/outer-worlds-2" rel="nofollow"><em>The</em><em>&nbsp;Outer Worlds 2</em></a>&nbsp;preview.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>A Taste of the World |&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>&nbsp;Preview</h2>

<p>The preview lasted about an hour and covered character creation and the first mission line. Overall, the story takes you to a colony not patrolled by the Earth&nbsp;Directorate, but under authoritarian control. There's still the silly humor present in the title, but taking out dictatorships remains the goal. You're able to play your way, NPCs recall previous dialogue choices, and actions you take directly impact how the mission plays out. I find this type of gameplay absolutely exhilarating.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-outer-worlds-2-dialogue-remembered.jpg?itok=gWh32ZcX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-outer-worlds-2-dialogue-remembered.jpg?itok=1uEw-qip 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Character creation is simple and straightforward. It also has a few inclusivity areas, mainly the ability to create characters with prosthetic limbs. This was great, the limbs are gorgeous, and I loved seeing disabled bodies represented in a popular title. Character Creation is the first important decision-making area of the game.</p>

<p>The focus here is on your skills and traits, which dictate how you interact with your crew and the colony of Arcadia. I played through the preview twice, picking different traits, choosing to get a negative trait, and selecting different skills to see how this impacts the game. My second time around was much smoother than the first with the inclusion of Lockpicking, a skill I find necessary to fully explore Arcadia.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-outer-worlds-2-character-creation-prosthetic-limbs.jpg?itok=Acfhog3C 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-outer-worlds-2-character-creation-prosthetic-limbs.jpg?itok=dNbDpD_k 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The mission available was what seems to be the first in the game, complete with tutorials and beginner combat tips. There are multiple choices you can make that determine whether you duke it out with enemies or go a stealthier route. The first time, I went with the combat-heavy choice, which resulted in me dying multiple times as I forgot to heal myself repeatedly. The second I became one with the shadows, a far better fit for my playstyle in this instance. Stealth kills are extremely satisfying, especially in a room full of enemies that previously gave me a hard time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, combat is straightforward, you have your main weapon, either ranged or melee, and support items like distraction devices or grenades. You can heal during combat, but it takes a moment and you can die while trying to get your health up. When it comes to stealth, there are multiple bars showing how exposed to enemies you are, really allowing you to take risks while avoiding detection. If you're creative enough, you can turn Arcadia's own defense turrets on the guards or have the mechs turn on their owners.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-outer-worlds-2-sneak-attack-combat.jpg?itok=7aLcGXyX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-outer-worlds-2-sneak-attack-combat.jpg?itok=53YfQAc6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Arcadia itself is full of nooks and crannies that hide collectibles, like Pitchball Cards. Secret item stashes are littered throughout, making the Observant option highly prized if you want to find everything. Otherwise, exploring the colony comes with the regular items for healing, ammo, additional weapons, and support items. Since the preview is centered around a single well-designed location in Arcadia, it's hard to say when the different areas of the colony will feel like and how well their theme is executed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Without spoiling the ending of the first mission, it's safe to say it's a cliffhanger that exits with a bang, literally. There are multiple explosions during the brief time I experienced Arcadia, but they really left an impression. I absolutely need to know what happens after the preview content ended.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-outer-worlds-2-rift-anomoly-explosion.jpg?itok=yxJlCcAF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-outer-worlds-2-rift-anomoly-explosion.jpg?itok=iFJDcDJ0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The overall experience was smooth, with no bugs encountered and no odd glitches, enemies in the sky, or clipping through walls. The story is well thought out with background information feeding into the main quests seamlessly. Depending on your choices, dialogue with the NPCs changes, giving you a unique experience based on your actions, skills, and traits.&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2&nbsp;</em>preview really lived up to my expectations in all ways except the length of the available content.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Left Us Wanting More</h2>

<p>While I was able to play through character creation and the first mission line multiple times, I was left wanting more content. The preview was relatively short. Some gameplay items were left out, like having a Pet or working with a Companion. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, though. I will 100% be playing when The Outer Worlds 2 releases at the end of October. I need to know what happens in Arcadia, why a massive explosion was required, and how I can save the world.&nbsp;</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Lost Skies 1.0 Release Sets Sail for Mid-September]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-skies-10-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lost-skies-1-0-release-sets-sail-for-mid-september.1282071/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Bossa Studios and publisher Humble Games have announced when you can expect the 1.0 release of skybound survival game&nbsp;<em>Lost Skies</em>, and it's just around the corner.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Lost Skies&nbsp;</em>1.0 will be arriving on September 17th, having launched in Early Access earlier this year. That feels to me like a surprisingly short amount of time for a game to stay in Early Access these days.</p>

<p>Bossa says that&nbsp;<em>Lost Skies&nbsp;</em>is essentially an attempt to create a spiritual successor to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/creators-of-surgeon-simulator-release-new-mmo-worlds-adrift-may-17" rel="nofollow">2017's&nbsp;<em>Worlds Adrift</em></a>, which, as the studio notes, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bossa-studios-worlds-adrift-is-shutting-down-this-summer" rel="nofollow">"ultimately did not reach a 1.0 release"</a>. Still, Bossa says&nbsp;<em>Lost Skies&nbsp;</em>"rebuild[s] upon the strong groundwork" left behind in the former's wake.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lost-skies-1.0-release-date-flying.jpg?itok=NI6XSdAi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lost-skies-1.0-release-date-flying.jpg?itok=LpssuubO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Lost Skies&nbsp;</em>is leaving Early Access in September.</figcaption></figure><p>The studio goes on to say that it's looking to "elevate the elements players loved from&nbsp;<em>Worlds Adrift</em>" in&nbsp;<em>Lost Skies</em>, and there doesn't appear to be any kind of intentional pun in there, which feels like a missed opportunity to me.</p>

<p>In any case, if you played&nbsp;<em>Worlds Adrift&nbsp;</em>and want to know what you can expect from&nbsp;<em>Lost Skies</em>, Bossa says that elements like "exploring hundreds of floating islands" and building unique skyships from rare materials and parts are very much part of the experience.</p>

<p>You can also expect to confront "some huge sky filling bosses", according to Bossa's Luke Williams. He says the studio has spent the last three years of development working closely alongside the community to ensure&nbsp;<em>Lost Skies&nbsp;</em>is everything it could be.</p>

<p>If you want to get a sense for what&nbsp;<em>Lost Skies&nbsp;</em>is like, then you can check out the official 1.0 release date trailer, courtesy of Humble Games, right here.</p>




<p><em>Lost Skies&nbsp;</em>1.0 launches on September 17th, but if you want to play it before then, you can do so right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1931180/Lost_Skies/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>.
