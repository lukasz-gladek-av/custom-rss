            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A PEGI rating has been spotted for something called <em>Assassin's Creed: Black Flag Resynced</em>, which appears to pretty much confirm the long-mooted remake or remaster of the piratical open-world adventure.</p><p>The <a href="https://pegi.info/search-pegi?q=Assassin%27s+Creed+Black+Flag+Resynced" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">rating</a>, which puts the game at 18 for "violence", "bad language", and "in-game purchases" (because of course; this is Ubisoft we're talking about, after all) was spotted by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/pegi-rates-assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Gematsu</a>, but it's not the first we've heard of a potential <em>Black Flag </em>remake or remaster.</p><p>A couple of weeks ago, Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1p72wmu/assassins_creed_black_flag_remake_resynced_leak/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">thequaliti</a> spotted text pointing to <em>Black Flag Resynced </em>within the localization table of <em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>. Essentially, the text is a quick disclaimer discussing "creative liberties" taken with history to create the game, but it's another pretty strong piece of evidence, too.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Assassin's Creed: Black Flag </em>is probably getting a remake soon.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There's precedent for this, too; in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-ceo-confirms-multiple-assassins-creed-remakes-are-on-the-way" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">June last year</a>, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot promised that "some remakes" of titles in the <em>Assassin's Creed </em>series were on the way, and that these projects would "revisit some of the games [Ubisoft has] created in the past and modernize them".</p><p><em>Assassin's Creed: Black Flag </em>seems like a pretty solid candidate to kick off Ubisoft's slate of <em>Assassin's Creed </em>remakes, especially given the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/skull-and-bones-review-dead-and-buried-already" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="85cef5b0-2392-4049-9109-bfdd7b8e3e95" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">grim fate</a> of the studio's other foray into nautical adventuring in recent years.</p><p>Still, I'd argue that remaking the original game, or perhaps <em>Assassin's Creed III</em>, would be a better shout. These are games with (in my eyes, at least) very clear flaws, so giving them another try and sanding down some of the more troublesome edges makes a lot of sense to me.</p><p><em>Black Flag</em>, by contrast, is still a very good game by today's standards, and as an avowed RPG-element-<em>Assassin's Creed </em>hater, I'm worried Ubisoft is going to drown the seafaring, swashbuckling classic in gear scores and incremental loot.</p><figure role="group">

<p>Given the increasing buzz around the so-called <em>Assassin's Creed: Black Flag Resynced</em>, it may well be that we can expect an official announcement at The Game Awards, which is set to reward some of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/game-awards-2025-nominees" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a925a006-6874-4d20-831b-d86ee39af97a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">its nominees</a> with shiny trophies later this week.</p><p>We'll have to wait and see whether that announcement surfaces or not.
