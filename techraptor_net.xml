            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/tales-of-valiant-players-guide-2-graces-kickstarter-today<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Kobold Press has launched a new crowdfunding campaign for <em>Tales of the Valiant</em>. The aptly named <em>Tales of the Valiant</em> Player's Guide 2 campaign introduces expanded player options for the studio's fantasy TTRPG, including new subclasses and spells.</p>



<p>According to its <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/deepmagic/players-guide-2-new-power-for-5e-and-tov-players/description" rel="nofollow">Kickstarter page</a>, <em>Tales of the Valiant</em> Player's Guide 2 offers players more customization options for their characters. This includes over 40 subclasses for pre-existing classes alongside three new classes: the Vanguard, Witch, and Theurge. Since <em>Tales of the Valiant</em> uses the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> 5e <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-releasing-updated-dungeons-dragons-2024-srd-at-end-of-month" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SRD</a>, that means all material in the book is also compatible with Wizards of the Coast's TTRPG.</p>

This preview showcases the Vanguard, which can be described as a support martial character. They can deploy banners and use stratagems to protect and aid their allies. An example stratagem is Close Ranks, which makes your group immune to critical hits and from being forcibly moved for a turn.</p>

<p><em>Tales of the Valiant</em> Player's Guide 2 is a 250+ page supplement that includes the three new classes, 48 subclasses, 150 new spells, a magical tattoo system, rules on new downtime activities, customizable base-building rules, and new vehicle upgrades. Additionally, the campaign features a 32-page character journal, custom dice bags and luck tokens, and VTT support for Shard, Fantasy Grounds, Foundry, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/alchemy-rpg-kickstarter-fully-funded-in-one-day" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Alchemy</a>.</p>

<p>The pledge tiers for Tales of the Valiant Player's Guide 2 are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Player's Guide 2 PDF for $29:</strong> A PDF of Player's Guide 2</li>
	<li><strong>Player's Guide 2 Hardcover and PDF for $59:</strong> PDF and physical copy of Player's Guide 2</li>

	<li><strong>Limited Edition Hardcover, PDF &amp; Journal for $129:</strong> A limited edition physical copy and PDF of Player's Guide 2 and three physical character journals</li>
</ul><p>The campaign for <em>Tales of the Valiant</em> Player's Guide 2 addresses the concern of US <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/adjusted-us-trade-tariffs-to-china-still-poses-problems-to-board-game-industry" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">trade tariffs</a>. As mentioned earlier, books are exempt from the tariffs; however, Kobold Press has fallback printers in the EU and Canada in case this situation changes.</p>

<p>At time of writing, the Kickstarter has raised&nbsp;$132,955, almost triple its initial funding goal of $50,000. the campaign ends June 27.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/russian-military-backed-squad-22-zov-wants-to-show-the-complexities-of-the-ukraine-war.1200795/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/squad-22-zov-russian-military-propaganda<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Squad 22: ZOV</em>, a tactical RTS that appears to have the official support of the Russian military, has appeared on Steam, and although it's free to play, that very fact is arguably pretty concerning.</p>

<p>As spotted by the folks at <a href="https://simulationdaily.com/news/steam-russian-military-propaganda-game/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Simulation Daily</a>, the game claims to be based on the "real wartime experience of living Russian veterans of war in Ukraine". Not only that, but&nbsp;<em>Squad 22: ZOV</em>'s developers say it's "officially recommended by the Russian military" as a basic training tool.</p>

<p>In gameplay terms,&nbsp;<em>Squad 22: ZOV&nbsp;</em>is a tactical strategy game in which you must issue orders to your squad, presumably as they invade Ukrainian towns and villages and ransack the homes of innocent civilians. It's not the best look in the world for Steam, I'd argue.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/squad-22-zov-russian-propaganda-game-tactical-view.jpg?itok=Jq7mTYWj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/squad-22-zov-russian-propaganda-game-tactical-view.jpg?itok=zAnI1JS9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Squad 22: ZOV&nbsp;</em>aims to depict the Russia-Ukraine war from, er, the Russian side. Right.</figcaption></figure><p>Tellingly, developer SPN Studio and publisher Zarobana Entertainment say that the game offers the chance to "delve into the complexities of the 2014 and 2022-2024 events through compelling campaigns". I'm not sure if it's deliberate that the date range doesn't include the current year.</p>

<p>In case you're not aware, those dates refer to the 2014 <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26686949" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">annexation of Crimea</a> by Russia, then 2022's <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/world-europe-60454795" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">full-scale invasion</a> of Ukraine, referred to by Russian leader Vladimir Putin as a "special military operation". It's not exactly the most creative euphemism in the world.</p>

<p>Said invasion led to various studios voicing their opposition to Russia in several ways, with companies like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/games-workshop-suspends-warhammer-sales-in-russia" rel="nofollow">Games Workshop</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloober-team-halts-sales-in-russia-and-belarus-over-invasion" rel="nofollow">Bloober Team</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cd-projekt-red-halts-sales-with-russia-and-belarus" rel="nofollow">CD Projekt</a> halting sales in Russia and Belarus owing to the event.</p>

<p>The two studios say the game gives you the opportunity to "gain insight into the perspectives of those who lived through these periods, understanding how these events shaped their lives and opinions".</p>

<p>Of course, I highly doubt that&nbsp;<em>Squad 22: ZOV&nbsp;</em>includes any Ukrainian viewpoints on the situation; given that it's endorsed by the Russian military, I can't imagine that organization condoning any kind of game that attempts to be that even-handed.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/squad-22-zov-russian-propaganda-game-outdoors.jpg?itok=jCdqiYZM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/squad-22-zov-russian-propaganda-game-outdoors.jpg?itok=AmEQDWJi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Squad 22: ZOV&nbsp;</em>promises to depict Russia's incursions into Ukraine, for some reason.</figcaption></figure><p>As if all of this wasn't bad enough,&nbsp;<em>Squad 22: ZOV&nbsp;</em>also utilizes generative AI, and the game's description of the way in which this was achieved is a head-scratcher.</p>

<p>SPN Studio says "some 2D images in game where [sic] pre-rendered with usage of AI as a base for work of our 2D artists", with those images "later drawn-over in order to make them geniue [sic] art". I don't think that's how "genuie" art works.</p>
