            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Scarlet Hollow </em>Episode 5, which was originally set to debut in its entirety later this week, will instead be releasing in two parts, developer and publisher Black Tabby Games has announced.</p><p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1609230/view/519737782627731799" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a post</a> on Steam, the studio says that Episode 5's first part will still be launching on Friday (which, appropriately enough, is the 13th of the month), but that the second half will now be arriving on February 20th, one week later.</p><p>The split is happening because "the art for the ending" of the fifth episode "has taken a little bit longer than [Black Tabby has] anticipated", according to the studio, and so rather than rushing the climax or delaying the entire episode, the decision has been made to cut the fifth chapter in two.</p><figure role="group">

<p>According to Black Tabby, the first part of Episode 5 "is still roughly the size of all of Episode 4", so if you are still planning to dive into the fifth episode on Friday, there should still be plenty to keep you occupied.</p><p>Black Tabby says the split release will also have the added benefit of allowing <em>Scarlet Hollow</em>'s community to theorize and digest the events of the fifth episode, promising "twists and revelations" as part of the chapter.</p><p>Just in case you're unfamiliar with <em>Scarlet Hollow</em>, it's a horror visual novel from Black Tabby Games, the developer behind <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/slay-princess-sales-1m-scarlet-hollow-100k" rel="nofollow">the breakout hit</a> <em>Slay the Princess</em>.</p><p>Unlike that game, <em>Scarlet Hollow </em>is episodic, and not all of its episodes are out yet; the game is planned to span seven chapters, with four currently available and the fifth now arriving across the next two weeks.</p>
<p>If you'd like to get caught up with <em>Scarlet Hollow </em>ahead of the fifth episode's release on Friday (and then the climax's arrival next week), you can pick the game up right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1609230/Scarlet_Hollow/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC via Steam</a>.
