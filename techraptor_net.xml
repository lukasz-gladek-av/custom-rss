            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft has reiterated its intention to remain in the first-party console business, despite rumors swirling recently that the company may be contemplating an exit from that side of its operations.</p>

<p>In a statement provided to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/no-xboxs-next-gen-console-hardware-plans-arent-cancelled" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Windows Central</a>, Microsoft says it is "actively investing in [its] future first-party consoles and devices designed, engineered, and built by Xbox", which is a pretty definitive rebuttal of rumors to the contrary.</p>

<p>The company also suggested that those who want to see proof of its commitment to the console business can remind themselves of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/next-gen-xbox-hardware-sneak-peek" rel="nofollow">the agreement</a> Xbox made with AMD back in June, which will see the tech company creating chips for new Xbox devices.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-hardware-rumors-this-is-an-xbox.jpg?itok=nkZV2fzt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-hardware-rumors-this-is-an-xbox.jpg?itok=t0lUZem6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Despite its current multi-device "This Is an Xbox" campaign, Xbox insists it hasn't given up on hardware development.</figcaption></figure><p>Recent rumors appear to have started with leaker <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/microsoft-revamps-xbox-game-pass-plans-and-hikes-ultimate-to-29-99-a-month-ultimate-gets-ubisoft-classics-and-more.1688694/post-270866538" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SneakersSO</a> (who was previously apparently responsible for leaking the news that Xbox would port its games to other hardware, including <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sea-of-thieves-grounded-and-pentiment-officially-announced-for-playstation-platforms" rel="nofollow">erstwhile rival PlayStation</a>).</p>

<p>The leaker said over the weekend that Xbox's future lay in software rather than hardware, and that previously "concrete" plans for new Xbox hardware had become "up in the air". Evidently, that's not the case, or at least that isn't the image Microsoft wants to publicly project.</p>

<p>If Microsoft were to pull out of the console race, it wouldn't necessarily be an entirely ridiculous decision. According to Aldora Intelligence's sales data (via <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/09/18/new-ps5-versus-xbox-sales-estimates-are-probably-worse-than-youd-expect/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Forbes</a>), Xbox Series X|S sales are sitting at under half of the PlayStation 5's numbers, having failed to break 30 million between the two available machines.</p>

<p>These are not, however, official figures; Microsoft is,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-sales-75m-best-quarter-ever" rel="nofollow">unlike Sony</a>, fairly reticent about regularly announcing how many Xbox Series consoles it's managed to sell. Still, it's fair to say Xbox is almost certainly trailing Sony quite significantly in terms of hardware sales.</p>




<p>Microsoft's statement comes after Xbox <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-tiers-reworked-2025" rel="nofollow">introduced new tiers for its Game Pass subscription service</a> last week, with Ultimate now costing an eye-watering $30 per month. That move itself came after Xbox <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-largest-investment-2025" rel="nofollow">revealed that this year marked its "largest investment"</a> in the service to date.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Denies Generative AI Government Lobbying]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-generative-ai-lobbying-denial</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Japanese gaming giant Nintendo has denied lobbying its native country's government over generative AI, although the company does say that it intends to continue taking action against anything it perceives as intellectual property infringement.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/NintendoCoLtd/status/1974716195246088220" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message</a> on social media, Nintendo says that it "has not had any contact with the Japanese government" regarding generative AI, "contrary to recent discussions on the internet". The studio closes by saying it will "continue to take necessary actions" against IP infringement, "whether generative AI is involved or not".</p>

<p>The message was seemingly posted in response to <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/nintendo-apparently-lobbying-japanese-government-in-fight-against-generative-ai/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a>&nbsp;(thanks, Nintendo Everything) by Japanese House of Representatives politician Satoshi Asano, who said that Nintendo "avoids using generative AI to protect its IP" and that the company was "engaging in lobbying activities with the government".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-generative-ai-lobbying-denial-donkey-kong.jpg?itok=dcJTiuib 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-generative-ai-lobbying-denial-donkey-kong.jpg?itok=qrNQ3PWb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nintendo, the studio behind games like&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, has, in fact, not been lobbying the Japanese government over generative AI.</figcaption></figure><p>Asano himself apologized for the inaccuracy of his original statement and the misleading information contained within, posting a lengthy explanation and apology <a href="https://x.com/Asano__Satoshi/status/1974812318761631821" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on his X account</a>. He's also deleted the original post in order to "prevent further dissemination of inaccurate information" (according to machine translation).</p>

<p>If Nintendo was lobbying the Japanese government over generative AI, though, it likely wouldn't come as much of a surprise, given the company's past statements about the controversial technology.</p>

<p>Back in July last year, Nintendo <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-generative-ai-no-plans" rel="nofollow">said it had no plans</a> to utilize generative AI during any of its development processes, with president Shuntaro Furukawa pointing to "issues with intellectual property rights" and the responsibility of Nintendo to "deliver value" as sticking points.</p>

<p>The legendary gaming company is famously hawkish when it comes to pursuing legal action over its intellectual property. It's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-palworld-pocketpair-lawsuit" rel="nofollow">currently suing</a> Pocketpair, the creator of survival game&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>, for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-lawsuit-patents-demands-nintendo" rel="nofollow">patent infringement</a>, and it's been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-genki-switch-2-lawsuit" rel="nofollow">aggressive</a> on the legal field in this regard <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-subpoena-request-pokemon-teraleak-identity" rel="nofollow">before</a>, too.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-nintendo-lawsuit-generative-ai-lobbying.jpg?itok=nrT_JqIb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-nintendo-lawsuit-generative-ai-lobbying.jpg?itok=yFsqkjbK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you want to know how protective Nintendo is over its IP rights, ask the folks behind&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo's stance on generative AI puts it at odds with many of its peers, including the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-generative-ai-characters-pubg-inzoi" rel="nofollow"><em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>studio Krafton</a>, streaming giant <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-generative-ai-vp" rel="nofollow">Netflix</a>, and fellow gaming titans <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-partners-with-generative-ai-company-to-enable-dynamically-generated-stories-quests" rel="nofollow">Xbox</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-hopes-to-use-generative-ai-to-drive-more-monetization-and-make-development-30-more" rel="nofollow">EA</a>, among others.</p>

<p>However, Nintendo isn't the only gaming luminary to express doubts about generative AI; others, like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioshock-creator-ken-levine-generative-ai" rel="nofollow"><em>BioShock</em>'s Ken Levine</a>, have also evinced skeptical positions on the tech, so Nintendo is far from alone in being cautious.</p>
