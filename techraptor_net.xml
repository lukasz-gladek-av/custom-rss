            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has dropped an official <em>Magic: The Gathering Marvel Super Heroes</em> preview. The latest Universes Beyond crossover set pushes further into the Marvel universe, introducing the likes of The Avengers and the Fantastic Four to the iconic card game.</p><p>In an official <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/feature/marvel-super-heroes-preview-prologue" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>, Wizards of the Coast showcased some select cards customers may find in the upcoming <em>Magic: The Gathering Marvel Super Heroes</em> set. The set was announced last year as part of a multi-set agreement with Marvel. The first set, based on <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/mtg-spider-man-interview-mark-rosewater-corey-bowen-team" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Spider-Man</a>, was released earlier this year.</p><picture>

The set will introduce characters, concepts, and equipment featured in The Avengers, Fantastic Four, and the Thunderbolts.</p><p>The cards featured certainly get the distinct scale and tone of these larger-than-life characters right. There is a Saga called <em>The Coming of Galactus</em> that ends with you spawning a 16/16 token with flying, trample, and destroying land whenever it attacks. Captain America has a mechanic around a Shield counter, which provides hexproof and extra protection from enemy spells.</p><p>But of course, heroes are only as good as their villains, and this set has some of the most iconic. Doctor Doom, the Super Skrull, and the Mad Titan Thanos are all showcased.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> <em>Marvel Super Heroes</em> preview also confirms that prebuilt Commander decks will be coming. This is notable since the last crossover set, based on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mtg-avatar-last-airbender-everything-you-need-to-know" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em></a>, had no Commander decks. The post confirms that one of the Commander decks will center around The Fantastic Four. The unique selling point of the decks is that your Commander can be any of the four members of Marvel's First Family.</p><p>Lastly, the preview confirms that, like the Spider-Man set, certain cards will be getting classic comic cards, borderless source material cards, and borderless panel card variants. As the names imply, this means certain cards will feature artwork from Golden Age and Silver Age comic covers, as well as select panels from key comic book moments.</p><picture>
