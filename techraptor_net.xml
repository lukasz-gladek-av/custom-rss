            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Supermassive has managed to create a fascinating formula with <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c664edc7-8576-46a3-bd42-ad55b04b4321" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/little-nightmares-review-very-unpleasant-dream" rel="nofollow"><em>Little Nightmares</em></a>&nbsp;and iterate upon it in the sequel. Now in <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="82b2b92a-8a97-466d-b41e-9ad000d7e88d" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/little-nightmares-iii-preview-co-op-nightmares" rel="nofollow"><em>Little Nightmares III</em></a>, players are invited back into a familiar yet new unsettling territory, while being joined by a co-op companion for puzzle solving, exploration, and running away from a variety of terrifying sights.</p>

<p><em>Little Nightmares III </em>introduces two new protagonists: Low and Alone. Low is a masked boy armed with a bow and arrow, while Alone is a red-headed girl in a green jumpsuit who wields a wrench. Beginning in front of a shattered mirror, the duo is trying to make their way through the Spiral. A variety of themed hellscapes where the horrors are larger than life, and there's very little you can do to influence the world but run, jump, and hide.</p>

They'll make it through the world of china dolls and building blocks, spider orderlies and paperwork, and a creepy carnival where it seems everyone has lost themselves to their indulgences. It's enough to know that you want to leave… so that's what you'll do to escape.</p>

<h2>A Story About A Boy And A Girl</h2>

<p>Just as with all <em>Little Nightmares</em> games, though, there's a deeper story going on. There's a subtle narrative that weaves through the different areas that you visit, and some cutscenes tell of times outside of the event of the game, too, that help to clarify the image. By the end of the game, there are also some things that you learn outright, but there's far more to be left to the imagination of the player.</p>

<p>This is a difficult way to tell a narrative. For someone who is just here for the gameplay, they'll be able to have a good time. For a different player who likes to read between the lines, there's certainly more to uncover here. In my single playthrough of the game, I think I have some idea of the journey that I've taken… but I also wouldn't be surprised if the next person to pick up the controller gets a totally different message.</p>

As Low or Alone, you'll be exploring each of these worlds, trying to find your way out. There isn't a large amount of exploration, as for the most par,t you'll be trying to make your way to the right like a classic sidescroller.</p>

<p>Your characters are far too small for the scale of the world, you won't be opening doors but sliding through cracks or vents. It's the creepy humanoid denizens of the world that you'll see acting as you normally would, while you're forced to shelter like weak vermin.</p>

<h2>Traditional <em>Little Nightmares</em> Puzzles</h2>

<p>You'll run, jump, and climb as Low or Alone, making your way through untraditional puzzles to inch closer to escape. An early puzzle had you trying not to draw the ire of a giant baby doll by avoiding the light cast by its gaze, moving from shadow to shadow while it looked away. Other puzzles might have you moving crates or trolleys around to use as a ladder to reach new locations.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/little-nightmares-iii-light.jpg?itok=q5chXagd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/little-nightmares-iii-light.jpg?itok=LNnK4zbP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bugs are scared of light, makes sense to me</figcaption></figure><p>My favorite puzzles were those where you had to trick or defeat the strange creatures of the world to steal a key from them to progress to the next room. While it was a short adventure, any chance you had to really stick it in the faces of those who were hunting you down was an incredibly satisfying victory.</p>

<p>For the most part, the puzzles weren't very difficult, and any time I was stuck, it would only be 5-10 minutes before I'd find the path forward. There were a number of times, especially when walking into rooms where enemies were preparing to grab me, that I did feel like the gameplay was somewhat unfair. Patterns needed to be understood, and you'd normally have to move in a specific path to not be caught. If you've never seen this pattern before, you're likely going to fail, get grabbed or killed, and then respawn at your last checkpoint.</p>

<p>These rooms didn't feel like I was 'solving' anything; it just felt like I had repeated the section enough to know the pattern.</p>

<h2>Co-Op Nightmares</h2>

<p>The major change for <em>Little Nightmares III</em> is in the co-op gameplay. For the most part, Low and Alone will stay together, but there are times when one character might need to stay behind to open a door while the other forges ahead to find another way to get their companion through.</p>

<p>The times that this gameplay worked, it was an incredible amount of fun, even in single-player. Flipping a lever as Alone and then asking Low to shoot arrows to solve a button puzzle was great, and the ventriloquism dummies that need to have their heads shot off by Low before Alone crushes them with her wrench were a blast.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/little-nightmares-iii-co-op-puzzle.jpg?itok=rQUY8OX3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/little-nightmares-iii-co-op-puzzle.jpg?itok=wWtKj07J 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Reveal a diagram and then shoot your way to victory</figcaption></figure><p>As a solo player, there was also the benefit when it came to chase sequences that my AI partner would not only be ahead of me, but also follow the perfect line to escape any danger. Unlike the enemy rooms, where I felt like I needed to learn the hard way to succeed, this felt like I was being handed the answers.</p>

<p>The downside of this co-op gameplay is the number of rooms and checks that require both characters to be pulling up a grate, both holding a lever, or both pushing a door. There is probably a not-insignificant amount of time that consisted of Alone just waiting for Low to catch up so they could progress forward.</p>

<p>This dependence on the other character being present, and no way to force a reset, also caused me issues at two points in my game where the AI got left behind, and I needed to reset myself to a checkpoint to have Low respawn so that I could progress through the game.</p>

<h2>Look And Feel Just As Eerie As Ever</h2>

<p>Supermassive have absolutely outdone themselves again in the creation of the different worlds that you'll venture through, how similar and yet darkly twisted it all is, and then filling it with all kinds of creepy creatures and sounds.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/little-nightmares-iii-baby-doll.jpg?itok=SOa1DnC8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/little-nightmares-iii-baby-doll.jpg?itok=tiSO3Z4z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>No thank you</figcaption></figure><p>From the very get-go of the game, getting hunted through buildings by a giant baby doll throws you into a state of unease. As you move through the twisted settings of what seems to be an office building of some kind, or a carnival where the disgusting and distorted humans seem to be visitors as much as they are the attraction, you just have to settle into an afternoon of unsettling sights and sounds to make it through <em>Little Nightmares III.</em></p>

<h2><em>Little Nightmares III</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><em>Little Nightmares III </em>is an enjoyable little puzzle platforming adventure to play through alone or with a friend this October season.</p>

<p>The story is enjoyable on the surface, while leaving good food for thought as the credits roll and you ponder a bit more about the adventure you went on. For a game where so much is left up to interpretation, it also doesn't overstay its welcome. I felt that the time for rolling credits was exactly where it should have been in the narrative.</p>

<p>The co-op aspect, I think, does well to elevate and make some of the gameplay more unique without explicitly overcomplicating it, but there is some level of drawback in having to create a world that's specifically designed for two people to play in instead of one.</p>

<p>Building on the creepy aesthetics of the previous titles, Supermassive has managed to once again create a surreal and gross world to experience from start to finish, where you'll just want to get out of it as soon as possible.</p>

<p>If you're up for a quick and off-putting adventure and you've got an afternoon to spend and a friend or partner to share it with, I couldn't recommend picking up <em>Little Nightmares III</em>&nbsp;enough. If what you're after is an engaging story, or you already know you're <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="17bd91ca-0fd9-4759-a16e-2ee29e6d762c" href="https://techraptor.net/games/little-nightmares-2" rel="nofollow">not a fan of the previous <em>Little Nightmares</em> titles</a>, then chances are this isn't the title for you.</p>
