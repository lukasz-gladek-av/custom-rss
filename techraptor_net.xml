            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The most influential Japanese TTRPG is getting an official English translation. Mugen Gaming has announced they will be localizing <em>Sword World RPG</em>, a TTRPG so popular that it culturally eclipses <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>.</p>



<p>According to a report <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/sword-world-rpg/crushed-dnd-english-translation" rel="nofollow">by Wargamer</a>, Mugen Gaming has announced a partnership with <em>Sword World RPG's</em> original publisher, Group SNE, to localize the TTRPG to English-speaking territories around the world.</p>

The campaign will be to localize the <em>Sword World 2.5 Core Rulebook</em>. In addition, Mugen plans to support the game long-term, providing localizations of expansions, supplements, and prewritten adventures.</p>

<p>The cultural space <em>Sword World RPG</em> has in Japan cannot be understated. It started when Ryo Mizuno and his friends played a translated version of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons red box. This resulted in the "replay" write-ups, essentially the earliest form of Actual Play, that would become the blockbuster fantasy novel and anime series, <em>Record of Lodoss War</em>.</p>

<p>With a passion for the hobby ignited, Mizuno and his friends founded Group SNE to pursue official TTRPG publishing projects. This led to <em>Sword World RPG</em>, an enduring franchise still going strong after 35 years and over 10 million in sales. It is notable for using a simplified 2d6 system, cinematic battles, an open multiclass system, and adventures designed to make each session feel like an episodic anime arc.</p>

<p>The English localization of <em>Sword World RPG</em> is a natural extension of the growing popularity of TTRPGs as a hobby. While we've seen more niche experiences arrive overseas like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/japanese-rpg-picaresque-roman-comes-to-kickstarter" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Picaresque Roman,</em></a><em>&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cmon-games-announces-household-ttrpg-coming-to-west" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Household</a>,</em><em>&nbsp;</em>and select entries from <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cmon-partners-with-bouken-to-bring-japanese-ttrpgs-to-west" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bouken's catalog</a>, Sword World finding a new audience may handily coincide with rising competition for D&amp;D's market share such as Darrington Press' <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/everything-darrington-press-has-announced-for-daggerheart-at-gencon-2025" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Daggerheart</em></a> and MCDM's <em>Draw Steel</em>.</p>
