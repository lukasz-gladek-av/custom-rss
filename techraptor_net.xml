            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/shadow-of-road-preview-different-take-on-japanese-history<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Shadow of the Road</em> is an upcoming tactical, turn-based RPG from Another Angle Games. Set in an alternate version of 19th-century Japan, you’re pitted against an Emperor who has embraced outside influences and aims to destroy the Shogunate. Interested in the blend of steampunk weaponry and myth, I took part in a gameplay presentation and hands-on preview of the alpha.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><em>Shadow of the Road Preview - Steampunk vs. Samurai Showdown</em></h2>

<p>You begin playing as two ronin in this traditional Japanese setting, where hints of steampunk weaponry from the West have invaded the land. That’s the overarching story of <em>Shadow of the Road</em>, Civil War. The Emperor has declared the end of the Shogun, using fierce weapons like flamethrowers to take out his enemies. The Shogun don't just lie down and die, however, as they recruit all warriors, even Ronin, to face the Emperor.</p>

<p>During the war, layers of personal missions, mystical experiences, and character developments impart additional tiers of narrative. Additionally, there are tie-ins with mythology, giving the title further story layers to discover. During your explorations, you can encounter yokai, who are both friendly and aggressive. While the spirits are based on Japanese lore, they are modified to fit the alternate world built by Another Angle Games.&nbsp;</p>

Medicinal items, like reishi mushrooms, are found throughout the land. These are important in keeping you alive in tough battles. Lootable items are marked with a pillar of falling blossoms making them easy to distinguish and collect. This is great for those who have issues picking out items in a realistic setting.</p>

<p>When it comes to the tactical part of&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Road</em>, I played through three different combat scenarios. The first is your basic tutorial combat. This mainly involves how to break an enemy’s concentration, destroy cover, attacks of opportunity, and shifting. I really enjoyed how the timeline displays turns for the whole battle, not just a single round.&nbsp;</p>

Even as a tutorial, you can lose the game if Akira or Satoru dies. Initially, I thought if one of them survived the game would continue. But I was wrong and soon the game over graphic was on my screen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The following combats were completely different, tactics-wise. In the second, you're tasked with protecting a young boy and fending off multiple waves of enemies. In the third, you face fire, a yokai, and exploding eyeballs. By the end of the battle, almost my whole field was an inferno. I drastically had to change how I moved my party to try and avoid getting burned, making the fight more drawn out than I would've liked. However, none of my units fell, and I was able to utilize some new ranged options I acquired in the skill tree.&nbsp;</p>

Not only do I want to learn more about how yokai appear and potentially partner with humans, but I also want to know more about these characters. How do the choices you make ultimately impact the story later on in the game?</p>

<p>These all have me wanting to fully explore the world of <em>Shadow of the Road</em>. I want to see how my choices change characters throughout the story. I want to see how yokai further alter combat and what they add to the traditional samurai combat experience.&nbsp;</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-october-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-to-october-2025.1144344/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-october-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Paradox and developer The Chinese Room have announced that&nbsp;<em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>has been delayed yet again. It's now set to come out later this year.</p>

<p>In a new development update trailer,&nbsp;<em>World of Darkness&nbsp;</em>executive VP Marco Behrmann reveals that&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>won't be meeting its previously-announced release window; the game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-yet-again" rel="nofollow">set to come out in the first half of this year</a>.</p>

<p>However, the two aforementioned studios believe that "ensuring great technical quality is more important than sticking to a specific date", and so they've admitted that&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>"will not be ready for release" before the fall.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-october-2025-shadows.jpg?itok=Lzb2Q_8V 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-october-2025-shadows.jpg?itok=a7cfqcn3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>has been delayed again. Who'd have thunk?</figcaption></figure><p>According to Behrmann, however, the game is "done", and The Chinese Room and Paradox are currently focusing on bug fixing and testing, placing&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>in a "late development stage".</p>

<p>The developer is apparently currently working to "ensure [<em>Bloodlines 2</em>] is stable and free of bugs that could disrupt the player experience", hopefully guaranteeing that the game "meets the technical quality standards that [fans] rightfully expect and deserve".</p>

<p>As such,&nbsp;<em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>will now be launching in October 2025, although Behrmann stopped short of announcing a new release date for the game. The wait goes on, it seems.</p>

<p>In case you're unfamiliar,&nbsp;<em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>has a very long and arduous development history. The game was first <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-announced-mitsoda-returning-as-writer" rel="nofollow">announced back in 2019</a>, at which point original game writer Brian Mitsoda was set to return.</p>




<p>After numerous delays, Mitsoda was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-kicks-out-narrative-designer-brian-mitsoda" rel="nofollow">removed from the project</a>, and its future was relatively uncertain until the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-back-developed-by-chinese-room" rel="nofollow">returned in late 2023</a>, now being developed by <i>Dear Esther&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<em>Everybody's Gone to the Rapture&nbsp;</em>studio The Chinese Room.</p>

<p>We can only hope that this new release window for&nbsp;<em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>is accurate, but given the game's long and storied history, I will believe that when I see it. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/geoguessr-steam-april</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/popular-guessing-game-geoguessr-comes-to-steam-in-april.1144296/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/geoguessr-steam-april<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Popular geographical guessing game&nbsp;<em>GeoGuessr&nbsp;</em>is making its way to Steam, so you'll soon be able to completely fail to guess where on earth a random muddy field is through Valve's platform.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://x.com/geoguessr/status/1904516547806150715" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, the game will be launching via Steam Early Access sometime in April, and the Early Access version will include both Solo Duels and Unranked Team Duels.</p>

<p>Playing Unranked Team Duels will be free, but the Solo Duels mode will require a&nbsp;<em>GeoGuessr&nbsp;</em>Steam Pass. If you've got a subscription on the browser version of the game, that won't translate to the Steam edition, so you'll have to fork out some more cash if you want to play Solo Duels on Steam.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/geoguessr-steam-guessing.jpg?itok=K37JT8aw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/geoguessr-steam-guessing.jpg?itok=UILe_i1s 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>GeoGuessr&nbsp;</em>is coming to Steam, but there are a few catches.</figcaption></figure><p>You won't be able to use your&nbsp;<em>GeoGuessr&nbsp;</em>browser account to play the game on Steam; it's technically a new game, so it'll require a new account as well, although it sounds like you'll just be able to use your regular Steam profile.</p>

<p>You will, however, be able to access crossplay between&nbsp;<em>GeoGuessr&nbsp;</em>on Steam and the browser version of the game, so even if your buddies aren't playing via Steam, you should still be able to play with (or against!) them.</p>

<p>If you do intend to play Solo Duels, you'll rise through the ranks gradually in order to prove yourself as a&nbsp;<em>GeoGuessr&nbsp;</em>champion. It promises to be exactly as addictive as the regular browser version of the game.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>GeoGuessr</em>, the clue is in the name; it's a game that shows you a random picture from somewhere around the world, and it's up to you to use context clues (or just wild guesses) to figure out where the picture might show.</p>
