            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With the original&nbsp;<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="cd8a1852-2307-4184-b0df-b9afab69154e" href="https://techraptor.net/games/outer-worlds" rel="nofollow"><em>The Outer Worlds</em></a>&nbsp;being one of my best friend's favorite games and as&nbsp;an RPG lover myself, I jumped at the chance to get my hands on the sequel through the preview. It was exactly what I thought I would experience, with whacky dialogue options, time-distorting technology, and brain damage. Here's what we learned in <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f7b9881c-df25-4849-881d-eafe092b40f7" href="https://techraptor.net/games/outer-worlds-2" rel="nofollow"><em>The</em><em>&nbsp;Outer Worlds 2</em></a>&nbsp;preview.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>A Taste of the World |&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>&nbsp;Preview</h2>

<p>The preview lasted about an hour and covered character creation and the first mission line. Overall, the story takes you to a colony not patrolled by the Earth&nbsp;Directorate, but under authoritarian control. There's still the silly humor present in the title, but taking out dictatorships remains the goal. You're able to play your way, NPCs recall previous dialogue choices, and actions you take directly impact how the mission plays out. I find this type of gameplay absolutely exhilarating.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

It also has a few inclusivity areas, mainly the ability to create characters with prosthetic limbs. This was great, the limbs are gorgeous, and I loved seeing disabled bodies represented in a popular title. Character Creation is the first important decision-making area of the game.</p>

<p>The focus here is on your skills and traits, which dictate how you interact with your crew and the colony of Arcadia. I played through the preview twice, picking different traits, choosing to get a negative trait, and selecting different skills to see how this impacts the game. My second time around was much smoother than the first with the inclusion of Lockpicking, a skill I find necessary to fully explore Arcadia.&nbsp;</p>

There are multiple choices you can make that determine whether you duke it out with enemies or go a stealthier route. The first time, I went with the combat-heavy choice, which resulted in me dying multiple times as I forgot to heal myself repeatedly. The second I became one with the shadows, a far better fit for my playstyle in this instance. Stealth kills are extremely satisfying, especially in a room full of enemies that previously gave me a hard time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, combat is straightforward, you have your main weapon, either ranged or melee, and support items like distraction devices or grenades. You can heal during combat, but it takes a moment and you can die while trying to get your health up. When it comes to stealth, there are multiple bars showing how exposed to enemies you are, really allowing you to take risks while avoiding detection. If you're creative enough, you can turn Arcadia's own defense turrets on the guards or have the mechs turn on their owners.&nbsp;</p>

Secret item stashes are littered throughout, making the Observant option highly prized if you want to find everything. Otherwise, exploring the colony comes with the regular items for healing, ammo, additional weapons, and support items. Since the preview is centered around a single well-designed location in Arcadia, it's hard to say when the different areas of the colony will feel like and how well their theme is executed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Without spoiling the ending of the first mission, it's safe to say it's a cliffhanger that exits with a bang, literally. There are multiple explosions during the brief time I experienced Arcadia, but they really left an impression. I absolutely need to know what happens after the preview content ended.&nbsp;</p>

The story is well thought out with background information feeding into the main quests seamlessly. Depending on your choices, dialogue with the NPCs changes, giving you a unique experience based on your actions, skills, and traits.&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2&nbsp;</em>preview really lived up to my expectations in all ways except the length of the available content.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Left Us Wanting More</h2>

<p>While I was able to play through character creation and the first mission line multiple times, I was left wanting more content. The preview was relatively short. Some gameplay items were left out, like having a Pet or working with a Companion. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, though. I will 100% be playing when The Outer Worlds 2 releases at the end of October. I need to know what happens in Arcadia, why a massive explosion was required, and how I can save the world.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Bossa Studios and publisher Humble Games have announced when you can expect the 1.0 release of skybound survival game&nbsp;<em>Lost Skies</em>, and it's just around the corner.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Lost Skies&nbsp;</em>1.0 will be arriving on September 17th, having launched in Early Access earlier this year. That feels to me like a surprisingly short amount of time for a game to stay in Early Access these days.</p>

<p>Bossa says that&nbsp;<em>Lost Skies&nbsp;</em>is essentially an attempt to create a spiritual successor to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/creators-of-surgeon-simulator-release-new-mmo-worlds-adrift-may-17" rel="nofollow">2017's&nbsp;<em>Worlds Adrift</em></a>, which, as the studio notes, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bossa-studios-worlds-adrift-is-shutting-down-this-summer" rel="nofollow">"ultimately did not reach a 1.0 release"</a>. Still, Bossa says&nbsp;<em>Lost Skies&nbsp;</em>"rebuild[s] upon the strong groundwork" left behind in the former's wake.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lost-skies-1.0-release-date-flying.jpg?itok=NI6XSdAi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lost-skies-1.0-release-date-flying.jpg?itok=LpssuubO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Lost Skies&nbsp;</em>is leaving Early Access in September.</figcaption></figure><p>The studio goes on to say that it's looking to "elevate the elements players loved from&nbsp;<em>Worlds Adrift</em>" in&nbsp;<em>Lost Skies</em>, and there doesn't appear to be any kind of intentional pun in there, which feels like a missed opportunity to me.</p>

<p>In any case, if you played&nbsp;<em>Worlds Adrift&nbsp;</em>and want to know what you can expect from&nbsp;<em>Lost Skies</em>, Bossa says that elements like "exploring hundreds of floating islands" and building unique skyships from rare materials and parts are very much part of the experience.</p>

<p>You can also expect to confront "some huge sky filling bosses", according to Bossa's Luke Williams. He says the studio has spent the last three years of development working closely alongside the community to ensure&nbsp;<em>Lost Skies&nbsp;</em>is everything it could be.</p>

<p>If you want to get a sense for what&nbsp;<em>Lost Skies&nbsp;</em>is like, then you can check out the official 1.0 release date trailer, courtesy of Humble Games, right here.</p>




<p><em>Lost Skies&nbsp;</em>1.0 launches on September 17th, but if you want to play it before then, you can do so right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1931180/Lost_Skies/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-update-162</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gran-turismo-7-update-1-62-brings-a-brand-new-corvette-and-more.1281951/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and Polyphony Digital have revealed&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>Update 1.62, and in the racing sim's latest update, you can drive a brand new Corvette, plus three more exciting new vehicles.</p>

<p>August's&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>update <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-update-161" rel="nofollow">follows on from July's</a>, in which a very rare car was added to the roster to give you a once-in-a-lifetime driving experience (virtually, of course). This update doesn't have anything quite so rare, but it does have a brand new hypercar that "offers a glimpse into the future of the Corvette".</p>

<p>The '25 Chevrolet Corvette CX Concept is an all-electric vehicle with a very sleek design and over 2,000hp, and it's available for you to check out in&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>Update 1.62.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gran-turismo-7-update-1.62-chevrolet-corvette.jpg?itok=2vgdi28K 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gran-turismo-7-update-1.62-chevrolet-corvette.jpg?itok=ryMHjPFS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A brand new Chevrolet Corvette is waiting for you in&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>Update 1.62.</figcaption></figure><p>If this car isn't your bag, then there are three others included as part of this update. The first, the '26 Afeela 1, is described by Sony and Polyphony Digital as a car that will "challenge the concept of transportation", and it's the first production model following the introduction of the prototype at CES 2024.</p>

<p>Another new Chevrolet Corvette concept car, the CX.R Vision Gran Turismo, is available in Update 1.62 as well, but if your tastes skew a little more street-level, you can drive the '02 Renault Avantime 3.0 V6 24V, a more modest (but no less fascinating) car.</p>

<p>All of this, of course, comes alongside new Extra Menus, new World Circuit events, and a new featured Curation in Scapes in the form of Tokyo Bay. You can check out a trailer showing it all off right here.</p>




<p>This update arrives just after Sony introduced a brand new official&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/official-gran-turismo-7-car-database" rel="nofollow">car database</a>, which collects the hundreds of vehicles currently available in the game in one handy place for your perusal.</p>

<p><em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>Update 1.62 arrives today at 10pm Pacific (that's tomorrow at 1am Eastern or around 6am GMT). The game is available right now on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/gran-turismo-7/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation consoles</a>.</p>
