            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-1886-announced-2027<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher 11 bit studios has announced&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk: 1886</em>, a remake of the original&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk&nbsp;</em>in Unreal Engine 5 (and, despite what the title suggests, nothing to do with&nbsp;<em>The Order: 1886</em>).</p>

<p>In an announcement <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3645160/view/545607485799530656" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Steam, 11 bit says the aim with&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk: 1886&nbsp;</em>is to "recreate the experience of the original game in [Unreal Engine 5]", and that the project is part of an effort to "further expand upon&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk</em>" away from the original game's now-defunct Liquid Engine.</p>

<p>This is almost certainly the new&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk&nbsp;</em>game to which 11 bit referred in its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-frostpunk-game-2027-11-bit-studios" rel="nofollow">most recent financial summary</a>; the studio already confirmed a 2027 release for that project, so unless there's another one in the works for the same year, it's most probably&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk: 1886</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/frostpunk-1886-remake-original-game-city-view.jpg?itok=R2Vt-VH2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/frostpunk-1886-remake-original-game-city-view.jpg?itok=jiUQUZya 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Frostpunk: 1886&nbsp;</em>aims to reimagine the original (pictured here) with new visuals and gameplay mechanics.</figcaption></figure><p>According to 11 bit,&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk: 1886&nbsp;</em>will feature "improved visuals, higher resolution, and all the other possibilities Unreal has to offer", serving as a "great introduction to the world of&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk</em>" but also the perfect game for "die-hard fans".</p>

<p>However, the project won't just be a rebuilt version of&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk</em>. Instead, it'll feature "tons of new content, new mechanics, new events, technologies, and buildings", as well as a totally new path, Purpose, to go alongside Faith and Order.</p>

<p>In addition,&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk: 1886&nbsp;</em>will support expansion via DLC in future, as well as official modding support, which is something that's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-2-modding-tool-at-launch" rel="nofollow">available for the second</a>&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk&nbsp;</em>but not for the first due to engine limitations.</p>

<p>You can check out the very brief teaser trailer for&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk: 1886&nbsp;</em>below. It doesn't give very much away, and it's really more of a mood piece than a full trailer, but hey, it might help you to get excited for the game.</p>




<p><em>Frostpunk: 1886&nbsp;</em>is due to land on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3645160/Frostpunk_1886/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> sometime in 2027. No console release has been announced yet.</p>
