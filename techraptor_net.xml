            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="224ada69-abcb-4bde-8ebc-1cd2a0b91343" href="https://techraptor.net/games/dying-light-2-stay-human" rel="nofollow"><em>Dying Light</em></a> series has always held a special place in the zombie genre. After all, it was one of the first, if not the first, to implement parkour and make it a vital part of surviving. Thankfully, <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> follows the same formula that fans have come to expect while building upon the game's overall story. Ahead of the game's launch, Tech Raptor was recently invited to a hands-on preview event where we got to play a little over four hours of the upcoming game.</p>

<p>Interestingly, <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> breaks the trend of playing as a new character. Instead, players are once again in the boots of Kyle Crane, the protagonist of the first <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ca6b8cd3-8473-4246-ba44-281fcce108ac" href="https://techraptor.net/games/dying-light-bad-blood" rel="nofollow"><em>Dying Light</em></a>. But things are a bit different this time around. Due to a series of experiments on him, Crane now has superhuman-like abilities called Beast Mode that allow him to murder anything around him easily. The only way to activate it was by building a bar that would only fill when you attacked someone. If timed right, Beast Mode can help out in the heat of battle.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dying-light_-the-beast-screenshot-10.jpg?itok=bNFrlgkd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dying-light_-the-beast-screenshot-10.jpg?itok=dXWvRq8O 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This takes Beast Mode to a whole new meaning.</figcaption></figure><p>My demo opened up with Crane running through the woods into a mansion. I noticed early on that The Beast does a great job of blending Urban environments with Nature. There'll be a lot of times where you'll find yourself running through the woods and have nothing to climb onto or jump on. This was a new direction to take the series because, in previous titles, you always had some kind of roof or ledge from which you could jump when needed.</p>

<p>At first, this may not sound like a good idea on paper, but it adds an extra layer of fear in the game. Because in many ways, you're now exposed, and it requires you to think quickly, if not, you run the risk of getting swarmed by a horde of zombies. To combat this, Techland introduced 4x4 trucks that you can drive in certain map regions. Admittedly, though I found myself avoiding cars because of how unreliable they can be, because of how it can get stuck in ditches or in a street filled with abandoned cars, running around proved to be the better method nine times out of ten.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dying-light_-the-beast-screenshot-12-1.jpg?itok=8Quo17_K 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dying-light_-the-beast-screenshot-12-1.jpg?itok=Kwz4tieN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nothing like the great outdoors... and zombies.</figcaption></figure><p>Once I entered the mansion and fought through a small group of zombies, I was immediately ambushed by a larger-than-life zombie called Chimera. These are essentially lab-created super zombies that are in Beast Mode 24/7.</p>

<p>Throughout my demo, I fought a small handful of Chimera, and each had its own unique fight. Despite that, they all shared a few common traits. Like Souls-like games, each boss has a second phase, and once you get to it, their moveset would drastically change, and throughout the fight, they would eventually call for backup, and you'd be forced to fight regular zombies while dealing with trying not to get killed by the boss.</p>

<p>As fun and engaging as these fights were, they all handicapped themselves because of how beefy the bosses were. A lot of the time, it felt as if my hits weren't doing too much damage, and this caused nearly all of the fights to drag on longer than I would have liked.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dying-light_-the-beast-screenshot-20.jpg?itok=WkYkA_tT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dying-light_-the-beast-screenshot-20.jpg?itok=U5poB19t 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>These zombies are about to catch these hands.</figcaption></figure><p>Another thing worth pointing out is some of the tropes implemented in <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em>. As I progressed through the story, I was eventually greeted by a woman who betrayed the game's main antagonist. The issue that stood out to me was that it followed an old 2000s trope of having an attractive blonde woman help this dark and broody man through the powers of science, because she couldn't defend or accomplish what she wanted to do herself. It felt odd then and odd now to see such dated clichés being played out again in 2025. But that's where a lot of my complaints begin and end.</p>

<p>Although many of the story beats I got were extremely limited to the small section I was playing, it offered an interesting twist. In short, Crane is looking to get revenge on the man who experimented on him, and to do this, he has to gain the trust of local survivors to ensure he'll have enough manpower to do so. But that wasn't the part that stood out to me. The Beast makes it clear that the big bad of this game is, by all accounts, a monster and someone who lost their humanity in hopes of gaining power. But to take him down, Crane has to become a monster himself, literally.</p>

<p>This is done by mixing his DNA with the dead Chimeras you kill along the way. This proposed a unique question: "How much of yourself can you sell, before you lose your humanity?" Obviously, this question wasn't answered in the few hours I played, but it left me wondering how the bigger picture would unfold.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dying-light_-the-beast-screenshot-16.jpg?itok=8TFALs55 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dying-light_-the-beast-screenshot-16.jpg?itok=gDJI6oDO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Am I a man... Or am I a monster?</figcaption></figure><p>One thing that caught me off guard was the improved combat system. Sure, shooting a bow and gun feels good, but at its core, <em>Dying Light</em> has always been a guerrilla survival game in the sense that just about anything can be a melee weapon. In <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em>, swinging a weapon around feels a lot more authentic. Seeing the difference in animations between lighting one-handed blades and two-handed hammers was something I appreciated, even more so when I found myself in tight environments, because this forced my character to use these in unique ways that still felt realistic.</p>

<p>In keeping things realistic, The Beast didn't shy away from the gore this time. As I was hacking and slashing through zombies, I immediately saw the effects my weapons were having. For example, every time I would hit a zombie in the face, I would see their flesh and skull open more and more with each hit. Or if I went for a gut attack, their intestines would come flying out.</p>

<p>The nice cherry on top of this was how precise arm attacks would be. I found myself testing how accurate it was. If I used a blade and swung at the hand only, the hand would fall off, but if I hit the elbow, then the bottom half of the arm would fall off. This nice attention to detail helps sell how grim and dark the world of <em>Dying Light</em> is.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dying-light_-the-beast-screenshot-08.jpg?itok=T6lGITMx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dying-light_-the-beast-screenshot-08.jpg?itok=jEQU-Zia 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hack and slash.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, some of <em>Dying Light's</em> core parts are the parkour and Day and Night systems. I'm happy to report that both are as fun and engaging as ever. Like the other Dyling Light games, the world still feels like a massive sandbox. This makes running from rooftop to rooftop even more fun because the game encourages you to run around and find hidden paths that make getting around much easier.</p>

<p>When night hits, the rules of the game are flipped once again. Although it's still possible to be aggressive and hunt down zombies, it's not the best idea. This is mainly because this is one of the only times Volatiles come out, and fighting them is never an easy task. But what's interesting is if you happen to get spotted by one, it'll create a unique sequence that lets you know how many Volatiles are actively trying to kill you. If you have a Volatile chasing you, more will appear, and the hunt for you will be even more challenging to survive.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dying-light_-the-beast-screenshot-17.jpg?itok=vx4QnnF2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dying-light_-the-beast-screenshot-17.jpg?itok=EzVAh6ey 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Can you survivethe night?</figcaption></figure><p>Overall, my time with <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> was fun. If you've played any of the games, you can pick up a controller and understand it almost instantly. Although it feels similar to the first two <em>Dying Light</em> games, it captures the charm of what makes them so enjoyable while improving many core features that help take the game in a new direction. <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> will be released on August 22 and will be playable on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Still Wakes the Deep&nbsp;</em>developer The Chinese Room has announced that it's splitting from parent company Sumo Group, following layoffs at the latter earlier this year.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/still-wakes-the-deep-studio-the-chinese-room-announces-management-buyout-gaining-independence-from-sumo-digital" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">IGN</a>, the British studio's management has bought the studio in order to make it independent. Prior to the buyout, The Chinese Room's future had been uncertain; in February, Sumo Group said it would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sumo-group-layoffs-refocus" rel="nofollow">focus more on "development services for partners"</a> rather than original work, although the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>would come under that heading.</p>

<p>The Chinese Room says that its sale to a third party was looking "increasingly likely" before the buyout, and that becoming independent will not only allow it to "work on new, original intellectual property", but also to "partner with other studios on other projects when they fit in with [the studio's] vision".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-the-chinese-room.jpg?itok=4nvtcGzZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-the-chinese-room.jpg?itok=19BVgUmW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Chinese Room is working on&nbsp;<em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>According to IGN's report, The Chinese Room is now working on two brand new IPs, but before those see the light of day, the studio will be releasing the long-awaited&nbsp;<em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>later this year.</p>

<p>Back in March, the game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-october-2025" rel="nofollow">once again delayed</a>, this time to October. It's been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-yet-again" rel="nofollow">delayed</a> a number of times <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-indefinitely" rel="nofollow">before</a>, but given that The Chinese Room was only announced as the game's developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-back-developed-by-chinese-room" rel="nofollow">back in September 2023</a>, it's entirely possible a lot of the earlier work on the game was thrown out when that development change happened.</p>

<p>In the interim, however, The Chinese Room hasn't been resting on its laurels. Earlier this year, the studio released a paid DLC pack for its narrative horror game&nbsp;<em>Still Wakes the Deep</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chinese-room-still-wakes-the-deep-release-date" rel="nofollow">released in June last year</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/how-28-days-later-stranger-things-and-pac-man-influenced-dying-light-beast</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-28-days-later-stranger-things-and-pac-man-influenced-dying-light-the-beast.1248728/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ahead of <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em>, TechRaptor was invited to a hands-on preview where we played the game for a handful of hours. On top of hacking and slashing the army of the dead, we also got to sit down and chat with Tymon Smektala, the franchise director for the <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="224ada69-abcb-4bde-8ebc-1cd2a0b91343" href="https://techraptor.net/games/dying-light-2-stay-human" rel="nofollow">Dying Light</a></em> series, about where the team draws inspiration from and where the series can go from here.</p>

<p>One of the most significant changes about <em>The Beast</em> in comparison to previous games is that a large portion of the game takes place in the woods, where there are few to no areas for players to use parkour to help them get out of a tricky situation. Smektala explains that they wanted to try this out and see if they could take the series to a new location and still feel authentic.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bober-the-beaver-screenshot-4.jpg?itok=cDiOMGjk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bober-the-beaver-screenshot-4.jpg?itok=h6cdHukz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Go and touch some grass.</figcaption></figure><p>"We wanted to see if we could have a <em>Dying Light</em> game where we could [occasionally] take away parkour. What we discovered is that it works very well for us because, in a way, parkour is a survival mechanic. You can use it to get away quickly. [Taking away parkour] even adds to the survival aspect because suddenly you feel more exposed and fragile against threats. It adds a lot of tension," Smektala said.</p>

<p>Many survival-horror games involve players running for their lives, but the latest installment of <em>Dying Light</em> introduces a new mechanic called "Beast Mode." In short, this makes you an unstoppable force of nature that can kill just about everything in your path. Smektala told TechRaptor that this was implemented so they could give players a fighting chance when they find themselves overwhelmed by zombies. The idea of having this second wind stemmed from an unlikely game… <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bcdf3e0e-b246-4766-a64d-4a145078a64f" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/shadow-labyrinth-preview-pax-east-2025" rel="nofollow">Pac-Man</a></em>.</p>

<p>"It's kind of the same setup. You feel very fragile because when the ghosts are chasing you, all they need to do is touch you, and you'll die. But when you grab the power pellet, that's when you turn the tables. [Beast Mode] is the same mechanic, and in <em>Pac-Man</em>, the uncertainty of not knowing if you'd reach the power pellet adds to the excitement like in <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em>," Smektala said.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dying-light_-the-beast-screenshot-10_0.jpg?itok=u7FiIdsl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dying-light_-the-beast-screenshot-10_0.jpg?itok=JYbWRXAz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Time to eat some Power Pellets.</figcaption></figure><p>As mentioned in our recent preview, a prominent theme of <em>The Beast</em> is the main character literally becoming a beast to stop someone who's metaphorically a beast. This idea largely stemmed from a Korean film called <em>Old Boy</em>.</p>

<p>The film explores similar themes and shares similar story beats of a person being captured for years, and once they escape, they set out to kill everyone who has wronged them. But <em>Old Boy</em> wasn't the only piece of media that helped inspire <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em>. Smektala went on to cite shows such as <em>Twin Peaks</em> and <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e5de03d1-d8cd-419d-8918-561c018bd3c0" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interview/liches-vecna-and-stranger-things-our-time-with-chris-perkins" rel="nofollow">Stranger Things</a> </em>as also playing a huge role in setting the narrative location for the upcoming game.</p>

<p>"Both take place in those little towns, where they are [cut off from] the outside world, and the outside world doesn't matter," he said. "It all happens within this town, and a lot of very weird and strange things transpire."</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dying-light_-the-beast-screenshot-14.jpg?itok=wB3qR7F1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dying-light_-the-beast-screenshot-14.jpg?itok=V-NPwWbJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Parkour!</figcaption></figure><p>Zombie fans may quickly notice how much the game draws inspiration from the <em>28 </em>movie trilogy. This can be seen in the music, scenery, and chases players encounter. When asked if the team used the movie series as a point of reference, Smektala said that Techland views <em>Dying Light</em> as "[one of the] top games in the zombie genre." But the <em>28 </em>series has been a big inspiration for Techland, and he discussed how both series have gone down similar paths.</p>

<p>"All of those movies try to do something different. If you compare <em>28 Days Later </em>and <em>28 Weeks Later</em>, they are completely different movies. Again, <em>28 Years Later</em> is very different when compared to the first two," Smektala said. "What happens in those movies is very similar to what we are doing with <em>Dying Light</em>. <em>28 Days Later</em> was a very intimate movie with mostly one character in a very empty space, where he was feeling weak against zombies. This was a similar feeling to the early hours of <em>Dying Light 1</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dying-light_-the-beast-screenshot-05.jpg?itok=C5rC4OyL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dying-light_-the-beast-screenshot-05.jpg?itok=TrwvJAuc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Fight the dead, fear the living.</figcaption></figure><p>"When you look at <em>28 Weeks Later</em>, it's much more focused on action. With people in big action sequences, people shooting guns, and a lot more blockbuster moments. This is the same with <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="224ada69-abcb-4bde-8ebc-1cd2a0b91343" href="https://techraptor.net/games/dying-light-2-stay-human" rel="nofollow">Dying Light 2 Stay Human</a></em>. This was our action game; it was focused on big moments. Now, <em>28 Years Later</em>, is a different story that is similar to <em>The Beast</em>, because it's very experimental in a way. A lot of weird things are happening in <em>28 Years Later</em>, as in <em>The Beast</em>."</p>

<p>Speaking of a lot of weird things happening, <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> introduces a new zombie variant called Chimeras. Smektala said that introducing a new zombie variant can always be difficult because they don't want to lean too far out of the world of realism. So the Chimeras came from the idea of "something that could have happened if you applied proper science to it." That's where a lot of the visual inspiration came into play.</p>

<p>"When it comes to the design of the Chimeras, two main sources of inspiration are anatomy books. The second one is an anime series called <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fa17d54b-1887-4176-82c7-9f626553cc5f" href="https://techraptor.net/games/attack-on-titan-2" rel="nofollow">Attack on Titan</a></em>, which has those types of monsters that are skinless with all of their bodies exposed. That informed the visual designs for the Chimera," he said.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dying-light_-the-beast-screenshot-20_0.jpg?itok=v88fsavZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dying-light_-the-beast-screenshot-20_0.jpg?itok=_rNtwCqj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Chimera or Titan?</figcaption></figure><p>One final piece of information that long-time franchise fans may be excited to hear is that <em>The Beast</em> is supposed to set the canon for the franchise going forward, and it takes place after the first two installments. This is notable because every <em>Dying Light</em> game has multiple endings, and it's left up to the player to decide what ending they want. But according to Smektala, <em>The Beast</em> will have one ending because the team wanted "to set the canon for the universe."</p>

<p>Smektala even teased that The Beast's ending will "answer several questions from both the first and second game." <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> will release on August 22 and will be playable on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
