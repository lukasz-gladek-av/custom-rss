            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I got a taste of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d21d65a5-4b5d-4746-8132-7a248cc992b2" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/deadpool-vr-pushes-vr-automotion-while-creating-fun-and-frantic-experience" rel="nofollow"><em>Deadpool VR</em> earlier this year at Summer Game Fest</a>, and I was blown away. I'm no stranger to VR, but the kinds of rhythm games and small tech demos that I was used to when I first got my Vive ~10 years ago were a far cry from the improved movement, responsive controls, and entertaining plot as you shoot and slash your way through the Helicarrier as Deadpool. Having played it now for an additional 10 hours, does it still retain that charm?</p>

<p>In <em>Deadpool VR</em>, you take up the mantle of the Merc with a Mouth, this time voiced by Neil Patrick Harris. As Deadpool, you're initially hired to infiltrate a S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier whose operation has been taken over by Flag Smasher. Making your way through the corridors, you're taught how to be the best mercenary you can while building a witty rapport with the different characters that are talking to you over voice comms.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/deadpool-vr-review-flagsmasher.jpg?itok=Vl4UdWrI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/deadpool-vr-review-flagsmasher.jpg?itok=glSOvE2x 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Be prepared to be a head on the ground a number of times</figcaption></figure><p>Near the conclusion of your battle with Flag Smasher, the true plot of the game is revealed as you're yanked through space and time and deposited into the lobby of Mojo TV. Here, you're hired (forced) to work for Mojo, building up ratings for his hyper-violent survival TV show by going out to recruit other contestants from across the Marvel multiverse. Characters include Lady Deathstroke, Omega Red, and Ultimo.</p>

<p>As you'd expect from anything Deadpool, the game is filled to the brim with crass jokes, witty one-liners, and fourth wall breaks. You'll get to hear Deadpool call himself Marvel Jesus, joke about a variety of inappropriate sex acts, and wish absurd violence on anyone who crosses his path. Honestly, there are not a lot of actors that I feel could get away with this level of crude verbal diarrhea, but Neil Patrick Harris absolutely nails the delivery of every line.</p>

<p>The only places that I really felt like the storyline could have been sped up or made a bit more snappy would be in the stand-still cutscenes. If a cutscene is playing on my TV with a traditional video game, I can just relax and watch. In VR, you're just awkwardly stuck there, standing still and waiting to get back to the action. A bit of walking and talking could have certainly tightened up aspects of the game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/deadpool-vr-review-one-piece.jpg?itok=od892gYl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/deadpool-vr-review-one-piece.jpg?itok=knnqdBXp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I'm always down for a One Piece joke, I just wish I could be doing something more than standing here...</figcaption></figure><p>The repeated combat dialogue is really the only place that Deadpool's chattering got a bit frustrating, but there's only so many times you can hear Deadpool make a decapitation quip before you begin to roll your eyes.</p>

<p>Overall, I was impressed with the story, it wasn't some grand epic, but it was a good way to pair Deadpool up with another interdimensional character like Mojo and give a good reason to drop Deadpool into a variety of unique settings like Ninja Temple or The Moon.</p>

<h2>Precise Shooting, But Flailing Sword Swings</h2>

<p>At its core, <em>Deadpool VR</em> is a hack-and-slash where you'll start in Mojo's hub world, pick a different stage to make your way through different themed rooms and corridors as you defeat a variety of nameless henchmen before taking on their boss to recruit (kidnap) them for Mojo TV.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/deadpool-vr-review-prologue-gameplay.jpg?itok=zYBNJ-8a 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/deadpool-vr-review-prologue-gameplay.jpg?itok=oMn4gfgr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Your base loadout includes two pistols that are strapped to your digital thighs, swords strapped to your back that you can grab over your shoulder, and a grapple gun in the small of your back. For the moments you needed it, a grenade is also strapped to your left forearm.</p>

<p>I absolutely loved the way you accessed your inventory. As you're making your way through frantic waves of enemies or platforming challenges, each weapon having a unique point to draw from minimizes interaction issues and creates less of a gap between the player and Deadpool. There are no finicky menus to worry about or selecting from multitudes of weapons, just a quick reach or drop of a weapon to be ready to continue attacking.</p>

<p>The guns, and by extension other ranged weapons like Playing Cards or Bows, are a lot of fun to play with. The swords are a bit more frantic to use. With somewhat floaty movement, trying to stay in melee range with an enemy can be a bit difficult. You'll quickly find that the most effective way to use these swords is just by flailing your arms around while running in a circle.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Deadpool VR</em> does a lot to make you feel cool while playing, but swordplay is not one of those times.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can temporarily get your hands on more powerful weapons by defeating the enemies that wield them in battle. These weapons are more powerful, like shotguns or SMGs, but they have limited ammunition.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/deadpool-vr-review-melee-combat.jpg?itok=KLuHY54b 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/deadpool-vr-review-melee-combat.jpg?itok=BR8WQlcs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Waggling my hands like my life depends on it</figcaption></figure><p>This can prompt you to quickly move through them, trying to maximize killing enemies and continuously swapping out your weapons, but they can also be reloaded by throwing them and having them ricochet off enemies.</p>

<p>This interaction creates a unique opportunity to link together combos while mowing through enemies. You might be sprinting forward, shooting at an enemy, and finish them off by bouncing a shotgun off their face, before taking it back into your hand, starting on the next enemy.</p>

<p>There are some fantastic object interactions that you'll get to experience by experimenting with weapons. One of my favorites in Lady Deathstroke's levels is that after defeating a ninja, they'll leave two floating kunai daggers. You can pick these up and use them yourself, or if you have your sword handy, you can slash at them to send them flying towards nearby enemies.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/deadpool-vr-review-bouncing-weapons.jpg?itok=1gAu_EVK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/deadpool-vr-review-bouncing-weapons.jpg?itok=UN2z9bNJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ricochet special weapons to reload them</figcaption></figure><p>There's a lot of help with magnetism that the game does to ensure a wild swing or thrown projectile hits it's target. You can tell the game is being nice to you, but you still feel like a badass while doing it, so I'll allow it.</p>

<p>The boss fights in <em>Deadpool VR</em> are, unfortunately, some of the weakest aspects. Each boss will sit back and take your gunfire or swordslashes while moving towards or away from you with a few very clearly telegraphed attacks.</p>

<p>There's an arcadey feel to fighting off the different waves of henchment enemies, trying to find the best line to completion or flashiest way to get the kills, but the boss fights are a bit more bullet sponger and basic.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/deadpool-vr-review-flag-smasher-qte.jpg?itok=HRAJP0Lb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/deadpool-vr-review-flag-smasher-qte.jpg?itok=1PSA4RHD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Press F to throw a katana into Flag Smasher</figcaption></figure><p>My favorite part of any of the boss fights was ironically the QTE moments, where a silhouette of a target or a sword position might show in your field of view. Here, the player gets to react in slow motion to more complicated combos. This reactive dance is one of the only times an enemy will really react to the different weapons you use.</p>

<h2>Upgrades And Replayability</h2>

<p>The weapons listed above aren't the only ones that you'll get access to as you progress through <em>Deadpool VR</em>. You aren't just trying to recruit new fighters to Mojo TV, but are also its star, as you'll gain viewers and earn money for killing competently.</p>

<p>More viewers mean more money, and more money means you can purchase a variety of upgrades.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/deadpool-vr-review-sword-upgrades_0.jpg?itok=_cZ9xUs8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/deadpool-vr-review-sword-upgrades_0.jpg?itok=2xkEAXyH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Doesn't change much gameplay wise, but it looks cooler</figcaption></figure><p>Gameplay upgrades include getting access to a variety of different weapons to augment your loadout. That might just mean that you get three grenades instead of one, or your guns are now a shiny new color. It can also mean you have different-bladed weapons or guns altogether.</p>

<p>On top of mechanical changes, there are also a variety of cosmetic options for Deadpool himself to pick from. Different themed outfits from Deadpools across the multiverse will unlock as you complete additional stages. After getting certain outfits, you can also return to different places in earlier stages that are themed to that character to open secret doors and get access to hidden content.</p>

<p>There is a lot of replayability that's built into this game, and a lot that I'm interested in checking out, but the length of the levels is also a bit of a detractor to this.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/deadpool-vr-review-collectibles.jpg?itok=eUtnL7HE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/deadpool-vr-review-collectibles.jpg?itok=vlcqa_9H 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Deadpool comics can be found hidden around the world</figcaption></figure><p>Even when I was playing the game at SGF and tried to scan my hand on a Lady Deadpool doorway in the Helicarier, only to be told you can access that in the full game, I was interested to see what's behind the door, but when getting to a secret door in a level might be a 20-30 minute endeavor it makes it a bit harder to push for.</p>

<p>I feel that if the game had broken up the different missions into smaller chunks with checkpoints to quickly hop to, or just had more levels that were shorter, this kind of replayability would feel more like a detour, instead of an additional adventure like it currently feels.</p>

<h2>The Look And Feel Of A Comic Book World</h2>

<p>One thing that I was truly blown away with, especially after only really interacting with PC VR and Mobile Phone VR, was how great a VR game looked on a standalone system.</p>

<p>Another thing helping this is the comic book style of the world, filled with rich and saturated colors and heavy outlines. Many of the characters and locations felt like they were pulled straight from the pages of a comic book or from a Saturday Morning Cartoon.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/deadpool-vr-review-combat-score.jpg?itok=7feGGDcB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/deadpool-vr-review-combat-score.jpg?itok=gj2ODJlZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>New high score!</figcaption></figure><h2>Marvel's <em>Deadpool VR</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Playing <em>Deadpool VR</em> at SGF I thoroughly enjoyed my time from the tight gameplay (maybe not so much the swordplay) to the witty and fast-paced dialogue. Having spent somewhere between 30-60 minutes on the game, I couldn't help but think as I was walking away, "Will this still be fun after 4-5 hours?"</p>

<p>I'm very happy to announce that it totally is.</p>

<p><em>Marvel's Deadpool VR</em> takes a pretty traditional level-based hack and slash and puts you in the middle of it. Leaning into some of the stranger aspects of the Marvel universe, like Mojo, this game delivers a Marvel experience filled with fast-paced combat and plenty of chuckles.</p>

<p>Melee combat is still something that needs to be worked on, but without a weight in your hand and resistance to swing against, I believe that's always going to be something near impossible to replicate.</p>

<p>If you have a Quest 3, this should be your next jaunt through Virtual Reality, whether it's on your own or something to share with friends and pass and play, trying for the most impressive kills.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Digital Sun has returned to deliver <em>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault</em>, the anticipated sequel to their 2018 action RPG roguelike, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/moonlighter" rel="nofollow"><em>Moonlighter</em></a>, which launches into Early Access for PC via Steam, PC Game Pass, and the Microsoft Store. The developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/moonlighter-2-early-access-release-date" rel="nofollow">intended to release <em>Moonlighter 2</em> on 23rd October 2025</a>; however, due to a plethora of great gaming releases that month, the developer moved its release to November.</p>

<p>According to the developer, the game is expected to release its full version for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/moonlighter-2-announced-2025" rel="nofollow">all platforms, including consoles</a>, at a date to be announced at a later time. But for the time being, we get to enjoy our time as a relic shopkeeper named Will, who has to make his way in a distant village and earn coin to his name while uncovering secrets about an ancient artifact that appeared in Tresna.</p>

<h2>All Hands Back On Deck At The Moonlighter</h2>

<p>Players who have yet to be introduced to the <em>Moonlighter</em> series, the first game took place in Rynoka, where they followed a young orphaned boy, Will, who set off on an adventure by exploring various dungeons located near his home. Exploring these dungeons allowed Will to acquire relics of different rarities, which he brought back to his family shop called the Moonlighter; however, one such discovery was a corpse with a peculiar note suggesting that there are four keys to be acquired from four guardians.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/moonlighter-2-endless-vault-screenshot-962.jpg?itok=ze3hfCnm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/moonlighter-2-endless-vault-screenshot-962.jpg?itok=s8S90mO2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Don't worry if you haven't played Moonlighter as the opening scene for Moonlighter 2 recounts the events from the first game!&nbsp;(Picture: Digital Sun / Ashleigh Klein)</em></figcaption></figure><p>After collecting those keys, unlocking the final dungeon, discovering interdimensional shenanigans, and encountering a government organization, Will returns home with the news of no longer being able to explore these dungeons again. This is where the sequel, <em>The Endless Vault,</em> picks up the story as Will finds himself in a new location, the vibrant village of Tresna, with new and familiar allies to be acquainted with and dungeons to explore.</p>

<p>As for the story, well, Will and a few other villagers have found themselves stranded in Tresna due to ongoing events in Rynoka, which are preventing them from returning home, and Will can learn more about them by accepting quests and progressing with the game itself! But as we're starting over with no coin to our name, it's back to business as we must discover and clear dungeons to seek our priceless relics to sell in our little shop (yes, The Moonlighter shop is back)!</p>

<p>Aside from exploring and clearing dungeons, finding precious treasures, and selling them in their shop, Will will be given opportunities to upgrade his weapons, armor, and perks, and acquire stunning pieces of furniture and decor items for the shop. Then there's the mysterious appearance of an ancient artifact, known only as The Endless Vault, providing a unique set of challenges and rewards for Will to take on.</p>

<p>Progress through the game in its opening hours to learn that it provides Will with a series of challenges, and after meeting its requirements, it will offer a reward and continue with these challenges for higher rewards. This reward will be valuable, especially as it can help boost the town's prosperity through upgrades that not only increase the town's morale but also enhance the wealth to be shared among the villagers.</p>

<h2>Battling Upon The Heat Of The Dungeons</h2>

<p>Once again, we'll remind players that the game is launching in Early Access, so technical issues, bugs, and glitches are to be expected during this period, as the developer will continue working on the game right up until its eventual full release. Nevertheless, in terms of gameplay, there aren't many differences between <em>Moonlighter</em> and <em>Moonlighter 2</em>; however, both games stand out in offering unique and refreshing takes on the action RPG roguelike genre.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/moonlighter-2-endless-vault-screenshot-946.jpg?itok=1lC-ohLW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/moonlighter-2-endless-vault-screenshot-946.jpg?itok=6VrPop9Z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Players (and Will) are sure to encounter some unique enemies and mini bosses during the dungeon run so be on the alert!&nbsp;(Picture: Digital Sun / Ashleigh Klein)</em></figcaption></figure><p>At the heart of <em>Moonlighter 2</em> is the quest to seek out precious treasures and relics that are at the center of the gameplay loop, as players will be actively spending most of their time defeating rooms of enemies to obtain them. During our hands-on experience, we immediately knew that no two dungeon clears will ever be the same, as each time players step inside a dungeon, the layout will procedurally change.</p>

<p>Each layout will feature a combination of Uncommon and Rare chests, weapon perks, unique dungeon events, blacksmith upgrades, and plenty of Elite enemies, mini bosses, and the dungeon boss to encounter. This allowed us to spend as much time in the first dungeon to get accustomed to the controls and combat mechanics to master clearing rooms without taking as much damage as possible, learn every enemy attack, and, of course, acquire as many relics and other treasures returning to the shop and sell them to customers (more on that later).</p>

<p>When embarking on a new dungeon run, every room will be randomized, and once cleared, they can follow its predetermined route by selecting which room to explore and learn what lies ahead, indicated by a map legend provided. Every room will have unique traps that can assist players, like fly traps, to knock enemies into them by using their backpack or attacking plants&nbsp;that will fire projectiles at enemies for extra offense.</p>

<p>These new enemies are no pushovers either (as implied by our death count), as players will encounter a myriad of adorable and imposing enemies that will attempt to prevent players from reaching the treasure at the room's exit. Luckily, there are perks to acquire for their weapons and their combat skills by exploring the Perk Rooms, which grant them unique buffs and status effects to inflict, which, personally, we do love the Wound (bleed) effect on our sword and gun, which helped us clear enemies more efficiently in our runs.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/moonlighter-2-endless-vault-screenshot-963.jpg?itok=GWxOko6A 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/moonlighter-2-endless-vault-screenshot-963.jpg?itok=FSu-JLvD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>We sure do love a good Bleed build if you wish to inflict additional damage to enemies with the Wound status effect.&nbsp;(Picture: Digital Sun / Ashleigh Klein)</em></figcaption></figure><p>But do watch out, as the survivability will also be tested, as once the health has been depleted, players can opt to restart their dungeon run or return "home" to sell their acquired loot at the Moonlighter shop. Unlike the first game, players won't have to worry about losing their found relics and treasures should they fall in combat, as all items will lose some rarity stars, but also, armored relics will lose their shield too, a slight change from Moonlighter that players should be pleased about.</p>

<h2>Shop Til You Drop!</h2>

<p>Now, the game's perfect blend of shopkeeping and roguelike mechanics is what drew many players to the first game and will likely do the same for the sequel. The developers aimed at improving the formula by retaining most of what worked in <em>Moonlighter</em> and adjusted it for the sequel with the addition of new features to make the shopkeeping gameplay aspect more rewarding, like customization options, strategic decision-making through systems like resource management, and the aforementioned varied yet dynamic dungeon runs.</p>

<p>Yes, players can finally customize The Moonlighter shop after obtaining the K33PER bot, which offers various services to Will when interacting with the bot inside the shop. Players can rearrange the layout of display floor cases, place unique decor pieces that can improve the items' rarity or boost their pricing, change the wall and flooring, and more, as these options can be acquired by either finding recipes within the dungeons or spending Blob Vouchers by talking to Ms. Scratch.</p>

<p>Lastly, players will be able to gain temporary perks available at the cash register when making sales at The Moonlighter, and these can vary between gaining tips on top of sales, adding more rarity stars to their precious relics, or boosting Gold when making sales. Like with <em>Moonlighter</em>, players will get a feel for their customers when it comes to pricing their discovered treasures by adjusting the prices to see what appeases them before allowing them to leave as a satisfied customer with their desired item and a bargain, of course.</p>

<h2>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/moonlighter-2-endless-vault-screenshot-953.jpg?itok=sdd6A-Km 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/moonlighter-2-endless-vault-screenshot-953.jpg?itok=ZdVfL_6Q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Even during a dungeon run, there's always time for a quick splash in a healing pool.&nbsp;(Picture: Digital Sun / Ashleigh Klein)</em></figcaption></figure><p><em>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault</em> has a strong start to its Early Access launch based on what developer Digital Sun has produced for players. Over the course of this preview, we've found a rhythm of delving into dungeons to clear out enemies, discover recipes, and valuable crafting materials, but also pushing our limits on survivability on every run.</p>

<p>As mentioned before, no dungeon run is the same, as the procedural generation makes our time spent in the dungeon all that exciting but equally terrifying with the enemies we may or may not encounter. The perks available in these dungeons do help in defeating all more efficiently, but now and then, we experienced some technical errors, from input latency bugs to general performance issues, but it wasn't prolonged enough to drop us out of the game entirely.</p>

<p>Outside of exploring dungeons, we poured plenty of time into rearranging our shop layout, placing unique decor pieces to increase our sales and item rarity, which was a great change of pace, gameplay-wise, and the developers did a marvelous job of being able to strike a balance between dungeon crawling and shopkeeping.</p>

<p>With <em>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault</em> is still in development while in Early Access, we'll be pushing our limits as a merchant and combative hero as we have found a new roguelike experience since <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/blue-prince-review-i-finished-game-50-hours-ago-and-theres-still-puzzles-to-solve" rel="nofollow">Blue Prince</a> to put multiple hours into by meticulously working out our pricing guide and resource management, mastering enemy and boss attack patterns, and reaping the rewards of our successes.</p>
