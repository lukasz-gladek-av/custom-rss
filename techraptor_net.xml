            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-borderline-justice-warbond<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and developer Arrowhead Game Studios have announced a new&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Warbond by the name of Borderline Justice, and it's ready to dispense some of the titular frontier violence later this week.</p>

<p>Landing on March 30th (that's Thursday),&nbsp;Borderline Justice follows on from recent&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Warbonds like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-servants-of-freedom-warbond" rel="nofollow">Servants of Freedom</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-truth-enforcers-warbond" rel="nofollow">Truth Enforcers</a>, and it's packing a new primary and secondary weapon, a new explosive, and more.</p>

<p>First up, picking up this Warbond will grant you the chance to use the R-6 Deadeye, a lever-action hunting rifle that will carry a lower rate of fire but a deadly kick. It's perfect for single targets, but it might not serve you quite as well for crowds.</p>

It may not have a revolving chamber, but it sure does pack a punch.</p>

<p>The new TED-63 Dynamite explosive is also part of the Borderline Justice Warbond, and you can use it either to make yourself feel like an old-timey prospector or just to blow up a horde of bugs. It's up to you.</p>

<p>Of course, like all good cowboys, you can also utilize the LIFT-860 jetpack to put you above the action. Hey, it can't all be Wild West-themed, now can it? You can also look forward to two new sets of armor, both of which have the Gunslinger passive to give you better reload speed and reduced recoil on your secondary weapon.</p>




<p>Elsewhere in&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>news, back in January, the game's creative lead Johan Pilestedt announced that he would be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-johan-pilestedt-sabbatical" rel="nofollow">taking an extended break from work</a>. When Pilestedt returns, he says he'll be working on the new Arrowhead game.</p>

<p><em>Helldivers 2</em>'s Borderline Justice Warbond arrives on March 20th. The game is available right now for PC and PlayStation 5, and you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/helldivers-2-review-fighting-for-managed-democracy" rel="nofollow">check out our review here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-jason-blundell-new-playstation-studio<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>veteran Jason Blundell, who's worked on some of the series' biggest games, is now heading up a new studio for PlayStation by the name of Dark Outlaw Games.</p>

<p>This news was revealed in an interview with gaming journalist Jeff Gerstmann (via <a href="https://www.pcgamesinsider.biz/news/75045/call-of-duty-vet-blundell-helming-new-playstation-studio-dark-outlaw-games/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PCGamesInsider</a>), during which Blundell revealed that he's been "working away in the shadows" on a game that has yet to be announced.</p>

<p>Blundell goes on to say that it's a "privilege" to be able to work as part of a first-party Sony studio, although I'm pretty sure that some of Sony's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-shuts-down-two-studios-including-concord-creator" rel="nofollow">more recent casualties</a> might have something to say about that assessment.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-duty-black-ops-iiii-jason-blundell-firefight.jpg?itok=6K48jePQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/call-of-duty-black-ops-iiii-jason-blundell-firefight.jpg?itok=ptbBVLn6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Jason Blundell has worked on some of the biggest&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>games.</figcaption></figure><p>Blundell also acknowledges in the interview that Sony "doesn't set up first-party studios all the time" and says he's "excited" to be working on Dark Outlaw's debut project, although he doesn't reveal what that project is.</p>

<p>If Blundell's past experience is anything to go by, however, we can probably assume that it'll be a first-person shooter of some kind, and since he's a&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>veteran with experience working on the series' Zombies modes, Dark Outlaw's game could well have live service elements.</p>

<p>Whether or not that's a logical move for Sony remains to be seen; the company's most recent live service shooter experiment, last year's&nbsp;<em>Concord</em>, ended in disaster. The game was&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds" rel="nofollow">shut down in just two weeks</a> and its developer was subsequently shuttered for good.</p>

<p>This also won't be Blundell's first foray into development for PlayStation; after leaving Treyarch in 2018, he founded Deviation Games, which was working on a new IP for PlayStation. However, Blundell left in 2022, and the developer then&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deviation-games-is-shut-down-before-it-can-ship-a-game-in-its-partnership-with-playstation" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">closed its doors last year</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, it remains to be seen whether Vonderhaar's studio will join the procession of NetEase studios <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/worlds-untold-netease-pause-shutdown" rel="nofollow">losing their funding</a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-studio-shockingly-closed-by-netease-laying-off-everyone" rel="nofollow">laying off staff members</a>. Stay tuned for more.</p>
