            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-offline-worldwide-ios-apple-block<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic says that Apple has blocked the release of&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>on iOS in both the US and the European Union, meaning that nobody with an iPhone or an iPad in those territories can play the game on their devices right now.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1923293522234356169" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Epic says it can't release&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>on iPhone or iPad since Apple has "blocked [its] submission". As such, the game "will be offline worldwide until Apple unblocks it".</p>

<p><em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>is unavailable on both the native iOS App Store in the US and the Apple-specific Epic Games Store in the European Union, so until this mess gets sorted out, it looks like iPhone users won't be dropping into the First Order Base to get murdered within five seconds anytime soon.</p>

<p>Apple's most recent refusal to admit&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>to the store is the latest point in a very long legal battle, which began back in 2020 when Apple <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-apple-store-version-removed-for-violating-app-store-guidelines" rel="nofollow">first removed</a>&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>from the App Store over Epic <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-slashes-up-to-20-off-purchases-on-all-platforms" rel="nofollow">pointing players to its own payment system</a> via the game.</p>

<p>Recently, Apple was slapped with a&nbsp;€500 million fine by the European Commission, which also said that Apple must allow developers to point customers to third-party payment systems rather than using Apple's built-in system, for which the tech company gets a cut of payments.</p>

<p>However, it's worth noting that this decision doesn't necessarily mean Apple must admit&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>to its ecosystem; after all, since iOS is Apple's system, the Cupertino giant has the final say over what it allows onto the platform and what it doesn't allow.</p>




<p>There's no timeline as to when&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>will return to the iOS App Store (if, indeed, it ever does), but it seems as though the Android release of the game is unaffected by this battle, so if you're a mobile user, that might be your best bet for now.</p>

<p>Otherwise,&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>is available to play right now on...well, on pretty much everything.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/killer-instinct-gold-nintendo-switch-online<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced that&nbsp;<em>Killer Instinct Gold</em>, a classic fighting game from the Nintendo 64 days, is now available via Nintendo Switch Online's Expansion Pack service.</p>

<p>Rare's fighter is the latest N64 game to join the subscription service's lineup, following on from other classics like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ridge-racer-64-nintendo-switch-online" rel="nofollow"><em>Ridge Racer 64</em></a>, spooky action-adventure game&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-n64-halloween" rel="nofollow"><em>Shadow Man</em></a>, and cult classic&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-n64-april-2024" rel="nofollow"><em>Iggy's Reckin' Balls</em></a>, among others.</p>

<p>Unlike some Switch Online N64 releases, it doesn't look like&nbsp;<em>Killer Instinct Gold&nbsp;</em>will be packing any extra online features; it'll just be you against the computer, or a friend that's daring enough to test their might against your unbeatable Sabrewulf.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/killer-instinct-gold-nintendo-switch-online-glacius-combo.jpg?itok=p9hIQDCO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/killer-instinct-gold-nintendo-switch-online-glacius-combo.jpg?itok=OahyuexO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Relive the glory days of N64 fighters with&nbsp;<em>Killer Instinct Gold</em>&nbsp;on Nintendo Switch Online.</figcaption></figure><p>Originally released in 1996,&nbsp;<em>Killer Instinct Gold&nbsp;</em>is a port of the previously arcade-only game&nbsp;<em>Killer Instinct 2</em>. It features ten playable characters, three of whom (Kim Wu, Maya, and Tusk) are new additions to the roster.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, several characters from the original&nbsp;<em>Killer Instinct&nbsp;</em>haven't made it into&nbsp;<em>Killer Instinct Gold</em>'s roster, including Chief Thunder, Cinder, and Riptor. All of them would return for 2013's&nbsp;<em>Killer Instinct&nbsp;</em>reboot, however, as would every other character from the series up to that point.</p>

<p>Designed as a response to Midway's hugely popular&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat</em>,&nbsp;<em>Killer Instinct&nbsp;</em>features a focus on combo-based gameplay; the infamous "C-C-C-COMBO BREAKER" soundbite comes from the original 1994 release.</p>

<p><i>Killer Instinct Gold&nbsp;</i>largely carries across&nbsp;<em>Killer Instinct 2</em>'s gameplay and characters from the original arcade release, but it omits voiceovers and full-motion video sequences thanks to the memory limitations of the N64's cartridges.</p>




<p>To date, 2013's&nbsp;<em>Killer Instinct&nbsp;</em>remains the last game in the series, and since developer and custodian Iron Galaxy <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rumbleverse-and-killer-instct-studio-iron-galaxy-suffers-layoffs" rel="nofollow">suffered layoffs back in February</a>, I'm not sure another one is on the way anytime soon.</p>

<p>Still, you can content yourself with&nbsp;<em>Killer Instinct Gold</em>, which is available now as part of a Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack subscription. It'll also be playable on Nintendo Switch 2 when the console <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">launches on June 5th</a>.</p>
