            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Monte Cook Games has announced a new edition of their award-winning TTRPG system. Their new Cypher RPG system, which will provide a streamlined experience, complete with GM narrative and creative freedom, will be arriving via crowdfunding campaign.</p>

<h2>The New Cypher RPG System Announcement</h2>

<p>In an <a href="https://www.montecookgames.com/announcing-cyphers-new-evolved-edition/" rel="nofollow">official post</a> on Monte Cook Games' website, Charles Ryan explains the reasoning behind introducing the new Cypher RPG system.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cypher-rpg-rulebook-artwork.jpg?itok=Bl3pyJqO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cypher-rpg-rulebook-artwork.jpg?itok=vSTi3_MW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Ryan mentions that the Cypher system has been around for twelve years, garnering a passionate fanbase thanks to its accessible but rewarding gameplay system. He even mentions the game's malleability, bringing to life games like the far future fantasy of <em>Numenera</em>, the existential far fantasy of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/return-to-actuality-with-invisible-sun-electric-and-indigo-by-monte-cook-games" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Invisible Sun</em></a>, and the disturbing cosmic horror of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/magnus-archives-roleplaying-game-review-leitner-worthy" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>The Magnus Archives Roleplaying Game</em></a>.</p>

<p>But with all TTRPG systems, feedback from players has led to certain parts of the system being streamlined or changed. Certain changes or additions may have been featured in certain licensed products and are being grandfathered into this new system. Furthermore, a new edition allows a studio to reformat their core rules for readability and clarity.</p>

<p>Some of the changes coming to the new Cypher RPG system have been long requested. Damage will no longer drain the player character's different stat pools. An armor system is being introduced, granting players more defensive options. New, genre-specific character generation options will be available, and there will be a greater focus on subtle cyphers: the imperceptible aids players can call upon in times of crisis.</p>

<p>But the pillars of the Cypher RPG system will still in place. Characters are still created with a combo of a Type, Descriptor, and Focus. Tasks are still assigned in difficulty from 1-10 and can be eased with a mix of Effort, Assets, and Skills. Also, enemy statblocks will remain easily readable and quick to implement for GMs.</p>

<p>The new Cypher RPG system will be released as two books. The first is the Cypher Character Rulebook, which will contain rules for making characters in a wide variety of genres, including high-fantasy, space opera, cyberpunk, and post-apocalyptic future. The second book, the Cypher GM's Guide, will contain rules and aids to help GMs run the game.</p>

<p>Both of these books will be available through a crowdfunding campaign that will launch in late summer, with a retail release set for mid-2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s only been a handful of days since EA raised the curtain on <em>Battlefield 6 </em>and already it’s become abundantly clear: <em>Battlefield</em> is back.</p>

<p>And EA is here to celebrate it with all the exaggerated pomp and circumstance that comes with a homecoming such as this. It’s a return to form in many ways, building upon what worked before, but also trying new things that will help define <em>Battlefield</em>’s identity.</p>

<p>It’s also a chance for a fresh start, and a commitment to fans that branches out from the legacy multiplayer experience using the key pillars of classes, gunplay, vehicles, and destruction.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-6-soldiers.jpg?itok=sknvJ_hA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-6-soldiers.jpg?itok=9n46A7n7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>With that in mind, EA and the developers at Battlefield Studios set fit to put on a dazzling, hard-edge show, inviting us out to see <em>Battlefield 6</em>’s multiplayer mode in action in a studio setting. From the jump it’s just as loud and bombastic as ever, with many facets that are setting the stage for one of this year’s big first-person shooters when it launches on October 10.</p>

<p><em>Battlefield 6</em> is framed by the role of a soldier who finds themself in the midst of a war between NATO and a paramilitary organization known as PAX ARMATA. These fights take place in real-world locations and set the stage for various modes including Conquest, Breakthrough, Squad Deathmatch, and Domination.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-6-city.jpg?itok=d1J31W6L 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-6-city.jpg?itok=KPULzFKd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Core gameplay is important, but especially so when it comes to games that lean on multiplayer for their longevity. <em>Battlefield 6</em> aims to take the stage with one key focus: squads. And with squads comes classes, each with a specific role to play and the capacity to adapt to real-time situations.</p>

<p>These classes include Engineer, which can expertly take down enemy vehicles and boost allies', and can take reduced damage from explosives. The Engineer takes control of submachine guns and has improved hip-fire control.</p>

<p>Then there’s the Recon class, whose role focuses on intelligence and counterintelligence whilst being able to infiltrate and scout at a high degree. As the name suggests, they make use of sniper rifles and can stabilize aim for a longer period of time.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-6-single-soldier.jpg?itok=DO3p6aC4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-6-single-soldier.jpg?itok=NBh_hUx2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Support is the medic of the squad, offering up support by providing ammo, healing, and revival during combat. They use light machine guns and a supply bag that can heal allies when tossed out onto the field.</p>

<p>At the forefront of the group is the Assault class. They’re the frontline fighter, the leader meant to take the team to the enemy. They wield assault rifles, and can sprint and shift to weapons with a faster transition than is normal.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-6-squad.jpg?itok=nF2qmU3K 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-6-squad.jpg?itok=p_ppWb2P 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Each of these four classes are inserted into <em>Battlefield 6</em>’s main combat system, known as the Kinesthetic Combat System. This system is designed to give the player more control, heightening mobility and tactical options in a fight, while also evolving the <em>Battlefield</em> series with all-new features.</p>

<p>For example, players can drag and revive a member of their team, ensuring both are away from danger. Players can get creative and mount weapons, which allows for steadier aim and a decrease in gun recoil. Cover can be further exploited through peeking around corners without being exposed, and you can even roll during combat to limit fall damage and increase the chance of dodging some bullets.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-6-vehicle.jpg?itok=s5r7Pdaq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-6-vehicle.jpg?itok=UvDS3Gmj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Vehicles in <em>Battlefield 6</em> have been expanded as well, with the ability to hitch a ride and hang on to the back even if all available seats are taken.</p>

<p>The combat system is unique in that it works to give players reliable recoil patterns that will allow players to learn and adjust accordingly. This is something the team really focused on, and getting that feedback ahead of time really helped shaped the state of the game.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-6-soldiers-and-helicopters.jpg?itok=JR7jv-uM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-6-soldiers-and-helicopters.jpg?itok=3fhdf3za 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>And it wouldn’t be <em>Battlefield</em> without a big focus on destruction. <em>Battlefield 6</em> offers even bigger transformations to the environment, adding authentic damage that can be wielded to the player’s advantage. There’s some pretty creative solutions here too such as firing on a floor to take out enemies from above.</p>

<p>All of this extends to <em>Battlefield 6</em>’s nine maps, including a remake of <em>Battlefield 3</em>’s Operation Firestorm. Newcomers include Siege of Cairo, Iberian Offensive, Empire State, and Liberation Peak. Several maps that we didn’t see firsthand include Saints Quarter, Manhattan Bridge, New Sobek City, and Kundara Valley.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-6-nighttime-fight.jpg?itok=VMvmMffr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-6-nighttime-fight.jpg?itok=Mjlar03R 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Within the maps themselves, players can expect to spend most of their time in Combat Zones, or special configurations in the map that focus on quality of gameplay that can switch up depending on the mode. More specifically this means that while the maps remain similar, elements within them can change such as how something becomes destroyed or the location of specific objects.</p>

<p>These modes can be broken down rather simply. There’s Conquest, which involves a lot of vehicles like tanks and helicopters, and it’s up to players to control specific locations on the map. When a team’s resources hit zero, they lose the game.</p>

<p>Breakthrough divides the map into sections that players will have to fight for one at a time. These battles will continue until all sections are captured or respawns are depleted.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-6-tank.jpg?itok=NQrjdFL- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-6-tank.jpg?itok=iEJCdEED 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Rush involves defusing and arming explosive systems, and the match will end when all communications systems are destroyed or players run out of respawns. There’s also the classic Team Deathmatch, Squad Deathmatch, King of the Hill, Escalation, and Domination modes available.</p>

<p>The Portal feature returns to <em>Battlefield 6</em> with new tools including a spatial editor. Players will now have the ability to craft their own spaces and their work with the community.</p>

<p>While we didn’t get to experience that particular mode, we did spend some quality time with many of the aforementioned gameplay features, as well as each of the four combat classes. It’s a lot to take in, but so far promises made seem to be promises kept.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-6-soldier-charge.jpg?itok=qgHQNM1D 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-6-soldier-charge.jpg?itok=0XVKObGK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>Battlefield 6</em> already feels incredibly polished, and not just in visuals. While yes, the fidelity is there, the explosions are bigger than ever, and the audio tuned along with it, it’s the gunplay that feels familiar yet fresh and tightly tuned.</p>

<p>Things are chaotic, but the assigned roles give you a sense of purpose - you’re not simply running and shooting, there’s the potential for specific tactical actions, and as the developers stressed, a real learning experience.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Support class in particular feels like a star for the versatility added to a typical healer. Being able to drag and revive people means you’re not going to be stuck out in the open, and playing around with shields, healing items, and zapping enemies with a defibrillator means that there’s a level of creativity involved outside of shooting a gun. When things get tough, hanging out in one of the vehicles isn’t a bad play either.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-6-helicopter.jpg?itok=m2fJ6Phd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-6-helicopter.jpg?itok=tuBrdDpA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The different game modes are also all unique in their own way. It truly does feel like you’re doing different things on the same map. This is especially true in the close quarters locations like Cairo, which relies a lot on buildings and small spaces.</p>

<p>These few hours were only a taste of what’s to come in <em>Battlefield 6</em>. With promises of post-launch support and an open beta for fans beginning early next month, it’ll be worth seeing if everything we saw holds up on a larger scale. The setup is certainly there, so it's safe to say, at least tentatively, that <em>Battlefield</em> is back.</p>
