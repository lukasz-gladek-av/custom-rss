            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Erenshor</em>, described by developer and publisher Burgee Media as a "single-player simulated MMORPG", is getting a brand new update, and it's got a new class, a guild system, and more for you to try out.</p><p>As revealed in a press release, the game's new Rising Shadows update is coming on February 2nd. One of its main new features is the Reaver, a melee class that can fulfil tank, DPS, and utility roles thanks to its stance system. It's not dissimilar to <em>World of Warcraft</em>'s Death Knight.</p><p>You can also look forward to a guild system that lets you create and join guilds, which Burgee Media says will add "a new layer of identity and progression" to <em>Erenshor</em>'s simulated MMO world.</p><figure role="group">

<p>If you're more of a solitary type, then you can take solace in the new Reliquary, a player space that you can decorate and customize using "found, crafted, and quest-earned statues", as well as "shrines, buffs, and other objects".</p><p>You can also use the Reliquary as a basis for fast travel, storing portal runes within it so you can move between locations and your home base with ease. Not only that, but you can summon your in-game friends to your Reliquary, as well as hosting auction houses, shops, and banks.</p><p>The new update also introduces a host of SimPlayer improvements, making <em>Erenshor</em>'s inhabitants feel even more lifelike, as well as new GM entities that will request you follow in-game rules if you find yourself feeling a little roguish.</p><p>All of this is in addition to lots of quality-of-life improvements that should make your experience in <em>Erenshor </em>feel that much smoother. If you're feeling like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/fellowship-preview-familiar-yet-fresh-take-on-mmo-dungeons" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2c9e90e9-ffd4-4c64-91cc-0b15cda9f07b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Fellowship</em></a><em> </em>is just a little too crowded, this one might be for you.</p>
<p><em>Erenshor </em>is a "single-player MMORPG" that aims to recreate the feeling of a classic MMO, only without the online multiplayer component.</p><p>It does so through technology Burgee calls SimPlayers, which, despite what you might think, aren't based on LLMs; instead, they use "a mixture of state machines and decision trees" to simulate real MMO players convincingly.</p><p>In essence, Burgee's goal is to build a living, breathing environment full of the same sort of things you'd find in a regular MMO, namely cities full of NPCs (and "players"), dungeons, lore to discover, and more.</p><p>If you'd like to see how successful Burgee has been at replicating that experience, you can check out <em>Erenshor </em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2382520/Erenshor/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC via Steam Early Access</a>.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
