            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and Arrowhead Game Studios have revealed Into the Unjust, the next major&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>update, and it's time for you and your squad to take the fight to the mysterious Terminid Hive Worlds.</p>

<p>As revealed in a PlayStation Blog <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/26/helldivers-2-into-the-unjust-launches-september-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, Into the Unjust arrives on September 2nd, and its big new addition is the aforementioned Hive Worlds, where you'll find new Terminid dangers both above ground and beneath it.</p>

<p>When Into the Unjust lands, you'll be delving underground as part of its new missions, and while you're down there, you'll encounter new Terminid enemies. You'll also be unable to call in your Super Destroyer for support, so it's just you and your team against whatever horrors lurk in the tunnels.</p>

Once they're close enough, they'll emerge from the ground and launch a surprise attack.</p>

<p>You'll also be able to encounter new enemies like the Dragonroach, a flying enemy that zeroes in on you and spits bile at you once it spots you. As if&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>'s existing flying enemies weren't already annoying enough to deal with.</p>

<p>New mission types will be added as part of Into the Unjust, too; one has you escorting a mobile oil rig and defending it from Terminid attacks, for instance, while delving underground will see you tasked with destroying the Hive Lung to stop the ever-encroaching Gloom.</p>

<p>Following the release of&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-halo-3-odst-warbond" rel="nofollow">first Legendary Warbond</a>&nbsp;(which also happens to be a <em>Halo 3: ODST </em>crossover) today, a new Dust Devils Premium Warbond has also been announced.</p>

<p>It comes complete with new weapons, including the AR-2 Coyote assault rifle, the S-11 Speargun, and the MS-11 Solo Silo stratagem, as well as new armor, new capes, and plenty more. It's launching just two days after Into the Unjust on September 4th.</p>
