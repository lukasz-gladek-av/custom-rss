            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-tony-hawks-remasters-potentially-leaked-by-pro-skater<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Pro skater Tyshawn Jones may just have leaked the existence of a brand new collection of&nbsp;<em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater&nbsp;</em>remasters, if a recent radio interview is anything to go by.</p>

<p>Speaking to New York station Power 105.1FM (thanks, <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/02/skater-tyshawn-jones-claims-to-be-in-upcoming-tony-hawk-game-remaster" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gematsu</a>), Jones said he's "in a&nbsp;<em>Tony Hawk&nbsp;</em>coming out" and that "they got a new one they're remastering, so that's about to come out".</p>

<p>As a reminder, Activision hasn't announced any new&nbsp;<em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater&nbsp;</em>remasters, so if Jones is right and a new collection is imminent, he's gotten ahead of Activision in revealing its existence.</p>

<p>Of course, a lot has happened since then, and it's entirely possible that the plans have been revived. It's also possible that Jones did the work he did for those remasters way back when and that no further development has occurred since their cancellation.</p>

<p>Presumably, the potentially-upcoming collection would include&nbsp;<em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>4</em>, but Activision could decide to skip those games and head straight for&nbsp;<em>Tony Hawk's Underground</em>&nbsp;instead.</p>

<p>Doing so seems like a missed opportunity to me, though; these are popular games, after all, and the two PS2 installments before the series switched to&nbsp;<em>Underground&nbsp;</em>were pretty popular with the critics of their time.</p>

<p>Of course, the two games are arguably targeting different audiences;&nbsp;<em>Tony Hawk's&nbsp;</em>tends to aim for a general audience, while&nbsp;<em>Skate</em>&nbsp;has always seemed to be focused on the hardcore skater crowd.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what happens with regards to new&nbsp;<em>Tony Hawk's&nbsp;</em>remasters, but my&nbsp;<em>Tony Hawk's&nbsp;</em>nostalgia and I are certainly hoping Jones is on the money. Stay tuned for more.</p>
