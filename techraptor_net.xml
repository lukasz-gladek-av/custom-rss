            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-early-access-mixed-reviews-50k-players<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Players are starting to get their hands on the early access (as distinct from Early Access) release of&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7</em>, and while the numbers are pretty impressive even for an iconic franchise like this one, player impressions are decidedly mixed.</p>

<p>In case you need a refresher,&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7</em>'s early access period started today for those who bought either the Deluxe or Founders Edition of the game. This isn't an "Early Access" release; it's the full game, but some players are getting to check it out ahead of the full release <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-pc-specs" rel="nofollow">on February 11th</a>.</p>

<p>First, the good news for publisher 2K.&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7</em>'s early access launch has debuted to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1295660/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">over 55,000 players</a> on Steam at time of writing, which surely portends well for the full release of the game. I wouldn't be surprised if&nbsp;<em>Civ 7&nbsp;</em>smashed&nbsp;<em>Civ 6</em>'s 162,657 <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/289070/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">concurrent player record</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/civilization-7-early-access-mixed-reviews-city.jpg?itok=FGHaDJ2s 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/civilization-7-early-access-mixed-reviews-city.jpg?itok=pFGxgtT4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>has debuted in early access to high player numbers and mixed reviews.</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately for 2K, the picture painted by the game's Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1295660/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_VII/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reviews</a> is perhaps a more ambiguous one.</p>

<p>At time of writing,&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>has attracted a Mixed rating across 2,587 reviews, with just 41% of those reviews being positive. Admittedly, the figure represents less than 5% of the game's overall early access player base, but that's still not a great look.</p>

<p>Common complaints from players include criticisms aimed at the game's user interface, as well as accusations that the game feels <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/NDYEE/recommended/1295660/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">"unfinished"</a> and that game customization is <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/machine001/recommended/1295660/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">lacking</a>.</p>

<p>Even some positive reviewers express dissatisfaction with the UI; one <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198049076071/recommended/1295660/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reviewer says</a> the "pros...outweigh the cons" when it comes to&nbsp;<em>Civ 7</em>, but describes the user interface as "abysmal".</p>




<p><em>Civilization&nbsp;</em>has been through cycles similar to this before; players often criticize new installments of the series for making changes to previous versions, and reception gradually improves as updates and DLC packs get released.</p>

<p>Time will tell whether or not that's what's happening here. We'll probably learn more about what the overall player impression of&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>is when it launches in full on February 11th for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1295660/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_VII/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/sid-meier-s-civilization-vii/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-for-xbox-series-xs/9N23HJHSC6BL" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/2k-reportedly-fires-project-ethos-studio-head-after-underwhelming-reveal.1102053/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/2k-project-ethos-studio-head-fired-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>2K Games has reportedly fired Michael Condrey, the president of&nbsp;<em>Project Ethos&nbsp;</em>developer 31st Union, following what the publisher sees as a disappointing reveal for the game last year.</p>

<p>If you don't remember&nbsp;<em>Project Ethos</em>, I don't blame you. It's a roguelike hero shooter that was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/project-ethos-2k-roguelike-hero-shooter" rel="nofollow">announced by 2K back in October</a>, but it's been relatively quiet since then, and if this report is anything to go by, I guess we now know why.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://kotaku.com/michael-condrey-projet-ethos-31st-union-2k-games-1851756173" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Kotaku</a> (which cites "sources familiar with the studio"), Condrey was removed from his position as the studio head of 31st Union three days ago, but he'll remain as an advisor on the project, although what exactly that will entail is unclear.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/2k-games-project-ethos-shooting.jpg?itok=XceoEUKS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/2k-games-project-ethos-shooting.jpg?itok=uZqdKru4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Project Ethos&nbsp;</em>developer 31st Union's studio head has apparently been fired.</figcaption></figure><p>In a statement given to Kotaku, 2K commends Condrey's "dedication, passion, and work ethic", but says that he will be "transitioning his role in the short term to focus on advising on the future of&nbsp;<em>Project Ethos</em>".</p>

<p>The studio says it's still "very committed" to finding a "forward path" for&nbsp;<em>Project Ethos&nbsp;</em>"and the people and culture of the 31st Union studio", so it doesn't sound like the game will be canceled or the studio will be shut down, at least.</p>

<p>As Kotaku points out, however, Take-Two is set to announce its quarterly financial results later today, and it's entirely possible that the studio could make some kind of reference to&nbsp;<em>Project Ethos&nbsp;</em>and its future then.</p>

<p>Of course, at the moment, there's a much bigger prize in Take-Two's eyes, namely the impending release of&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-released-early-following-leak-coming-in-2025" rel="nofollow">still apparently set for this year</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/grand-theft-auto-6-take-two.jpg?itok=r9oyPo9u 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/grand-theft-auto-6-take-two.jpg?itok=r8qCJkT4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>'s release is still on the cards for 2025.</figcaption></figure><p>If 2K's parent company Take-Two does cancel&nbsp;<em>Project Ethos&nbsp;</em>and shut down 31st Union, it wouldn't be the first time the company has done something like that.</p>

<p>Although it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-denies-roll7-intercept-closure" rel="nofollow">denied doing so</a>, Take-Two reportedly closed down two of its subsidiaries, namely&nbsp;<em>OlliOlli World&nbsp;</em>developer Roll7 and&nbsp;<em>Kerbal Space Program 2&nbsp;</em>studio Intercept Games, last year.</p>

<p>Additionally, the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-private-division-sale" rel="nofollow">sold its indie label Private Division</a> to a then-undisclosed buyer in November, with that buyer subsequently reported to be a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-annapurna-staff-private-division-ips" rel="nofollow">company made up of ex-Annapurna Interactive staffers</a>&nbsp;following mass resignations at that company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/annapurna-interactive-staff-resign-after-company-spin-off-talks-fail" rel="nofollow">in September</a>.</p>

<p>At any rate, for now, at least,&nbsp;<em>Project Ethos&nbsp;</em>remains in development and 31st Union remains an active studio. We'll have to wait and see how long that lasts. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bandai-namco-staff-count-falls-by-100</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bandai-namco-staff-count-quietly-falls-by-over-100-in-less-than-a-year.1101951/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bandai-namco-staff-count-falls-by-100<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The staff count at&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>publisher Bandai Namco has fallen by over 100 in the last ten months, a new report has revealed.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/bandai-namco-studios-staff-silently-reduced-by-over-100-people-japan-pension-service-database-shows/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Automaton Media</a>, the Japanese online pension registry, which shows how many employees business have enrolled, shows a diminished number of staff in February when compared to April 2024.</p>

<p>Automaton says that the register showed Bandai Namco employed 1,294 people in April 2024, but that this number had fallen to 1,177 as of the last update, which took place on February 4th. That represents a drop of 117 people.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bandai-namco-staff-count-falls-unknown-9-awakening.jpg?itok=5yVeWH-J 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bandai-namco-staff-count-falls-unknown-9-awakening.jpg?itok=ogKop7Ra 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's fair to say not every recent Bandai Namco game has been a success.</figcaption></figure><p>Bandai Namco doesn't seem to have publicly announced these layoffs, although recently,&nbsp;<em>Unknown 9: Awakening&nbsp;</em>developer Reflector Entertainment, a subsidiary of Bandai Namco, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unknown-9-awakening-layoffs-cancellation-reflector" rel="nofollow">revealed it would lay off</a> an unknown (no pun intended) number of staff.</p>

<p>As Automaton points out, a Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-15/bandai-namco-begins-to-cut-headcount-after-culling-game-titles" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>&nbsp;in October alleged that Bandai Namco staff were essentially being coerced to leave the company voluntarily through the use of "oidashi beya", or "banishment rooms".</p>

<p>Employees were allegedly placed in these rooms with no real tasks to complete, effectively pressuring them into leaving the company and circumventing what Bloomberg calls "some of the world's strictest labor protection laws".</p>

<p>Bandai Namco itself denied those reports, and the reduction in headcount at the studio naturally doesn't provide any kind of evidence that oidashi beya were being used, but it does look like the studio underwent a fairly significant staff drop between April and February.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-bandai-namco.jpg?itok=CPbVS1Pf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-bandai-namco.jpg?itok=mYs-zAVA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bandai Namco is gearing up to release&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>this year.</figcaption></figure><p>It's also worth noting that since this staff reduction hasn't been officially announced, it might not even technically be correct to call them "layoffs", since some staff may have left voluntarily or retired.</p>

<p>This report also comes after Bandai Namco released its <a href="https://www.bandainamco.co.jp/files/ir/financialstatements/pdf/20250205_en_Result.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">financial statement</a> for the nine-month period between April and December 2024, which shows growth in both profit and sales for the company.</p>

<p>That boost is, according to Bandai Namco, attributable in part to things like the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-sales-5m" rel="nofollow">"massive success"</a> of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</em>, as well as strong sales for both&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-25-million" rel="nofollow">Elden Ring</a>&nbsp;</em>and its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-sales" rel="nofollow">DLC&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a>.</p>
