            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Krafton has announced that a new anti-cheat system will be making its way to&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>in the popular battle royale game's next major update.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://pubg.com/en/news/9001" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a>&nbsp;on the official&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>website, Krafton says the new system is designed to "directly detect abnormal behavior at the deepest layer of the operating system". The game already had kernel-level anti-cheat measures in place, but the new tool will offer "even more precise and effective protection", the studio says.</p>

<p>Essentially, it works as you'd expect kernel-level anti-cheat to work; once you boot up the game, the tool scans for abnormal code, and if it detects any illegal software being used, it'll boot the player using it from the game and ban them.</p>

<p>The studio also confirms that the new anti-cheat technology will only run while you're playing&nbsp;<em>PUBG</em>, and will immediately shut itself down once you exit the game. That feels like it should be fairly standard behavior for anti-cheat tools, but it's a nice reassurance all the same.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that you probably shouldn't use other anti-cheat solutions at the same time as this tool is running. Krafton says that doing so could cause "system conflicts or unexpected behavior", including "unexpected issues during launch or gameplay".</p>

<p>In future, Krafton says it intends to "advance [its] illegal software countermeasures by combining technological innovation with operational efficiency", so there's likely more anti-cheat stuff on the way, especially if this system proves to have flaws in day-to-day running.</p>

The studio also reported <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-record-breaking-financials-2024" rel="nofollow">record-breaking sales and profits</a> for its 2024-25 fiscal year back in February.</p>

<p>In terms of&nbsp;<em>PUBG</em>'s future, the game isn't just getting the aforementioned roadmap features; it'll also play host to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/payday-pubg-crossover-starbreeze-krafton" rel="nofollow">some kind of&nbsp;<em>Payday&nbsp;</em>crossover</a> courtesy of developer Starbreeze, and it'll also serve as a proving ground for Krafton's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-generative-ai-characters-pubg-inzoi" rel="nofollow">plans when it comes to generative AI</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA apparently turned down a&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>trilogy remaster pitched by BioWare, denying the series the same treatment that the publisher's original&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect&nbsp;</em>releases received a few years ago.</p>

<p>That's according to an interview between YouTuber MrMattyPlays and ex-BioWare producer Mark Darrah (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-trilogy-remaster-was-pitched-to-ea-but-they-basically-seem-to-be-against-free-money-says-series-veteran" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>), in which Darrah says that BioWare suggested remastered versions of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: Origins</em>,&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age II</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>, to be released as&nbsp;<em>The Champions Trilogy</em>.</p>

<p>According to Darrah, though, EA is "against remasters", and while he doesn't exactly know why, he wryly says it's because the publisher "basically seem[s] to be against free money". Given EA's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/buying-fifa-loot-boxes-is-fair-according-to-ea" rel="nofollow">championing of loot boxes</a> in the likes of&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC</em>, I'm not sure about that, but I see his point.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-age-inquisition-dragon-age-trilogy-remasters.jpg?itok=gJKeSX7J 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-age-inquisition-dragon-age-trilogy-remasters.jpg?itok=sqTO-EGS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Remasters of the first three&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>games were apparently pitched, but rejected by EA.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Darrah's interview, BioWare's resources were split between the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect 4&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, which was released last year to an initially positive but <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-ea-sports-fc-25-underperformed" rel="nofollow">eventually largely indifferent</a> reception. That's another reason no trilogy remasters were made, Darrah says.</p>

<p>There's also the fact that while all three&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect&nbsp;</em>games were made in Unreal Engine 3, all three&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>games constituting the series' original trilogy were made with different engines, so remastering them would have been a more difficult task. Still, I'm sure there was a way to get that work done, so it's a shame EA decided not to.</p>

<p>While the next&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect&nbsp;</em>game remains in active development (<a href="https://fextralife.com/bioware-clarifies-the-status-of-mass-effect-4/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">as far as we know</a>),&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age</em>'s future as a franchise looks to be a little more in doubt.&nbsp;<em>Veilguard&nbsp;</em>underperformed for EA, and CEO Andrew Wilson seemingly&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-the-veilguard-shared-world-elements" rel="nofollow">insinuated back in February</a> that the game's failure could be put down to its lack of "shared world elements".</p>

<p>Whether that means we'll get another&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>game with a more live-service bent, as&nbsp;<em>Veilguard&nbsp;</em>was meant to be, remains to be seen. Perhaps BioWare will be able to convince EA to make another game in the series, or maybe it will be shelved for the time being. Only time will tell.</p>




<p>For now, you can content yourself with the fact that the original&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>trilogy is still on sale on PC via Steam, and&nbsp;<em>The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>is also available now, although you may well find it an acquired taste if you're a huge fan of the originals (particularly&nbsp;<em>Origins</em>).</p>
