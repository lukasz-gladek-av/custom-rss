            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/4a-games-reburn-la-quimera<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Metro&nbsp;</em>series developer 4A Games has announced that it's changing its name, and that its next project will be a narrative-led first-person shooter based on an entirely original IP.</p>

<p>Per a press release, 4A Games' new name is Reburn, and it's currently hard at work on&nbsp;<em>La Quimera</em>, a game the studio describes as an "action-packed first-person shoter with a heavy focus on narrative, world design, and characters".</p>

<p>Unlike the&nbsp;<em>Metro&nbsp;</em>series' oppressive subterranean tunnels,&nbsp;<em>La Quimera&nbsp;</em>will take place in "a fictional Latin American megalopolis" and will revolve around a "down-on-their-luck PMC outfit".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/4a-games-reburn-la-quimera-aiming.jpg?itok=1KNYrj3i 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/4a-games-reburn-la-quimera-aiming.jpg?itok=ALSsfXh4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>La Quimera&nbsp;</em>is the next project from Reburn (formerly known as 4A Games).</figcaption></figure><p>Rather impressively, Reburn says it's working with filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn for the "world and narrative" of&nbsp;<em>La Quimera</em>. Refn is best known for movies like&nbsp;<em>Drive&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Neon Demon</em>, as well as 2008's prison drama&nbsp;<em>Bronson</em>.</p>

<p>The studio promises that the game's world will combine "Latin American folklore with highly advanced weaponry and technology", which, I suppose, is where the title comes from.</p>

<p>You'll be able to play&nbsp;<em>La Quimera&nbsp;</em>in single-player, but if you want to, you can also team up with up to two friends for three-player co-op. Seems a little strange to stop at three, but hey, if it's good enough for&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-2025" rel="nofollow"><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></a>, it's good enough for&nbsp;<em>La Quimera</em>, I guess.</p>

<p>Reburn says you can expect the same kind of "tense gunplay and intimate storytelling" you're familiar with from the&nbsp;<em>Metro&nbsp;</em>series, as well as "highly detailed environments, characters, and weapons".</p>




<p>It's likely that&nbsp;<em>La Quimera&nbsp;</em>is one of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/4a-games-zen-studios-embracer" rel="nofollow">two AAA titles</a> that 4A Games is apparently working on for its parent company Embracer Group, with the other presumably being the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metro-exodus-developers-still-working-on-next-game-despite-war-in-ukraine-sdk-released" rel="nofollow">next game in the&nbsp;<em>Metro&nbsp;</em>series</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Whatever the case may be,&nbsp;<em>La Quimera&nbsp;</em>is slated to arrive on PC via Steam, although it doesn't have a release date yet. No console version appears to be planned for now. Stay tuned for more.</p>

True to form, that's exactly what we got today, and here's everything that was announced during said showcase!</p>

<hr><h2>New episodes of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Concierge&nbsp;</em>are on the way</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-concierge-new-episodes-pokemon-presents-february-2025.jpg?itok=UJGGkGeW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-concierge-new-episodes-pokemon-presents-february-2025.jpg?itok=AngXE7QU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>New&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Concierge&nbsp;</em>episodes are coming in September.</figcaption></figure><p>To kick the show off, The Pokemon Company announced new episodes of the charming stop-motion animation&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Concierge</em>. They're set to air via Netflix in September, and you can watch the first four episodes of the show for free via YouTube from now until March 9th.</p>

<h2><em>Pokemon Go&nbsp;</em>Tour: Unova - Global coming this weekend</h2>

<p>Next up, we got a look at the next&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Go&nbsp;</em>Tour, which is happening this weekend. It'll see Black Kyurem and White Kyurem appearing in Raid Battles, and you'll also get the chance to get your hands on Victini and a shiny Meloetta.</p>

<h2>Mobile-focused&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>announcements are go</h2>

<p>Three mobile-focused&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>titles got updates next, namely&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Masters EX</em>,&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Cafe ReMix</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Sleep</em>.</p>

<p>In the former, Champion May and her shiny Primal Kyogre, as well as Champion Brendan and his shiny Primal Groudon, will be making an appearance.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Pokemon Cafe ReMix&nbsp;</em>is getting a new apple-themed menu item along with appearances from Flapple and Appletun, while a new Cresselia versus Darkrai event is coming to&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Sleep</em>.</p>

<h2>New&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Unite&nbsp;</em>fighters announced</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-unite-new-fighters-pokemon-presents-february-2025.jpg?itok=2Lo2DDvE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-unite-new-fighters-pokemon-presents-february-2025.jpg?itok=OrhC4s9w 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Three new fighters have been revealed for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Unite</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Three new Pokemon were announced for the MOBA&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Unite</em>. Suicune is coming to the game on March 1st, followed by Alolan Raichu in April and Alcremie later in the year.</p>

<p>What's more, the game will also see the return of the Remoat Stadium map, as well as a brand new mode called First to 500, which will reward you with unique battle effects when reaching certain point thresholds.</p>

<h2><em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>'s Triumphant Light set revealed</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-triumphant-light-pokemon-presents.jpg?itok=TO6J_eU9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-triumphant-light-pokemon-presents.jpg?itok=g_fQUaSE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A new set is coming to&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>tomorrow.</figcaption></figure><p>The next major expansion set for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>has been revealed in the form of Triumphant Light, and this one looks like it's themed around the deific Pokemon Arceus, which makes sense given that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-update-new-expansion-release-date" rel="nofollow">previous expansion Space-Time Smackdown</a> was built around Dialga and Palkia.</p>

<p>Cards include new Eevee, Magnemite, and Golbat variations, as well as a rather pretty Arceus ex card, a full-art Shaymin, and a pretty sweet-looking shiny Raichu. The set launches tomorrow.</p>

<h2><em>Pokemon TCG&nbsp;</em>is getting Mega Evolutions</h2>

<p>Mega Evolved Pokemon are coming to&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG</em>&nbsp;this year! The trailer showed off some snazzy-looking ex cards for Mega Lucario and Mega Gardevoir, but it didn't reveal a release date for the new feature.</p>

<h2><em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>is getting some fun stuff</h2>

<p>If you're still playing&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet</em>, you'll be pleased to know that you can grab yourself a nifty-looking Rotom Phone cover for each game. Simply input SB00KC0VER for&nbsp;<em>Scarlet&nbsp;</em>and VB00KC0VER for&nbsp;<em>Violet&nbsp;</em>(those are zeroes, not Os).</p>

<p>New Tera Raid Battles for Meowscarada, Skeledirge, and Quaquaval are also coming on February 28th, March 7th, and March 14th, respectively, with more (including Metagross, Garchomp, and Dragapult) on the way in the future.</p>

<h2><em>Pokemon Champions&nbsp;</em>brings battling to Switch and mobiles</h2>




<p>Next up, The Pokemon Company announced a new game called&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Champions</em>, a&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Stadium</em>-style game with an emphasis on battling.</p>

<p>The game will connect to&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Home</em>, allowing you to use 'mons you've teamed up with in your games to battle trainers around the world. This one's coming to Switch and mobile devices, although we don't know when yet.</p>

<h2><em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>coming "late 2025", new gameplay revealed</h2>




<p>Finally, we got to see some new info about&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-a-announced" rel="nofollow"><em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em></a>, and we now know roughly when to expect the game as well, although certain details still seem conspicuous by their absence.</p>

<p>The game will take place in a Lumiose City currently undergoing a "high-tech urban redevelopment plan" in order to "turn it into a city that people and Pokemon truly share".</p>

<p>It looks like the game will largely take place within the confines of the city, and you'll find Wild Zones inside Lumiose where Pokemon live. That's where you'll be doing the majority of your catching and battling, too.</p>

<p>During the trailer, The Pokemon Company introduced some of the fun characters you'll meet in&nbsp;<em>Legends: Z-A</em>, including two new friendly rivals, Urbain or Taunie, one of whom you'll meet (seemingly based on the gender you pick).</p>

<p>We also got a new look at combat in&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>, and it comes with a brand new feature in the form of areas of effect for moves; Rollout, for instance, hits in a straight line, while Rock Slide hits across a wide area. You'll have to dodge alongside your Pokemon to keep up.</p>

<p><em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>launches in late 2025 for Switch, but we didn't get a specific release date, nor did we learn whether the game will be coming to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">recently-revealed Nintendo Switch 2</a>. Ho hum.</p>

<hr><p>That's everything revealed during today's Pokemon Presents showcase! Stay tuned for more on all other things&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>-related.</p>
