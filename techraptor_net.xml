<p>Just as a reminder, when <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-gold-kojima-daruma-doll" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c0ed27a4-2f32-4cd5-b797-033e2ec3af80" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">a game "goes gold"</a>, it essentially means that the master copy of the game, i.e. the one from which all other copies will be created, is complete. In essence, it means that the game is ready to ship.</p><p><em>Crimson Desert </em>was first announced all the way back <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/11/26/black-desert-online-devs-announce-three-visually-impressive-new-games-including-plan-8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">in 2019</a>, with a trailer showing off gameplay for the title appearing at <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/live-game-awards-2020-announcements-and-news" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a982241a-bdbb-4ed6-918b-2b5ee8272e07" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">The Game Awards in 2020</a>.</p><p>Following that, however, in July 2021, Pearl Abyss delayed <em>Crimson Desert </em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crimson-desert-delayed" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="36cb0564-abf5-4116-8b3d-f6fc86269ba6" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">indefinitely</a>, citing the usual need to "create the best possible experience" upon the game's release.</p><p>Pearl Abyss continued working on the game in the years that followed, and after one last delay, a release date of March 19th was finally revealed. It now looks as though the studio will be able to keep to this latest release date.</p>
<p>Though <em>Crimson Desert </em>began life as a prequel to Pearl Abyss' <em>Black Desert Online</em>, it eventually morphed into a standalone adventure.</p><p>Taking place in the world of Pywel, <em>Crimson Desert </em>features an in-depth combat system with plenty of moves and tactical options to master, as well as a range of other activities including fishing, hunting, and cooking.</p><p>You'll be able to play <em>Crimson Desert </em>when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3321460/Crimson_Desert/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/crimson-desert/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/crimson-desert/9NG592G0W474" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a> on March 19th.

</figure>
<p>When <em>Enshrouded </em>1.0 does arrive, you can look forward to a host of new features and improvements, including a better new player experience, "greater tactical depth" and "smarter enemy behavior" in combat, and lots of new content, plus more.</p><p>In addition to sharing news of <em>Enshrouded </em>1.0's release window, Keen Games has also revealed some fun stats to commemorate the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/enshrouded-early-access-release-date" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2e65c442-f6c0-40ec-9a6b-7942672ca6a1" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">second anniversary</a> of the game (which is coming up in a couple of days), and players have been pretty busy enjoying the world of Embervale.</p><p>In total, <em>Enshrouded </em>players have spent 20,901 years playing the game (collectively, of course), and have destroyed 30 million shroud roots, placed 1.3 billion blocks of water, and farmed 1.3 billion plants.</p><p>The world of <em>Enshrouded </em>hasn't been content to rest on its laurels and let all of this happen, though; 420,402 players have drowned in the game, and 52.5 million deaths from fall damage have been registered as well. Be careful out there.</p>
<p>Additionally, <em>Enshrouded </em>has crossed the five million sales mark at last, so it's managed to pick up another million sales for itself <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/enshrouded-sales-4m-update-6" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b69a55bc-9269-4dab-bcb0-40f0e1796e5c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">since April last year</a>. I'm rooting for you, guys!</p><p><em>Enshrouded </em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1203620/Enshrouded/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC via Steam Early Access</a>, and it's coming to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S this fall. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
