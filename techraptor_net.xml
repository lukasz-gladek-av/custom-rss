            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-year-of-eevee-merchandise<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has designated 2025 as the "Year of Eevee", promising tons of Eevee-themed merchandise throughout the year including plushies, TCG sets, figurines, and much more.</p>

<p>Over on the UK version of the Pokemon Center <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/en-gb/year-of-eevee" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>&nbsp;(with the promo likely also on its way to the US website soon), the company promises "a year of Eevee products" as a gift for those who "love Eevee". Who doesn't?</p>

<p>The site goes on to say that "from plush to apparel,&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG&nbsp;</em>to figures, you won't be short on Eevee merch this year". True to its word, the site then spotlights a number of existing plushies, toys, and pins themed around Eevee and its evolutions (or Eeveelutions).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-center-year-of-eevee-listings.jpg?itok=qY6xd3Bn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-center-year-of-eevee-listings.jpg?itok=WoNLmx1t 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Year of Eevee is already well and truly underway on the Pokemon Center website.</figcaption></figure><p>Further down, the Pokemon Center site looks forward to Eevee merchandise that's coming later this year, including "a new series of beautifully-crafted Evolving Personalities figures" based on Eeveelutions.</p>

<p>They include the Splashes Vaporeon figure, the Skillful Strategy Jolteon figure, and the Satisfied Snooze Flareon figure, with several more based on the remaining Eeveelutions coming later on.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to a new kind of plushie that features "the most cozy, fleecy material", and as you've probably guessed, Eevee will be one of the options for that plushie, although you can also pick up Pikachu if you like.</p>

<p>All of this is, of course, in addition to the new <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-brings-eevee-and-its-many-forms-to-scarlet-violet" rel="nofollow"><em>Prismatic Evolutions&nbsp;</em>set</a> for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG</em>, which launches next week and revolves mainly around Eevee and its evolutions.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-center-year-of-eevee-prismatic-evolutions.jpg?itok=j7zmhfec 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-center-year-of-eevee-prismatic-evolutions.jpg?itok=1mYb5EEQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pokemon TCG</em>'s new&nbsp;<em>Prismatic Evolutions&nbsp;</em>set will be heavily themed around Eevee.</figcaption></figure><p>All of this Eevee-related excitement comes as speculation regarding the upcoming Nintendo Switch successor mounts. Nintendo has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation" rel="nofollow">promised an announcement</a> before April this year, so it's very possible the new console could be revealed this month.</p>

<p>In February, a new&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends&nbsp;</em>game in the form of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-a-announced" rel="nofollow">was revealed</a>, and we still don't have a concrete release date for that. Additionally, mainline&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games have been released every three years since 2013, so we could be due an announcement on that front soon as well.</p>

<p>All of this is to say that given that 2025 is now apparently the Year of Eevee, and given all of the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em> news we might reasonably expect this year, we could finally be in for a new Eeveelution being revealed soon. Let's hope so!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Valorant Agent Tejo Revealed for Season 2025 Act 1]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valorant-tejo-season-2025-act-1</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-valorant-agent-tejo-revealed-for-season-2025-act-1.1074864/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valorant-tejo-season-2025-act-1<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Riot Games has revealed a brand new&nbsp;<em>Valorant&nbsp;</em>Agent in the form of Tejo, an Initiator with a number of rather intriguing gadgets to his name.</p>

<p>Tejo will arrive alongside Season 2025 Act 1, which is set to debut in just a couple of days. He's a Colombian intelligence consultant with a "ballistic guidance system" that both helps his allies to identify their foes and deals direct damage into the bargain.</p>

<p>First up, Tejo's Special Delivery ability fires a sticky grenade onto the first surface it hits, exploding and Concussing targets caught up in its blast radius. You can also launch the grenade with just one bounce using the alt fire key.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/valorant-new-agent-tejo-special-delivery.jpg?itok=HhmTWk0d 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/valorant-new-agent-tejo-special-delivery.jpg?itok=VmWEB5g0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Tejo is&nbsp;<em>Valorant</em>'s latest Initiator Agent.</figcaption></figure><p>Stealth Drone, meanwhile, allows Tejo to control a drone as it reveals the enemies its pulse hits, as well as Suppressing them. Finally, the Guided Salvo ability hits up to two locations on the map with missiles that detonate as soon as they arrive.</p>

<p>Of course, Tejo also has an Ultimate ability in the form of Armageddon, a tactical strike that delivers a payload of explosives along a custom-set path. It sounds like Tejo won't be for those who prefer their Agents simple, but he'll be a rewarding choice for more skilled players.</p>

<p>Along with Tejo,&nbsp;<em>Valorant</em>'s Season 2025 Act 1 also brings with it the Flex system, consisting of "handheld objects that [give] players more ways to express themselves in-game". Each player will get one Flex for free, and a second will be available via the battle pass.</p>

<p>You'll also be able to get your hands on the new EX.O skin line, which offers skins for the Vandal, the Sheriff, the Spectre, the Outlaw, and the Katana.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Valorant</em>, it's a competitive multiplayer first-person shooter created by&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>developer Riot Games.</p>

<p>The game mixes the objective-based gameplay of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/counter-strike-global-offensive" rel="nofollow">Counter-Strike</a>&nbsp;</em>with the hero-focused approach of the likes of&nbsp;<em>Overwatch&nbsp;</em>and the more recent&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/marvel-rivals" rel="nofollow"><em>Marvel Rivals</em></a>, offering players unique abilities for each Agent while also keeping the focus on map control and awareness.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Valorant&nbsp;</em>for free right now on <a href="https://playvalorant.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S</a>. Season 2025 Act 1 arrives on January 8th.</p>
