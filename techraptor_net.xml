            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-5-3-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has announced the release date for <i>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</i>Version 5.3, so if you're looking for a way to ring in the new year, then you're in luck.</p>

<p>Following hot on the heels of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-52-release-date" rel="nofollow">November's Version 5.2</a>&nbsp;and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-51-release-date" rel="nofollow">previous month's Version 5.1</a>, Version 5.3 will arrive on January 1st. That's right: New Year's Day itself. It'll continue the storyline of Natlan's Archon Quest, in which the Traveler is about to awaken their Pyro power and the six heroes of Natlan have united.</p>

<p>Of course, it wouldn't be much of a HoYoverse game update without some new characters to enjoy, and Version 5.3 is bringing not one, but two 5-star characters for you to add to your roster.</p>

She can either take enemies on with the aforementioned claymore or use her Flamestrider to crush enemies. Said Flamestrider can also be used to traverse the world.</p>

<p>The second 5-star character joining&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>in Version 5.3 is Citlali, also known as Granny Itztli. She's a Cryo-using catalyst wielder who can deploy shields and deal powerful area-of-effect damage. Both characters are joined by the intriguing-sounding multi-elemental Liyue fighter Lan Yan, who debuts in the second half of the update.</p>

<p>Of course, you can also expect reruns of existing characters in case you missed the chance to add them to your team. Characters returning as part of this update include Arlecchino, Clorinde, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/genshin-impact-ganyu-guide-builds-skills" rel="nofollow">Ganyu</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/genshin-impact-shenhe-build-guide" rel="nofollow">Shenhe</a>.</p>




<p>Plenty of other goodies are coming as part of Version 5.3 as well, including the return of the Lantern Rite event, the popular rhythm minigame becoming a permanent fixture, and optimizations to the character level up screen to make it a little easier to understand and parse.</p>

<p>As per usual, HoYoverse is also giving away some&nbsp;<em>Genshin&nbsp;</em>goodies for those who are looking to build their roster. Here are this update's codes!</p>

<ul><li>UAMPGJASECZH: 100 Primogems, 10 Mystic Enhancement Ore</li>
	<li>LT5NH2TTXUHM: 100 Primogems, 5 Hero's Wit</li>
	<li>4SLPH3BSFVH9: 100 Primogems, 50,000 Mora</li>
</ul><p><em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>is available to play right now for free on <a href="https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation, Xbox Series X|S, and mobile devices</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-engineers-2-early-access-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Keen Software House has announced the&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>Early Access release date, as well as unveiling the game's first full trailer in anticipation of that date.</p>

<p><em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-engineers-2-announced" rel="nofollow">revealed last week</a>, and as part of that reveal, Keen Software House (not to be confused with&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/enshrouded" rel="nofollow">Enshrouded</a>&nbsp;</em>studio Keen Games) promised an Early Access release date the following week.</p>

<p>Now, that time has come;&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>will officially arrive in Early Access on January 27th, so make sure to mark that date on your calendar if you're looking forward to some co-op space engineering fun.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/space-engineers-2-early-access-release-date-space-base.jpg?itok=j35s3ikz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/space-engineers-2-early-access-release-date-space-base.jpg?itok=JlJin-fH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>is coming to Early Access in January.</figcaption></figure><p>In an announcement post revealing the Early Access date, Keen Software House says that rather than being a small update to the formula,&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>represents a "complete reimagining of the space engineering experience".</p>

<p>Plenty of new systems and gameplay mechanics will be introduced in&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2</em>, including new creative tools, a brand new engine with "better performance and future optimization potential", and improved visuals, among many other changes.</p>

<p>If you pick up&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>in Early Access, you'll gain, erm, access to what Keen Software House calls the "first vertical slice" of the game, which will consist of its Creative Mode. This mode will show off many of the game's new tools and features, so if you're looking to get an idea of what&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>will be capable of in the future, the Early Access release is the place to go.</p>




<p>In future, Keen Software House says it'll keep updating&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>with new "vertical slices", each of which will expand the game's "features and content". In essence, it sounds like they'll work just like most Early Access game updates do.</p>

<p><em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>is coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1133870/Space_Engineers_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on January 27th.</p>
