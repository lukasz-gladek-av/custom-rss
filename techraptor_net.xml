            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lies-of-p-sales-3m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Lies of P&nbsp;</em>developer Neowiz has announced that its puppet-centered Soulslike has reached a brand new sales milestone, just a handful of days after the release of its first big story DLC.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://x.com/Liesofp/status/1935850080948699629" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, the action RPG, which launched back in 2023, has reached three million sales. That means it's picked up another two million for itself since launch month, during which it managed to achieve the impressive milestone of a million copies sold.</p>

<p>It's likely that the shadowdrop of&nbsp;<em>Overture</em>, the game's first story expansion, helped sales along; it was launched without preceding fanfare during the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/summer-game-fest-2025-recap" rel="nofollow">main Summer Game Fest show</a> earlier this month, having been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lies-of-p-dlc-q1-2025-new-ip" rel="nofollow">teased</a> by Neowiz for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lies-of-p-dlc-sequel" rel="nofollow">some time</a> prior to that announcement.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lies-of-p-sales-3m-overture.jpg?itok=Y7qonlF9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lies-of-p-sales-3m-overture.jpg?itok=idEhKMsX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Lies of P&nbsp;</em>has managed to reach a new sales milestone, perhaps driven by the release of its first major DLC pack.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Lies of P</em>, it's a Soulslike action RPG created by Korean studio Neowiz. As you've probably guessed, it's an extremely loose adaptation of 1883 children's novel&nbsp;<em>The Adventures of Pinocchio</em>, although the emphasis here is on "loose"; if you're expecting a faithful retelling of Carlo Collodi's classic fable, you'll be disappointed.</p>

<p>Instead, you're getting a fairly straightforward Soulslike setup; the city of Krat, a Belle Epoque-era metropolis full of breathtaking architecture, is now sadly also full of murderous puppets, and it's up to you, a different kind of murderous puppet, to do something about that.</p>

<p>Gameplay-wise,&nbsp;<em>Lies of P&nbsp;</em>hews pretty close to the formula; it's built around parry-focused combat, semi-linear exploration, and an oblique story that drip-feeds clues over the course of the game's running time.</p>

<p>The game's first major DLC,&nbsp;<em>Overture</em>, revolves around a legendary figure in&nbsp;<em>Lies of P</em>'s mythology by the name of Lea Florence Monad. You'll uncover her story while also exploring new areas, battling new enemies, and trying out some new weapons into the bargain.</p>




<p><em>Lies of P</em>&nbsp;is out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1627720/Lies_of_P/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/lies-of-p/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/lies-of-p" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and its&nbsp;<em>Overture&nbsp;</em>DLC is also available on all of those platforms.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-xiv-patch-7-3-adds-new-dungeons-and-more-in-august.1224105/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-patch-73-august<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has revealed roughly when you can expect&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>Patch 7.3 to land, as well as what it'll bring to the long-running MMORPG when it arrives.</p>

<p>Per a new <a href="https://x.com/FF_XIV_EN/status/1936032284802793652" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">thread</a> on social media platform X, Patch 7.3 will arrive in early August, and it'll continue the story of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-patch-72-release-date" rel="nofollow">March's Patch 7.2</a>. As part of that story continuation, you can look forward to a new dungeon by the name of the Meso Terminal, which will serve as a "glittering monument to Alexandria's eternal queen".</p>

<p>The new update will also continue the ongoing&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XI</em>-themed 24-person raid, the second part of which will be called "San d'Oria: The Second Walk". Presumably, you'll be exploring the city of the same name from&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XI</em>, although given that these raids often take players through some weird and wonderful setpieces, that may not be where you end up.</p>

<p>The Cosmic Exploration feature, which is open to crafting and gathering professions, will expand in the new update as well, giving you a whole new planet to discover in the form of Phaenna. Who knows what you'll find for your Hand or Land journey there?</p>

<p>A new Deep Dungeon, Pilgrim's Traverse, will also be available, so if you prefer to take on combat-oriented challenges rather than crafting (or if you're planning to do both), you'll probably want to tackle that one as well.</p>

<p>If you play as a Hrothgar or a Viera, you'll be pleased to know there are also new headgear options available for these races, so your fashion options will be expanded when August rolls around.</p>

We don't have a more concrete release date for it yet, so stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-34-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/honkai-star-rail-version-3-4-release-date-set-for-july.1224030/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-34-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.4, the latest update for HoYoverse's turn-based gacha RPG, launches early next month, the developer and publisher has announced.</p>

<p>Per a press release, Version 3.4, also known as "For the Sun Is Set to Die", arrives on July 2nd. Following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-33-release-date" rel="nofollow">May's Version 3.3</a>, the new update will see you stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Phainon "at the crossroads of destiny" in order to "take a decisive step that may ignite the dawn of the Era Nova".</p>

<p>Since this is a&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>update, you can, of course, also look forward to brand new characters, and this time around, you're getting three, although two of them are guests from another franchise altogether.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/honkai-star-rail-version-3.4-phainon.jpg?itok=BXCfkQTw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/honkai-star-rail-version-3.4-phainon.jpg?itok=LiySLaWd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Phainon is joining the roster in&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.4.</figcaption></figure><p>The first new character joining the roster in&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.4 is Phainon, who can essentially take over the battlefield when he transforms into his Ultimate form. As you can probably imagine, he's a pretty reliable damage-dealer, so take him if you need some destruction in your lineup.</p>

<p>Your other two characters in this update are both visitors from the&nbsp;<em>Fate/stay night&nbsp;</em>franchise, namely Archer and Saber. Archer will be available for free once the crossover event begins, as will Saber. The latter will be a five-star fighter as well, so she'll be a valuable addition to your team.</p>

<p>This update will also bring reruns for&nbsp;Tribbie, Sunday, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-introduces-new-character-sparkle-and-she-goes-from-cute-to-crazy" rel="nofollow">Sparkle</a>, while in the second half, you'll get another chance to add&nbsp;Firefly, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-teases-new-character-jingliu-ahead-of-14-ps5-release" rel="nofollow">Jingliu</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-showcases-its-edgiest-character-blade-launches-flappy-birds-clone" rel="nofollow">Blade</a> to your team.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.4 right here. It gives a flavor of what you'll be doing when you begin your adventure next month.</p>




<p><em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.4 lands on July 2nd across <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">all platforms</a>. The game is currently available on PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices running both major operating systems.</p>
