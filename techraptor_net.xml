            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Phoenix Labs has announced that&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm&nbsp;</em>updates will be coming to an end in September, and that the game's online servers will be shutting down at the same time.</p>

<p>In an update on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2230110/Fae_Farm/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam page</a>, the studio says the game "will be going offline" on September 10th at 11:59pm Pacific (or around 2am the following day by Eastern time), and that there won't be any further updates for the game after that.</p>

<p>While&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm</em>'s updates and online services will be coming to a close, Phoenix Labs has assured fans that the single-player offline version of the game will remain playable, so if you do own&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm&nbsp;</em>and you're yet to get around to checking it out, you haven't missed your chance.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fae-farm-updates-ending-farm.jpg?itok=Cm2kwdHq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fae-farm-updates-ending-farm.jpg?itok=bfK8-fcs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Updates for&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm&nbsp;</em>are ending next month.</figcaption></figure><p>It doesn't seem as though the game is being delisted, either, so you should still be able to buy&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm&nbsp;</em>if you don't already own it.</p>

<p>The end of&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm&nbsp;</em>updates comes after Phoenix Labs <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dauntless-developer-phoenix-labs-more-layoffs" rel="nofollow">laid off "the majority" of its staff</a> earlier this year, a move the studio referred to as "unfortunate but necessary changes to our operations" at the time.</p>

<p>That decision followed the release of an update for monster-hunting RPG&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>by the name of Awakening, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dauntless-awakening-update-apology" rel="nofollow">proved hugely unpopular with players</a> and caused the game's player base to dwindle. The failure of Awakening also led Phoenix Labs to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dauntless-shutting-down-in-may" rel="nofollow">shut down <i>Dauntless&nbsp;</i>in May</a>.</p>

<p>Given that&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>has closed down and that updates for&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm&nbsp;</em>are ending, it's not too difficult to extrapolate that Phoenix Labs itself might be about to close down. It certainly wouldn't be the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">only studio</a> to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/echtra-games-shut-down-torchlight-3" rel="nofollow">do so this year</a>, unfortunately.</p>
