This updated document, officially titled the SRD 5.2, will allow creators to publish TTRPG content using the 2024 ruleset of the popular fantasy TTRPG.</p>

<h2>The Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024 SRD Announcement</h2>

<p>In an official post on <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/1949-coming-april-22-publish-your-own-creations-using#what-s-changing-from-srd-5-1-to-srd-5-2" rel="nofollow">D&amp;D Beyond</a>, Wizards of the Coast announced the publication of the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024</em> SRD. According to the post, the SRD will be released under a Creative Commons license and will coexist alongside the SRD 5.1 document for <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Fifth Edition.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dungeons-dragons-2024-vecna-artwork.jpg?itok=i0h-SmMo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dungeons-dragons-2024-vecna-artwork.jpg?itok=6h0LpIK7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The post then detailed what will be included in the SRD. Unlike the notorious OGL debacle, the SRD allows third-party developers to make material using the rules material without paying a fee to Wizards of the Coast. In addition, since both SRDs are in Creative Commons, it provides a legally binding promise that the essential rules of D&amp;D are free to use, change, and build upon forever.</p>

<p>With this SRD's publication you can, irrevocably and in perpetuity, create and publish material for both Fifth Edition Dungeons &amp; Dragons and Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024.</p>

<p>The post also confirms that Wizards of the Coast will be releasing a Conversion Guide for creators who want to update their work to be compatible with the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024</em> SRD.</p>

<p>Lastly, Wizards of the Coast confirmed the SRD will be routinely updated to include any and all errata for <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024</em>. The SRD will be updated accordingly to match these changes.</p>

<p>The <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024</em> SRD was initially announced in <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dungeons-dragons-2024-srd-announced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">May 2024</a>. This announcement was made alongside the updated core rulebooks as part of the fantasy TTRPG's 50th anniversary. These Core Rulebooks were overseen by industry leads <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/christopher-perkins-retires-from-wizards-of-coast-after-28-years-working-on-dungeons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Christopher Perkins</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/jeremy-crawford-game-director-of-dungeons-dragons-is-leaving-wizards-of-ghost" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Jeremy Crawford</a>. Both of them have recently announced their departure from Wizards of the Coast.</p>

<p>The <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> 2024 SRD will be released on April 22.</p>
