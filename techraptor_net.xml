            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/infinity-nikki-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Infold Games has revealed the&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>release date, so if you've been waiting for an open-world game that's packed with cutesy and cozy vibes to get you through the winter, today's your lucky day.</p>

<p><em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>officially arrives on December 5th, and it's coming to PC, PS5, and mobile devices. Sadly, it doesn't look like the game will be getting a Steam release anytime soon, so you'll have to grab it via its own launcher or via the Epic Games Store.</p>

<p>According to Infold Games,&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>has managed to attract 30 million pre-registrations in the runup to its release, so it's clearly striking a chord. Given that this is the fifth installment in the series, perhaps that's to be expected.</p>

<p>It's not hard to see the influence of more recent&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>games on&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki</em>, but Infold's game places much more of an emphasis on cozy open-world exploration rather than combat and conflict (although that's definitely in there too).</p>

<p>The studio is promising activities like pet grooming, fishing, and fashion competitions in&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki</em>, as well as "evocative and engaging story quests" and plenty of platforming challenges to keep you busy as well.</p>

<p>You can check out the release date announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>below. It also features the game's theme song, "Together Till Infinity", which is performed by pop star Jessie J.</p>




<p><em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>arrives for PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices on December 5th.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-financials-q2-2024</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/embracer-group-sales-fall-by-20-as-company-sells-casual-giant-easybrain-for-1-2b.1035717/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-financials-q2-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Swedish conglomerate Embracer Group has released its financial results for the second quarter of the 2024-25 fiscal year, and things aren't looking great for the company, although a massive casual studio sale might help things along a touch.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-publishes-interim-report-q2-july-september-2024-adjusted-ebit-amounted-to-sek-1207-million/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">financial statement summarizing the quarter</a>, Embracer reveals that net sales dropped by 21% on a year-on-year basis, while sales across the first six months of the financial year dipped by 23% (again compared to the same period last year).</p>

<p>More specifically, PC and console sales dropped by 46% for Embracer this quarter and by 40% across the first six months of the fiscal year. Embracer puts this down in part to the underperformance of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-mickey-rebrushed-release-date" rel="nofollow">remaster&nbsp;<em>Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed</em></a>, which the company says sold "slower than expected".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disney-epic-mickey-rebrushed-embracer-group-financials-q2-2024.jpg?itok=1SUBCpaB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disney-epic-mickey-rebrushed-embracer-group-financials-q2-2024.jpg?itok=NPXY4TOl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed&nbsp;</em>hasn't done very well for Embracer, apparently.</figcaption></figure><p>Embracer also says that the releases of&nbsp;<em>Remnant 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Payday 3&nbsp;</em>in the same period last quarter makes the year-on-year comparison "tough". It's worth noting here too that&nbsp;<em>Payday 3&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-studios-ceo-steps-down" rel="nofollow">hasn't exactly done too well</a> since launch, so it's not really providing a constant revenue stream for Embracer.</p>

<p>Along with its financial results, Embracer has also announced the sale of casual gaming giant Easybrain, the company that owns the Sudoku.com domain.</p>

<p>It's been sold to fellow casual gaming purveyors Miniclip for an eye-watering $1.2 billion, which, along with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/raid-shadow-legends-developer-bought-620m" rel="nofollow">recent sale of&nbsp;<em>Raid: Shadow Legends&nbsp;</em>developer Plarium for over $600 million</a>, just demonstrates how strong the mobile and casual markets are.</p>

<p>In general, it's a bit of a gloomy forecast for Embracer; not a single one of the business' divisions has reported increased sales either this quarter or across the April-September period.</p>

<p>The company's lineup for the second half of the fiscal year includes&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-delay" rel="nofollow"><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tomb-raider-4-6-remastered-announced" rel="nofollow"><em>Tomb Raider 4-6 Remastered</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hyper-light-breaker-trailer-shows-pulse-pounding-action-reveals-release-window" rel="nofollow"><em>Hyper Light Breaker</em></a>, with releases like&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gothic-1-remake-collectors-edition" rel="nofollow">Gothic 1 Remake</a>&nbsp;</em>also apparently set to arrive sometime in the next year or so.</p>

<p>We're also currently awaiting the splitting of Embracer into three separate companies, as was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-splitting-three-companies" rel="nofollow">revealed back in April</a>. Embracer says that Asmodee, in particular, which will handle the company's tabletop properties, is poised to "build on its successful track record" and "[unlock] shareholder value".</p>
