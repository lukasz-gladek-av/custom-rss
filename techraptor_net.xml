            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last week, Nintendo announced that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-firered-leafgreen-switch" rel="nofollow"><em>Pokémon</em> <em>FireRed</em> and <em>LeafGreen</em> will be coming to the Nintendo Switch eShop</a> on February 27 to celebrate the franchise's 30th anniversary. Instead of these classic <em>Pokémon</em> titles getting added to Nintendo Switch Online as part of their subscription, <em>FireRed</em> and <em>LeafGreen</em> will be available to purchase for $20 each, causing a lot of backlash online.</p><p>The combined $40 price tag for two 22-year-old games understandably creates some sticker shock, but this is not nearly as bad a deal as the community is making it out to be. Not only have <em>FireRed</em> and <em>LeafGreen</em> never been available since the Game Boy Advance days, but classic <em>Pokémon</em> titles in general have been difficult to obtain on a legitimate Nintendo console without diving into the expensive secondhand market.</p><p>While many turn to emulation, there are those who prefer to have Nintendo titles authentically available on Nintendo platforms, making this release a great choice for <a href="https://techraptor.net/series/pokemon" rel="nofollow"><em>Pokémon</em></a> fans this February.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2><em>Pokémon</em> <em>FireRed</em> &amp; <em>LeafGreen</em>: Available for First Time Since 2004</h2><p>Despite <em>Pokémon</em> being the most successful media franchise in the world, with revenue surpassing $100 billion since its founding, fans will be hard-pressed to find classic <em>Pokémon</em> titles readily available. With how popular these games are, it feels like a slam dunk to re-release them, but Nintendo and GameFreak have been intentionally withholding.</p><p>Back in 2016, before the summer of <em>Pokémon</em> <em>Go</em>, we got <em>Pokémon</em> <em>Red</em>,<em> Blue</em> and Y<em>ellow</em> released on the Nintendo 3DS eShop for just $10 each, and shortly after, <em>Pokémon Gold</em>, <em>Silver</em>, and <em>Crystal</em>, but they stopped there.</p><p>In 2018 we did get Kanto remakes with <em>Let's Go Pikachu!</em> and <em>Let's go Eevee!</em>, but so many longtime fans had a desire for the <em>Pokémon</em> Company to go back to its pixel art roots. Yet despite their popularity and commercial success, <em>FireRed</em> and <em>LeafGreen</em> would never again get the opportunity to be enjoyed on a modern Nintendo console. At least, not until now.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Classic <em>Pokémon</em> Games Are Few &amp; Far Between On Modern Consoles</h2><p>In 2006 the Wii Virtual Console made it easier for fans to purchase Nintendo classics, but mainline <em>Pokémon</em> games have been difficult to acquire through official means. Apart from the few exceptions mentioned above, you either had to own the original hardware or turn to an emulator.</p><p>With how popular <em>Pokémon</em> is, re-releasing the classic titles on a modern console just makes sense. I'm confident sales for <em>FireRed</em> and <em>LeafGreen</em> will rival any modern <em>Pokémon</em> game, and hopefully it will be an incentive for Nintendo to bring the entire library to Nintendo Switch.</p><p>While $20 seems like a lot, it's a small price to pay to finally access these beloved remakes. For many of us, it will be our first time getting our hands on these games without needing to pay resale prices. Besides, the Game Boy Advance resale market is not without its risks.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Many of Us Will Play <em>FireRed</em> &amp; <em>LeafGreen</em> for the First Time</h2><p>Years ago, I got really excited at the idea of playing <em>Pokémon</em> <em>FireRed</em> and <em>LeafGreen</em>. I had bought myself a Game Boy Advance SP and was ready to dive into some of the classic titles, so I purchased a cartridge on eBay, only to find that it was fake and that it was likely my save data would get corrupted.</p><p>Emulators were an option, and as far as emulation goes, the <em>Pokémon</em> games run pretty well (plus there are a myriad of mods you can add to customize these games), but I still wanted a genuine Nintendo experience on a Nintendo console.</p><p>So I've never played through <em>FireRed</em> or <em>LeafGreen</em>, and this re-release will be my first opportunity to do so. I know I'm not alone on this – the <em>FireRed</em> and <em>LeafGreen</em> re-release is going to be extremely popular among longtime fans. Not to mention that having a path to accessing a classic title like this on a current console is hugely important for the games industry at large.</p><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/game-preservation-protect-past" rel="nofollow">Video game preservation is such a huge issue</a>, something that gamers, content creators, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/strong-national-museum-play" rel="nofollow">even national museums</a> are working toward addressing. With <em>Pokémon</em> <em>FireRed</em> and <em>LeafGreen</em> coming to Nintendo Switch, an entire new generation of gamers gets to appreciate these games, and not just the younglings, either. I'm in my mid-30s and am looking forward to jumping into these games as much as any other fan.</p><p>I don't need to charge up decades-old hardware or hope that a cartridge will still function – revisiting the world of Kanto will be as easy as selecting the game on my Switch home screen. Hopefully if these titles sell well, more from the <em>Pokémon</em> catalog will become available before too long.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2><em>Pokémon</em> <em>FireRed</em> &amp; <em>LeafGreen</em>: Fun That's Worth the Price</h2><p>A $20 price tag to own these classic titles feels like a fair price, especially when the secondhand market is so out of control. Though I personally enjoy NSO for its variety, it's hard to replace the satisfaction of actually owning your games, even digitally (yes, for the contrarians: I understand you only pay for the license). With that in mind, having the opportunity to play <em>FireRed</em> and <em>LeafGreen</em> on a modern console is well worth the cost of admission.</p><p>And if you disagree? No one's forcing you to buy it. But for everyone looking forward to this release, I'll be right there with you to share memories of Kanto when we jump back in on February 27.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
