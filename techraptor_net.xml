            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/free-mullet-madjack-update-features-ultrakill<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The high-octane, fast-and-loud shooter <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/mullet-madjack-review-nostalgia-fueled-frenzy" rel="nofollow"><em>Mullet MadJack</em></a> launched to <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/16689/mullet-madjack" rel="nofollow">wide acclaim</a> from critics, and with a new crossover update featuring <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/new-blood-interactive" rel="nofollow">New Blood Interactive's</a> <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/ultrakill" rel="nofollow">ULTRAKILL</a>,</em> there's even more to rave about.</p>

<p>The bulk of new content comes in the form of Boss Rush Mode. Fight against the clock and slay <em>Mullet MadJack</em>'s various bosses and compete with global rankings for the highest score. Make it to the final boss of the Mode and you'll be met with a surprise: a character from <em>ULTRAKILL.</em></p>


<p>V2 from <em>ULTRAKILL</em> makes an appearance and you'll have to fight head-to-head against this extremely lethal machine. Fans of <em>ULTRAKILL</em> will recognize this as a punishing boss encounter, and the crossover makes for an exciting addition to <em>Mullet MadJack</em>.</p>

<p><em>Mullet MadJack</em> is a roguelite first-person shooter featuring fast gameplay. Players have only a handful of seconds to make it to the next floor. Recover precious time by slaying robobillionaires and save the love of your life. With a story-based Campaign mode as well as an endless Survival mode, Boss Rush will make a fine addition to the critically-acclaimed title.</p>



<p><em>ULTRAKILL </em>is an equally fast-paced shooter, with a brutal difficulty curve and plenty of style. Take control of a killer robot called V1 and literally bathe in the blood of your enemies to regain health. It's currently in Early Access and, while the official launch of <em>ULTRAKILL</em> is still up in the air, it's received quite a bit of buzz from fans with over 100,000 Steam reviews.</p>

<p>Whether you're a fan of <em>Mullet MadJack </em>or <em>ULTRAKILL</em>, fans won't have to wait long for this crossover. The update -- featuring Boss Rush Mode and Punished V2 as its final encounter -- is available for download today on PC.</p>

<p>For now, this crossover is exclusive only to <em>Mullet MadJack</em>, but who knows? Maybe we'll see something in <em>ULTRAKILL</em> in the future.</p>
