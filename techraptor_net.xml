            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sales analysis firm Circana has released its gaming industry sales data for May 2025, and FromSoftware and Bandai Namco will have cause to celebrate this month.</p>

<p>According to Circana's <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ltjuov7li22j" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Mat Piscatella</a>,&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>was the best-selling game across all formats in May, and it topped the individual PlayStation and Xbox charts as well. As a reminder, I <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/elden-ring-nightreign-review-fort-night" rel="nofollow">awarded the game an 8 out of 10 score</a>, so I'm pretty pleased it managed to sell as well as it did.</p>

<p>Of course, given that sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-confirmed-sales" rel="nofollow">topped 3.5 million</a> just a few days after the game was released, it's not surprising that&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>performed as well as it did. Still, since the game is an experiment on FromSoftware and Bandai Namco's behalf, it will no doubt come as a pleasant surprise for both studios.</p>

As a reminder, Bethesda <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bethesda.net/post/3lpmvjo7noz2c" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> shortly after launch that&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>had hit three million players, although since that number includes Game Pass players, it's perhaps not quite as valuable as the studio thinks.</p>

<p>Neither of these games have managed to topple&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-10m" rel="nofollow">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered&nbsp;</em>as the best-selling games of 2025 year-to-date. Incidentally,&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 5&nbsp;</em>is in third place, largely because of its release on PS5 in late April.</p>

<p>As ever, Nintendo's chart is off in its own little world, since many of the aforementioned games weren't released for the Switch. That platform's best-selling game for May was&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart 8</em>, because of course it was, followed by&nbsp;<em>Capcom Fighting Collection 2</em>.</p>

It's got plenty of stats on things like hardware sales and the mobile market as well, so be sure to give it a glance if you're into your numbers.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Stalker 2 PS5 Version Confirmed for Later This Year]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-ps5-version-late-2025</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher GSC Game World has revealed that its post-apocalyptic RPG shooter&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>is coming to PlayStation 5 later this year.</p>

<p>The announcement of the game's PS5 port was made via a rather amusing new trailer, which features a familiar character from&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>. I won't spoil its surprises, but you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qFxNZksiSw" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">check it out here</a> if you'd like to watch it.</p>

<p>According to GSC Game World, the PS5 version of&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>will utilize the DualSense's haptic feedback and adaptive trigger features for "deeper player immersion", so presumably, that'll manifest in the form of trigger resistance for guns and various other fun little features.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stalker-2-ps5-vista-pc.jpg?itok=9VWh0-ID 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stalker-2-ps5-vista-pc.jpg?itok=zJcgxK19 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>is hitting PS5 soon.</figcaption></figure><p>In addition, the PS5 version of&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>will feature a number of enhancements for the PS5 Pro, so you can add the shooter to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/full-ps5-pro-enhanced-list-launch" rel="nofollow">list of games with extra features</a> for the souped-up version of Sony's hardware.</p>

<p>Other than that, though, it sounds like this will very much be the same&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>with which you may already be familiar. It doesn't sound like GSC Game World will be adding any extra content for the PS5 release, so you won't be missing out if you don't pick it up on Sony's platform.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>, it's the long-awaited sequel to 2007's&nbsp;<em>Stalker: Shadow of Chornobyl&nbsp;</em>(not counting prequel <i>Clear Sky&nbsp;</i>or standalone sequel&nbsp;<em>Call of Pripyat</em>, although the latter does take place after&nbsp;<em>Shadow of Chernobyl</em>).</p>

<p>The game follows new protagonist Skif, who must explore the Exclusion Zone in search of ways to make money to replace his destroyed home (at least, that's how the game opens; it takes some interesting turns after that which I won't spoil).</p>




<p><em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>is available now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/stalker-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. It's coming to PS5 in "late 2025", according to GSC Game World.</p>
