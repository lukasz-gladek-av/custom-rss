            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hello-kitty-island-adventure-sales-500k<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Sunblink has announced that&nbsp;<em>Hello Kitty Island Adventure&nbsp;</em>sales have reached a major milestone just 30 days after the game's release on PC and Switch.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/03/hello-kitty-island-adventure-sales-top-500000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gematsu</a>, the cozy life sim has reached 500,000 sales, which isn't bad considering it's only been available as an individually-sold game for around a month.</p>

<p>If you need a reminder,&nbsp;<em>Hello Kitty Island Adventure&nbsp;</em>was actually released on iOS back in July 2023, but the game was part of the Apple Arcade subscription service (which will also be playing host to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/katamari-damacy-rolling-live-apple-arcade" rel="nofollow">first new&nbsp;<em>Katamari&nbsp;</em>game in almost eight years</a> come next month).</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Hello Kitty Island Adventure</em>, it's a life sim based on Sanrio's hugely popular&nbsp;<em>Hello Kitty&nbsp;</em>property. It bears similarities to&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing</em>; you'll be exploring and restoring a mysterious island, all while befriending its inhabitants (although this time around they are, of course, based on other <i>Hello Kitty&nbsp;</i>properties).</p>

<p>Unlike&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing</em>, you'll also find lots of different areas and biomes to explore in&nbsp;<em>Hello Kitty Island Adventure</em>, including a volcano, "the ocean's depths", and "an island in the clouds".</p>

<p>Of course, since the game is a life sim, you can also expect plenty of recipes to cook and craft, as well as the ability to renovate cabins on your island in order to attract new residents. You might even unlock new storylines involving those residents.</p>




<p>You can check out <i>Hello Kitty Island Adventure&nbsp;</i>right now on PC and Switch, and it's also available via Apple Arcade, with a PlayStation port on the way in the future as well.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crusader-kings-3-khans-of-the-steppe-expansion<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Paradox has announced a new&nbsp;<em>Crusader Kings 3&nbsp;</em>expansion in the form of&nbsp;<em>Khans of the Steppe</em>, and it's the first part of the game's fourth "chapter".</p>

<p>In a news <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1158310/view/535470580526219410" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Steam, Paradox reveals that&nbsp;<em>Khans of the Steppe&nbsp;</em>will launch on April 28th, and that it'll begin "the next stage in <em>Crusader Kings 3</em>'s development". As with previous&nbsp;<em>Crusader Kings 3&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-major-crusader-kings-3-expansion-highlights-royal-court" rel="nofollow">expansions</a>,&nbsp;<em>Khans of the Steppe&nbsp;</em>will add a number of new gameplay mechanics and features.</p>

<p>Since the expansion is based around the Mongols, it probably won't come as a surprise to learn that the first major feature is a nomadic government system. You'll be tasked with exploiting the resources in your current location, then moving on to a new place with more resources to reap.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/crusader-kings-3-khans-of-the-steppe-overlook.jpg?itok=CmR1jb9G 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/crusader-kings-3-khans-of-the-steppe-overlook.jpg?itok=WOPY1SXn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Crusader Kings 3</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Khans of the Steppe&nbsp;</em>expansion will add nomadic governments and more.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as nomadic government,&nbsp;<em>Khans of the Steppe&nbsp;</em>will also introduce a Herd system that will represent your "horses, cattle, and overall strength within the steppe", and it'll serve as the "cornerstone of diplomatic, martial, and economic actions" in the new expansion.</p>

<p>The new Dominance system will also measure your power and influence within the steppe, and Paradox says that if you manage to raise your Dominance high enough, you "might even claim the mantle of Genghis Khan; the Universal Ruler".</p>

<p>You can also look forward to "changing climate and weather patterns" affecting your life in the steppe; you may, for instance, have to contend with sudden snows "decimating fertility and putting pressure on you to find greener pastures".</p>




<p><em>Khans of the Steppe&nbsp;</em>may be&nbsp;<em>Crusader Kings 3</em>'s first Chapter 4 expansion, but it's not the main event; that honor goes to&nbsp;<em>All Under Heaven</em>, which will, as the name suggests, expand the game's map to encompass Asia.</p>

<p>You can look forward to new cultures, faiths, and more in this expansion, as well as a new Dynastic Cycle system that will have you attempting to maintain the Mandate of Heaven to prove you can "navigate the empire through treacherous waters".</p>

<p>There's no release date for&nbsp;<em>All Under Heaven&nbsp;</em>yet, but the first dev diary is set for May, with regular dev diaries for&nbsp;<em>Khans of the Steppe&nbsp;</em>also due to air throughout April until the expansion's release.</p>
