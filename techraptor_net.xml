            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Magic has returned to the classic world of Lorwyn and Shadowmoor for the first time since we left following <em>Eventide </em>in 2008, almost 20 years ago.</p><p>A world defined by duality, by light and dark, <em>Lorwyn</em>/<em>Shadowmoor </em>drew on Celtic mythology and used many typal themes on the Lorwyn side of things with 8 races focused on (along with a number of classes), and Shadowmoor, the dark counterpart focused on color and -1/-1 counters. <em>Lorwyn Eclipsed</em> has the tough job of capturing 4 sets in one newly merged world where both light and dark co-exist.</p><p>Beyond the set itself, one other element of duality is the pair of commander decks releasing with <em>Lorwyn Eclipsed</em>. For Lorwyn, we appropriately have a typal deck focused on one of the creature types that are classically Lorwyn in elemetals with Dance of the Elements. For Shadowmoor, Blight Curse is a deck focused on -1/-1 counters and all the wonderful things you can do with them.</p><p>Any pre-constructed deck though has some spaces it can be improved. New ideas to be sprinkled in, and that's where I come in with my special spice kit for you. Let’s get cooking a few <em>Lorwyn Eclipsed</em> commander deck upgrades.</p><h2>Dance of the Elements Upgrades</h2><p>A quick look at <a href="https://mtg.wiki/page/Lorwyn_Eclipsed/Commander_decks#Dance_of_the_Elements" rel="nofollow">Dance of the Elements </a>shows it as a 5 color Elemental typal deck. It focuses heavily on enters and leaving abilities on elements, with Evoke, Encore, and Myriad all showing up in the deck and fueling those abilities, along with tokens. The face commander <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ecc/1/ashling-the-limitless" rel="nofollow">Ashling, the Limitless </a>wants to focus on Evoke, while the alternate commander <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ecc/3/mass-of-mysteries" rel="nofollow">Mass of Mysteries</a> wants to focus on Myriad.</p><picture>

  </picture><h3><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/2x2/171/animar-soul-of-elements" rel="nofollow">Animar, Soul of Elements</a></h3><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/animar-soul-of-elements_0.jpg?itok=rtZjLO5R 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="372" height="520">

  </picture><p>One elemental missing from the deck but a natural friend to Ashling, the Limitless is Animar, Soul of the Elements. &nbsp;Aanimar’s ability to reduce cost of creature spells means that with only a few plays all future elementals will be evokable for free with Ashling, the Limitless. Meanwhile, Animar himself gets bigger, and is relatively resistant to removal with protection from black and white.</p><h3><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/who/146/the-master-multiplied" rel="nofollow">The Master, Multiplied</a></h3><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-master-multiplied_0.jpg?itok=V4YQxGEx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="373" height="520">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-master-multiplied_0.jpg?itok=nIKSAuK1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="373" height="520">
                  

  </picture><p>If you’re wanting to explore Mass of Mysteries more, The Master Multiplied is I think a must-add to the deck, from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/best-lore-deep-cuts-of-doctor-who-commander-universes-beyond" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9113edf5-8cfc-4569-b9c0-bd636f0ddcdd" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Doctor Who </em>commander decks</a>. This will turn all the myriad tokens you make into permanent keepers and will quickly transform your board into an out-of control zone if someone doesn’t take out either your commander or The Master, Multiplied. It’s less useful alongside Ashling, because Ashling wants you to sacrifice them, but even there it might have a spot.</p><h3><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tsb/7/enduring-renewal" rel="nofollow">Enduring Renewal </a>and/or <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/usg/299/lifeline" rel="nofollow">Lifeline</a></h3><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/enduring-renewal-and-lifeline.jpg?itok=m0BJufEK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="754" height="520">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/enduring-renewal-and-lifeline.jpg?itok=oATCLmIr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="754" height="520">
                  

  </picture><p>Alternatively for Ashling, the Limitless, I’d look at resurrection type abilities a bit more. Perhaps the strongest option is Enduring Renewal, which with Animar and Ashling is an infinite token evoke engine, and even without that keeps you going on creatures. Lifeline is a slower, more value ridden approach, with it giving you the creatures back at the end of the turn.</p><h3><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/inr/117/heartless-summoning" rel="nofollow">Heartless Summoning</a></h3><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/heartless-summoning.jpg?itok=H5Jm0bBB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="373" height="520">

  </picture><p>Only a few of the creatures in Dance of the Elements die to Heartless Summoning, but getting half off all of your evoke costs from Ashling is a huge benefit. With Heartless Summoning it is much more plausible to evoke and elemental, and pay the WUBRG cost to keep the token around, effectively double spelling.</p><h3><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/drc/7/renewed-solidarity" rel="nofollow">Renewed Solidarity</a></h3><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/renewed-solidarity.jpg?itok=yQxrT2bA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="373" height="520">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/renewed-solidarity.jpg?itok=jTciNGhI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="373" height="520">
                  

  </picture><p>This rare from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/aetherdrift-top-10-vehicles-and-mounts" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6835fe23-96da-4b98-88c2-ac1b4dde1d34" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Aetherdrift</a> <a href="https://mtg.wiki/page/Aetherdrift/Commander_decks#Eternal_Might" rel="nofollow">Eternal Might pre-constructed</a> deck is a perfect fit with Ashling, the Limitless. The copies Ashling makes when you sacrifice the evoked elementals are essentially doubled at end of turn, and at a price point that is far far below other token doublers, while also costing less mana and giving a boost to your creatures.</p><h2>Blight Curse Upgrades</h2><p>For the first time in years, Magic has brought a focus to -1/-1 counters, capturing the Shadowmoor side of the plane. The last time we saw -1/-1 counters in a primary spotlight was in <em>Amonkhet </em>back in 2017, and <a href="https://mtg.wiki/page/Lorwyn_Eclipsed/Commander_decks#Blight_Curse" rel="nofollow">Blight Curse </a>features the first two Jund -1/-1 counter commander options in <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ecc/2/auntie-ool-cursewretch" rel="nofollow">Auntie Ool, Cursewretch</a>, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ecc/4/the-reaper-king-no-more" rel="nofollow">The Reaper, King No More</a>. Auntie is a value commander gaining cards and damage from your counters, while The Reaper is more theft focused.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/blight-curse-commanders.jpg?itok=8VXIA_fK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1134" height="780">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/blight-curse-commanders.jpg?itok=FzNc-R6N 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1134" height="780">
                  

  </picture><p>A quick aside: this deck has a 2 card low mana infinite combo in <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ecc/123/hapatra-vizier-of-poisons" rel="nofollow">Hapatra, Vizier of Poisons </a>and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ecc/46/blowfly-infestation" rel="nofollow">Blowfly Infestation</a> creating infinite death and enters triggers. This moves it out of the default bracket 2 state, so is something to talk about in rule 0 discussions, especially if you make any changes to the deck.</p><h3><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/hou/141/obelisk-spider" rel="nofollow">Obelisk Spider</a></h3><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/obelisk-spider.jpg?itok=qUwFUyy7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="373" height="520">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/obelisk-spider.jpg?itok=b1grhSLB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="373" height="520">
                  

  </picture><p>From <em>Hour of Devastation</em> in <em>Amonkhet</em> block, Obelisk Spider is such an obvious addition I almost didn’t include it here. But sometimes, the obvious needs to be said, and this spider’s ability to turn all your counter shenanigans into little damage cuts and life gain can help close out a game, and provide useful advantages.</p><h3><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dsc/22/persistent-constrictor" rel="nofollow">Persistent Constrictor</a></h3><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/persistent-constrictor.jpg?itok=9YWHhM39 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="373" height="520">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/persistent-constrictor.jpg?itok=OMRseIog 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="373" height="520">
                  

  </picture><p>When they made the <em>Duskmourn c</em>ommander decks I wonder if they were seeding this guy as an upgrade option for the future Blight Curse deck. While a bit costly, the Constrictor will ensure you have fresh new counters on your opponent’s creatures to manipulate, and help bleed out your opponent.</p><h3><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/rex/3/spitting-dilophosaurus" rel="nofollow">Spitting Dilophosaurus</a></h3><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/spitting-dilophosaurus.jpg?itok=ROoRUoJ_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="373" height="520">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/spitting-dilophosaurus.jpg?itok=eZGhVTPf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="373" height="520">
                  

  </picture><p>Traveling outside the Magic multiverse for a moment, from the <a href="https://scryfall.com/sets/rex" rel="nofollow">Jurassic Park cards</a> in <em>Ixalan</em>, we come across a perfect fit for this deck, as Spitting Dilophosaurus not only produces counters on entrance and attack, but ensures your opponents can’t blow when you’ve weakened their creatures.</p><h3><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/som/145/contagion-engine" rel="nofollow">Contagion Engine</a></h3><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/contagion-engine.jpg?itok=BSI56wr9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="373" height="520">

  </picture><p>With Auntie Ooi, Cursewrench, Contagion Engine goes beyond a targeted board wipe, to also potentially being a killshot against token players. This shrinkage, along with the ability to multiple proliferate make the Contagion Engine a powerful tool for Blight Curse players to adopt.</p><h3><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/som/145/contagion-engine" rel="nofollow">Generous Patron</a></h3><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/generous-patron.jpg?itok=yf_KR5oX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="373" height="520">

  </picture><p>This esteemed patron is a star of my <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ncc/7/kros-defense-contractor" rel="nofollow">Kros, Defense Contractor </a>deck where they ensure we get paid in cards for handing out new weapons (+1/+1 counters) to various parties. They have assured me that it will work much the same for the withering blighting counters that Blight Curse hands out, giving a consistent set of cards as you weaken your foes monsters.</p><hr><p>Overall, the Lorwyn Eclipsed Commander decks pay homage to the original block in flavorful and fun ways. They address player requests (like a June -1/-1 counter commander), and complement a banger of a set with even more fun.</p><p>Of the two, Blight Curse is the more powerful, and intriguing in many ways, as well as having higher valued reprints. That’s not to say that Dance of the Elements is without its upsides, but if I were picking one to grab it’d be Blight Curse, and working on adding a few more cards to it.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

<figcaption><em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream </em>is getting its own Nintendo Direct this week.</figcaption>

<p>Given that the Switch 2 has been released since <em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-march-2025-all-news-and-announcements" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9e9f0043-e970-4bd3-85c9-1c2e96dcc7e7" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">original announcement back in March</a>, I'd also be very surprised if we don't see a Switch 2 Edition for the game, but hey: if there's one thing Nintendo likes to do, it's surprise people.</p><p>According to Nintendo, you can expect roughly 20 minutes of new information about <em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</em>, so that should be more than enough to give you an idea of whether you want to grab this one or not.</p><p>If you're unfamiliar with <em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</em>, it's a sort of ambient life sim in which you can populate an island with Miis and watch them interact with one another in fun and strange ways.</p><p>The debut trailer for the game very much played up <em>Tomodachi Life</em>'s inherent weirdness, concluding as it did with a Mii being confronted by a giant version of one of their friends, <em>Metal Gear Solid 2 </em>Gurlugon-style.</p>
<p>Whether or not <em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream </em>gets a Switch 2 release, you'll be able to check it out when it launches sometime this year for the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Tomodachi-Life-Living-the-Dream-2786386.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Switch</a>.

<figcaption>The <em>Dynasty Warriors 3 </em>remaster will take a little longer to arrive than previously thought.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><em>Dynasty Warriors 3: Complete Edition Remastered </em>was technically first revealed alongside <em>Dynasty Warriors Origins</em>' first DLC <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dynasty-warriors-origins-dlc-remaster" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="8865ca2f-1071-4d07-a044-3a5661b38db2" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">back in August</a>, although at the time, Koei Tecmo was fairly cagey about which game was getting the remaster treatment.</p><p>Of course, since <em>Dynasty Warriors 3 </em>is a firm fan favorite, it was always one of the frontrunners, and so when <em>Dynasty Warriors 3</em>'s remaster was finally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-state-of-play-september-2025" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="cd5b7ba9-4473-41df-8d3c-8a1ff1c52f90" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">unveiled in September</a>, it didn't come as much of a surprise to fans.</p><p>The remaster will boast new visuals courtesy of Unreal Engine 5, as well as a host of other gameplay and performance improvements and tweaks. It'll also pack in the extra content included as part of the game's expanded <em>Xtreme Legends </em>release.</p><p>Other than those tweaks, however, Koei Tecmo seems to be aiming to make <em>Dynasty Warriors 3: Complete Edition Remastered </em>as close to the original as you remember, so if you're nostalgic for its signature 1-versus-1000 action, you're in luck.</p>
<p><em>Dynasty Warriors 3: Complete Edition Remastered </em>is now set to release sometime this year for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3841510/DYNASTY_WARRIORS_3_Complete_Edition_Remastered/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10016743" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/dynasty-warriors-3-complete-edition-remastered/9pnhw2mssq80" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and both Switch 2 and Switch.
