            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rootbound-ex-gothic-elex-developers<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A group of ex-Piranha Bytes developers have banded together to found new indie studio Brainlag Games, and the developer has also announced its first game in physics-based adventure&nbsp;<em>Rootbound</em>.</p>

<p>Per its new <a href="https://www.brainlag-games.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official website</a>, Brainlag was founded with the goal of "bring[ing] back what gaming was meant to be" and "creating immersive worlds with gameplay you haven't seen a hundred times".</p>

<p>That would certainly fit in with the development ethos of the studio founders' former outfit Piranha Bytes, whose name you might know best from the likes of&nbsp;<em>Gothic</em>,&nbsp;<em>Risen</em>, and<i>&nbsp;Elex</i>. The studio was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/piranha-bytes-shut-down-report" rel="nofollow">shuttered last year</a>, although neither Piranha Bytes nor parent company Embracer Group officially announced its closure.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rootbound-brainlag-games-ex-piranha-bytes-developers.jpg?itok=ikGB2ZLR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rootbound-brainlag-games-ex-piranha-bytes-developers.jpg?itok=9LvKIMX3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Rootbound&nbsp;</em>looks to be a very different prospect from its developers' former work.</figcaption></figure><p>That brings us to Brainlag, which was founded by Piranha Bytes veterans&nbsp;Markus Kloß, Maki Dieffenbach, Amadeus Weidmann, and André Hotz. Like Piranha Bytes, the studio is based in Essen in Germany.</p>

<p>Brainlag's first game&nbsp;<em>Rootbound&nbsp;</em>is, according to its Steam page, a "physics-based action adventure about a plantling's quest to save its home from a mysterious blight". Rather than being a fully-fledged 3D action RPG like&nbsp;<em>Gothic&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Risen</em>, it's a&nbsp;<em>Zelda</em>-style isometric affair.</p>

<p>Together with your sentient backpack, you will journey into the world of Akara, discovering "ancient puzzles" and fighting "dangerous monsters" as you seek to uncover a long-lost civilization's secrets.</p>

<p>By the looks of the debut trailer, the physics element of the game comes in a sort of <i>Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</i>-style environment manipulation mechanic whereby you can build bridges with planks, knock down stone walls, and interact with the world in other fun ways.</p>




<p>Unfortunately,&nbsp;<em>Rootbound&nbsp;</em>doesn't yet have a release date, but if you'd like to keep up with the game's progress, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3453490/Rootbound/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wishlist it on Steam right here</a>.</p>

<p>As for Piranha Bytes, the studio may be dead, but its debut title&nbsp;<em>Gothic&nbsp;</em>lives on in the form of the upcoming remake (developed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-thq-nordic-studio-alkimia-interactive-to-develop-gothic-remake" rel="nofollow">by Alkimia Interactive</a>), which is now <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gothic-1-remake-2025-release-window" rel="nofollow">scheduled to launch in 2025</a>.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Kojima Productions has revealed the&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>release date, and the long-awaited sequel is on its way to PlayStation 5 in summer.</p>

<p>Per a new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach&nbsp;</em>launches on June 26th. Unlike <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-directors-cut-pc-release-coming-to-steam" rel="nofollow">the original</a>, this one's a PS5 exclusive, although it's worth noting that&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>originally launched exclusively for PS4 before receiving a PC release (and then an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-xbox-release-kojima-ip" rel="nofollow">Xbox release</a>) later on down the line.</p>

<p>As well as revealing the release date, Kojima Productions also announced that pre-orders for&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>will begin on March 17th at 10am local time, so make sure to add that to your calendar if you want to get in early.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/death-stranding-2-release-date-forest.jpg?itok=aEHb70Y5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/death-stranding-2-release-date-forest.jpg?itok=qgZCeiNP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>officially launches in June.</figcaption></figure><p>In characteristic Kojima fashion, the release date was revealed as part of a mammoth 10-minute trailer showcasing more of what you can expect from&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2</em>.</p>

<p>Naturally, that includes more spectacular scenery, more labyrinthine conversations between extremely famous people, and lots more walking. I'm looking forward to it tremendously.</p>

<p>In the trailer, you can catch glimpses not only of returning characters like Norman Reedus' Sam Porter Bridges or&nbsp;Léa Seydoux's Fragile, but also new players like Luca Marinelli's Neil and Debra Wilson's Doctor, as well as&nbsp;<em>Mad Max: Fury Road&nbsp;</em>director George Miller as Tarman.</p>

<p>You can check out the release date announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>right here. It's worth setting aside ten minutes or so to watch the whole thing, as it's exactly the kind of bonkers excess we've come to expect from Hideo Kojima.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em>, it's the sequel to 2019's&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding</em>. Originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-confirmed-by-norman-reedus" rel="nofollow">leaked by lead actor Norman Reedus</a> in 2022, the game was subsequently officially revealed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-trailer-revealed-at-game-awards-2022" rel="nofollow">at that year's Game Awards</a>.</p>

<p>It's not the only project Kojima is currently working on, either; he's also currently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideo-kojima-announces-new-game-od-in-partnership-with-xbox-and-filmmaker-jordan-peele" rel="nofollow">working on the mysterious&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideo-kojima-announces-new-game-od-in-partnership-with-xbox-and-filmmaker-jordan-peele" rel="nofollow">OD</a>&nbsp;</em>alongside&nbsp;<em>Get Out&nbsp;</em>director Jordan Peele, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideo-kojima-announces-next-generation-espionage-action-game" rel="nofollow">"next-generation espionage action game"&nbsp;<em>Physint</em></a>.</p>

<p><em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>launches exclusively for <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a> on June 26th.</p>
