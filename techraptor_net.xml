<p>Romero told the Madrid conference that there were "a really good 110 people working on the game", and that, while it has "nothing" to do with the game on which the studio was previously working, it "incorporates a lot of the elements" from that project.</p><p>It's a little confusing, but it sounds like Romero's team is still only working on one game, which is essentially a redesigned and cut-down version of the project which it was previously developing prior to losing funding from a major publisher (probably Xbox).</p><p>Romero says the team is "not starting at ground zero" for the new game, and that the goal is to "take pieces out of [the previous game] and put [them] into a brand new indie game".</p><p>According to Romero, he's "never played a game like" the one his team is developing, and playing it for the first time will be "new" in the way that "going through <em>Elden Ring </em>was a really new experience". Typical Romero bluster or honest summary? We'll have to wait and see.</p><figure role="group">
