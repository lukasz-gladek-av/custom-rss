            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/chromagun-2-dye-hard-is-more-of-same-but-zanier-stil<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>ChromaGun 2: Dye Hard</em> is the latest of the <em>ChromaGun </em>color puzzle games from PM Studios. After the initial title's success, the ChromaGun is back once again to test players with their memory of basic color matching.</p>

<p>I got a chance to sit down and play 30 minutes of <em>ChromaGun </em>at Summer Game Fest. The demo opened with the standard fair for anyone familiar with these kinds of portal-like titles. In a testing facility you’ll be enticed to pick up the <em>ChromaGun</em>, getting just a single color at first your aim.</p>

The main way you progress is by successfully moving floating spheres around rooms. The way that you move them is by creating wall and ceiling panels of the same color.</p>

<p>A yellow sphere will be attracted to a yellow wall tile. This works when the switch you need the sphere to be on is located right under a tile. If the switch is between wall tiles then you may need to daisy chain it between two, in that case the sphere will move to an equidistant location between the two tiles.</p>

<h2>How Do You Make Purple Again?</h2>

<p>Adding further complication, different wall tiles and spheres will not just come in the primary colors – yellow, blue, and red – but also in Secondary colors. Forcing you to have to remember something basic like if you want your Blue Sphere to head towards the Purple wall tile then you’ll have to shoot your Sphere with the color Red.</p>

While there was no strict tutorial,&nbsp;<em>ChromaGun 2</em> did a good job to slowly layer mechanics.</p>

<p>A core theme within <em>ChromaGun 2</em>, something I learned as I leapt from a ledge straight into a portal was that ChromaGun’s ‘worlds’ are all based on alternate realities where you might trade out the sterile white walls and right angles, for curved structures, a visual filter that makes it look like you’re playing the game as a classic comic book, and the last ‘world’ I entered before I finished my time was a barnyard settings.</p>

<h2>Weird Worlds</h2>

<p>Each zone has a unique style that makes it easy to check where you are at any point, but didn’t vary too much in terms of gameplay. Regardless, it was an interesting reskin of what you’d expect to see in a game about completing tests.</p>

<p>Each zone additionally has a different robotic/AI voice as your tested who is confused upon your arrival, but interacts with you with a different personality.</p>

<p>If you’re a fan of the original ChromaGun title, or you’re into the idea of a puzzle game that leans heavily into color shifting and matching then this will likely be a title that you’ll want to keep an eye on. There’s a lot of times where you see a game attempt to totally reinvent itself between iterations, but if you’re good at what you do is that totally necessary?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/directive-8020-enhances-gameplay-putting-stealth-and-scares-in-players-hands<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've been a massive fan of Supermassive games since <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="8b369c29-3d2f-4f8f-ae11-ac3c77f5e39e" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/until-dawn-2024-review-new-faces-old-blood" rel="nofollow"><em>Until Dawn</em></a> and with every new title iterating on gameplay, scares, and ways to experience the horror with my friends, I was very excited to sit down and get my hands on a small portion of <em>Directive 8020</em> and talk with Executive Producer Dan McDonald.</p>

<p>My gameplay demo began with a tense but hopeful conversation between a new astronaut Young talking with her mission direction Stafford. During the conversation there are hints about the declining state of the world, how Young's father died four years prior, and that they would be ready to head to the stars once again to visit a planet that could inhabit life.</p>

<p>McDonald explained to me that this mission is one to visit and gather information about this new planet and how it might be habitable. The plan is to just fly by, but one thing leads to another and the crew needed to land.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/directive-8020-overgrowth.jpg?itok=0XygnpiC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/directive-8020-overgrowth.jpg?itok=CdMIy7TV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>After watching the cutscene, a discussion that McDonald said would continue to be flashed back to over the course of the story, the gameplay demo leapt ahead to Chapter 6 of the 8 Chapter story.</p>

<h2>Friends Or Enemies You Can't Trust</h2>

<p>Two Astronauts, Sermon and Stafford, were in the hydroponics lab aboard the spaceship. Canisters were broken and a strange organism was growing over them. From the darkness a humanoid figure steps forward, a perfect clone of one of the Astronauts until his face ripples unsettlingly.</p>

<p>Attacked by not just one, but two clones (one of which shapeshifts into a horrific alien creature), I was in control. Playing as Sermon, I was skulking around the service tunnels underneeth the main hydroponics area. The giant hunter seeking me out, I was able to try to crouch walking by it to make my escape.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/directive-8020-turning-point-choice.jpg?itok=Yee7Fz8D 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/directive-8020-turning-point-choice.jpg?itok=VF41BBmD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Failing that I was thrown into a QTE, quickly mashing the X button I was able to turn my stun baton on the creature and get away while it writhed in pain. The Stun Baton was a multi-use weapon with a brief recharge (luckily, it charged again in time before I needed it once more).</p>

<p>In these tunnels, there were also other options to distract or make my way past the creature. Running was an option, but McDonald also showed me that there were a variety of interactable objects that could take the Hunter's attention as well as a radar system that allows the player to briefly see the creature through walls.</p>

<p>Shortly after escaping, the two astronauts returned to the rest of the crew with a new fear that one of the party members was not what they seemed.</p>

<p>While the horror of other Dark Pictures games from Supermassive have been about a very recognizable foe, the thought of an enemy that could be one of the players (even one being played by a character) is a fantastic approach to horror. As well as being inspired by <em>The Thing</em> McDonald highlighted other sources such as <em>Event Horizon, Alien</em>, and specifically called out the purples and greens to add that eerie <em>Color Out Of Space</em> vibe to the game.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/directive-8020-attacked-human.jpg?itok=hxF3x39z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/directive-8020-attacked-human.jpg?itok=xTUXMC1m 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>While I didn't see too much, what I did see spoke wonders about the game. After getting to play through the game and understand more of the tense nature of the plot I got to talk with McDonald more about gameplay elements, multiplayer, and how the shift away from only walking and reactions to active stealth and combat will remain accessible to all skill levels.</p>

<h2>An Overall Upgrade</h2>

<p>In terms of gameplay all of the movement has been overhauled to align with a more traditional 3rd person horror title. McDonald highlighted the experiences working on <em>Devil In Me</em>, specifically the clamber mechanic, with how they could continue to reshape their movement.</p>

<p>It's not just movement related to stealth that's been improved either as changes have also been made to allow for more puzzle systems to be used in the game.</p>

<p>Highlighting a few of the choices that were made over the course of gameplay McDonald pulled up a detailed path showing where events you encounter are intended, and where they can split. He explained that with every choice you make you can then easily revert back to the choice right before.</p>

<p>They wanted to make sure that anyone playing the game could play it in a linear fashion, or they could go back through and retry choices over and over again to get the whole scope of the game without needing to replay it from scratch.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/directive-8020-05.jpg?itok=HNamyInN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/directive-8020-05.jpg?itok=2bwgkU8c 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Another important change was that instead of building the game for a three act structure, like a movie, instead each chapter followed the structure of a TV show episode. Understanding that as their games were becoming larger and more involved, it would be harder for players to complete them in a single sitting. By swapping to an episodic structure there are more places for players to conclude a single session, but be excited to pick up when the story continues.</p>

<h2>Accessible To Everyone, No Matter Your Skill Level</h2>

<p>The last important piece of information that I got about <em>Directive 8020</em> was that Movie Night mode is not only returning but has been improved. Movie Night, a mode where each character in the story can be assigned to a different player in your party, now functions not only with local play but over the internet, creating a fun group experience.</p>

<p>Additionally, while the game was becoming more mechanically complex in Movie Night mode you can adjust the difficulty and accessibility per player. This means someone who is familiar with video games and the Dark Pictures games can have normal QTE timing and stealth modes, while the senses of the Hunter can be turned down for a player less familiar with the controls.</p>

<p>As a game series that I love to play with friends of all different skill levels I was so happy to hear that a custom experience could be created to allow for everyone to have just as fun a time.</p>

<p><em>Directive 8020</em> is certainly one of the most anticipated releases for me coming out to Summer Game Fest and with the developments to the gameplay, and the understanding of the audience and wanting to include as many players as possible the team at Supermassive have really demonstrated an understanding for fans of their games.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/thick-as-thieves-preview-spiritual-successor-to-classic<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>What’s a good heist without high stakes? <em>Thick as Thieves</em> aims to up the ante with its PVPVE, competitive thievery. From Warren Specter’s studio, OtherSide Entertainment, this game has much potential.</p>

<p>We got a chance to see <em>Thick as Thieves</em> in action during a hands-off demonstration at Summer Game Fest 2025. Unfortunately, we were only able to see the single-player aspect of Thick as Thieves, since the venue’s internet decided to stop working.</p>

<p>Despite this, Director of Product Michael Fitch says that despite very much being a multiplayer game, the PVE aspect much also be important. So yes, you can play <em>Thick as Thieves</em> by yourself if you so choose.</p>



<h2>Pick Your Poison</h2>

<p>First things first: pick your character. Each character in <em>Thick as Thieves</em> has their own abilities; essentially, they each have one killer advantage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Spider, for instance, is quite mobile and is equipped with tools like a grappling hook to get on top of roofs and other obstacles. The Chameleon, on the other hand, can take the form of an NPC.</p>



<p>The Chameleon, in particular, sounds quite intriguing, as his playstyle revolves around subterfuge and trickery by trying to mimic the habits of an NPC.</p>

<p>Whatever the case, at the start of every match, each thief is assigned the same job by the Thieves Guild. The objective is to obtain a special book, which is purportedly hidden in a manor. We don’t know much beyond that, which is why collecting clues is crucial.</p>



<h2>Making Garrett Proud</h2>

<p>This does hearken back to games like <em>Thief</em> where you’d have to collect clues scattered around the environment to eventually find your way to the target. Indeed, <em>Thick as Thieves </em>is described as a spiritual successor to <em>Thief</em>, so you can expect it to share similar gameplay elements like reading those notes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Eventually, we find out how to obtain the book. The way in which you find your target piece of loot will change from game to game, so there is a degree of unpredictability here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Grabbing the target will start a timer that alerts other thieves that someone has the item and are working their way to the exit. This is where, presumably, most players will come out of the woodwork and try to fight you.</p>



<h2><em>Thick as Thieves&nbsp;</em>Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>I wish I could have seen more of the multiplayer aspect, because that’s really at the heart of <em>Thick as Thieves’</em> gameplay. It simply doesn’t seem quite as exciting with one player.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And that’s related to another concern of mine: the game’s longevity. Immersive sims are already a niche genre, and <em>Thick as Thieves </em>will depend on a healthy audience. I just don’t know if that audience is there, but I really hope it is.</p>

<p>But, with minds like Warren Specter behind <em>Thick as Thieves</em>, I have faith in the project. Should it gather the numbers needed to thrive, this title has potential to create a lot of long-lasting memories.&nbsp;</p>
