            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-sims-1-and-2-re-released<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has shadow-dropped re-releases for&nbsp;<em>The Sims 1&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>2&nbsp;</em>as part of the franchise's 25th anniversary, and you can pick both of them up right now on PC.</p>

<p>Starting from today,&nbsp;<em>The Sims Legacy Collection&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Sims 2 Legacy Collection&nbsp;</em>are both available on PC via Steam, Epic, and the EA app, although you will need to install and use EA's proprietary software on Steam and Epic to play them.</p>

<p>Both packs bundle in&nbsp;the base games and all of the expansions released for both of them throughout their lifetimes, as well as&nbsp;<em>Sims 4</em>-themed bonus content to sweeten the deal. It's a deal that might need quite a bit of sweetening, too, given that the first&nbsp;<em>Sims</em>&nbsp;will set you back $20 and the second will cost $30 (although there's also a $40 bundle).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-sims-1-and-2-re-released-sims-2.jpg?itok=bh8deMti 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-sims-1-and-2-re-released-sims-2.jpg?itok=vcPPqQbh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You can now say "sul sul" to the first two&nbsp;<em>Sims&nbsp;</em>games on PC.</figcaption></figure><p>Aside from the included bonus content, it seems like these aren't remasters of&nbsp;<em>The Sims&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Sims 2</em>, but re-releases, which means you shouldn't expect too much in the way of revamped visuals and gameplay.</p>

<p>Still, if you're looking for some nostalgic retro thrills and you're yearning for a return to the days when not everything in&nbsp;<em>The Sims&nbsp;</em>was sold via DLC or microtransaction, then you'll definitely want to pick these re-releases up.</p>

<p>You can check out the (rather disturbing) launch trailer for&nbsp;<em>The Sims&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Sims 2&nbsp;</em>right here. Be aware that it contains at least one clown.</p>




<p>These re-releases harken back to a simpler time, when the direction EA was taking with&nbsp;<em>The Sims&nbsp;</em>was perhaps a bit simpler and more conventional.</p>

<p>Back in September, the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-no-plans-the-sims-5" rel="nofollow">revealed that it has no plans</a> to create&nbsp;<em>The Sims 5&nbsp;</em>anytime soon, and that the focus is instead on creating more content for&nbsp;<em>The Sims 4</em>, as well as updating the game to ensure it keeps up with modern standards.</p>

<p>If you wish the series would return to traditional flagship games rather than this live service-adjacent model, then it looks like&nbsp;<em>The Sims 1&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>2</em>'s re-releases may be where you get your money's worth. They're both available now on Steam, Epic, and the EA app.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sony DMCAs Unofficial Bloodborne 60FPS Patch]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloodborne-60fps-patch-dmca<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has issued a DMCA takedown against a fan-made patch that allowed 2015 action RPG&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>to run at 60FPS, sparking fresh speculation that a remaster of the game could be in the works.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/manfightdragon.bsky.social/post/3lh2cipa4rk2v" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">modder Lance McDonald</a>, who's also one of the most prominent members of the&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>community, Sony asked him to "remove links to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloodborne-60fps-patch-dropping-this-month" rel="nofollow">the patch</a> [he] posted on the internet" via DMCA notice, which means it's no longer available for download.</p>

<p>In the replies, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/powerful.crabf.art/post/3lh2eegkh4c2x" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">users</a> are <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/turbohotdog.bsky.social/post/3lh2eg7nc3s2e" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">speculating</a> that Sony's sudden flurry of activity aimed at the patch could mean that the company is working on its own version of&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>that runs at 60FPS.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bloodborne-60fps-patch-dmca-old-hunters.jpg?itok=Q6hcoT7F 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bloodborne-60fps-patch-dmca-old-hunters.jpg?itok=n1bloLO- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sony has DMCA'd a 60FPS&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>patch, but does that mean anything?</figcaption></figure><p>There is precedent for this standpoint. Back in 2022, Konami <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-leak-dmcad-by-konami" rel="nofollow">issued a DMCA notice</a> against a leak for a then-upcoming&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>game, and that game subsequently turned out to be&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill: The Short Message</em>, so that DMCA was issued in order for Konami to get ahead of the leaks.</p>

<p>Of course, the obvious (and unfortunate) fallacy in the argument is that companies don't always issue DMCA takedowns because they're planning on creating something similar to what's been taken down.</p>

<p>Studios like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-2-dmcas-gta-mods-save-file" rel="nofollow">Take-Two</a> are extremely <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-issues-another-wave-of-dmcas-for-gta-mods" rel="nofollow">au fait</a> with DMCA takedown notices, and often, those takedowns are issued simply because the company is protective of its IP and doesn't want anyone else coming within sniffing distance of making money from that IP.</p>

<p>It's entirely possible that Sony has only just become aware of the&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>60FPS patch and that it has no intention of doing anything with the IP; it just doesn't want anyone else doing anything with it either.</p>




<p>It's a shame if the DMCA is purely for IP protection reasons, because&nbsp;a&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>remaster is frequently requested by fans thanks to the game's popularity (as well as its relatively shoddy performance in its current state).</p>

<p>Sony <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-state-of-play-february-2023-here-are-all-news-announcements" rel="nofollow">has been known</a> to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-state-of-play-january-2024-recap-heck-out-all-news-trailers-and-reveals" rel="nofollow">hold State of Play presentations</a> around this time of year, though, so with all that said, it is possible we could be about to learn that a&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>remaster is indeed in the works.</p>

<p>For now, you'll have to content yourself with <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/bloodborne/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">picking up the original on PS4</a>. It's also playable on PS5 via backwards compatibility, of course.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/spider-man-2-pc-port-bad-reviews<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Marvel's Spider-Man 2&nbsp;</em>has officially hit PC, and fans are flocking to Steam to express their dissatisfaction with what they see as an unsatisfactory port, citing extensive technical issues.</p>

<p>The game landed on Steam yesterday, and a quick look at its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2651280/Marvels_SpiderMan_2/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reviews on the platform</a> shows a Mixed rating across almost 2,000 reviews (at time of writing), which isn't a great look for a first-party Sony game that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-sales-pass-548-milion-units-marvels-spider-man-2-has-sold-10-million-copies" rel="nofollow">sold gangbusters</a> on PlayStation and serves as one of the company's flagship titles.</p>

<p>Common themes have emerged across the negative reviews, too. One user <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198047951793/recommended/2651280/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">says</a> that calling the port "rough" would be "an understatement", pointing to improperly-loaded features like lighting, extra-slow framerates, and regular freezes and stutters, which <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/RootyBlues/recommended/2651280/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">other users</a> have also <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199237301221/recommended/2651280/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">complained about</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvels-spider-man-2-pc-port-negative-reviews-city.jpg?itok=342RL_r5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvels-spider-man-2-pc-port-negative-reviews-city.jpg?itok=qq17ncnN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Marvel's Spider-Man 2&nbsp;</em>is picking up some bad reviews on PC.</figcaption></figure><p>For what it's worth, some reviewers are <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198276342581/recommended/2651280/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">saying</a> that they've been able to get the game running with relatively <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/GeneralKamo/recommended/2651280/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">few problems</a>, so it seems the crashes and bugs aren't affecting all players equally.</p>

<p>Still, though, enough players are complaining about technical issues with&nbsp;<em>Spider-Man 2</em>'s PC port that I'd imagine Sony will issue an emergency patch in the next few days to address some of the more common problems.</p>

<p>The timing of this issue is particularly unfortunate for Sony. Just a couple of days ago, the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-psn-account-requirement-incentives" rel="nofollow">walked back its PSN requirement</a> for certain PC single-player games, including&nbsp;<em>Spider-Man 2</em>, promising incentives for those games if you linked a PSN account.</p>

<p>It's a move that's bound to garner goodwill from the PC gaming community given just how <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-pc-playstation-backtrack" rel="nofollow">unpopular mandatory PSN accounts are</a> with those folks, but low-quality PC ports like this one apparently is will probably do a lot to erase that goodwill.</p>
