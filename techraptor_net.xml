            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced the release date for its upcoming wheelchair basketball sports game&nbsp;<em>Drag x Drive</em>, with the Switch 2-exclusive title set to launch later this summer.</p>

<p>Per the Nintendo Today news app,&nbsp;<em>Drag x Drive&nbsp;</em>will bring its rather unique-looking gameplay loop to the Switch 2 on August 14th. Essentially, it looks like it'll be occupying the same space in the Switch 2's lineup as&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-arms-trailers-shows-off-fighters-customization" rel="nofollow"><em>Arms&nbsp;</em>did for the original console</a>.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Drag x Drive</em>, it's a game that sees players taking part in a sport that looks like a cross between wheelchair basketball and&nbsp;<em>Rocket League</em>, and it uses the Joy-Con 2 controllers' new mouse functionality.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/drag-x-drive-release-date-august-hoop.jpg?itok=xit-MTbt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/drag-x-drive-release-date-august-hoop.jpg?itok=M6vZbNiL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Drag x Drive&nbsp;</em>looks to be one of the Switch 2's more unique games, and it's coming in August.</figcaption></figure><p>The game will pit teams of three players against one another, and each player will need to use both Joy-Con 2 controllers in their mouse configuration in order to push the wheels of their wheelchair around the court.</p>

<p>When you're ready to make a shot, you'll have to use your Joy-Con to mimic the movement of tossing the ball in the hoop. Alternatively, you can wheel yourself off the ramp next to the hoop for a slam dunk.</p>

<p>Despite&nbsp;<em>Drag x Drive</em>'s similarity to wheelchair basketball, journalist Laura Kate Dale <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/laurakbuzz.bsky.social/post/3lmpb7rrq7c2i" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">stated back in April</a> that Nintendo staff were told to refer to the wheelchairs in the game as "vehicles". The reason for this decision is unclear.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Drag x Drive&nbsp;</em>is just one of a number of Switch 2 games being rolled out (no pun intended) during the console's initial launch window. Others include flagship racer&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a>, 3D platformer&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2" rel="nofollow"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></a>, and a host of third-party ports as well.</p>




<p>Said ports apparently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-third-party-game-launch-sales-report" rel="nofollow">haven't been performing too well</a> in comparison to first-party Nintendo titles, although CD Projekt Red's&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>has apparently been a winner for the company, outselling the initial run for the Switch port of&nbsp;<em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</em>.</p>

<p><em>Drag x Drive</em>&nbsp;launches exclusively for Nintendo Switch 2 on August 14th. Let's hope we get to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/super-smash-bros-ultimate-livestream-reveals-arms-fighter" rel="nofollow">see one of its characters</a> in a new&nbsp;<em>Super Smash Bros.</em> installment&nbsp;sometime soon.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-xbox-pc-apps-aggregated-library-is-coming-to-insiders-this-week.1226694/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Xbox has announced that starting this week, those signed up to its Insider program can get a sneak preview of the Xbox PC app's new aggregated library feature, which gathers games from different storefronts together under the Xbox banner.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/06/23/xbox-june-update-copilot-for-gaming-aggregated-gaming-library/#PCUpdates" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">update</a> on the official Xbox website, the company says the aggregated library update will begin rolling out to Insider members this week. It'll also be available on the ROG Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X, both of which were revealed during the Xbox <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">summer show earlier this month</a>.</p>

<p>The new aggregated library will allow players to "conveniently launch games from Xbox, Game Pass, Battle.net and other leading PC storefronts from a single library", with additional support for more storefronts coming "over time".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-pc-app-aggregated-library-default-view.jpg?itok=kxnxOzj- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-pc-app-aggregated-library-default-view.jpg?itok=3SU1yJZI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Xbox PC app will soon let you view games from other libraries besides Xbox.</figcaption></figure><p>Although Xbox doesn't specify which PC storefronts you'll be able to view through the app, it's no stretch to imagine that the list probably includes popular apps like Steam, GOG, and the Epic Games Store, among others.</p>

<p>As well as the aggregated library, a new publisher channel will also be added to the Xbox PC app in the next few weeks. You can access it through the Game Pass tab, and it'll show you "iconic characters from various publishers" in order to highlight "the diversity of publishers and games in Game Pass".</p>

<p>Console players, meanwhile, are getting more customization options for the Most Recently Used tab; you'll be able to hide system apps, pin favorites, and reduce tile numbers to make the window look however you like.</p>

<p>It'll also soon be easier to see in-game benefits for free-to-play games like&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em>&nbsp;if you're a Game Pass subscriber thanks to the More Benefits page.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-pc-app-most-recently-used-console.jpg?itok=WFJwN7KY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-pc-app-most-recently-used-console.jpg?itok=gVFP4baE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Xbox console improvements are coming soon as well.</figcaption></figure><p>Elsewhere in Xbox news, the company recently revealed that its next generation of hardware <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/next-gen-xbox-hardware-sneak-peek" rel="nofollow">won't be tied to a single device or a single store</a>, so it's entirely possible that this multiple-storefront approach will extend to next-gen Xbox consoles as well.</p>

<p>We'll likely have to wait at least a couple of years to find out whether that's the case, though. In the meantime, the aggregated library will be rolled out this week as a preview for Xbox Insider members, so check it out if you're signed up.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ambitious Voxel Sandbox Game Hytale Canceled as Dev Shuts Down]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hytale-canceled-dev-shuts-down</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ambitious-voxel-sandbox-game-hytale-canceled-as-dev-shuts-down.1226628/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>developer Hypixel Studios has announced that the ambitious voxel sandbox game has been canceled, and that the studio itself will be shutting down as well.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/6/a-difficult-update-about-hytale" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>website, Hypixel co-founder Noxy says that the decision to shut the game down came "after years of pushing forward, adapting, and exploring every possible path".</p>

<p>Noxy says that despite a major engine reboot,&nbsp;<em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>needed "a lot more time" in order for the developers to "get it to a place where it could support the ambitious vision" they had for the game. According to Noxy, Hypixel's "vision evolved" and its "technical ambitions grew more complex" over time.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hytale-canceled-dev-shutting-down-monsters.jpg?itok=n6GAShfQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hytale-canceled-dev-shutting-down-monsters.jpg?itok=hxGeTByO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>is shutting down, and its developer is no more, unfortunately.</figcaption></figure><p>The&nbsp;<em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>team looked at "reducing scope, adjusting timelines, and finding new angles to keep moving forward", according to Noxy, but each option "would have meant compromising on what made&nbsp;<em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>special in the first place" and would have meant the game was not "the game [fans] deserve".</p>

<p>As for Riot Games, which acquired&nbsp;<em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>and Hypixel (the studio, rather than the&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>server; more on that in a moment) <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/riot-games-hytale-acqusition-adds-blocky-adventure-to-roster" rel="nofollow">back in 2020</a>, Noxy says the&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>studio is supporting Hypixel during the cancellation of&nbsp;<em>Hytale</em>.</p>

<p>According to Noxy, Riot is "ensuring [the] team is supported with generous severance and resources to help them find what's next", a move Noxy describes as "not just thoughtful", but also "human".</p>

<p>When it comes to the&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>Hypixel server, Noxy assures fans that said server won't be affected by&nbsp;<em>Hytale</em>'s cancellation; that server is run separately from the studio, even though they share a name, so it'll "continue to operate as usual".</p>




<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>was, its creators describe it as a game that "combines the scope of a sandbox with the depth of a roleplaying game".</p>

<p><em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>would have taken place in a procedurally-generated world in which players could construct buildings and other structures, embark on adventures, and even use script to create minigames and much more. Sadly, of course, none of that will be possible within the game now.</p>

<p>The shutdown of Hypixel and the cancellation of&nbsp;<em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>comes among a wider wave of studios <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-and-closes-studio-making-it" rel="nofollow">closing down</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/jagex-layoffs" rel="nofollow">reducing their headcount</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/people-can-fly-layoffs-projects-canceled" rel="nofollow">canceling projects</a>, with companies both big and small among the affected.</p>
