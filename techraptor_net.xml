            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gothic-1-remake-2025-release-window<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Alkimia Interactive has revealed a new&nbsp;<em>Gothic 1 Remake&nbsp;</em>release window, although it's perhaps not quite as specific as you might like if you've been waiting for the game since its announcement.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1297900/announcements/detail/519700531080333166" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post on Steam</a>, Alkimia wishes the game's fans and followers a happy new year, promising that 2025 will be "a truly key year" for&nbsp;<em>Gothic 1 Remake&nbsp;</em>and that it is "working tirelessly" to release the game.</p>

<p>A user named Mr Patrick <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1297900/eventcomments/600766396226347151?snr=1_5_9_#c600766396226353492" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">commented on that post</a>,&nbsp;saying that Alkimia "won't even inform [us] about [the] release date" after telling players they would "get the game in 2024". Alkimia refutes this claim in <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1297900/eventcomments/600766396226347151?snr=1_5_9_#c600766396226353606" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a reply</a>, then says that&nbsp;<em>Gothic 1 Remake&nbsp;</em>"will be released in 2025".</p>

<p>Indeed, a collector's edition for the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gothic-1-remake-collectors-edition" rel="nofollow">was revealed in April</a>, allowing players to spend huge amounts of money on a game that still didn't have a release date or window nailed down.</p>

<p>It's nice to know that the two studios haven't given up on&nbsp;<em>Gothic 1 Remake</em>. Presumably, we'll be getting a more concrete release date sometime in the next few months, but we'll have to wait and see on that front.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Gothic 1 Remake</em>, it is, as you may have guessed, a remake of the first&nbsp;<em>Gothic</em>, although "reimagining" might be a little closer to the truth.</p>

<p>The original&nbsp;<em>Gothic</em>'s setting and basic plot setup remain intact, but the remake will add a number of more modern quality-of-life features, as well as a visual overhaul and other changes. Alkimia describes the project as "faithful".</p>

<p>We still don't know when&nbsp;<em>Gothic 1 Remake&nbsp;</em>will launch, but when it does, it'll arrive on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1297900/Gothic_1_Remake/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10005976" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/gothic-1-remake/9nbrlcpw4zgv" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.&nbsp;</p>
