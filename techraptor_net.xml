            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/ranking-units-from-new-warhammer-40k-death-korps-army-box<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Games Workshop sent us along a brand new box of their <em>Warhammer 40K</em>&nbsp;Death Korps of Krieg Army Box, and I set to work reading through the rules (the box contains data cards and a nice glossy version of the Astra Militarum Codex) and checking out the models. Now that I've got a good handle on everything, let's run through a quick ranking of the models in the Army Box.</p>

<h2>#4 - Death Riders</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-death-korps-death-riders.jpeg?itok=nk37L9oj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-death-korps-death-riders.jpeg?itok=vSKukE9W 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Death Riders gallop in at the top of our list! Image: Games Workshop</figcaption></figure><p>Okay, okay... here's the big secret with this list: all of the models included in this Army Box are pretty damn good. But I set out to challenge myself to rank them from "worst" to "best." So I'm shocking even myself by saying that the Death Riders - while looking extremely cool on their enhanced Krieg Steeds - don't quite live up to the excitement of the rest of the models in the box.</p>

<p>With a 10" move (doesn't that feel a little slow for cavalry? The Attilan Rough Riders have a 12" move) and bearing a lascarbine and a frag lance, they're fine at a distance, but nothing extraordinary. They also have a power sabre and their steeds' claws for when you're done charging. They also have a special ability "Screening Line," allowing them to make a Normal 6" move whenever an enemy gets within 9" of them.</p>

<p>None of this is bad, in fact they can be quite a handful on the table... but there's just not much too them!</p>

<h2>#3 - Lord Marshal Dreir</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-death-korps-lord-marshal-drier.jpeg?itok=ru9Egrl- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-death-korps-lord-marshal-drier.jpeg?itok=Rm6Jm5Vv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Lord Marshal leads from horseback, hard to get him into a tank! Image: Games Workshop</figcaption></figure><p>Hmm... maybe I'm just a horse hater? Coming in at number three is Lord Marshal Dreir, an epic hero and officer for Krieg who can be attached to the aforementioned Death Riders. He's also got a 10" move, and has 6 wounds. Those 6 wounds aren't as bad as they sound, as he has "Feel No Pain 6+" and the "Tough To Kill" special ability which basically allows you to re-set him up if he's destroyed by rolling a 2 or better once per game.</p>

<p>Not too shabby! Add to that his "Leading the Charge" special ability, which gives his unit's melee weapons the "Devastating Wounds" ability (crits can't be invuln saved against). Speaking of weapons, he is an infantry chopper with his Sabre of Sacrifice, which has Anti-Infantry 4+ (pairing nicely with the Devastating Wounds from a charge).</p>

<p>But that's... pretty much it for him. Yes, he has the ability to give up to 3 Orders to his units, but other than that he's just armed with a laspistol. For a character larger than life like Dreir, it would have been nice to see him kitted out a bit more.</p>

<h2>#2 - Kreig Combat Engineers</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-death-korps-combat-engineers.jpeg?itok=KaCymLlK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-death-korps-combat-engineers.jpeg?itok=DJoPc0sg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Now THIS is what I think of when I think about Death Korps! Image: Games Workshop</figcaption></figure><p>Now we're talkin'! Of all the new <em>Warhammer 40K</em> Death Korps units included in this box, the Krieg Combat Engineers bring a lot of flexibility and some serious firepower. Each model comes with a standard Auto pistol and trench club, but you can upgrade individual models with flamers, combat shotguns, and more to suit your needs.</p>

<p>Also, these little dudes are meant to get moving on the battlefield with their "Scout 6"" ability, and their "Remote Mine" ability (which sports an incredible miniature to serve as a marker) can really do some damage. It reads: "Once per battle, at the start of your Shooting phase, you can select one enemy unit within 12" of the bearer and roll one D6: on a 3+, that enemy unit suffers D6 mortal wounds, or D3+3 mortal wounds instead if it is a Vehicle or Fortifications unit." OUCH!</p>

<p>I also love the look of them... maybe that's one of the reasons I'm instantly drawn to them. Krieg just look kinda off on horses. They should be crawling on their bellies through razorwire, not galloping on mutated horses!</p>

<h2>#1 - Artillery Team</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-death-korps-artillery-team.jpeg?itok=4o-Ew-eD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-death-korps-artillery-team.jpeg?itok=fHEX1Ng8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>When you truly need to bring the BOOM! Image: Games Workshop</figcaption></figure><p>Finally, let's get to the most gorgeous model in the set - and in my opinion the one that packs the most punch! While not tied specifically to Death Korps, the Artillery Team model is a slow-rolling source of death for all unlucky enough to fall within its sights. While it only has a 3" move, as you'd expect from an Artillery Team, the unit has a 7 toughness, a 3+ save, and 10 wounds!</p>

<p>But what really makes this so nasty is the choice of builds here. You can build the Artillery Team with a Heavy Mortar (pictured), a siege cannon, a heavy quad launcher, or a multiple rocket launcher. Siege and heavy quad are fun options, but for me it's all about either the heavy mortar (48" range, D6+3 attacks, 5+ BS, 8 strength, -1 AP, 2 Damage per hit) or the multiple rocket launcher (48" range, D6+3 attacks, 5+ BS, 2 strength, -1 AP, 1 Damage per hit).</p>

<p>If you're looking to punch through heavy armor, take the high-strength heavy mortar. But if you want to whittle down infantry, the multiple rocket launcher has Anti-Infantry 3+ (meaning you wound infantry on a wound roll of 3 or better!) and is a really strong option.&nbsp;</p>

<p>No matter the build, you add to that the "Remorseless Barage" ability which reads: "In your Shooting phase, after this model has shot, if one or more of those attacks made with an Indirect Fire weapon [Giaco's note: all the options have Indirect Fire] scored a hit against an enemy unit, that unit must take a Battle-shock test (if an Infantry unit is hit by one or more attacks made by a multiple rocket launcher, they must subtract 1 from their Battle-shock test when doing so)."</p>

<p>So those are my rankings! How wrong am I? Please sound off in the comments and show me the error of my ways!</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-soul-aside-psn-requirement-pc-removed</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-published-lost-soul-aside-wont-require-a-psn-account-on-pc-it-seems.1080744/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-soul-aside-psn-requirement-pc-removed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and developer Ultizero Games appear to have quietly removed the requirement for PC players of upcoming action RPG&nbsp;<em>Lost Soul Aside&nbsp;</em>to have a PSN account in order to play.</p>

<p>According to the game's Steam <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3378960/history/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">update history</a> (thanks, <a href="https://twistedvoxel.com/psn-account-no-longer-needed-for-lost-soul-aside-on-steam/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Twisted Voxel</a>), the PSN requirement was removed back in December, but Sony didn't announce the removal of said requirement at that point.</p>

<p>Given that&nbsp;<em>Lost Soul Aside&nbsp;</em>isn't out yet, it's technically possible that the requirement was removed for some arcane administrative reason, and that Sony still fully intends to require PC players to sign up with a PSN account in order to play the game on PC.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lost-soul-aside-psn-pc-requirement-removed-snow.jpg?itok=UHtB-OHH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lost-soul-aside-psn-pc-requirement-removed-snow.jpg?itok=ghWu7udA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Lost Soul Aside&nbsp;</em>may be one of the only PlayStation-published PC games not to require a PSN account to play.</figcaption></figure><p>However, if the PSN account requirement truly has been removed, then that would indicate it won't be necessary to sign up for a PSN account in order to play&nbsp;<em>Lost Soul Aside&nbsp;</em>when it eventually comes out on PC.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, PSN accounts are required to play multiplayer Sony-published games on PC; games like&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima&nbsp;</em>require one, if only for their multiplayer modes, while titles like&nbsp;<em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Returnal&nbsp;</em>don't need you to have a PSN account to play on Steam.</p>

<p>This isn't always the case, though. According to its <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2531310/info/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB page</a>, the upcoming PC port of&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered&nbsp;</em>will require players to sign up for PSN, even though it's a single-player game with no multiplayer component.</p>

<p>The PSN requirement for PC games is an issue for which Sony has gotten into trouble in the past. When Sony announced it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-pc-playstation-account-link" rel="nofollow">would begin imposing a PSN account requirement</a> on&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>players, the backlash was so great that the company was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-pc-playstation-backtrack" rel="nofollow">forced to walk its decision back</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-psn-requirement-pc.jpg?itok=SvbBRv23 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-psn-requirement-pc.jpg?itok=W1r2w-4m 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered&nbsp;</em>will, for some reason, require a PSN account to play on PC.</figcaption></figure><p>We'll get to see whether&nbsp;<em>Lost Soul Aside</em>'s PSN account removal is for real when the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-soul-aside-release-window-2025" rel="nofollow">launches sometime this year</a>. It's set to arrive on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3378960/Lost_Soul_Aside/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/lost-soul-aside/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a> when it does.

<hr><h2>Third Place -&nbsp;1000xRESIST</h2>



<p>Developer: Sunset Visitor | Release Date: May 9th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Tyler Chancey</p>

<p>Sunset Visitor's narrative game tells a potent tale, one that blends multiple themes with messy three-dimensional characters. The tale of Watcher and her glimpse into the life of her sovereign The All Mother is a nuanced spotlight on the effects of traumas small and large cascading into society. It is a meditative experience about what we do with our emotional baggage and how it can lead to the most horrible acts and the most noble of sacrifices.</p>

<p>For a debut title by a new studio, it is a narrative with measured confidence. One that expresses itself with passion, one that is spellbinding to experience start to finish</p>

<h2>Second Place - Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</h2>



<p>Developer: MachineGames | Release Date: December 9th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Andrew Stretch</p>

<p>You can create a game with a charming lead man with a fedora and a bullwhip that solves ancient puzzles, but it won't truly become<em> Indiana Jones</em> if the writing doesn't match the feel. A perfect mix of knowledgeable investigation into ancient cultures, sinister enemies monologuing, and quippy banter (but not too much of the last part.)</p>

<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> finds that mix introducing the players to a mystery and continuing to expand upon it, to new memorable characters that feel fully fleshed out in the world and giving us an Indiana Jones to embody that nails the original aesthetic to fulfil the nostalgia. All while offering new fans to the genre a faithful take to continue to explore the greater franchise (except <em>Crystal Skull</em>â€¦ you can ignore that one)</p>

<h2>Winner - Metaphor: ReFantazio</h2>



<p>Developer: Atlus | Release Date: October 11th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Robert Scarpinito</p>

<p>For everyone who cries out against politics in their video games, <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> defiantly asks, "What if everything in the game was political?" It has the subtlety of a nuclear bomb, with metaphors veiled so thinly you could barely see the shrink wrap. Nonetheless, it's a poignant, meaningful story, especially amid the reality we've all (sort of) shared these past few years.</p>

<p><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> goes beyond simply saying, "This thing is unequivocally bad." There's nuance in its messaging, providing the player a launchpad to critically think for themself. For example, racism socioeconomically harms people, so we should see everyone as equals. But if you go too far, do we lose what makes each person and their culture special?</p>

<p>Louis and Sanctism aren't quite 1-to-1 caricatures of real-life figures, but there are enough parallels that the line between fantasy and reality can blur a bit. Is strongman leadership all it's cracked up to be? Is a church state really about religion, or power?</p>

<p>That blurring of reality and fantasy seems to be Studio Zero's goal, as portrayed by the (slightly convoluted) fantasy book within the game. The protagonist and his party often refer to a book about a skyscraper-laden utopia, both idealizing and questioning it. It's a direct commentary on what the player can and should do with the game itself.</p>

<p>Much like the <em>Persona </em>games before it, it's easy to come away with the overall message painting humanity in a bad light. But in reality, it's about finding the internal will and hope to fight for a better tomorrow for yourself and the ones around you.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-modding-workaround<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>players have found a workaround for the game's recent clampdown on skin mods (as well as other mods), but it could result in your account being banned.</p>

<p>As reported on <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/marvel-rivals/marvel-rivals-players-already-found-a-way-to-bring-mods-back-3028424/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Dexerto</a>, while it's no longer possible to simply use a mod manager to place&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>skin mods into the game's directories and expect them to work when booting up a match, a new workaround may still allow you to use your favorite mods.</p>

<p>There is, of course, a catch. Modding steadfastly remains a violation of NetEase's terms and conditions when it comes to&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>, so you could get banned if you're discovered using them, but that's always been the case.</p>

You still can, but there's a big catch.</figcaption></figure><p>I don't want to get too technical here, but essentially, the new workaround involves gaining direct access to a certain kind of&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>file with the .pak extension.</p>

<p>As Dexerto points out, there's also <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/marvelrivals/mods/1162" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">another way</a> to circumvent&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' mod ban, but this one's creator has admitted it's a "temporary fix" and that unless you've got a specific hardware setup, you could damage your storage drive if you use it for character model modding.</p>

<p>In case you need a reminder, NetEase <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-modding-clampdown" rel="nofollow">clamped down</a> on&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>modding with the advent of Season 1 last week, introducing a new authenticity check for character skins that essentially invalidates most existing mods.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>skin modding scene was (and, to a certain extent, remains) quite active prior to this clampdown, with users creating mods that turned characters into the likes of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball</em>'s <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/marvelrivals/mods/105" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Vegeta</a>,&nbsp;<em>GTA: San Andreas</em>' <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/marvelrivals/mods/63" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">CJ</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/marvelrivals/mods/83" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Big Smoke</a>, and&nbsp;<em>Chainsaw Man</em>'s <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/marvelrivals/mods/80" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Pochita</a>.</p>
