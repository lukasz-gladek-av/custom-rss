            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Shiro Games has announced a new DLC pack for&nbsp;<em>Wartales&nbsp;</em>in the form of&nbsp;<em>Contract: The Fief</em>, and, as the name suggests, it'll put you in control of your very own domain when it launches later this month.</p>

<p>Per a press release, the DLC, which was first teased as part of&nbsp;<em>Wartales</em>' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wartales-roadmap-late-2025" rel="nofollow">most recent roadmap</a>, will launch on September 25th, and it'll offer you a domain in which you can "enact laws, oversee industry and tradecraft, and manage state affairs".</p>

<p>As your fiefdom develops, you can construct new buildings, watch as factions emerge and battle one another for dominance, and more. It's up to you whether your domain will become known for diplomacy and scholarship or for brutal militarism (or anything in between!).</p>

<p>What's more, the new DLC will integrate seamlessly with&nbsp;<em>Wartales</em>' existing campaigns, so you'll be able to manage your fief and issue commands as you play through one of the other stories on offer.</p>

<p>Game director Quentin Lapeyre says&nbsp;<em>Contract: The Fief&nbsp;</em>will add "a whole new way to interact with the world of&nbsp;<em>Wartales</em>", and that it'll allow you to "expand [your] horizons and rule over [your] own fief" without distracting you from your usual mercenary activities.</p>

<p>You can check out a (very brief) trailer introducing&nbsp;<em>Contract: The Fief&nbsp;</em>and its various gameplay additions right here.</p>




<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Wartales</em>, it's a gritty medieval mercenary RPG that blends open-world exploration with tactical turn-based combat, pitting you against everything from "petty thieves" to "the land's most notorious figures".</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Wartales&nbsp;</em>right now on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1527950/Wartales/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a> or <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/wartales" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a>.&nbsp;<em>Contract: The Fief&nbsp;</em>launches for both platforms on September 25th.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Future Far Cry Games Will Focus Much More on Multiplayer, Ubisoft Says]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot has revealed that future&nbsp;<em>Far Cry&nbsp;</em>games will likely have much more of a multiplayer focus, and he says the shift is to ensure longevity.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ubisoft-assassins-creed-mirage-saudi-arabia" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Game File</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisoft-confirms-far-cry-will-more-predominantly-push-multiplayer-in-future/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">VGC</a>), Guillemot spoke about the future of the&nbsp;<em>Far Cry&nbsp;</em>series during the New Global Sport Conference in Saudi Arabia, at which he was asked about what was next for the first-person shooter franchise.</p>

<p>In response to that question, Guillemot said that the goal for the&nbsp;<em>Far Cry&nbsp;</em>series is to "bring the multiplayer aspects more predominantly pushed" so that the franchise and its games "can also be played for a long time by players".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/far-cry-multiplayer-focus-far-cry-6.jpg?itok=H7i_L6Oq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/far-cry-multiplayer-focus-far-cry-6.jpg?itok=46PqyLwy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Future&nbsp;<em>Far Cry&nbsp;</em>games will foreground multiplayer to a much greater degree.</figcaption></figure><p>According to VGC, Guillemot's comments echo rumors that&nbsp;<em>Far Cry 7&nbsp;</em>is being developed in conjunction with a standalone multiplayer&nbsp;<em>Far Cry&nbsp;</em>game, which the publication says will be an "extraction-based shooter set in the Alaskan wilderness".</p>

<p>The last game in the&nbsp;<em>Far Cry&nbsp;</em>series was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/far-cry-6-release-date-revealed-for-late-2021" rel="nofollow">launched almost four years ago</a>. Ubisoft hasn't announced exact sales figures for&nbsp;<em>Far Cry 6</em>, but in its <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/7FRH9Pjch7t9yXb4GMFgi0/db479fa1ae07fc5264f8b16e1d7a15f8/Ubisoft_FY22_Earnings_PR_English_Final.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">2021-22 financial report</a>, the studio claimed the game was behind the series' "best year ever".</p>

<p>Of course, given Ubisoft's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-creative-houses-q1-financials" rel="nofollow">recent</a> financial <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-financials-layoffs-possible" rel="nofollow">woes</a>, it stands to reason that the company would want to shore up sales for its major brands as much as possible, but whether shifting to multiplayer will work that magic for&nbsp;<em>Far Cry&nbsp;</em>remains to be seen.</p>

<p>The next installment in the&nbsp;<em>Far Cry&nbsp;</em>franchise has yet to be officially announced by Ubisoft, but in December last year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-far-cry-7-and-maverick/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">rumors suggested</a> that the game had been internally pushed from a 2025 release window to 2026, so it may be some time before we hear from the series again.</p>




<p>If Guillemot's comments are to be believed, then it's likely that when&nbsp;<em>Far Cry 7&nbsp;</em>does arrive, it'll push its multiplayer aspect much more prominently, so you might want to grab a friend or two to play it with. Stay tuned for more.</p>
