            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/geforce-now-monthly-playtime-limit-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nvidia has announced that streaming service GeForce Now will begin imposing monthly playtime limits on new subscribers to two of its three currently available tiers, starting from next year.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GeForceNOW/comments/1glr3yc/gfn_thursday_updates_november_7_2024/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Reddit update</a>, Nvidia says it's renaming its Priority subscription tier to Performance, and that new subscribers to both the Performance and Ultimate tiers will be limited to 100 hours per month of playtime beginning "at the start of next year".</p>

<p>If you're an existing Performance or Ultimate member on or before December 31st this year, then you won't start seeing the monthly limits kick in until January 2026, which Nvidia says is a gift "to thank the GeForce Now community for joining the cloud gaming revolution".</p>

<p>You'll be able to buy extra hours if you run over the limit, too; $2.99 will get you 15 more hours on the Performance tier, while you'll have to pay $5.99 for the same privilege if you're on the Ultimate tier, although naturally, the quality of your streaming is better on this tier.</p>

<p>In addition, up to 15 hours of unused playtime will roll over each month, so if you do find yourself going under the limit for one month, you'll be able to enjoy an equivalent amount of extra time the following month.</p>

<p>On the plus side, Performance members will be able to enjoy 1440p gaming instead of 1080p, and the tier is also getting access to ultrawide support, although 4K and 120fps remains reserved for Ultimate members.</p>

It's similar to services like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-cloud-gaming-beta-available-now-on-xbox-series-xs-and-xbox-one">Xbox Cloud Gaming</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazon-luna-announced-as-new-cloud-gaming-service-in-early-access">Amazon Luna</a>.</p>

<p>You can sign up for the service over on the official GeForce Now <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">website</a> if you're interested.</p>
