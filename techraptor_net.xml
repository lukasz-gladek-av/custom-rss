      <div><p>Wizards of the Coast is expanding their partnership with TCGPlayer. The <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> publisher will work alongside the virtual card marketplace for exclusive content designed to engage the dedicated enthusiast community.</p>



<p>According to the press release, Wizards of the Coast's TCGPlayer partnership is expanding from something offered earlier this year: the introduction of WPN badges to eligible TCGPlayer storefronts.</p>

This includes exclusive previews, interviews with game designers, and exclusive reveals. For convenience, users can filter search results to discover any Magic: The Gathering products held exclusively in WPN-verified stores.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>TCGplayer is focused on innovating for our community, enhancing buyer and seller<br>
experiences, and offering the best selection across trading card games,” said Stephanie Mims,<br>
Senior Vice President, Seller Experience. “Being designated the preferred online marketplace<br>
for the WPN represents a milestone in our quest to be the most trusted trading card platform for<br>
Magic players and retailers.</p>

<p><br>
Our investment in local game stores and the Wizards Play Network is at the core of this<br>
initiative,” said Brian Trunk, Vice President of Wizards Commercial, Hobby and WPN at Wizards<br>
of the Coast. “By teaming up with TCGplayer, we’re not only giving players greater confidence<br>
in their purchases, but also empowering WPN retailers to thrive, reach new audiences, and<br>
continue building strong Magic communities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>TCGPlayer is one of the largest virtual card retail platforms on the internet. The platform, acquired <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/ebay-enters-agreement-for-tcgplayer-acquisition" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">by eBay</a> in early 2023 for the sum of $295 million, has helped dedicated card game players and aspirational competitive players obtain the cards they want for their respective game. Be it <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/disney-lorcana" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Disney Lorcana</em></a>, or even the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/pokemon-trading-card-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Pokemon TCG</em></a>.</p>

<p>The platform recently came under fire due to it quickly shutting down an authentication center down in Syracuse. This was seen by the workers as an attempt to shut down the worker's union seeking better wages. This lead to a boycott starting in May 2025 before a new contract was renegotiated by the worker's union in June.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Tomb Raider Studio Crystal Dynamics Hit by Layoffs Again]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crystal-dynamics-layoffs-november-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tomb-raider-studio-crystal-dynamics-hit-by-layoffs-again.1353820/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>developer Crystal Dynamics has announced yet another round of layoffs across "various departments and projects", and the layoffs are apparently an attempt to "restructure the company and business".</p>

<p>In a post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/crystal-dynamics_today-weve-made-the-difficult-but-necessary-activity-7394805539140169729-lwXF/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>, Crystal Dynamics calls the decision to lay off "just under 30" employees a "difficult but necessary decision", and blames the evolving "realities of the industry" for the need to let more team members go.</p>

<p>The studio says that the layoffs are an attempt to "optimize the continued development of [its] flagship&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>game", in addition to "shaping the rest of the studio to make new games for the future".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider-crystal-dynamics.jpg?itok=_PCW5_St 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider-crystal-dynamics.jpg?itok=XMhUvaNA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Tomb Raider</em>'s Crystal Dynamics is laying off yet more staff.</figcaption></figure><p>This is the third time that Crystal Dynamics has engaged in layoffs this year; it first laid off a round of employees in March, then <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crystal-dynamics-layoffs" rel="nofollow">again in August</a> following the cancellation of Xbox's&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</em>reboot (and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">shuttering of the studio</a> chiefly responsible for making it).</p>

<p>At the time of August's layoffs, Crystal Dynamics reassured fans that&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider</em>'s development was "unaffected" by the decision. Technically, no such reassurance has been offered for this latest wave of redundancies.</p>

<p>It's also worth noting that the next game in the&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>series has yet to be announced; there's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazon-tomb-raider-lara-croft" rel="nofollow">an Amazon series</a> headed up by&nbsp;<em>Fleabag</em>'s Phoebe Waller-Bridge in the works, but that's the only piece of genuinely new&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>media fans have to cling to for now.</p>

<p>As far as we know, the as-yet-unrevealed&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>title is the only thing on which Crystal Dynamics is actively working, so I'd imagine there's quite a lot of pressure within the studio to deliver on this one (although what exactly "this one" is, we don't yet know).</p>

Until then, stay tuned for more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Misery Returns to Steam Following Stalker 2 Dev's DMCA Claim]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/misery-steam-return</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/misery-returns-to-steam-following-stalker-2-devs-dmca-claim.1353817/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><i>Misery&nbsp;</i>developer Platypus Entertainment has announced that the game has made a return to Steam, following a DMCA claim that was issued by&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>developer GSC Game World.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2119830/view/809086547679772954" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on Steam, the studio says that it has "resolved" the "misunderstanding" it had with GSC Game World, following a conversation with one of the Ukrainian developer's lawyers.</p>

<p>Specifically, Platypus makes reference to two issues it says were "not mentioned in the DMCA claim" and that the studio wasn't aware of. Both issues have now been resolved, and it seems like that's what has allowed&nbsp;<em>Misery&nbsp;</em>to be reinstated on Steam.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/misery-steam-return-room.jpg?itok=RcpZB2U2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/misery-steam-return-room.jpg?itok=SDTTJ7N1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Misery&nbsp;</em>is now back on Steam for your enjoyment.</figcaption></figure><p>The first issue revolved around a "helicopter model in the files" of&nbsp;<em>Misery</em>. Platypus says the game is "an evolution of education, non-commercial projects", and that the model, which has now been removed, "was unintentionally left in [<em>Misery</em>''s] resources as a legacy leftover".</p>

<p>Platypus goes on to say that the helicopter model in question can't be seen anywhere in&nbsp;<em>Misery&nbsp;</em>itself, but the studio doesn't actually state exactly where it got the model from. Still, this appears to be one of the key points of contention for GSC Game World.</p>

<p>The second point pertains to some of the guitar-based folk songs being played in&nbsp;<em>Misery</em>. Platypus says that for the&nbsp;<em>Stalker&nbsp;</em>games, GSC Game World "used popular folk songs" for ambient guitar-playing NPCs, and that someone affiliated with Platypus "wrote original covers of some of these songs".</p>

<p>However, it turns out that some of the songs used by Platypus "were specifically written or exclusively licensed by GSC", so those songs have been removed. However, the studio is adamant that "no original files from GSC games were used".</p>




<p>If you need a reminder,&nbsp;<em>Misery&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-dev-strikes-down-copycat-game-misery-with-dmca-claim" rel="nofollow">taken down</a> from Steam earlier this week following a DMCA claim by&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>'s GSC Game World, which alleged that Platypus Entertainment's game infringed GSC's copyright.</p>

<p>This led to a rather unfortunately slur-laden <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/1or39zs/comment/nno4g7j/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Discord message</a> from developer Maewing, who subsequently <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/stalker-dev-gsc-game-world-dmcad-a-stalker-inspired-indie-off-steam-and-the-devs-are-crying-foul-this-is-an-abuse-of-power-against-small-independent-developers-by-a-large-corporation/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">apologized</a> for their "past words" and "old posts", although that doesn't really apply to a message that was clearly posted after the strike was filed.</p>

<p>That, however, is an issue that Platypus has addressed in its most recent Steam news post; the studio says it has "established a strict policy on Discord moderation", which means it's no longer an "anarchy dumpster fire".</p>

<p>In any case, if you'd like to check out&nbsp;<em>Misery</em>, you can do so right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2119830/MISERY/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>. Stay tuned for more on this.</p>
