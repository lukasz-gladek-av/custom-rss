            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/konami-financials-2024-25<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Konami has released its financial statement for the fiscal year ending in March 2025, and revenue and profit are both up for the&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>publisher.</p>

<p>Per the company's latest presentation, revenue across all sectors jumped by 17% this year, while operating profit rose by 27%. In the "Digital Entertainment" sector (which covers Konami's video game business), revenue was up by 22.5%, while profit grew by 24.7%.</p>

<p>In an accompanying <a href="https://img.konami.com/ir/en/ir-data/statements/2025/en0508_28h9rg.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">document</a>, Konami attributed its success this year to the successful release of Bloober Team's&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake, which had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">sold two million copies</a> at last count. The two studios are currently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloober-team-konami-new-game-ip" rel="nofollow">working together on another new game</a> based on a Konami IP, although it's unclear whether that IP is&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill</em>.</p>

Early Days Collection</em></a>, which features 14 "nostalgic classic digital titles", as Konami says.</p>

<p>Sadly, Konami doesn't reveal any sales figures for these collections, so we don't know how well they're doing. We do, however, know that a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suikoden-star-leap-announced" rel="nofollow">brand new&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>game is in development</a>, albeit a mobile RPG that will almost certainly feature gacha mechanics.</p>

<p>As regards the future, it's looking like a pretty packed year by Konami's standards. In the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-release-date-leak-playstation" rel="nofollow">next few months</a>, the studio will release&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em>, an Unreal Engine 5 remake of the 2004 stealth-action classic with a new visual makeover and some hefty gameplay improvements.</p>

<p>Konami also says it's "committed to the development" of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-f-officially-revealed-konami" rel="nofollow">upcoming survival horror title&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f</em></a>, although the studio stops short of revealing a release date or even a release window for the game.</p>
