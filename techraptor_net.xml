            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has released a Psion UA update for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>. This new version of playtest material for the popular fantasy TTRPG introduces tweaks and changes to the Psion class, a casting class that focuses on psychic powers.</p>



<p>In a blog post on <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/2072-designer-insights-from-unearthed-arcana-psion#the-updated-psion" rel="nofollow">D&amp;D Beyond</a> the design team discussed the changes in the Psion UA update. It covers the fundamental parts of the Psion, like its class features and its Psionic Energy dice, as well as tweaks to three of its subclasses. The fourth subclass, the Psi Warper, has been unchanged from the previous <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dungeons-dragons-2024-psion-class-introduced-in-new-unearthed-arcana" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Unearthed Arcana</a>.</p>

Telekinetic Propel and Telepathic Connection are now baseline abilities; you can use them at will as a Bonus Action. They can also be enhanced with Psionic Energy dice. Certain effects have been reworded so you only lose energy dice if your target fails a saving throw. Psionic Modes have been removed, and you have more means of regaining energy dice.</p>

<p>The Metamorph subclass has received some buffs across the board. Now, whenever you use a Psionic Energy dice, you gain temporary hit points. The Life-Bending Weapons feature deals additional damage without spending Psionic Energy dice. Curiously, the UA specifies that if the Psion shows up in a future book, it will include magic items that enhance the subclass' Organic Weapons feature.</p>

<p>The Psykinetic is another subclass that has been bumped up. It has a new feature called Stronger Telekinesis, which enhances the Mage Hand spell, letting it carry up to 20 pounds of weight. The reworked level six feature, Destructive Trance, adds bonus damage to spell attacks. And certain mid-to-late features like Rebounding Field and Heightened Telekinesis either don't use dice, spell slots, or provide temporary hit points.</p>

<p>The most significant changes are reserved for the Telepath subclass. New spells have been added to its spell list, The Potent Thoughts feature greatly extends the use of telepathy to 60 feet. The Scramble Minds feature has been simplified to where enemy behavior is dictated by the caster and not by random dice rolls. This helps add more utility to the subclass without dragging down the pacing of a fight.</p>

<p>The feedback form for the Psion UA update playtest material opens October 9.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>The Lacerator</em> is a gory indie survival horror chock full of love and respect for the classics, but should it be your Halloween play? Or is it grindhouse garbage? Our <em>The Lacerator</em> review should give you a good idea if this is gore greatness or a failure of a flick.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>What is <em>The Lacerator</em>?</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-lacerator-screenshot-showing-a-bright-blue-inventory-screen-with-a-bandage-as-the-only-item-it-contains.jpg?itok=O0Vx7htW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-lacerator-screenshot-showing-a-bright-blue-inventory-screen-with-a-bandage-as-the-only-item-it-contains.jpg?itok=G1FdTWK7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The actual content of the inventory screen is familiar, but the high-contrast '80s microcomputer interface is a nice touch.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>If you’ve not had a chance to check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2339330/The_Lacerator/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">game’s Steam page</a> yet, let me fill you in. <em>The Lacerator</em> is an old-school survival horror game from developer Games from the Abyss and publisher <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/dread-xp" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Dread XP</a> in the <em>Resident Evil </em>mold.</p>

<p>In fact, it would be fair to say that this game is an homage to <em>Resident Evil</em> in many ways. It does both of the two different camera styles that the series has used, namely, over-the-shoulder and fixed, and is about escaping from a house filled with gory humanoids bent on your death. Oh, and you spend most of the game being chased by a huge, muscular monster. You could have told me this was an unreleased tongue-in-cheek Resi spin-off and I’d have believed you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You play as Max, The man Who Loves Sex, one of the most popular porn stars of the 1980s. After spending a night doing what you do best, you wake up to find that you, your co-star, and your cameraman have been kidnapped and locked in some sort of basement dungeon.</p>

<p>As you explore your location, it’s clear that you’re in some sort of snuff den, and you need to try your best to get out without losing any of your extremities, and I do mean any of them. Let's just hope that this isn't giving DreadXP 'nam <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vile-exhumed-steam-removed-sexual-content" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">flashbacks to their last slightly sexual horror game</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Let’s Get Lacerator-y</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-lacerator-screenshot-showing-an-over-the-shoulder-shot-of-a-man-over-a-grungy-catwalk-holding-a-hatchet.jpg?itok=YUa2L_vE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-lacerator-screenshot-showing-an-over-the-shoulder-shot-of-a-man-over-a-grungy-catwalk-holding-a-hatchet.jpg?itok=prHCtQjq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I don't think it's technically possible to 'aim' an axe that you have no intention, nor ability, to throw.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>The way that <em>The Lacerator</em> plays will be completely different depending on your set-up. If you choose to go with the classic ‘fixed’ camera, you’ll be controlling your character with tank-controls and sudden camera angle shifts. If you choose the more modern, over-the-shoulder style of camera, you’ll actually be able to play the game.&nbsp; In either case, the bulk of the rest of the gameplay revolves around killing zombie-like enemies, finding items, and solving puzzles to unlock further progress.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If that last paragraph wasn’t clear enough, I found the fixed camera angle a pain. Not only does it make certain puzzles based around timing very frustrating, but it also makes the already janky combat nearly impossible to wrap your head around. I understand that combat in a survival-horror game like this is supposed to feel chaotic to keep things tense, there’s only a certain level you can hit before the experience becomes genuinely unpleasant.</p>

<h2>Fight the Power, and the “Zombies”</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-lacerator-screenshot-showing-an-old-tv-and-an-original-atari-2600-but-with-crt-scanlines-over-the-top-of-it.jpg?itok=ouVv_lbR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-lacerator-screenshot-showing-an-old-tv-and-an-original-atari-2600-but-with-crt-scanlines-over-the-top-of-it.jpg?itok=aLUfzUVc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Max has some interestingly negative attitudes towards various things throughout the game, but that is almost certainly part of the point.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>The combat in <em>The Lacerator</em> isn’t without merit at all. Generally, it functions fairly similarly to the <em>Resident Evil </em>standards. You ready your weapon by holding one button, then press another to attack. With ranged weapons this is pretty easy to get a hang of, though the game starts out incredibly reticent to dole out ammo. However, melee weapons take a decent amount of getting used to, made all the harder if you’re attempting this on fixed-camera mode. Part of the reason for this is a slight issue with the game’s controls.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During melee combat, you have to try and dodge incoming attacks, but you don’t really have a dodge move. All you can do is back up as quickly as possible, avoid the incoming damage, then swing with your melee weapon again. This sounds fine, but the game won’t let you keep the run button held between attacks, so you have to get used to the very specific timing window that you have after landing an attack to quickly press run again before you start moving backwards if you want to avoid damage. It’s easily doable after a bit of practice, but it also results in melee combat feeling formulaic once you’ve got it down. Either way, by the latter half of the game, you have better access to guns, so melee becomes less of an issue.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Splintering Pathways</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-lacerator-screenshot-showing-a-man-standing-in-a-hallways-that-looks-like-its-made-out-of-rusted-iron-and-human-flesh.jpg?itok=AYoj9JcF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-lacerator-screenshot-showing-a-man-standing-in-a-hallways-that-looks-like-its-made-out-of-rusted-iron-and-human-flesh.jpg?itok=EBl_1zQl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Guys, does this place look familiar to you?&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Combat aside, there is a decent amount of fun to be found in <em>The Lacerator</em> for fans of old-school survival horror. You have the same style of room-clearing gameplay, but weirdly without the map that you might normally find in such games, it feels a lot creepier exploring each new area that you come across.</p>

<p>At least, it does the first time through. This is also the sort of game that is made with replays in mind thanks to multiple endings being available, so on your second visit the creep factor is definitely lessoned, though it’s not the only draw either.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There’s also an irreverent tone, and the '80s-style aesthetic to a lot of the environments you’ll come across makes you feel like you’re playing a parody exploitation movie, and that is also borne out in the storyline too. Playing a porn star called Max in the '80s is already pretty grimy, but add the extravagant gore and you could be forgiven for thinking that this is some stupid edgelord game with not much interesting to say.</p>

<p>Keep playing and paying attention and you’ll come across an interesting narrative that alludes to a lot more going on beneath the surface with Max’s character and backstory.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Getting Gored &amp; Bugged</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-lacerator-screenshot-showing-a-mostly-nude-man-standing-with-his-back-to-the-player-who-is-in-a-pool.jpg?itok=fjLS4hOv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-lacerator-screenshot-showing-a-mostly-nude-man-standing-with-his-back-to-the-player-who-is-in-a-pool.jpg?itok=kwD7YsEN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I'm almost 100% sure that he is not supposed to be stood there like that.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>One of the biggest mechanics in <em>The Lacerator</em> is the ability for you to get several bits of yourself chopped off. If you're not paying attention to obvious traps, or the 9-foot naked guy chasing you down, then you're likely to end up losing an arm, or worse, your junk. Depending on what you lose, the gameplay changes accordingly.</p>

<p>So, lose an arm, and you'll begin to find combat a fair bit harder with most weapons. Lose a leg, and you'll move slower as you get around by hopping, or drag yourself around by your arms, if you lose both of them. This is an interesting mechanic, as it does mean you can only access certain areas or abilities by having certain things chopped off, but you'll also want to avoid doing it if you can help it, since finishing with nothing chopped off is the only way to unlock some of the best endings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While you're going back through for the other endings or just to check out what else there is to see, you'll need to keep your eye out for a couple of bugs. I'm not sure how it triggers, but sometimes when you're reading a note or picking up an item, the game will get the overlay stuck on the screen while you're still able to move around the world.</p>

<p>It's not game-breaking, unless the item you were trying to pick up is a key item, but it's certainly annoying. I also had a really weird bug where The Lacerator himself seemed to get stuck staring into a wall, though in fairness, this did just add to the eerie feeling a bit.</p>

<h2>Sound &amp; Visuals</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-lacerator-screenshot-showing-a-man-in-pink-boxers-standing-in-a-dilapidated-building.jpg?itok=Z5sUs_kU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-lacerator-screenshot-showing-a-man-in-pink-boxers-standing-in-a-dilapidated-building.jpg?itok=IChu5Jph 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Max was also known as one of the hairiest porn stars of the '80s, though there is a lot of stiff competition.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Along with the old-school gameplay, <em>The Lacerator</em> uses an old-school PS1/N64-style aesthetic. So, we’re talking blocky 3D polygonal characters with slightly blocky textures laid on top. While a lot can be said about this being ‘nostalgia bait,’ it’s a really effective aesthetic when you’re working with a grungy, and gory, grindhouse story like this. The distorted visuals and audio being used add to the eerie feeling of the game, and that distortion also helps to keep you guessing more about what each new sound you here might mean, until you discover the horrific source.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It’s also more of a game about the sound design than the soundtrack. When you’re wandering around exploring new areas and trying to solve puzzles or make progress, you’re generally listening mostly to your own footsteps. Occasionally, you’ll get some diagetic sound from an in-game stereo or record player, but other than that, it’s only during monster encounters when you get any music. It’s a style of gameplay that works best in an explorative horror game, and it’s right at home here.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><em>The Lacerator</em>&nbsp;Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-lacerator-screenshot-showing-a-man-sitting-in-a-black-void-smoking-a-cigarette.jpg?itok=c8OA9N1A 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-lacerator-screenshot-showing-a-man-sitting-in-a-black-void-smoking-a-cigarette.jpg?itok=P-Lid2c8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sometimes, even when escaping a sex dungeon, you just gotta stop for a smoke.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p><em>The Lacerator</em> is an interesting old-school survival horror titles with a few quirks that hold it back from true greatness. The slight jank to the controls make the melee combat tough to get into, a fact that isn’t aided by the fixed camera mode, but thankfully a lot of what the rest of the game has to offer is great. There is the heart of soul of a great game here, but it’s buried beneath layers of minor bugs and QoL fixes that need to happen first. Until then, only the horror-dedicated will find entertainment within.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Legendary point-and-click developer Revolution Software has announced&nbsp;<em>Broken Sword - The Smoking Mirror: Reforged</em>, a remastered version of the second game in the&nbsp;<em>Broken Sword&nbsp;</em>series, and it's due to arrive early next year.</p>

<p>Per a press release, <i>Broken Sword - The Smoking Mirror: Reforged&nbsp;</i>"celebrates the series' enduring legacy while introducing enhancements for modern players". CEO and founder Charles Cecil says the remastered version will "respect the original while making it shine for modern audiences".</p>

<p>It sounds as though the new remaster will work in a similar way to last year's&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Templars: Reforged</em>, coming complete with new visual enhancements, audio improvements, and more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/broken-sword-the-smoking-mirror-reforged-beach.jpg?itok=yg8s4qC3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/broken-sword-the-smoking-mirror-reforged-beach.jpg?itok=VJRNpiHn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Broken Sword - The Smoking Mirror: Reforged&nbsp;</em>remasters a point-and-click classic next year.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Revolution Software, the new version will feature "beautiful high definition" visuals, as well as "crisp audio", but if you love the original, you'll still be able to switch between the new and old styles at any time.</p>

<p>Additionally, if you're the kind of person who gets frustrated at point-and-click adventure puzzles (for which I will throw absolutely no shade your way whatsoever), then you can play with the new "story mode" in order to get "subtle hints".</p>

<p>Once this one's been released, it will be intriguing to see whether Revolution Software decides to revisit its adventures into three dimensions with remasters of 2003's&nbsp;<em>The Sleeping Dragon&nbsp;</em>and 2006's&nbsp;<em>The Angel of Death</em>. Arguably, they're the ones most in need of remastering.</p>

<p>For now, though, you can check out the trailer for&nbsp;<em>Broken Sword - The Smoking Mirror: Reforged&nbsp;</em>right here. It'll show off the new art style and give you a sense of what you can expect if you pick the game up.</p>




<p>Let's also hope that this remaster is successful enough to prompt a potential new entry in the series, a la 2020's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/beyond-steel-sky" rel="nofollow"><em>Beyond a Steel Sky</em></a>.</p>

<p>For now, though,&nbsp;<em>Broken Sword - The Smoking Mirror: Reforged&nbsp;</em>launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch early next year. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-hellsinger-the-outsiders-shut-down-funcom</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metal-hellsinger-developer-the-outsiders-shut-down-by-parent-company-funcom.1317700/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Metal: Hellsinger&nbsp;</em>developer The Outsiders has been closed down by its parent company Funcom, according to studio founder David Goldfarb, but he says he's determined to press on regardless.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/locust9.bsky.social/post/3m2jumlqlmc2m" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky post</a>, Goldfarb confirms The Outsiders' closure after ten years of operation. The studio's shutdown is part of a wider spate of layoffs at Funcom, which the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-funcom-layoffs" rel="nofollow">announced recently</a> (despite latest release&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>being Funcom's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-sales-1m-infographic" rel="nofollow">most successful game</a> to date).</p>

<p>Goldfarb says he and his studio "survived a near-death studio experience years back when&nbsp;<em>Darkborn&nbsp;</em>was canceled", referring to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embrace-your-inner-monster-in-darkborn" rel="nofollow">a project</a> that was first revealed back in 2015 before being <a href="https://x.com/outsidersgames/status/1255834216815890434" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">canned in April 2020</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metal-hellsinger-the-outsiders-shutdown-shooting.jpg?itok=_3dTMF_o 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metal-hellsinger-the-outsiders-shutdown-shooting.jpg?itok=zFSmQ3n5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Outsiders' latest (and last) game is 2022's&nbsp;<em>Metal: Hellsinger</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Although Goldfarb says he and his team were hoping to "do something even better" than&nbsp;<em>Metal: Hellsinger&nbsp;</em>this time, "things don't always go the way you hope", and The Outsiders has instead been closed down.</p>

<p>However, Goldfarb says this might not be the end for him and his team. He says they're "not giving up", and that they "are going to try to continue on in some new form", asking followers to help out with "business leads, placement for employees, guidance, whatever it is".</p>

<p>Funcom originally purchased The Outsiders back in 2021, just a few months before <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/funcom-acquires-conan-ip-holder" rel="nofollow">acquiring the rights</a> to the&nbsp;<em>Conan&nbsp;</em>IP and the holding group that originally held those rights (along with the rights to the likes of&nbsp;<em>Solomon Kane&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/mutant-year-zero-road-to-eden" rel="nofollow"><em>Mutant Year Zero</em></a>, the latter of which uses the Swedish <em>Mutant&nbsp;</em>RPG's setting).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, The Outsiders is far from the only studio to be closed down by its parent in recent months. Others include Xbox subsidiary and&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">The Initiative</a>, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rich-vogel-t-minus-zero-entertainment-netease-shut-down" rel="nofollow">NetEase-backed outfit T-Minus Zero</a>, and&nbsp;<em>Torchlight 3&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/echtra-games-shut-down-torchlight-3" rel="nofollow">Echtra Games</a>.</p>
