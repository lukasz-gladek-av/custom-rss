            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Supermassive Games, the studio responsible for the likes of Bandai Namco's upcoming&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares III&nbsp;</em>and the&nbsp;<em>Dark Pictures&nbsp;</em>anthology series, has announced another round of layoffs.</p>

<p>Last year, the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/supermassive-games-layoffs" rel="nofollow">laid off a number of employees</a> as part of a "reorganization" effort; the number wasn't revealed, but Bloomberg's Jason Schreier reported that around 90 Supermassive staffers were affected.</p>

<p>Now, in a <a href="https://x.com/SuperMGames/status/1947650822768132211" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Supermassive says it's laying off "up to 36" employees as part of a new "redundancy consultation process". The studio cites the "challenging and ever-evolving environment" of the gaming industry as the reason for these newest cuts.</p>

You can read our very own Andrew's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/directive-8020-enhances-gameplay-putting-stealth-and-scares-in-players-hands" rel="nofollow">preview of that game here</a> to find out what he thought of it.</p>

<p>If you're worried about&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares III</em>, you needn't be; Supermassive says that these layoffs will have "no impact on the development" of the upcoming horror puzzle-platformer, and the October 10th release date, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/little-nightmares-iii-release-date" rel="nofollow">announced last month</a>, will go ahead as planned.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Supermassive isn't even the only studio to lay off staff in the last week or so; it joins&nbsp;<em>GreedFall II&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Steelrising&nbsp;</em>developer Spiders, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/spiders-layoffs" rel="nofollow">hit by layoffs across its animation and rig team</a> this week.</p>

<p>These layoffs are also part of a broader pattern that has seen thousands of industry employees losing their jobs over the last couple of years, as well as project cancellations and studio closures galore.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see how else Supermassive Games' latest layoffs affect the studio's operations. Stay tuned for more.</p>
