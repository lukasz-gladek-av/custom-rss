            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-mans-sky-worlds-part-2-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hello Games has released the&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>Worlds Part 2 update, bringing new planets to explore, new story content to uncover, and lots more to the galaxy-spanning space sim.</p>

<p>Following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-mans-sky-worlds-part-i-update" rel="nofollow">the first part</a> of the Worlds update back in July, Worlds Part 2 introduces "stranger, more alien terrain" for you to explore, including "new mountains, deep valleys, and sprawling plains on untouched planets".</p>

<p>A new class of star has been added in this update in the form of Purple-class solar systems, which bring new worlds for you to discover along with a new story to unravel.</p>

That should give you something to do <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/subnautica-2-early-access-2025-co-op" rel="nofollow">while you wait for&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2</em></a>.</p>

<p>There's plenty more to discover in this update as well, from bigger features like new gas giant planets and new creatures through to smaller improvements like one-button inventory sorting.</p>

<p>You can read the full patch notes for the&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>Worlds Part 2 update <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/worlds-part-ii-update/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a> courtesy of the game's official website, and you can check out a trailer showing off some of the update's more significant new features below.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky</em>, it's an open-world survival-crafting game that takes place in an "infinite procedurally-generated universe".</p>

<p>The game got off to a rocky start when it was released in 2016, but after many updates, Hello Games has managed to shape&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>into something resembling the game its fans were originally promised.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/275850/No_Mans_Sky/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/no-mans-sky/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/no-mans-sky/BQVQTL3PCH05" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/no-mans-sky-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>, and the game is also available as part of a Game Pass subscription, but only if you sign up to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-price-hike-new-tier" rel="nofollow">certain tiers</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dino-crisis-1-and-2-brought-back-to-life-on-pc-via-gog.1094811/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dino-crisis-1-2-gog-rerelease<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GOG has resurrected Capcom's dino-hunting horror classics&nbsp;<em>Dino Crisis&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Dino Crisis 2</em>, and now, the storefront wants your help in deciding what it should bring back to life next.</p>

<p>Both&nbsp;<em>Dino Crisis&nbsp;</em>games "come DRM-free with their original content fully intact", as is GOG's mission statement. However, they're also a part of the GOG <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gog-preservation-program" rel="nofollow">Preservation Program</a>, which means they've had some spring-cleaning done in order to ensure smooth playability on modern systems.</p>

<p>Updates for both games include increased resolution support, fixes for some common issues, and, of course, modern controller compatibility, and the first game also features its Original, Arrange, and Operation Wipe Out modes.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dino-crisis-1-and-2-pc-gog-dinosaur.jpg?itok=BH2AeNVy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dino-crisis-1-and-2-pc-gog-dinosaur.jpg?itok=6zWZIGrs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You can now enjoy the first two&nbsp;<em>Dino Crisis&nbsp;</em>games on PC via GOG.</figcaption></figure><p>Alongside the&nbsp;<em>Dino Crisis&nbsp;</em>announcement, GOG has also revealed the <a href="https://www.gog.com/dreamlist" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Dreamlist</a>, an evolution of its Community Wishlist feature that serves as a way to tell the GOG folks what you want to see revived next.</p>

<p>The Dreamlist is essentially a list of all the games GOG has not yet brought to its storefront, and by voting on your favorites, you can tell the storefront which games you want to see given the&nbsp;<em>Dino Crisis&nbsp;</em>(or&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/original-resident-evil-2-gog-release-date" rel="nofollow"><em>Resident Evil</em></a>, or&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gog-preservation-program-warcraft-delisting" rel="nofollow"><em>Warcraft</em></a>) treatment next.</p>

<p>GOG staff will also periodically highlight games that they think might be worth your time to vote on. At time of writing, highlighted games include&nbsp;<em>Freelancer</em>,&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil Code: Veronica X</em>, and the original&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy VII</em>, among many others.</p>

<p>Of course, if you don't like the sound of the highlighted games, you can browse the full list to find your favorites, and you can even tell GOG staff if there's a game that's missing from the list.</p>




<p>Game preservation is becoming a more and more serious problem as the industry moves forward. According to GOG's numbers, 87% of games released prior to 2010 are no longer available, and that's a shocking statistic, frankly.</p>

<p>Thankfully, GOG's efforts to preserve older games continue. You can grab&nbsp;<em>Dino Crisis&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Dino Crisis 2&nbsp;</em>via GOG right now, and they're also available as <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/dino_crisis_bundle" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">part of a bundle</a> if you want to pick them up together. <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shinji-mikami-dino-crisis-monster-hunter-comments" rel="nofollow">Take that, Shinji Mikami</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Silent Hill 2 Remake Sales Top 2m Worldwide]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-2m</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-top-2m-worldwide.1094778/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-2m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Konami and Bloober Team's&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake has reached another big sales milestone, the two studios have announced.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://prtimes.jp/main/html/rd/p/000001079.000050711.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a> (which is in Japanese; we're using machine translation), the game has managed to hit two million sales worldwide, which includes both physical shipments and digital sales.</p>

<p>The new milestone means that&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>has racked up another million sales since October, when it reached its first million <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-1m" rel="nofollow">after just three days on sale</a>. Naturally, that means sales have slowed down somewhat, but that's arguably to be expected for what is still, in the end, a fairly niche game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-2m-car.jpg?itok=pQEIITkC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-2m-car.jpg?itok=UYtw8vzy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake has hit another big sales milestone.</figcaption></figure><p>It's fair to say that&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2</em>'s numbers are perhaps a little more modest than those of Capcom's flagship&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>remakes.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em>remake managed to rack up three million sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-hit-3-million-in-just-2-days" rel="nofollow">in just two days</a>, beating out the&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 2&nbsp;</em>remake, which hit the same milestone <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-2-ships-3-million-copies-during-first-week-free-dlc-announced" rel="nofollow">inside its first week</a>.</p>

<p>Still, direct comparisons are perhaps unfair.&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>is a series that arguably has more mainstream appeal than&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill</em>, with the latter being more overtly focused on subtler, more psychological horror and the former focusing more on action.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake is also doing significantly better than ill-fated studio Pieces Interactive's&nbsp;<em>Alone in the Dark&nbsp;</em>reboot, which performed so poorly that it sadly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alone-in-dark-developer-pieces-interactive-shut-down" rel="nofollow">caused the studio to be shut down</a>.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with the&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake, it's a reimagined version of the 2001 survival horror classic that comes courtesy of&nbsp;<em>Layers of Fear&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Medium&nbsp;</em>developer Bloober Team.</p>

<p>The game's narrative is mostly faithful to the original, but the gameplay has been updated; the action now plays out with an over-the-shoulder camera reminiscent of the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>remakes rather than the more traditional fixed-camera approach of the 2001 game.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2124490/SILENT_HILL_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/silent-hill-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sony Ditches Co-CEO Strategy in Leadership Shakeup]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-leadership-shakeup</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-ditches-co-ceo-strategy-in-leadership-shakeup.1094748/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-leadership-shakeup<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has made some major leadership changes, ditching the co-CEO strategy that saw Hermen Hulst and Hideaki Nishino heading up PlayStation together and switching to a more traditional hierarchy.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/press-releases/2025/new-leadership-at-sony-interactive-entertainment/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a>, Sony reveals that Nishino has been appointed the sole president and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment. Hulst will remain in his position as head of PlayStation Studios, but he'll be reporting to Nishino now.</p>

<p>Additionally, Sony president and COO Hiroki Totoki, who served as interim Interactive CEO after Jim Ryan <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/jim-ryan-retiring-as-playstation-ceo-after-30-years-at-sony" rel="nofollow">retired last year</a>, will now serve as Sony president and CEO, while SIE corporate strategy SVP Lin Tao will become the CFO of Sony as a whole. Her successor at SIE hasn't yet been appointed.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hermen-hulst-playstation-leadership-shakeup.jpg?itok=VgjfS5a4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hermen-hulst-playstation-leadership-shakeup.jpg?itok=FOrUN63C 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hermen Hulst will remain as head of PlayStation Studios, but he's no longer the co-CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment.</figcaption></figure><p>In essence, not much has actually changed in terms of Hulst and Nishino's roles; Sony says that Nishino will still serve as president of the "Platform Business Group", and that Hulst will remain head of "Studio Business Group".</p>

<p>In that role, Hulst will "continue to lead the development, publishing, and business operations of SIE's first-party content", and he'll also continue working with PlayStation Productions on bringing Sony IP to other media, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-helldivers-horizon-movies-ghost-of-tsushima-anime" rel="nofollow">like movies</a>.</p>

<p>This change is more of a hierarchical one; rather than serving on the same level, Hulst will now report to Nishino.</p>

<p>It's not clear what's prompted this change, but we do know that it's coming after the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds" rel="nofollow">failure of first-person shooter&nbsp;<em>Concord</em></a>, which is arguably one of the most disastrous flops in the company's gaming history.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sony-leadership-shakeup-concord.jpg?itok=yvFkoe0c 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sony-leadership-shakeup-concord.jpg?itok=IJTlj4ng 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Last year, PlayStation experienced what is probably one of its biggest flops ever in&nbsp;<em>Concord</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Recently, Sony also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-live-service-games-canceled" rel="nofollow">canceled live-service projects</a> in development at PlayStation subsidiaries Bend and Bluepoint, and an in-development MMO based on the&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>IP was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/horizon-mmo-canceled-report" rel="nofollow">reportedly shut down</a>&nbsp;recently as well.</p>

<p>Given the fact that Hulst is remaining in his position, it's not clear whether these developments are related to the leadership shakeup, but the fact Nishino alone will head up Sony Interactive Entertainment feels significant on that front.</p>

<p>Whether or not this has a material effect on PlayStation's strategy in the future remains to be seen. Stay tuned for more.</p>
