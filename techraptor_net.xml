            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Splatoon 3 </em>is getting a major update later this week, and if you thought Update 11.0.0 would just be bringing insubstantial quality-of-life improvements, think again, because some pretty major gameplay changes are coming.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/News/2026/January/What-s-new-in-the-Splatoon-3-Version-11-0-0-update-3011546.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">news post</a> on the official Nintendo website, the company reveals that <em>Splatoon 3 </em>Update 11.0.0, which is set to arrive on January 29th (that's this Thursday at time of writing), will introduce "new mechanics and other changes to freshen things up in the Splatlands".</p><p>First up, the update will add a new system called Flow Aura, which is essentially a killstreak system. Racking up splats in quick succession will put you in the Flow Aura state, which will increase your speed and defense, and you can keep this state going by scoring more splats or assists.</p><figure role="group">

</figure>
<p>To help you work out how close you might be to a KO in <em>Splatoon 3</em>, the new update will also make enemy health bars visible, although the bar will only show when an enemy has just been hit. You won't be able to see it if they're in cover or if they've jumped into their ink (short of certain specials).</p><p><em>Splatoon 3</em>'s hitboxes are also being adjusted to compensate for players' increased expertise with motion controls; landing a shot on an opponent in swim form will be harder, but attacks are easier to land on enemies in kid form with certain weapons.</p><p>If you'd like to see exactly what's changing, you can check out the full patch notes for <em>Splatoon 3 </em>Update 11.0.0 <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Support/Nintendo-Switch/Game-Updates/How-to-Update-Splatoon-3-2266003.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">right here</a>. The list has some fairly straightforward quality-of-life tweaks alongside the flashier stuff.</p>
<p>This latest <em>Splatoon 3 </em>update comes despite Nintendo's assurance that the game would receive no further content drops <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splatoon-3-updates-ending" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="606f040c-e9d7-4046-8557-17a8d3ce9a10" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">back in September 2024</a>, although it's true that this update doesn't feature any new weapons or gear.</p><p>The studio continuing to pay attention to <em>Splatoon 3 </em>also arguably stokes the rumor fire for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splatoon-3-switch-2-edition-pegi-rating" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fb9a9fd5-8c34-4a21-a5d1-efc312421224" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">a Switch 2 Edition</a>, as distinct from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splatoon-raiders-splatoon-3-switch-2" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="838585b0-e552-447b-bbf4-87e2329e177e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">more incremental update</a> the game received back in June.</p><p>You can check out <em>Splatoon 3 </em>right now on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/splatoon-3-switch/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch</a>.

It's a curio, but hey, if you're checking the Virtual Boy out already, you may as well give it a shot.</p><figure role="group">

<p>Here's a full list of all of the games that will be available for the Virtual Boy via Nintendo Switch Online on February 17th. As a reminder, you're going to need the dedicated Virtual Boy accessory to play these.</p><ul><li data-list-item-id="e7027c5815e534e60a58d3e5ff87facdf"><em>Teleroboxer</em></li><li data-list-item-id="e9a6bf0b85cb0be2d57feeddcb3551fe0"><em>Galactic Pinball</em></li><li data-list-item-id="ef46a697da3615b50fa72a7086d3c64b6"><em>Red Alarm</em></li><li data-list-item-id="e541ce85f6f1dbfb318d70f41baa23d06"><em>Golf</em></li><li data-list-item-id="e613ca37732033beaa6ad0bc4f34888b9"><em>Virtual Boy: Wario Land</em></li><li data-list-item-id="ee4d296e791b6bba921ff16f14341eb59"><em>3D Tetris</em></li><li data-list-item-id="e059e668b0e647485318f24c15c3b5cf6"><em>The Mansion of Innsmouth</em></li></ul><p>All of these games will support the Switch Online's quality-of-life features, including rewinding, save states, and control customization.</p><p>That's not all, though. Here's a list of games that will be coming to the Switch Online's Virtual Boy library throughout the rest of 2026.</p><ul><li data-list-item-id="eaaf5872df9d3ec61df8d8b0955a7bb9a"><em>Mario Clash</em></li><li data-list-item-id="e3a97f0c35dd6409cf2135b9a23a9af76"><em>Mario's Tennis</em></li><li data-list-item-id="e10b42dd2b5c09278c20dc5e55ce0629a"><em>Jack Bros.</em></li><li data-list-item-id="e4965b0a75f58346615697644a1f5c5c6"><em>Space Invaders Virtual Collection</em></li><li data-list-item-id="e1288a24cebbcbc5b70359befd89a6a91"><em>Virtual Bowling</em></li><li data-list-item-id="ee7ee8aa739723b7f3232fe25eb17e9dc"><em>Vertical Force</em></li><li data-list-item-id="e6810c5b641fe9ddd974539b726802c37"><em>V-Tetris</em></li></ul><p>They'll be joined by two previously unreleased games for the Virtual Boy, namely <em>Zero Racers </em>and <em>D-Hopper</em>, both of which will be available sometime later this year.

Maybe they'll spark a Virtual Boy <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/virtual-boy-fighting-game-tournament-taking-place-in-nyc-on-may-8" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="eb23a95a-54fd-4c7e-b357-f0547032c151" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">tournament revival</a>.</p>
<p>If you're not a fan of the Virtual Boy's garish red filter, then there will be an option to change the filter's color, although if you're playing with the Cardboard Model version of the Virtual Boy peripheral, that feature will sadly be absent.</p><p>Nintendo's slate of Virtual Boy games will land on Switch Online on February 17th, and you'll need an Expansion Pack membership and one of the two Virtual Boy peripheral models to check them out.

            <title><![CDATA[Helldivers 2 Siege Breakers Warbond Brings Patriotic Destruction Next Week]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-siege-breakers-warbond</link>
            <guid>1417426</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and developer Arrowhead have announced Siege Breakers, the latest Warbond for <em>Helldivers 2</em>, and this one's all about big, loud explosions, which are, as I'm sure we can all agree, the ideal way to spread democracy throughout the galaxy.</p><p>In many ways, Siege Breakers provides the perfect counterpoint to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-redacted-regiment-warbond" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="460a9d06-01c8-4dde-8dcd-17b098a9a0f5" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Redacted Regiment</a>, the Warbond from a couple of weeks ago, because that one focused on stealth and this one...absolutely does not.</p><p>The first major addition to <em>Helldivers 2 </em>in Siege Breakers is the LAS-16 Trident, an updated version of the beloved weapon from the original arsenal. This one fires six beams instead of three, and when it comes to annihilating enemies, that's definitely a marked improvement.</p><figure role="group">

</figure>
<p>If you prefer to get up close and personal (well, even more up close and personal), then the new CQC-20 Breaching Hammer stratagem will allow you to do just that. It's a massive sledgehammer that can optionally also explode. I say "optionally", but that sounds pretty mandatory to me.</p><p>Joining the new hammer is the GL-28 Belt-Fed Grenade Launcher, which, as the name suggests, is an explosive weapon that lets you continuously fire grenades. It should be perfect for those pesky Terminid hives.</p><p>Should you prefer to make one very loud noise rather than a series of slightly less loud noises, you may want to check out the EAT-411 Leveller, a single-shot missile launcher with a serious kick.</p><p>Lastly, if all of this ordnance isn't working for you and you need to protect yourself, the G/SH-39 Shield should help you do just that by providing a barrier that should stop more than a few Automaton shots.</p>
<p>All of this is, of course, coming in addition to new armors, capes, and other accouterments to help your Helldiver stand out and look snazzy on the battlefield.</p><p><em>Helldivers 2</em>'s Siege Breakers Warbond launches across all platforms on February 3rd. The game is available now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/helldivers-2/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/helldivers-2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/helldivers-2-review-fighting-for-managed-democracy" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5a16fadb-7c1f-45fc-a180-c4fd53fd4ea1" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">read our review here</a>.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
