            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>While walking the halls of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/best-new-tabletop-games-at-pax-unplugged-2025" rel="nofollow">PAX Unplugged</a> this winter, I was immediately struck by the vibrant colors and interesting products on display from <a href="http://www.hugeminis.com/" rel="nofollow">Huge Miniatures</a>. After chatting a bit with the team, they sent along some products for me to check out and review. And I’m thrilled to say, Huge Minis is even better in practice than it looks on the shelf!</p><p>Huge Miniatures sent along a bevy of basing products and tools for me to check out, and I thought the best way to put them all through their paces was to scratch-build some tester scatter terrain out of cardboard. Follow my process and I’ll walk you through the products I used!</p><h2>Huge Miniatures Basing Fundamentals</h2><picture>

  </picture><p>My first order of business when setting everything up for this review was to create a base upon which to build a bit of scatter terrain. Using some scraps of corrugated cardboard I had nearby and some basic white glue, I created a rough hill with varying levels.&nbsp;</p><p>I always like to force a bit of verticality in my scatter terrain, and this off-centered hill felt like a good way to test how these products cover tight and wide spaces, as well as ridges.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>After a quick coat of brown acrylic paint over everything (which I would quickly learn was totally unnecessary!), I got to the business of testing out one of the products I was <em>most</em> curious about, the Huge Miniatures Texture Paste. They sent along both the Mud and Snow variations, so I started with the Mud as a basis.</p><p>Here's where I knew I was truly in for a treat! As soon as I opened up the canister and began to spread it on (using a Huge Miniatures Texture Paste Paint Knife, which they also provided), I was shocked by the texture (the name should have been a giveaway, I guess) - it spread evenly, but had a bit of stiffness and weight to it that allowed it to be molded.&nbsp;</p><picture>

  </picture><p>Next up was the Snow Textured Paste, which I applied after the Mud had dried (set up in front of a mini-fan, this took less than an hour). And this was even <em>more</em> satisfying to spread on. Thick, but malleable, with a crisp white finish. The only way I can describe the texture was, to put it plainly, like working with cake icing.</p><p>This is the kind of basing material that'll make you want to use up the whole pot just playing around with it on your bases. Experimenting with this texture paste was so satisfying, and I found myself creating little moments and interplay between the mud and snow on the base.&nbsp;</p><p>Here, the snow drifted up against the hillside, there, the mud bled through a shallow drift. It was environmental storytelling on the smallest scale, all thanks to Huge Miniatures.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>Finally, it was time to try out the other basing materials included with this shipment, consisting of the Huge Miniatures 4-in-1 Tundra scatter foliage, frosty tufts, and snowy pure white weathering powder. Both the tufts and the 4-in-1 scatter were easy to use, and instantly helped flesh out the scene I created on my scatter.&nbsp;</p><p>The weathering powder took a moment to get used to, but once I'd gotten the hang of it, I was dusting those shrubs with the best of 'em! It's an interesting product, super-fine and light, and the idea is to apply it pretty liberally with a dry brush, then hit it was a lacquer or sealant and re-apply. At first, I couldn't see what it was accomplishing, but as it dried I was astounded by the wintry vibes it helped bring to life.</p><p>Now, in the above photo, you may notice some very disgruntled, frost-bitten Rebel Troopers (from <em>Star Wars: Legion</em>), I enlisted their help to see how all these basing products worked on actual model bases.</p><h2>Huge Miniatures Model Basing</h2><picture>

  </picture><p>I started with a small handful of <em>Star Wars: Legion</em> models I'd already had painted. Pretty handy to have some snowy dudes to test out this snowy basing paste, huh?&nbsp;</p><p>I've always wanted to be the kind of hobby modeler and miniature gamer who fully bases his minis, but the reality is what you see above - it's actually a miracle that I even slapped some white acrylic paint around the bases of my Hoth Rebel Troopers.</p><p>So now, with the right tools and a reason to get back into it, I was ready to work on these bases of these minis.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/huge-miniatures-applying-basing-snow.jpeg?itok=dh0Ierv3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1440" height="1080">

  </picture><p>This is where I felt the utility of the included paint knife. While you can use just about anything to spread this Texture Paste onto something as large as a piece of scatter terrain, I found the narrow point of the paint knife perfect for getting between the legs of these figures.</p><p>After liberally applying snow to the bases of these figures, I wanted to go all out and hit them with the weathering powder as well, to ensure they had the right, snow-bound look to them.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/huge-miniatures-snowy-figures.jpeg?itok=LTzUAiI3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1440" height="1080">

  </picture><p>And I mean... just look at these poor guys. Stuck on Hoth freezing half to death, I feel like a really captured the desperation of their situation. It was so fun to mold the snow around them, with the one model on his knee really being designed to look "dug in" to the snow - an idea I was able to push by piling on the weathering powder on his hat, shoulders, and gun barrel.&nbsp;</p><p>I also used the Mud Texture Paste on some random <em>Legion</em> commander models I had lying around, to see if I could recreate the feeling of soldiers trucking through the mud and muck.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/huge-miniatures-mud-texture-paste.jpeg?itok=T5iImTPP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1440" height="1080">

  </picture><p>As you can see from the image above, the Mud Texture Paste is a little bit thinner and grainier than the Snow Texture Paste, by design.&nbsp;</p><p>This allowed me to create a much muckier and more fluid scene on these models' bases, allowing it to behave like and mimic Mud much better than if it had a similar constitution to the Snow paste.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Huge Miniatures Modeling Supplies - Final Thoughts</h2><p>What can I say? I'm completely hooked. I love the idea behind - and execution of - the Texture Paste. It's easy to use, dries to create realistic moments, and retains a strong color after drying. The 4-in-1 Tundra scatter was also a big hit, combining four different types of scatter foliage in one easy to use tub. And while the weathering powder took some getting used to, in the end I was really pleased with the results.&nbsp;</p><p>My only <em>real</em> complaint is that I used cheap corrugated cardboard as my scatter terrain base on this test and review! If I had known how much I was going to enjoy working with these products, and how strong the finished product would end up looking, I would have gone the full mile and custom cut some foam with the ol' hot wire cutter.&nbsp;</p><p>If you're looking to start creating scatter terrain for your games, or want to level up the bases of your miniatures, I cannot recommend Huge Miniatures highly enough.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has dropped a new Secret Lair Chaos Vault drop for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a>. Like all prior Chaos Vault drops, the cards and artwork is more random and experimental. However, this new drop isn't just experimenting with style, but with how it is sold.</p><h2>The Secret Lair Chaos Vault <em>Prints Charming</em> Announcement</h2><p>In an official <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/a-charming-curiosity-comes-to-secret-lairs-chaos-vault" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>, Wizards of the Coast highlighted the experiment at play with the new <em>Prints Charming</em> Secret Lair Chaos Vault drop.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>At first glance, it appears to be no different from prior Chaos Vault releases. Instead of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-chaos-vault-oishii-tokens-drop-brings-cute-food-to-magic-gathering" rel="nofollow">adorable foodstuffs</a>, moody sci-fi vistas, or friendly competition between <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-chaos-vault-secret-lair-is-for-cats-and-dogs" rel="nofollow">cats and dogs</a>, this drop will feature woodblock-inspired storybook art takes on cards from Lorwyn Shadowmoor. That artwork is provided by Kathleen Neeley, Roman Klonek, Pedro Oyarbide, and Sophy Hollington.</p><p>The drop features the following four cards:</p><ul><li data-list-item-id="e5d643c74c7e5ba37739d0203b082dd1b"><em>Nature's Lore</em></li><li data-list-item-id="ebe7f7bade2228e8f1c3da7e52e98a5f2"><em>Skyshroud Claim</em></li><li data-list-item-id="ec4ab8aef8a6da3ce3878ae80b08bc278"><em>Wood Elves</em></li><li data-list-item-id="e50e5f77d0a1cb97043ccc3420f6c99cb"><em>Dryad Arbor</em></li></ul><p>&nbsp;On the surface, these cards appear no different from other alternative card artwork. There is some creative playfulness with the border and the rules text being incorporated into the artwork. Given the fairy tale sensibilities of the release of the new <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/cards-to-upgrade-lorwyn-ecllipsed-commander-decks" rel="nofollow"><em>Lorwyn Eclipsed</em></a> set, this drop of cards would be right at home.</p><p>Here's the twist. There are multiple price listings for the <em>Prints Charming</em> Secret Lair Chaos Vault drop. This isn't an a la carte or a deluxe edition situation. You pay one of the listed prices, you get the same set of cards. Nothing more; nothing less. The post explicitly states this several times.</p><blockquote><p>All Prints Charming listings, including non-foil and foil editions, contain the exact same cards and contents at every price point. The only difference between listings is the price. Higher-priced listings do not include anything extra.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp; The non-foil MSRP listings for the drop are $9.99, $19.99, $29.99, $34.99, and $39.99. If you want foil, your choices are $19.99, $29.99, $39.99, $44.99, $49.99</p><p>The business decision behind this Secret Lair Chaos Vault drop is questionable. From a certain perspective, it is a more restrictive version of the "Pay What You Want" option used by various independent artists and creatives on different platforms. But, it's a high profile product by one of the largest tabletop companies in the world. That usually implies a certain premium price on their product.</p><p>Regardless, the Prints Charming Secret Lair Chaos Vault drop has sold extremely quickly. At time of writing, there is only one batch available: a foil drop at the $39.99 mark.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
