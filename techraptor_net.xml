            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Fabraz and publisher Atari have revealed the <em>Bubsy 4D </em>release date, so if you think everyone's (least?) favorite bobcat deserves one more shot, then it's nearly time to put your money where your mouth is.</p><p>As revealed by Atari <a href="https://x.com/atari/status/2014345190346011105" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">on social media</a>, <em>Bubsy 4D </em>will be arriving on PC and consoles on May 22nd, and if, for some reason, you'd like to pre-order the game, you can do so now on your platform of choice.</p><p>It's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bubsy-bobcat-makes-his-grand-return-for-some-reason" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="db3d0244-1ad5-4c64-ad19-5f7ed0f148aa" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">no secret</a> that <em>Bubsy </em>games <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/bubsy-woolies-strike-back-review-bubsy-is-still-bad" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ef96e2fa-8978-4a24-b83d-f084a4633ecc" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">aren't exactly well-received</a> by and large, but Fabraz, whose name you might recognize from 3D platformer <em>Demon Turf </em>and 2D offering <em>Slime-san</em>, is hoping it can change all that.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Could <em>Bubsy 4D </em>finally be the game to turn the franchise around?</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This time around, Bubsy is making a return to 3D, which feels like a pretty ballsy move given how things went for the bobcat's last excursion into the third dimension.</p><p>As you'd probably expect (and as is probably necessary given <em>Bubsy</em>'s history), <em>Bubsy 4D </em>is taking a self-aware approach; Bubsy himself is returning to the fold after a long absence, and characters around him frequently question whether he's up to the job.</p><p>The game itself is a fairly straightforward 3D collectathon platformer in which Bubsy must navigate a series of "expansive craft-themed levels" and do battle with vicious BaaBots in order to recover his beloved Golden Fleece.</p><p>You can check out the new release date announcement trailer for <em>Bubsy 4D </em>right here. It gives a sense of what kind of gameplay you can expect if you decide to humor the bobcat one last time.</p>
<p>I've been talking smack about <em>Bubsy </em>for this whole piece, but I won't lie: I'm actually rooting for Fabraz and Atari on this one, because I played the <em>Bubsy 4D </em>demo, and it's...well, it's quite fun. Don't tell anyone I said that.</p><p>In any case, <em>Bubsy 4D </em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3237970/Bubsy_4D/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10016621" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/bubsy-4d/9P82VZJSZWGS" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox</a>, and both Switch 2 and Switch on May 22nd. Stay tuned to find out whether it's actually decent like the demo.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
