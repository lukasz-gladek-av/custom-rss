            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-overwatch-union<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Over 200 staffers on Blizzard's&nbsp;<em>Overwatch&nbsp;</em>franchise have formed a new wall-to-wall union under the banner of the Communications Workers of America, becoming the latest Blizzard outfit to do so.</p>

<p>Per an official <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/overwatch-game-developers-secure-union-recognition-communications-workers-america" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on the CWA website, the&nbsp;<em>Overwatch&nbsp;</em>Gamemakers Guild (OWGG) includes "game developers across all disciplines, including design, production, engineering, art, sound, and quality assurance".</p>

<p>It's the latest union to be formed as part of the wider Activision Blizzard organization. Others include a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/world-of-warcraft-blizzard-union" rel="nofollow">union of&nbsp;<em>World of Warcraft&nbsp;</em>developers</a>, which was Blizzard's first of its kind, and a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/raven-software-activision-microsoft-labor-complaint" rel="nofollow">unionized group of employees</a> at&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>developer (and Activision subsidiary) Raven Software.</p>

<p>He goes on to say that the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>World of Warcraft&nbsp;</em>union's formation was "heartening" for the then-nascent OWGG. Fellow&nbsp;<em>Overwatch&nbsp;</em>staffer and OWGG organizer Foster Elmendorf says the effort to "organize [the gaming] industry for the better" is "long overdue".</p>

<p>The new union's formation is part of a wider movement across the industry, which has seen thousands of workers unionize at their various companies. Other unions formed across the industry include folks at <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenimax-qa-union-strike" rel="nofollow">Bethesda parent ZeniMax</a>,&nbsp;<em>Evil West&nbsp;</em>outfit <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/flying-wild-hog-unionizes" rel="nofollow">Flying Wild Hog</a>, and staffers at&nbsp;<em>Just Cause&nbsp;</em>dev <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/over-100-avalanche-studios-developers-have-joined-union" rel="nofollow">Avalanche Studios</a>.</p>

<p>It's not limited to individual studios, either. Back in March, the US' first industry-wide union, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/united-videogame-workers-union-formed" rel="nofollow">United Videogame Workers Union</a>, was formed, and it's open for any industry employee to join.</p>

<p>When workers at Blizzard's Albany QA division <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activision-blizzard-albany-union-vote-approved-by-nlrb" rel="nofollow">voted to unionize</a>&nbsp;back in 2022, Activision Blizzard was accused of attempting to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activision-blizzard-accused-of-trying-to-stifle-albany-union" rel="nofollow">stifle the union's formation</a>, with the company subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activision-blizzard-fights-to-delay-union-vote-tabulation" rel="nofollow">battling to delay the vote tabulation</a> for said union.</p>

<p>Activision Blizzard has also been subject to a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/union-files-nlrb-complaint-against-activision-blizzard-over-labor-law" rel="nofollow">National Labor Relations Board complaint</a>&nbsp;filed on behalf of the CWA back in 2021, with the complaint alleging violations of federal labor law on the company's part.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see whether this new&nbsp;<em>Overwatch&nbsp;</em>union proceeds smoothly or whether Blizzard decides it wants to try and stand in the way. Stay tuned for more.</p>
