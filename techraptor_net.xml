            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fragpunk-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bad Guitar Studio has announced the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S release date for&nbsp;<em>FragPunk</em>, and the console versions of the game are not too far away at all.</p>

<p>As revealed in an official announcement on the&nbsp;<em>FragPunk&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.fragpunk.com/news/official/20250410/40587_1226546.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, the free-to-play 5v5 hero shooter will be coming to current-gen machines on April 29th. Unfortunately, it's not hitting last-gen consoles, nor has a Switch 2 version of the game been announced at time of writing.</p>

<p><em>FragPunk&nbsp;</em>launched on Steam on March 6th as planned, but just a day or so before the game's planned console launch, it was <a href="https://x.com/PlayFragPunk/status/1897074010997035438" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">delayed</a>, with Bad Guitar citing "unexpected technical challenges in optimization and adaptation".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fragpunk-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-release-date-firing.jpg?itok=vTRuhqml 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fragpunk-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-release-date-firing.jpg?itok=tOewjM6p 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bad Guitar's colorful shooter&nbsp;<em>FragPunk&nbsp;</em>is launching on consoles later this month.</figcaption></figure><p>In order to make up for that delay, Bad Guitar says it will issue "plenty of gifts" to those playing&nbsp;<em>FragPunk&nbsp;</em>on consoles, including "exclusive time-limited event rewards" from the start of the game's first season through April 29th.</p>

<p>That's slightly confusingly worded, but it sounds as though all console players will be receiving those gifts without having to do anything, which is nice. Additionally, if you bought the Pioneer Bundle on consoles, you'll get "additional gifts".</p>

<p>In case you're wondering,&nbsp;<em>FragPunk&nbsp;</em>will also support crossplay between PC and consoles, and cross-progression will also be supported, so you can take your&nbsp;<em>FragPunk&nbsp;</em>stuff from PC and enjoy it on PS5 or Xbox Series X|S if you like.</p>

<p>Bad Guitar is also promising a "smooth gameplay experience" on consoles, including aim assist for those on controllers, which is designed to "minimize the disparity between controller and keyboard/mouse input".</p>




<p>In case you're wondering what&nbsp;<em>FragPunk&nbsp;</em>is, it's a 5v5 hero shooter with a unique selling point in the form of its Shard Cards, which can be deployed to add effects like buff shots for your teammates, healing, and plenty of other extras.</p>

<p>The game is going up against the likes of Blizzard's&nbsp;<em>Overwatch 2&nbsp;</em>and NetEase's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-40m" rel="nofollow">hugely popular&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em></a>, and it remains to be seen whether it's got the staying power of those games or whether it'll go the way <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/2k-project-ethos-studio-head-fired-report" rel="nofollow">2K's&nbsp;<em>Project Ethos&nbsp;</em>seems to be going</a>.</p>

<p>You can play&nbsp;<em>FragPunk&nbsp;</em>for free right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2943650/FragPunk/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, and it's coming to <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012871" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/fragpunk/9mw715j1p29d" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on April 29th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-cursed-hollow-event<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Kinetic Games has announced&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia</em>'s first major event for 2025 in the form of Cursed Hollow, which will give you the chance to unlock all kinds of unique rewards when it debuts next week.</p>

<p>Arriving on April 17th, Cursed Hollow will operate in a similar manner to other seasonal events like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-crimson-eye-update" rel="nofollow">Crimson Eye</a> or Winter's Jest, and the event will also sport a number of improvements based on feedback received for previous updates.</p>

<p>The new event will task you with "identifying ghosts, completing objectives, and discovering the totems scattered across [<em>Phasmophobia</em>'s] maps". Activating totems will affect "that which haunts you - the Forest Spirit", and those effects might be boons or drawbacks for you and your team.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/phasmophobia-cursed-hollow-event-totems.jpg?itok=6byqXshq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/phasmophobia-cursed-hollow-event-totems.jpg?itok=kox7Cc9J 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Cursed Hollow brings creepy totems and a Forest Spirit to&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>next week.</figcaption></figure><p>Rewards for the event will be split into two categories: Community and Personal. Community goals will essentially work the same way as previous&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>event goals have, while Personal goals will be "unique to the player".</p>

<p>Additionally, Cursed Hollow will be a little different to previous updates thanks to changes based on community feedback. These include a map rotation system, a shorter duration for the event, and gameplay modifiers similar to those introduced in Crimson Eye.</p>

<p>Of course, it won't just be the seasonal event that debuts in the Cursed Hollow update; Kinetic Games says there will also be a number of permanent gameplay improvements and quality-of-life tweaks, all of which will be revealed in the patch notes next week.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/phasmophobia-cursed-hollow-event-barn.jpg?itok=Gg7cF70C 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/phasmophobia-cursed-hollow-event-barn.jpg?itok=ei67pZTX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Phasmophobia</em>'s Cursed Hollow update will rotate its maps for added variety.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia</em>, it's a multiplayer horror game in which you and your team must investigate paranormal phenomena across a range of different maps.</p>

<p>Released in Early Access all the way back in 2020,&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>also got its long-awaited console release in December last year, with the game going on to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-console-sales" rel="nofollow">sell a million copies on consoles</a> in just over a month.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/739630/Phasmophobia/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/phasmophobia/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/phasmophobia-game-preview/9N6D60SBZN05" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. The Cursed Hollow event is due to start on April 17th.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Netflix's Devil May Cry Has Already Been Renewed for a Second Season]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-devil-may-cry-renewed-second-season</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/netflixs-devil-may-cry-has-already-been-renewed-for-a-second-season.1160580/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-devil-may-cry-renewed-second-season<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Netflix has announced that its&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>series, which is helmed by&nbsp;<em>Castlevania</em>'s Adi Shankar, has been renewed for a second season just a week after its initial air date.</p>

<p>In a fairly simple <a href="https://x.com/netflix/status/1910331989678338091" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Netflix confirms that season 2 of&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>is coming "soon", although the streaming giant stops short of announcing a date for the second season's airing. The announcement is accompanied by some appropriately edgy-looking artwork of protagonist Dante.</p>

<p>Shankar's&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>series was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/adi-shankar-announces-devil-may-cry-series-alongside-castlevania" rel="nofollow">announced back in 2018</a>, with the showrunner affectionately referring to the show as part of his "bootleg multiverse" alongside his animated&nbsp;<em>Castlevania&nbsp;</em>series.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/netflix-devil-may-cry-season-2-vergil.jpg?itok=JJhw132b 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/netflix-devil-may-cry-season-2-vergil.jpg?itok=9FHh7YFA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Adi Shankar's&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>will be returning for a second season.</figcaption></figure><p>We got our first look at the show <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-releases-first-look-at-tomb-raider-and-devil-may-cry-animated-series" rel="nofollow">back in late 2023</a>, when a debut trailer was released alongside an initial look at Netflix's&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>animated series.</p>

<p>Following that, it was announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/devil-may-cry-animated-series-april-2025" rel="nofollow">back in September last year</a>&nbsp;that the&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>series would debut in April this year, and indeed, the series' first eight-episode run premiered on April 3rd to <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/tv/devil-may-cry-2025/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">mostly positive reviews</a>.</p>

<p>The show revolves around longtime&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>series protagonist Dante, who comes into conflict with a terrorist known only as the White Rabbit while also battling the government organization DARKCOM.</p>

<p>Given that the show's timeline doesn't quite seem to match up with the games' story, it's reasonable to assume that the show isn't part of the games' canon, although Shankar could well prove me wrong on that front with the second season.</p>




<p><em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>is just one of the shows based on video games to debut in recent years. Others include the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Castlevania&nbsp;</em>and its sequel series&nbsp;<em>Nocturne</em>, as well as shows based on the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kaitlyn-dever-last-of-us-season-2" rel="nofollow"><em>The Last of Us</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-prime-video-100-million-viewers" rel="nofollow"><em>Fallout</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/more-league-of-legends-shows-on-way" rel="nofollow"><em>League of Legends</em></a>.</p>

<p>In addition, shows based on properties like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pacific-drive-tv-series-rights-james-wan" rel="nofollow">Pacific Drive</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>(yes, another one) are also reportedly in the works, although the UK's Daily Mail cast some <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-14569897/Phoebe-Waller-Bridge-gravy-train.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">doubt</a> on the latter earlier today.</p>

<p>You can check out all eight episodes of Netflix's&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>on the streaming platform right now. The show's second season doesn't have a release date or window yet.</p>
