            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Amazon has officially revealed that its ill-fated MMO <em>New World</em>, currently carrying the additional title of <em>Aeternum</em>, will be shutting down in January next year, so it's time to start writing those bucket lists.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.newworld.com/en-us/news/articles/the-future-of-new-world-aeternum-what-to-expect" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a post</a> on the game's official website, Amazon says <em>New World </em>will be taken down from all platforms on January 31st next year. Remember, that's 2027, not 2026, so don't worry; the game isn't going anywhere just yet.</p><p>If you haven't played <em>New World </em>yet and you were thinking of giving it a try, you've probably noticed it's not available anywhere anymore. That's because Amazon delisted the game yesterday. If you already own it, you can still play it, but otherwise, you're out of luck.</p><figure role="group">

<p>As well as keeping the servers open, Amazon says it'll also be extending <em>New World</em>'s Nighthaven season all the way up until shutdown, which means you'll be able to experience the seasonal events and content for the next year or so.</p><p>The in-game Marks of Fortune currency will be removed from sale this July, and you won't be able to get any refunds on purchases made before then, so think carefully before you grab any currency bundles.</p><p>World bosses and bonus weeks will continue until <em>New World</em>'s shutdown, but as Amazon <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-world-development-ending-amazon-layoffs" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="96fc63cd-c591-42ec-8af0-59f8445fa07b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">has previously stated</a>, the game won't be getting any new content or bug fixes. What you see right now is what you get.</p><p><em>New World </em>launched all the way back in 2021 and experienced a somewhat rocky release, with the game's initial weeks being plagued by a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/game-breaking-new-world-invincibility-exploit-discovered" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a1ac2420-38d6-42c7-8305-a2907143df68" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">number</a> of game-breaking <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-world-hatchet-bug-gives-huge-damage-boost-to-players" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="39cba7a6-4fc8-4611-808d-b7e998fee769" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">bugs</a> (not to mention <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-world-is-bricking-gigabyte-rtx-30-series-gpus" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3a694e8f-6d8e-4d39-829c-562a5141f06e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">hardware-destroying problems</a>).</p>
<p>The MMO trundled along for a while before <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-world-moving-to-seasonal-model-expansion-coming-this-fall" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="271e38d8-8e18-483a-b744-4f0d30933667" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">moving to a seasonal model in 2023</a>, a system it stuck with until its demise. In June 2024, <em>New World </em>was relaunched as <em>New World: Aeternum</em> alongside its console release, a move <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-world-review-bomb-relaunch" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5e72f24c-6992-4953-8989-161ca039bc90" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">about which fans were not happy</a>.</p><p>This is where I'd normally say that if you want to check out <em>New World </em>before its death, you can do so on various platforms, but, well, you can't (unless you already have, of course).

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Ace Combat 7 </em>sales have passed yet another big milestone, developer and publisher Bandai Namco has announced, and the milestone feels appropriate given the anniversary the game is about to celebrate.</p><p>As revealed in a press release, sales of the latest entry in the long-running flight combat series have reached seven million, which means another million players have picked up <em>Ace Combat 7 </em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ace-combat-7-sales-6m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6fcc05c9-9918-40b4-b1f3-9a72e7aec374" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">since last year</a>. Let the franchise's popularity never be understated!</p><p>As well as this game in particular crossing a new sales barrier, the <em>Ace Combat </em>series as a whole has now passed 21 million sales, Bandai Namco says. That's not too shabby at all, although the series did technically begin way back in 1995.</p><figure role="group">

</figure>
<p>To celebrate the new sales achievement, Bandai Namco says you can now listen to music from both <em>Ace Combat X </em>and <em>X2 </em>on streaming services, so if you're a fan of the series' soundtracks, then fill your boots.</p><p><em>Ace Combat 7 </em>is, as the name suggests, the seventh mainline installment in the <em>Ace Combat </em>series of combat-oriented flight sims (although it's not really a realistic sim along <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator </em>lines).</p><p>The series melds air combat (which is also the name of the very first game in the franchise) with melodramatic storylines, so if you think traditional flight sims are a touch dry, then this might be the franchise for you.</p>
<p>Bandai Namco will no doubt be pleased with <em>Ace Combat 7</em>'s sales achievement, because there's an eighth game on the way; <em>Ace Combat 8: Wings of Theve </em>was announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-game-awards-2025-recap" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7f71e644-2289-45c0-a1c9-dc56c3797e8a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">during last year's Game Awards ceremony</a>, and it's set for release this year.</p><p>In the meantime, if you want to catch up with the series, you can check out <em>Ace Combat 7 </em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/502500/ACE_COMBAT_7_SKIES_UNKNOWN/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0700-CUSA05636_00-AC7STANDARDED000" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PS4</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/ace-combat-7-skies-unknown/brvm8rnwlxh1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox One</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/ace-combat-7-skies-unknown-deluxe-edition-switch/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch</a> (and on current-gen consoles through backwards compatibility).
