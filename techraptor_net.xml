            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-sales-3m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Medieval colony sim&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>has crossed another big sales milestone, publisher Hooded Horse and developer Slavic Magic have revealed.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>has now hit three million sales across all of the PC storefronts on which it's available. That means the game has picked up another million sales for itself in the time between now and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-sales-two-million" rel="nofollow">May last year</a>.</p>

<p>Three million is a particularly impressive number when considering that&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>is available on Game Pass (as long as you're a PC Game Pass or Game Pass Ultimate member, at any rate; the console version isn't available via the service).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/manor-lords-sales-3m-village.jpg?itok=LTg9_RtJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/manor-lords-sales-3m-village.jpg?itok=URerxqwZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>has hit another big sales milestone.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>was originally released via Early Access in April 2024, quickly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-price-player-count" rel="nofollow">climbing the Steam charts</a> and passing 120,000 concurrent players within just a few hours of its release (again, impressive given it landed on Game Pass on day one as well).</p>

<p>Within just a few days, the game had managed to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-sales-player-count" rel="nofollow">surpass a million sales</a>, and it had broken the two million barrier inside three weeks. Naturally, sales have slowed since then, but amassing another million sales in less than a year is solid work.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>is, it's a medieval colony sim-come-city builder in which you must build and oversee your very own village (hence the title).</p>

<p>You'll be responsible for overseeing the game's "complex economic and social simulations", guiding your village and constructing different districts depending on what you need to grow and flourish.</p>




<p><em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>does have combat, but by its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-manor-lords-roadmap-yet" rel="nofollow">own developer's admission</a>, it's not intended to be a&nbsp;<em>Total War&nbsp;</em>competitor; it's a city builder with battles rather than a war simulator with city building.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>right now on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1363080/Manor_Lords/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/manor_lords" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/manor-lords-ef795f" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Epic</a>, and the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/manor-lords-game-preview/9p5f966564fs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Microsoft Store</a>, and it's also available on Xbox.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-xiv-patch-7-2-set-to-bring-new-dungeon-and-more-in-march.1103319/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-patch-7-2-march<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has revealed the release window for&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>Patch 7.2, as well as the kind of content you can expect when the update rolls around.</p>

<p>Following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-patch-71-release-date" rel="nofollow">November's</a> Patch 7.1, the new patch, which launches in late March, largely represents business as usual for&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>patches, with one major exception.</p>

<p>Like previous patches, 7.2 will continue the main post-<em>Dawntrail&nbsp;</em>storyline, so if you've been keeping up with what happened after the events of that expansion, you'll appreciate what's being added. It'll also bring a brand new dungeon in the form of the Underkeep, which, in turn, will also bring new bosses to fight and new loot to collect.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-xiv-patch-7.2-pictomancer.jpg?itok=HU9L8Wpk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-xiv-patch-7.2-pictomancer.jpg?itok=ThM1TkDA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>Patch 7.2 launches in late March, Square Enix has confirmed.</figcaption></figure><p>The big new addition, however, comes with the introduction of the Occult Crescent, a new "large-scale battle-oriented duty" that represents&nbsp;<em>Dawntrail</em>'s version of <i>Shadowbringers</i>' Bozjan Southern Front or&nbsp;<em>Stormblood</em>'s Forbidden Land Eureka.</p>

<p>Much like those activities, the Occult Crescent will task large numbers of players with exploring its map, battling its inhabitants, and taking on a series of objectives to contribute to a larger-scale initiative. More information about the Occult Crescent will likely be released as we draw closer to Patch 7.2's release date.</p>

<p><em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>'s next patch will also introduce the next part of the eight-man Arcadion raid. The Cruiserweight tier will add four more encounters, and if you played the first part of the raid, you'll likely know roughly what to expect on this front.</p>

<p>A new Trial will also be added as part of the patch's story content, and you'll be able to take on a level 100 Unreal-difficulty version of the Suzaku Hells' Kier trial as well, so there's plenty of combat-oriented content to keep you busy.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-outsold-expectations</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-outsold-expectations-square-enix-says.1103280/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-outsold-expectations<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It would appear the stars have aligned, because Square Enix has admitted that one of its games outsold its expectations, a fairly rare occurrence for a studio that seems to want a lot from its releases.</p>

<p>In its Q3 financial results <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/pdf/25q3release.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">release</a>, Square Enix says that while its numbers are down for the nine-month period between April and December 2024 when compared to the same period last year, the quarter itself saw operating income increase, largely due to&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remaster</em>.</p>

<p>The company says the JRPG remake achieved "stronger sales" than it had "initially assumed", helping to offset newer releases achieving lower sales than tentpole games like&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI&nbsp;</em>and the&nbsp;<em>Pixel Remaster&nbsp;</em>series.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-sales-battle.jpg?itok=eUQg7jM2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-sales-battle.jpg?itok=m2DDXHdX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake&nbsp;</em>did better than Square Enix expected it to.</figcaption></figure><p>Although Square Enix says its latest games haven't done as well as&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>, it's worth remembering the company also said that game, along with&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-16-rebirth-profits-square-enix" rel="nofollow">didn't meet its expectations</a>.</p>

<p>Square Enix hasn't shared how many sales either of those games achieved (nor, indeed, has it shared specific figures for&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake</em>), but the company has something of a reputation for expecting its games to achieve what some might call unrealistic sales figures.</p>

<p>Naturally, the company's nine-month period between April and September also benefited from the launch of&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>expansion&nbsp;<em>Dawntrail</em>, although that launch didn't stop net sales and operating income from falling for that period. Instead, it likely just softened the blow.</p>




<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake&nbsp;</em>is, well, the clue's in the name; it's a remake of classic JRPG&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest 3&nbsp;</em>using Square Enix's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/trademark-for-octopath-travelers-hd-2d-filed-by-square-enix" rel="nofollow">trademarked</a> HD-2D style, which combines nostalgic pixel art with chunky 3D.</p>

<p>You can check the game out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2701660/DRAGON_QUEST_III_HD2D_Remake/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/dragon-quest-iii/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake/9P5ZQNN9WRL2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> if you want to see what all the fuss is about.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/undaunted-battle-of-britain-review-undaunted-takes-to-skies<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Undaunted</em> by Osprey Games, is a series heralded as perfectly blending a deck-building game with wargaming elements. The series of games first started in 2020 with <em>Undaunted Normandy</em>, and rather than start with a review of the original game, we're working backwards from the latest game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/undaunted-2200-callisto-old-mechanics-new-tricks" rel="nofollow"><em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto</em></a>. This time we're looking at <em>Undaunted Battle of Britain</em>, which takes the <em>Undaunted</em> rules to the sky, and as a previous member of His Majesties' Royal Air Force, one that I'm personally excited to get into.</p>

<p>Although we've only just started covering&nbsp;<em>Undaunted</em> on the site, we have previously covered several of Osprey Games' titles, including the brand new <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bolt-action-3rd-edition-review-snapping-into-action" rel="nofollow">Bolt Action 3rd Edition</a></em>, copublished with Warlord games, and also some of their awesome supplements for their miniatures agnostic system,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/frostgrave-wildwoods-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Frostgrave</em></a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/undaunted-battle-of-britain-2.jpg?itok=4ycFfiu- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/undaunted-battle-of-britain-2.jpg?itok=W5EMip9Z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Games of&nbsp;<em>Undaunted Battle of Britain</em> take place on map tiles, over the sea and coastlines of the UK and Europe.</figcaption></figure><h2>How Do You Play Undaunted Battle of Britain?</h2>

<p>In games of <em>Undaunted</em>, as was the case in&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/undaunted-2200-callisto-old-mechanics-new-tricks" rel="nofollow"><em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto</em></a>, players draw 4 cards from their deck each turn and then use those cards to play actions from the tokens they have on the board, such as moving and attacking. Certain cards also allow you to draw more cards from your supply, or move cards from your deck to your supply, allowing you to tailor your deck as you play. Rather than introducing new tokens as cards are added to your deck as the other <em>Undaunted</em> titles we've covered did, in <em>BoB, in&nbsp;</em>certain scenarios, aircraft start grounded and need to take off before they can take actions as normal.</p>

<p>This card system, as well as working for actions, also controls a unique damage system. As a unit takes hits, you must discard a matching card from your hand. If you don't have a matching card in your hand, you discard one from your discard pile, and if there isn't one there too, you discard it from your deck. If you can't find the card at all, the unit is eliminated. This can put real pressure on going first in the turn and focuses you on picking your targets. If a unit you have the card for in your hand is hit, then you discard the card and you might not be able to activate it this turn. It also adds a nice hidden element as you and your opponent try to determine how many cards units have left, and which is the optimum target to hit.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/undaunted-battle-of-britain-4.jpg?itok=z561iVD3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/undaunted-battle-of-britain-4.jpg?itok=b2w0F5IM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Undaunted Battle of Britain </em>captures dogfighting perfectly, with bonuses for getting your target in the weak rear arc, bombers have multiple arcs though, so you need to be carful.</figcaption></figure><h2>How Does The Ariel Combat Work In Undaunted Battle of Britain?</h2>

<p>The difference between <em>Undaunted Battle of Britain</em>, and the other <em>Undaunted</em> games, is that <em>BoB</em> is focused on aerial combat and the difficulties that entails. For example, in other games in the series, you don't have to move or worry about the facing of your unit when shooting. In <em>Undaunted Battle of Britain</em>, every time you activate a unit, it has to move, and its directional facing for shooting is shown on the unit's token.</p>

<p>This means that positioning is key over the other <em>Undaunted</em> games, and anyone who's played <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/star-wars-x-wing-minatures-game-2nd-edition-core-set-review-perfect-time-to-join" rel="nofollow"><em>Star Wars X-Wing</em></a>&nbsp;will feel right at home. If your fighter flies past your enemy, it's not an easy matter of turning to attack them next turn, aircraft have to wheel around, taking them out of position and circling to face their target again, which can take a couple of turns. This captures the thematic feel of WWII dogfights perfectly, as fighters would zip past each other and then maneuver to get the upper hand.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/undaunted-battle-of-britain-6.jpg?itok=3PasnwVG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/undaunted-battle-of-britain-6.jpg?itok=_exyIRUj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Undaunted Battle of Britain </em>replaces the fog of war with discord cards, which fill up your deck if you play a comms card when you're more than a space away from the rest of the squadron.</figcaption></figure><p>Another change from other <em>Undaunted</em> games is that the fog of war has gone. This was a mechanic that as you scouted ahead on the map, you added fog of war cards to your deck (interference in <em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto</em>). In <em>Battle of Britain</em>, you need to keep your matched units grouped close together when you play communications cards, otherwise you get a discord card added to your deck. Keeping your aircraft together can be challenging, so this mechanic is a great reflection of the radio communications at the time, and the challenges of radio communications in general, and is a great thematic inclusion.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/undaunted-battle-of-britain-5.jpg?itok=XRCxB49D 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/undaunted-battle-of-britain-5.jpg?itok=ZIKIroSZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Lufrwaffe entered the Battle of Britian with superior numbers and technology, and&nbsp;<em>Undaunted Battle of Britain </em>captures this theme well without making the game unbalanced.</figcaption></figure><h2>Does Undaunted Battle of Britain Have Different Factions?</h2>

<p><em>Undaunted Battle of Britain&nbsp;</em>features the 2 historical forces that were part of the campaign during WWII, the German Luftwaffe and the United Kingdom's Royal Air Force (RAF). The reality of the war was that the Luftwaffe was coming off the back of a string of victories over most of Northern Europe. Their pilots were experienced and their aircraft were technologically advanced. The RAF was struggling to match production to get aircraft into the sky.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To capture this in the game, without making the units vastly different, across the developing scenarios that introduce new units and rules as you progress, the German forces generally have goals to achieve, while the RAF just need to take out Luftwaffe aircraft. It creates a great blend of feeling the pressure, but not making the scenarios too uneven for either side.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/undaunted-battle-of-britain-3.jpg?itok=lLWqkUDg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/undaunted-battle-of-britain-3.jpg?itok=L1-TvSS1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>As the scenarios progress in&nbsp;<em>Undaunted Battle of Britain, </em>further challanges are added.</figcaption></figure><h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On Undaunted Battle of Britain?</h2>

<p><i>Undaunted Battle of Britain&nbsp;</i>is a fantastic take on the <em>Undaunted</em> mechanics, perfectly blending the great core mechanics with the aerial combat theme. The scenarios are a blast to play through, and both forces feel realistically thematic. The way movement is handled perfectly captures dog-fighting and the change from fog-of-war to discord adds a realistic element to the battles. If I had to pick a criticism, it would be that the aircraft tokens are quite small, which would be fine for a huge map with hundreds of aircraft, but here I would have liked bigger tiles and tokens, but that would also have increased the size of the compact box that stores well.</p>

<h2>Should I Buy Undaunted Battle of Britain?</h2>

<p>If you like the <em>Undaunted</em> mechanics and want a new challenge, then <em>Undaunted Battle of Britain</em> offers that, or if you never played <em>Undaunted</em>, but want a great aerial combat game, then <em>U:BoB</em> is fantastic. If you don't like the sound of maneuvering to line up a target for shooting, then consider checking out one of the other <em>Undaunted</em> Games, either <em>Normandy</em> or <em>North Africa</em> for standard troop battles, <em>Stalingrad</em> for campaign play, or <em>2200 Callisto</em> for a futuristic battle with a deeper terrain system.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gta-6-still-on-track-for-fall<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Take-Two has recommitted to a fall 2025 release window for upcoming tentpole title&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, thus (at least temporarily) putting paid to rumors that the game might be delayed.</p>

<p>Commenting on the studio's third-quarter financial results, CEO Strauss Zelnick says the 2025 calendar year is shaping up to be one of his company's strongest, pointing to&nbsp;<em>GTA 6</em>'s release "in the fall", as well as&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mafia-old-country-no-italian-audio" rel="nofollow"><em>Mafia: The Old Country</em></a>'s launch in summer and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/borderlands-4-toilet-humor-narrative-director" rel="nofollow"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a>'s arrival sometime this year.</p>

<p>Zelnick also highlights the launch of&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7</em>, which is set to arrive on February 11th, although some players have already gotten their hands on the game in early access (and have made their thoughts on it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-early-access-mixed-reviews-50k-players" rel="nofollow">abundantly clear</a>).</p>

<p>Not only that, but basketball game <i>NBA 2K25&nbsp;</i>apparently outperformed Take-Two's expectations, racking up seven million sales in the third quarter and seeing an increase in player engagement as well.</p>

<p>In a followup <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-twos-strauss-zelnick-on-tariffs-ai-and-gta-6" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">interview</a> with GamesIndustry.biz, Zelnick shares some of his thoughts about Take-Two's current situation in the industry, as well as wider trends like AI and Donald Trump's recently-introduced tariffs.</p>

<p>Zelnick says he thinks "a world without tariffs is a better place", highlighting the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/esa-trump-tariffs-comments" rel="nofollow">ESA's opposition to the tariffs</a> and expressing a "cautiously optimistic" outlook regarding the recent postponement of tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports.</p>

On the one hand, he calls artificial intelligence "an oxymoron" and says "machines don't learn", but he also says AI can "help make our business more efficient and help us do better work" (although he's confident it won't lead to unemployment).</p>
