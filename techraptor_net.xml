            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dragon Quest</em> has been having a renaissance with the recent releases of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/dragon-quest-1-2-hd-2d-remake-preview-pax-east-2025" rel="nofollow"><em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-review-all-that-glitters-are-pixels" rel="nofollow"><em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em></a>. These remakes garnered high praise among the masses for revitalizing three iconic classics for the modern era, and make no mistake—Square Enix has every intention of continuing to deliver amazing, creative remakes of timeless classics with the upcoming release of <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em>. This game is sure to stun audiences with its beautiful hand-crafted 3D art style, modern gameplay features, and heartwarming story.</p>

<p><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em> is based on the original PlayStation title released in 2000 in Japan, then remade for the Nintendo 3DS in 2013, and focuses on the adventures of a group of childhood friends who leave their home of Estard Island to embark on a high-stakes adventure across the seas and through time itself to battle against unknown, evil forces and discover the mysteries of their world.</p>

<p>My one-hour hands-on experience with <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em>&nbsp;showed off a delightful game full of charm and mystique while also embodying the same fun, lighthearted spirit that made the original <em>Dragon Quest VII</em> such a well-revered title among fans of the franchise.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dq7r_wetlock_01.jpg?itok=HhIbPh8P 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dq7r_wetlock_01.jpg?itok=jgVGCfKW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>I started my time in the demo in Wetlock, a small town playing host to a traveling musician named Old Man Riffer. When I entered the village, Old Man Riffer was entertaining the villagers with his torban before quickly trying to leave despite the villagers' protests. At night, while staying in the inn, a haunting melody began to play, opening portals that spirit away the villagers into the unknown, prompting the party to investigate the strange disappearances.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When traversing the continent in search of answers, I found myself stumbling across Spliton-on-Sea, an abandoned fishing village that exhibited signs of being plagued by the same mystery as Wetlock. While exploring the map and interacting with important locations, the playable characters would trigger opportunities to talk to certain characters to get their thoughts on current events and helpful hints on where to go next.</p>

<p>Eventually, I found my way to Highendreigh Tower and began uncovering the truth behind the disappearances in Wetlock and Spliton-on-Sea, which led to the sudden appearance of Gracos the Demon King, who submerged the entire small island continent in water.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you’ve ever played a <em>Dragon Quest</em> game before or if you’re new to the franchise, the mechanics are easy to catch on to. Players get four basic commands: Attack, which launches a basic attack with your equipped weapon; Skills, which allows players to chose from a variety of abilities and spells that can be used by each character based on their growth and class; Items that can be used to to heal and buff players or attack and debuff enemies; and Defend to reduce damage from incoming enemy attacks.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dq7r_wetlock_13.jpg?itok=vhTcCOro 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dq7r_wetlock_13.jpg?itok=YR950owq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The Let Loose ability has also been added to <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em>, which activates after a character has been worked up during combat to allow them to unleash a powerful attack or skill.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em> also introduces the brand-new feature called Moonlighting, where the player can assign an additional class to each playable character to gain special abilities and skills to the playable characters. These additional classes can be changed at-will while playing without having to go anywhere special, like a church, inn, or checkpoint to change that additional vocation, and I found it really fun to be able to switch them whenever to create different strategic combinations before heading into battle.</p>

<p>One of my favorite characters to utilize was Aishe, who had Destiny’s Dancer as one of her vocations, giving her access to M-Pathy, a powerful healing spell.</p>

<p>I also had her as a Troubadour, which allowed her to cast Divine Intervention to prevent the party from experiencing instant death from an attack. This combination made her a powerhouse healer while still being effective at offensive attacks with her sword. Ruff, Maribel, and the protagonist also had their own combination of unique spells and abilities in the demo, and being able to mix and match to address any combat situation helped to keep the game refreshing and engaging.</p>

<p>The second location available in the demo was Emberdale at an earlier part of the game, which allowed me the chance to play as Kiefer, the Prince of Estard, alongside Maribel and the protagonist. When the party arrived in Emberdale, the town had been experiencing strange tremors from the volcano near their town, so they started preparations for the Flaming Festival to give fire back to the volcano as a tribute in hopes of stopping it from erupting.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dq7r_wetlock_11.jpg?itok=kLZZdfU6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dq7r_wetlock_11.jpg?itok=Fl2uWDb2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Meanwhile, Palmela, the town clairvoyant, had been trying to prevent the townspeople from doing that because she was certain the volcano would erupt because of it. At night, the townsfolk go to the volcano and begin feeding it their flames, but it slowly awakens the Glowering Inferno, a fire-based monster that had been living inside the volcano with plans to destroy the continent Emberdale sits on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The battle against the Glowering Inferno felt tense due to the limited abilities the party had access to in this demo, but it may also have to do with the fact that I sped down to the bottom of the volcano without fighting many enemies along the way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite the difficulties of the battle, various vocational abilities aided in making the battle easier to progress through. The protagonist had the Fledgling Fisherman vocation, which allowed him to use Ocean’s Devotion, an ability that made it so each ally would neutralize the next attack that targeted them.</p>

<p>Maribel, as a Mini Mayoress, could use Shewrd Operator, which allowed her to see through enemy resistances to make elemental attacks more effective. Keifer with the Heir Apparent vocation would cast Royal Flush, which reduced his defense stats while significantly increasing his attack power and critical hit chances.&nbsp;</p>

The beautiful diorama-esque style makes it feel like the player is looking down on a miniature world while moving around living-breathing maquettes rather than just simple 3D models.</p>

<p>It makes sense given Square Enix scanned in hand-crafted, super-detailed dolls of all of the main playable characters to give the game its unique, distinct art style, differentiating it from other Dragon Quest games while still embodying the charm of the character designs illustrated by the late Akira Toriyama.</p>

<p>As I finished my time with <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em>, I couldn’t help but wish I could have played even more because of how much fun I was having. There were also plenty of hidden mysteries within the demo that I wished I had the chance to find and experience, but that just means I have plenty to look forward to when the game comes out next year, and fans of the franchise or newcomers looking for a new turn-based RPG will also have plenty to enjoy and explore, too.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's been a minute since we've had a good ol' Wild West game, and while&nbsp;<em>Outlaws + Handful of Missions: Remaster</em>&nbsp;technically isn't recent, this new port from <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/nightdive-studios" rel="nofollow">Nightdive Studios</a> comes with a number of improvements to revitalize this lesser-known FPS.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like many westerns, tragedy is at the heart of this tale. James Anderson, former lawman and current badass, is on a quest for revenge after his peaceful life in retirement is ruined. With his wife deceased at the hands of some outlaws, and his daughter kidnapped by the very same, it's time to put the "Wild" in Wild West.</p>



<h2>Another Great Remaster Treatment from Nightdive</h2>

<p>Like most games from 1997, there's always some jank to be expected. That's why we can always trust Nightdive Studios to do a good job to make games feel modern and revitalized, which is the case here with&nbsp;<em>Outlaws + Handful of Missions: Remaster.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>The most noticeable difference between the original and its remaster is a fresh coat of paint. Every aspect of this title gets an improvement, visually. Weapon and enemy models are touched up, textures (from the ground you're standing on to the skyboxes above) are expertly recreated, all the while retaining their retro charm.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other noticeable improvements can be found in its cutscenes. Now,&nbsp;<em>Outlaws + Handful of Missions: Remaster</em>&nbsp;stands out a bit with its cartoonish cutscenes, with the excellent animation of characters making the story feel more like a classic, animated movie. These cutscenes are also brushed up to look cleaner for the modern day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of these visual improvements are enhanced even further with support for high refresh rates and resolutions. If you're familiar with Nightdive remasters, none of this should be a surprise. What I&nbsp;<em>really</em>&nbsp;like about this remaster is that you can switch from the new graphics to the old seamlessly, so it's always fun to see how areas are improved over the original.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other quality of life improvements come in this package. Controller support, for example, feels great to use even if I much prefer keyboard and mouse. Still, I didn't need to fiddle with the keybindings for my Xbox controller, and I was able to adapt to the control scheme almost immediately, so it's good news for those who prefer gamepads.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/outlaws-handful-of-missions-remaster-menu-options_0.jpg?itok=1J0o1jhw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/outlaws-handful-of-missions-remaster-menu-options_0.jpg?itok=wQTrJTlq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Gyro aim? Now we're talkin'.</figcaption></figure><p>I didn't encounter many bugs, if any at all, though one issue I encountered might qualify. The height of my jump would be really inconsistent; for example, I encountered a tower I had to scale, but my character couldn't jump up the stair-like ledges. I took a break from&nbsp;<em>Outlaws</em>, came back the next day, and the jump worked.</p>

<p>This weird inconsistency was a source of great frustration since it could essentially softlock me in several areas, but it would somehow fix itself if I kept trying or came back later. I really can't tell if this is an error on my part or the game's, but it's worth noting that this might happen to you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another issue that isn't related to bugs or anything like that is visibility.&nbsp;<em>Outlaws</em>&nbsp;can be&nbsp;<em>very</em>&nbsp;dark in some areas, and if you run out of lamp oil, you'd better pray you're going the right way. Similarly, crucial objects like keys and crowbars to pry blocked doors felt practically invisible, so these were missed a lot. The pickup radius for these items is also extremely small.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/outlaws-handful-of-missions-remaster-keys.jpg?itok=P1rfJgGu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/outlaws-handful-of-missions-remaster-keys.jpg?itok=saRIsP2m 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hands up, sir, I'm here for the keys. And directions.</figcaption></figure><h2>Where in Tarnation Do I Go?</h2>

<p>Although it is perhaps more narrative-focused than other FPS games from its time,&nbsp;<em>Outlaws</em>&nbsp;is still a classic shooter at its core. This particular FPS is created by the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/star-wars-dark-forces-remaster-review-return-of-kex" rel="nofollow"><em>Star Wars: Dark Forces</em></a>&nbsp;team, and that happens to be one of my favorite games of the genre.&nbsp;<em>Outlaws,</em>&nbsp;then, should be a slam dunk, right?</p>

<p>Well, I'm a bit mixed on this one. Let's start with the setting: It's the Wild West. I was never the biggest fan of westerns, and level design is usually my favorite aspect of boomer shooters. They do a decent job at creating a variety of stages, but I was never blown away by them, perhaps because of my personal biases.</p>

<p>Wild West towns, heavily armed forts, and even a moving train -- these are some of the levels you can expect in&nbsp;<em>Outlaws</em>. The train level is probably my favorite, as they usually are, because of their tight quarters and close-ranged combat. That, and I actually knew where to go (forward, obviously), whereas most levels are maze-like to the extreme.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/outlaws-handful-of-missions-remaster-fort.jpg?itok=coIxVkUK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/outlaws-handful-of-missions-remaster-fort.jpg?itok=IkvJWBBv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Plenty of things to hide, even in a single fort.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Star Wars: Dark Forces</em>' level design was also maze-like at times, but I never felt lost with the exception of a level or two. In&nbsp;<em>Outlaws</em>, the later levels continued to frustrate me as I bumbled around, looking for whatever the heck this game wanted me to do. Some of the solutions are puzzle-based, which require picking up certain items and interacting with specific objects.</p>

<p>The puzzle design in a number of levels here is obtuse and devoid of fun, and sometimes it was hard to find where you needed to place certain items. I'd wager half of my playtime with&nbsp;<em>Outlaws</em>&nbsp;was because I was lost, which is just so frustrating. The issue with keys being super hard to see in environments exacerbates this issue.</p>

<p>Some levels, particularly in the "Handful of Missions" portion (these are just extra missions separate from the story), feel more well-designed. The Civil War level is an exciting and enemy-heavy level with a fun theme around it, and the Marshal Training missions are shorter but more combat-focused as well -- bonus, you usually don't get lost in these ones.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/outlaws-handful-of-missions-remaster-combat.jpg?itok=MUhw57UL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/outlaws-handful-of-missions-remaster-combat.jpg?itok=dnGY2KBl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Don't mess with a seasoned lawman.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><h2>Gunslingin' in&nbsp;<em>Outlaws + Handful of Missions Remaster</em></h2>

<p>The gunplay in&nbsp;<em>Outlaws</em>&nbsp;feels a bit different than your traditional boomer shooter. Weapons have high stopping power, often dropping enemies in one or two hits. Even the base pistol, your trusty revolver, can drop most enemies no problem. It's not super accurate at long range, but if you use your alt-fire to fan the gun's hammer, it's a force to be reckoned with.</p>

<p>The rifle with its scope attachment is crucial, and it's super satisfying to take out a bunch of enemies from afar like a sniper. This is pretty crucial to succeed in&nbsp;<em>Outlaws</em>, or else you'll end up dead, and fast.</p>

<p>Enemies are just as lethal as the player, with their guns dealing a large amount of damage any time you're hit. Walk into a room full of enemies without a plan and you'll get dropped in a second, and that makes for quite an exciting time, at least when you're not bumbling around looking for where to go next.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/outlaws-handful-of-missions-remaster-guns.jpg?itok=2OCwZKj9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/outlaws-handful-of-missions-remaster-guns.jpg?itok=JXmBCkMw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A shotgun can be useful&nbsp;<em>sometimes</em>.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>In terms of weapon variety, I find&nbsp;<em>Outlaws</em>&nbsp;to be lacking. There aren't all that many weapons to begin with, and three of them are shotguns. The shotguns all feel the same to use, and frankly, aren't all that viable when you have to reload after each shot. Most of my time was spent using the rifle and revolver, and their ammo is plentiful.</p>

<p>You have dynamite, which is a bit like grenades but more dangerous, and the throwing mechanics for it seem a bit clunky, as well as some knives that I also couldn't figure out how to throw well. If all else fails, you can use your fists and kill most enemies in one hit -- which is actually pretty funny -- but it's dangerous to get in close.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/outlaws-handful-of-missions-remaster-vault.jpg?itok=rkQFbl8p 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/outlaws-handful-of-missions-remaster-vault.jpg?itok=XyehT7Ek 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some fun behind-the-scenes content is included, as they are in most Nightdive titles.</figcaption></figure>

<p><em>Outlaws + Handful of Missions: Remaster</em>&nbsp;was a FPS I wasn't all too familiar with, despite my quest to consume every boomer shooter ever invented. I was glad to have played this one, especially with Nightdive's improvements, but I don't see myself coming back. Level design is just a bit too obtuse. At this point,&nbsp;<em>Outlaws</em>&nbsp;is nearly 30 years old, so there's not much that can be done but to enjoy what is an adequate, if frustrating, shooter in this new remaster.&nbsp;</p>
