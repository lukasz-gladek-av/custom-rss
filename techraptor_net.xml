            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warcraft-2-remaster-leaked-rumor<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A&nbsp;<em>Warcraft 2&nbsp;</em>remaster may have just been leaked ahead of a major celebration for the franchise's 30th anniversary, which is due to take place next week.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1gkkzj1/warcraft_2_remastered_internal_alpha_leaked_via/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Redditor Neggy5</a>, a <a href="https://blizztrack.com/view/w2rd?type=versions" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new listing on tracking site BlizzTrack</a>, which monitors changes in the backend of the company's Battle.net service, points to the existence of an internal alpha test for something called&nbsp;<em>Warcraft 2: Remastered</em>.</p>

<p>All things considered, it's pretty difficult to imagine that this is anything other than a reworked modern version of the seminal 1995 RTS, which was originally titled&nbsp;<em>Warcraft 2: Tides of Darkness</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warcraft-2-remaster-leak-original-shot.jpg?itok=PEyMoc8Q 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warcraft-2-remaster-leak-original-shot.jpg?itok=Eas5tPeJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A remaster of classic 1995 RTS&nbsp;<em>Warcraft 2&nbsp;</em>could be on the way.</figcaption></figure><p>The listing gives practically nothing away, as you might imagine, but it does potentially confirm the existence of a remaster that may well be announced during next week's celebration.</p>

<p>According to the Redditor who discovered the listing, an upcoming update for the controversial&nbsp;<em>Warcraft 3: Reforged&nbsp;</em>was also discovered on the BlizzTrack website, so it seems that Blizzard's attempts to redeem that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warcraft-3-reforged-developer-update-does-little-to-satisfy-irate-fans">ill-received rework</a> also continue, although the nature of said update hasn't been revealed.</p>

<p>It's also worth noting that none of this has officially been confirmed; this could well just be an experimental attempt on Blizzard's part to go through options rather than a confirmation that something concrete is in the works.</p>

<p>Still, the timing of this leak seems pretty serendipitous with the&nbsp;<em>Warcraft&nbsp;</em>anniversary stream due to air next week, so I wouldn't be surprised if a&nbsp;<em>Warcraft 2&nbsp;</em>announcement was officially made at that point.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-blizzard.jpg?itok=ScnB5hX3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-blizzard.jpg?itok=wGY516Vx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Blizzard recently released&nbsp;<em>World of Warcraft&nbsp;</em>expansion&nbsp;<em>The War Within</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>The&nbsp;<em>Warcraft&nbsp;</em>anniversary stream airs a few months after Blizzard released&nbsp;<em>World of Warcraft: The War Within</em>, the tenth major expansion for the long-running MMORPG, which launched back in August.</p>

<p>It's also arriving after developers on said MMO <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/world-of-warcraft-blizzard-union">formed Blizzard's first wall-to-wall union</a> back in July, which essentially means said union represents the entire studio rather than a single unit within the company.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sega-is-officially-working-on-a-new-virtua-fighter-game.1028919/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sega-new-virtua-fighter-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega has officially announced that a new&nbsp;<em>Virtua Fighter&nbsp;</em>game is in the works as part of the company's drive to revive some of its classic franchises.</p>

<p>Speaking <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/why-sega-is-reviving-classics-like-shinobi-and-jet-set-radio-across-games-film-and-tv/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">to VGC</a>, Sega transmedia head Justin Scarpone revealed that alongside revivals of franchises like&nbsp;<em>Jet Set Radio</em>,&nbsp;<em>Golden Axe</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Shinobi</em>,&nbsp;which were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/game-awards-2023-recap-check-out-all-news-trailers-and-reveals">announced during last year's Game Awards</a>, a new&nbsp;<em>Virtua Fighter&nbsp;</em>game is also in development, although Scarpone stopped short of revealing further details.</p>

<p>Scarpone also says that "in certain instances", Sega has transmedia projects in development alongside its games, pointing to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shinobi-movie-announced">recently-revealed&nbsp;<em>Shinobi&nbsp;</em>movie</a> as an example, although it's not clear whether&nbsp;<em>Virtua Fighter&nbsp;</em>is also part of that initiative.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/virtua-fighter-revival-fight.jpg?itok=C3ym3pyD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/virtua-fighter-revival-fight.jpg?itok=OLNB1IcM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Virtua Fighter&nbsp;</em>is getting a revival.</figcaption></figure><p>Sega's&nbsp;<em>Virtua Fighter&nbsp;</em>revival is part of a company-wide initiative on Sega's part to emphasize its classic franchises, with several games currently in the works based on old-school Sega IPs.</p>

<p>These projects include a reboot of&nbsp;<em>Crazy Taxi</em>, which Sega says <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crazy-taxi-reboot-open-world-mmo">will be an open-world MMO</a> in contrast to the original game's classic arcade approach to gameplay, as well as reworks of <i>Golden Axe</i>,&nbsp;<em>Shinobi</em>, <i>Jet Set Radio</i>, and&nbsp;<em>Streets of Rage&nbsp;</em>(in the latter case, a reboot distinct from <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/streets-of-rage-4">2020's&nbsp;<em>Streets of Rage 4</em></a>).</p>

<p>We don't have any kind of inclination regarding what exactly Sega is planning to do with these franchises (beyond the&nbsp;<em>Crazy Taxi&nbsp;</em>reboot, of course), but we'll likely learn more in the coming months.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/streets-of-rage-4-sega-virtua-fighter-reboot.jpg?itok=eMj77dZv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/streets-of-rage-4-sega-virtua-fighter-reboot.jpg?itok=3GTrRjAD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sega is currently working on reboots of a number of its core franchises.</figcaption></figure><p>Elsewhere in recent Sega news, the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metaphor-refantazio-sales-1m-already">achieved major success with&nbsp;<em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em></a>, the JRPG developed by many members of the core creative team behind the&nbsp;<em>Persona&nbsp;</em>franchise. The game managed to sell a million copies within its first few hours on sale.</p>

<p>The gaming giant has also enjoyed recent success thanks to the release of&nbsp;3D platformer&nbsp;<em>Sonic x Shadow Generations</em>, which, much like the aforementioned JRPG, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-x-shadow-generations-sales-million">sold very strongly indeed on its launch day</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hogwarts-legacy-sales-top-30m-as-sequel-work-continues.1028853/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-sales-30m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Warner Bros has revealed that&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>sales have topped yet another huge sales milestone, further cementing the game's importance as a cornerstone of the studio's gaming strategy.</p>

<p>As noted in <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/harry-potter-franchise-future-tv-series-video-games-1236201249/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a Variety article</a>,&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>has now reached 30 million sales "as of last month" (that's Variety's wording), which means it's picked up another 15 million sales between <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-sales-smash-through-15-million-barrier">May 2023</a> and now. That's pretty impressive, even given the game's high profile.</p>

<p>Variety also notes that&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>was the top-selling game across the board in 2023, meaning it beat huge releases like&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom&nbsp;</em>and the&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em>remake (not to mention being the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/google-year-end-search-list-gaming-2023">most-Googled game of that year</a> as well).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hogwarts-legacy-sales-dragon.jpg?itok=fKlBqvwN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hogwarts-legacy-sales-dragon.jpg?itok=cDdurZF6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>is, surprise surprise, a big seller for Warner Bros.</figcaption></figure><p>Warner Bros. Interactive president David Haddad says the company is currently thinking hard about the sequel to <i>Hogwarts Legacy</i>, acknowledging that fans of the franchise are "looking for more things in this world" and that his studio is "spending a lot of time" considering how to give them what they want.</p>

<p>If you're someone who disagrees with&nbsp;<em>Harry Potter&nbsp;</em>writer J.K. Rowling's political stances, you might be dismayed to learn that while Rowling doesn't directly manage the franchise, Warner Bros is keeping her updated "via her literary agent" (again, that's Variety's wording, not WB's).</p>

<p>This news comes after it was reported that&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&nbsp;</em>developer Rocksteady is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-directors-cut-report">currently working on a Director's Cut version</a> of&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, although no official announcement on Rocksteady or Warner Bros' part has been made on that front.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hogwarts-legacy-sales-characters.jpg?itok=55pVpkNN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hogwarts-legacy-sales-characters.jpg?itok=Lw_DdnvS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A Director's Cut version of&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>is reportedly in the works.</figcaption></figure><p>Indeed,&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>'s financial success will no doubt come as a relief for Warner Bros given the fairly spectacular failure of the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em>, which cost Warner Bros $200 million after achieving <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-kill-justice-leagues-sales-disappointed-hogwarts-legacy-is-big-win">disappointing sales</a>.</p>

<p>It may even have been&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em>'s failure that led to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rocksteady-layoffs-suicide-squad">layoffs at the studio</a>&nbsp;in September, although the studio is reportedly in the midst of pitching a new single-player game that would return it to its&nbsp;<em>Batman: Arkham</em>-style roots (although it's not necessarily part of that franchise).</p>
