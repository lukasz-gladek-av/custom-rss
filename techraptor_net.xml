            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sons-of-forest-update-rafts-more<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Endnight Games has released a brand new&nbsp;<em>Sons of the Forest&nbsp;</em>update, and this one comes complete with new buildable structures, support for a major Steam feature, and even a fun new secret to find.</p>

<p>Naturally, this update isn't quite as big as the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sons-of-forest-10-patch-notes" rel="nofollow">huge 1.0 release in February last year</a>, but it does bring three new buildable raft structures, as well as a new mooring post for you to hitch your seafaring vehicles to.</p>

<p>You'll also find new buildable holders for the KnightV and hang glider vehicles, as well as a "procedural defensive wall placement system" to help you draw a more natural formation for your defensive fences.</p>

<p>What's more, there's also a new "secret player findable outfit" that you can discover somewhere in the game world. Endnight is remaining cagey regarding exactly how or where you find this item, so it's up to you to scour&nbsp;<em>Sons of the Forest</em>'s world to claim it.</p>

<p>Naturally, you can also look forward to tons and tons of new gameplay improvements and bug fixes. Make sure to check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1326470/view/526458302147592280" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">full patch notes</a> for this update if you want to see everything that's new.</p>




<p><em>Sons of the Forest&nbsp;</em>is the followup to the supremely spooky survival game&nbsp;<em>The Forest</em>, which was released back in 2018 for PC and PlayStation 4. The sequel is only available for PC, though.</p>

<p>This time, you'll be exploring a mysterious island to try and uncover the fate of a missing CEO, although you'll quickly be drawn into the same type of shenanigans the first game offered. I won't spoil, but this certainly isn't a cozy game, let's put it that way.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Sons of the Forest&nbsp;</em>right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1326470/Sons_Of_The_Forest/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-20m-shipments-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo is reportedly preparing a massive amount of Switch 2 shipments for the console's first year on sale, with the figure apparently dwarfing that of the original Switch.</p>

<p>According to a Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-16/nintendo-to-unveil-next-generation-switch-2-in-april" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a> (which, in turn, cites analyst Robin Zhu of Sanford C. Bernstein), Nintendo's supply chain network for the Switch 2 will allow it to sell "more than 20 million units in its first year".</p>

<p>As Bloomberg points out, that figure would be five million higher than the original Switch, which managed to sell 15 million units during its first year on sale. It's clear that Nintendo is banking on its new console doing well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-pipeline-20m-mario-kart.jpg?itok=DzIoVW6a 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-pipeline-20m-mario-kart.jpg?itok=msB6_bFT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nintendo is preparing its new console for around 20 million shipments in its first year, apparently.</figcaption></figure><p>It's also possible the company wants to avoid a repeat of the great chip shortage of the early 2020s, which made consoles like the PS5 and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-shortage-got-you-down-build-your-own-instead" rel="nofollow">original Switch</a> very hard to obtain. It might sound obvious, but Nintendo really doesn't want you not to be able to find this console in stores.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, Nintendo <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">finally announced</a> the Switch 2 earlier today after months of speculation regarding when the console would finally be revealed.</p>

<p>It's fair to say that the announcement itself was pretty terse; it showed off the console's form factor, as well as what appears to be a new game in the&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart&nbsp;</em>series, but it didn't give away anything about the machine's specs or launch day lineup.</p>

<p>We do, however, already know that the Switch 2 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-successor-will-be-backwards-compatible" rel="nofollow">will be able to play</a> original Switch games, although Nintendo has said that the successor may not support every original Switch game at launch.</p>




<p>Nintendo has promised that it will reveal more about the Switch 2 during a Direct presentation in April. It's likely we'll learn more about the console's hardware specs then, and we'll probably get a release date too. Stay tuned.</p>
