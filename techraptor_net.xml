            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-outsold-expectations<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It would appear the stars have aligned, because Square Enix has admitted that one of its games outsold its expectations, a fairly rare occurrence for a studio that seems to want a lot from its releases.</p>

<p>In its Q3 financial results <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/pdf/25q3release.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">release</a>, Square Enix says that while its numbers are down for the nine-month period between April and December 2024 when compared to the same period last year, the quarter itself saw operating income increase, largely due to&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remaster</em>.</p>

<p>The company says the JRPG remake achieved "stronger sales" than it had "initially assumed", helping to offset newer releases achieving lower sales than tentpole games like&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI&nbsp;</em>and the&nbsp;<em>Pixel Remaster&nbsp;</em>series.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-sales-battle.jpg?itok=eUQg7jM2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-sales-battle.jpg?itok=m2DDXHdX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake&nbsp;</em>did better than Square Enix expected it to.</figcaption></figure><p>Although Square Enix says its latest games haven't done as well as&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>, it's worth remembering the company also said that game, along with&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-16-rebirth-profits-square-enix" rel="nofollow">didn't meet its expectations</a>.</p>

<p>Square Enix hasn't shared how many sales either of those games achieved (nor, indeed, has it shared specific figures for&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake</em>), but the company has something of a reputation for expecting its games to achieve what some might call unrealistic sales figures.</p>

<p>Naturally, the company's nine-month period between April and September also benefited from the launch of&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>expansion&nbsp;<em>Dawntrail</em>, although that launch didn't stop net sales and operating income from falling for that period. Instead, it likely just softened the blow.</p>




<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake&nbsp;</em>is, well, the clue's in the name; it's a remake of classic JRPG&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest 3&nbsp;</em>using Square Enix's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/trademark-for-octopath-travelers-hd-2d-filed-by-square-enix" rel="nofollow">trademarked</a> HD-2D style, which combines nostalgic pixel art with chunky 3D.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/undaunted-battle-of-britain-review-undaunted-takes-to-skies<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Undaunted</em> by Osprey Games, is a series heralded as perfectly blending a deck-building game with wargaming elements. The series of games first started in 2020 with <em>Undaunted Normandy</em>, and rather than start with a review of the original game, we're working backwards from the latest game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/undaunted-2200-callisto-old-mechanics-new-tricks" rel="nofollow"><em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto</em></a>. This time we're looking at <em>Undaunted Battle of Britain</em>, which takes the <em>Undaunted</em> rules to the sky, and as a previous member of His Majesties' Royal Air Force, one that I'm personally excited to get into.</p>

<p>Although we've only just started covering&nbsp;<em>Undaunted</em> on the site, we have previously covered several of Osprey Games' titles, including the brand new <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bolt-action-3rd-edition-review-snapping-into-action" rel="nofollow">Bolt Action 3rd Edition</a></em>, copublished with Warlord games, and also some of their awesome supplements for their miniatures agnostic system,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/frostgrave-wildwoods-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Frostgrave</em></a>.</p>

<p>In games of <em>Undaunted</em>, as was the case in&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/undaunted-2200-callisto-old-mechanics-new-tricks" rel="nofollow"><em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto</em></a>, players draw 4 cards from their deck each turn and then use those cards to play actions from the tokens they have on the board, such as moving and attacking. Certain cards also allow you to draw more cards from your supply, or move cards from your deck to your supply, allowing you to tailor your deck as you play. Rather than introducing new tokens as cards are added to your deck as the other <em>Undaunted</em> titles we've covered did, in <em>BoB, in&nbsp;</em>certain scenarios, aircraft start grounded and need to take off before they can take actions as normal.</p>

<p>This card system, as well as working for actions, also controls a unique damage system. As a unit takes hits, you must discard a matching card from your hand. If you don't have a matching card in your hand, you discard one from your discard pile, and if there isn't one there too, you discard it from your deck. If you can't find the card at all, the unit is eliminated. This can put real pressure on going first in the turn and focuses you on picking your targets. If a unit you have the card for in your hand is hit, then you discard the card and you might not be able to activate it this turn. It also adds a nice hidden element as you and your opponent try to determine how many cards units have left, and which is the optimum target to hit.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/undaunted-battle-of-britain-4.jpg?itok=z561iVD3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/undaunted-battle-of-britain-4.jpg?itok=b2w0F5IM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Undaunted Battle of Britain </em>captures dogfighting perfectly, with bonuses for getting your target in the weak rear arc, bombers have multiple arcs though, so you need to be carful.</figcaption></figure><h2>How Does The Ariel Combat Work In Undaunted Battle of Britain?</h2>

<p>The difference between <em>Undaunted Battle of Britain</em>, and the other <em>Undaunted</em> games, is that <em>BoB</em> is focused on aerial combat and the difficulties that entails. For example, in other games in the series, you don't have to move or worry about the facing of your unit when shooting. In <em>Undaunted Battle of Britain</em>, every time you activate a unit, it has to move, and its directional facing for shooting is shown on the unit's token.</p>

<p>This means that positioning is key over the other <em>Undaunted</em> games, and anyone who's played <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/star-wars-x-wing-minatures-game-2nd-edition-core-set-review-perfect-time-to-join" rel="nofollow"><em>Star Wars X-Wing</em></a>&nbsp;will feel right at home. If your fighter flies past your enemy, it's not an easy matter of turning to attack them next turn, aircraft have to wheel around, taking them out of position and circling to face their target again, which can take a couple of turns. This captures the thematic feel of WWII dogfights perfectly, as fighters would zip past each other and then maneuver to get the upper hand.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/undaunted-battle-of-britain-6.jpg?itok=3PasnwVG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/undaunted-battle-of-britain-6.jpg?itok=_exyIRUj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Undaunted Battle of Britain </em>replaces the fog of war with discord cards, which fill up your deck if you play a comms card when you're more than a space away from the rest of the squadron.</figcaption></figure><p>Another change from other <em>Undaunted</em> games is that the fog of war has gone. This was a mechanic that as you scouted ahead on the map, you added fog of war cards to your deck (interference in <em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto</em>). In <em>Battle of Britain</em>, you need to keep your matched units grouped close together when you play communications cards, otherwise you get a discord card added to your deck. Keeping your aircraft together can be challenging, so this mechanic is a great reflection of the radio communications at the time, and the challenges of radio communications in general, and is a great thematic inclusion.</p>

<p><em>Undaunted Battle of Britain&nbsp;</em>features the 2 historical forces that were part of the campaign during WWII, the German Luftwaffe and the United Kingdom's Royal Air Force (RAF). The reality of the war was that the Luftwaffe was coming off the back of a string of victories over most of Northern Europe. Their pilots were experienced and their aircraft were technologically advanced. The RAF was struggling to match production to get aircraft into the sky.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To capture this in the game, without making the units vastly different, across the developing scenarios that introduce new units and rules as you progress, the German forces generally have goals to achieve, while the RAF just need to take out Luftwaffe aircraft. It creates a great blend of feeling the pressure, but not making the scenarios too uneven for either side.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/undaunted-battle-of-britain-3.jpg?itok=lLWqkUDg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/undaunted-battle-of-britain-3.jpg?itok=L1-TvSS1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>As the scenarios progress in&nbsp;<em>Undaunted Battle of Britain, </em>further challanges are added.</figcaption></figure><h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On Undaunted Battle of Britain?</h2>

<p><i>Undaunted Battle of Britain&nbsp;</i>is a fantastic take on the <em>Undaunted</em> mechanics, perfectly blending the great core mechanics with the aerial combat theme. The scenarios are a blast to play through, and both forces feel realistically thematic. The way movement is handled perfectly captures dog-fighting and the change from fog-of-war to discord adds a realistic element to the battles. If I had to pick a criticism, it would be that the aircraft tokens are quite small, which would be fine for a huge map with hundreds of aircraft, but here I would have liked bigger tiles and tokens, but that would also have increased the size of the compact box that stores well.</p>

<h2>Should I Buy Undaunted Battle of Britain?</h2>

<p>If you like the <em>Undaunted</em> mechanics and want a new challenge, then <em>Undaunted Battle of Britain</em> offers that, or if you never played <em>Undaunted</em>, but want a great aerial combat game, then <em>U:BoB</em> is fantastic. If you don't like the sound of maneuvering to line up a target for shooting, then consider checking out one of the other <em>Undaunted</em> Games, either <em>Normandy</em> or <em>North Africa</em> for standard troop battles, <em>Stalingrad</em> for campaign play, or <em>2200 Callisto</em> for a futuristic battle with a deeper terrain system.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gta-6-still-on-track-for-fall<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Take-Two has recommitted to a fall 2025 release window for upcoming tentpole title&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, thus (at least temporarily) putting paid to rumors that the game might be delayed.</p>

<p>Commenting on the studio's third-quarter financial results, CEO Strauss Zelnick says the 2025 calendar year is shaping up to be one of his company's strongest, pointing to&nbsp;<em>GTA 6</em>'s release "in the fall", as well as&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mafia-old-country-no-italian-audio" rel="nofollow"><em>Mafia: The Old Country</em></a>'s launch in summer and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/borderlands-4-toilet-humor-narrative-director" rel="nofollow"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a>'s arrival sometime this year.</p>

<p>Zelnick also highlights the launch of&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7</em>, which is set to arrive on February 11th, although some players have already gotten their hands on the game in early access (and have made their thoughts on it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-early-access-mixed-reviews-50k-players" rel="nofollow">abundantly clear</a>).</p>

<p>Not only that, but basketball game <i>NBA 2K25&nbsp;</i>apparently outperformed Take-Two's expectations, racking up seven million sales in the third quarter and seeing an increase in player engagement as well.</p>

<p>In a followup <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-twos-strauss-zelnick-on-tariffs-ai-and-gta-6" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">interview</a> with GamesIndustry.biz, Zelnick shares some of his thoughts about Take-Two's current situation in the industry, as well as wider trends like AI and Donald Trump's recently-introduced tariffs.</p>

<p>Zelnick says he thinks "a world without tariffs is a better place", highlighting the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/esa-trump-tariffs-comments" rel="nofollow">ESA's opposition to the tariffs</a> and expressing a "cautiously optimistic" outlook regarding the recent postponement of tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports.</p>

On the one hand, he calls artificial intelligence "an oxymoron" and says "machines don't learn", but he also says AI can "help make our business more efficient and help us do better work" (although he's confident it won't lead to unemployment).</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-25-canceled</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/football-manager-25-canceled-sega-to-focus-on-football-manager-26.1103193/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-25-canceled<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega and Sports Interactive have announced that&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>has been canceled, and that development efforts will now focus on the next game in the series.</p>

<p>In a development <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/news/development-update-football-manager-25-1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">update</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Football Manager&nbsp;</em>website, Sports Interactive said that while development on&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>was progressing apace, the studio realized it wouldn't be able to reach the standard it wanted to in time for the game's already-delayed&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-25-delayed-2025" rel="nofollow">March release date</a>.</p>

<p>Delays to games aren't uncommon, but&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25</em>, like many yearly sports titles, is a special case; delaying the game beyond March would mean the game would launch "too late in the football season to expect players to then buy another game later in the year", as Sports Interactive says.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/football-manager-25-canceled-menu.jpg?itok=SOmCykVa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/football-manager-25-canceled-menu.jpg?itok=fy5GCFKQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ignore the "Work In Progress" label on this menu, because, well, it isn't.</figcaption></figure><p>Sports Interactive says that despite the "phenomenal efforts" of its development team, various areas of&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25</em>, like its "overarching player experience and interface", aren't where the studio wants them to be for how far along in development the game is.</p>

<p>As such, the decision was made to cancel&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>and to focus on what will presumably be called&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 26&nbsp;</em>instead. Assuming it's not subject to delays, that game will likely be released towards the end of the year.</p>

<p><em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>was originally due for release <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-25-release-date" rel="nofollow">in November last year</a>, but it was subsequently delayed to March to give the development team additional time to work on the game. It now seems as though even that extra time wasn't quite enough.</p>

<p>The game was due to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-25-dev-update" rel="nofollow">drop a number of features</a> from previous&nbsp;<em>Football Manager&nbsp;</em>games, including the Create-a-Club system, Touchline Shouts, and more.</p>




<p>It's likely the work Sega and Sports Interactive did on&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>will carry over to&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 26</em>, so don't expect those features to suddenly make a reappearance in the series' next major iteration.</p>

<p>This cancellation also hasn't changed Sega's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-24-data-update-2024-25" rel="nofollow">stance on a data update</a> for&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 24&nbsp;</em>to implement more up-to-date club and player information; Sports Interactive says this would still be a "substantial undertaking" that would "divert critical resources away from the development of the next release".</p>

It must be noted that I've been playing both the <em>L5R</em> card game and roleplaying game since 1995. I've played through all versions (reviewing the latest versions of both here on TechRaptor), and I've read all the published <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/swords-and-spirits-preview-legend-of-five-rings-fiction" rel="nofollow">tie-in fiction</a>, as well as being a huge samurai and ninja nerd (and Japan in general). So I was going to be a tough audience for this.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-4.jpg?itok=eG9ZykLS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-4.jpg?itok=sYOshyZb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Our demo brief for the first 2 levels of&nbsp;<em>Shadowveil: Legend of the Five Rings</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>As with all my tabletop reviews, I judge theme pretty harshly. If you're going to throw a setting in your title, you better live up to it, rather than it being a paper-thin layer on top. So I was always going to judge it on theme before how good it actually was. If it lived up to the setting, I could forgive poor gameplay, but never the other way around. I got to test <em>Shadowveil</em> with a preview code, so not all elements of the game were available, and some things may change by the time the game releases fully on Mar 04.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-7.jpg?itok=kyroIged 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-7.jpg?itok=WN-VyIAa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Kuni Yori is abolsultey as sketchy as he looks.</figcaption></figure><p>My concerns about theme were immediately alleviated, as soon as the first dialogue box opened. The <em>L5R</em> setting features several clans, all vying for power with different strengths and goals. The Crab clan, who are the focus of <em>Shadowveil</em>, guard the rest of the empire against the Shadowlands, a corrupted realm filled with demons, evil spirits, goblins, and other creatures, are unique in their outlook in that they don't care for honor or social politics. Victory is simply everything, and the methods are immaterial.</p>

<p>This stoic realism was captured immediately, and also told me that I wouldn't need to worry about how <em>Shadowveil</em> would deal with the social politics of the different clans, this was going to be war, the part of the empire that didn't care for etiquette or courtly virtues. But that element wasn't written out, as it could easily have been. It's obvious that not all is as it seems as the lead pair of characters, a brother and sister pair of Crab clan samurai reach a walled outpost in need of repair, and some internal politics are obvious from the off.</p>

Our build saw us taking O-Ushi, and leading our warriors to war. The first few dialogue boxes take you through the setting introduction, not drawing it out, but giving those new to it enough to go on, and then you're off on your first outing, beyond the wall, and into the shadowlands.</p>

You can select cards for abilities and items for your fighters and choose their placement in combat, but the battles happen automatically, with your fighters attacking as per their class. You start off with your main character and 2 basic samurai, but you can unlock other classes like the scout and witch hunter on subsequent runs, along with upgrading your basic samurai into formidable fighters themselves.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-10.jpg?itok=Hq4XR-FD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-10.jpg?itok=L8wGsjQG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The roguelike journey begins with the first step.</figcaption></figure><p>During the run you collect cards, which unlock abilities. These are either generic or class-locked, and duplicate copies can be combined into a more powerful version. You can also collect items and other resources to unlock further elements as you progress. Some only benefit you during that run, like jade, which is used when you rest to heal and gain temporary boosts, others you take back with you, unlocking character classes and items. Side quests are also available, with some key unlocks early in the game's story. throughout it all, your characters gain experience, which levels them up for subsequent run attempts, and later levels.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-3.jpg?itok=cpbK406d 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-3.jpg?itok=XqwmJf2j 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>In a true RPG feel, everything here is your choice of upgrade.</figcaption></figure><p>The leveling-up screen gives you a whole host of options, from core stats, specific masteries and traits, unlocking more item and ability slots for cards you collect on the way, and also upgrading the core ability itself. When you upgrade stats, you get several stat package options that allow you to focus the character the way you want. The upgrade package was a lot more detailed than I thought, and really gave me a roleplaying feel that captures the the <em>L5R</em> RPG.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-16.jpg?itok=xIh6G1Ea 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-16.jpg?itok=7LEPwxrd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Enemy numbers mean nothing when you've invested everything in a run on a single berserker.</figcaption></figure><p>The&nbsp;roguelike runs are handled very well, with branching level selects with the side quests highlighted further down the route. Each failed attempt isn't death, but a withdrawal to recuperate and rearm, before heading out again, with some friendly banter from your sibling after your failed run. It took me 4 runs on my first go to finish to defeat the first boss, and I'd unlocked 2 other classes, taking 5 fighters total to battle in the last mission. I focused on gaining command points, which lets you deploy extra fighters, rather than upgrading abilities, but it looks like either option is viable, either taking a small force of starting-level abilities or a couple of super-samurai.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The second level was a lot harder, and I hit several walls early on and had to upgrade a couple of times to even make it halfway. Tactical resting became key, and positioning choices at the start of each battle really started to matter.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-14.jpg?itok=QybwHeAH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-14.jpg?itok=PEfHKgn3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Rest Timing and option selection is as key as to everything else you chose in completing a run.</figcaption></figure><h2>Shadowveil: Legend of the Five Rings Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Thematically, <em>Shadowveil</em> nails it. It captures the setting very well, even with the limited single-clan view, which allows them to focus the gameplay on the combat side of <em>L5R</em> without feeling like it's missing the social side. Yet it still captures the politics, even the internal politics of the very unpolitical Crab clan. The RPG elements had surprising depth, and the blend of permanent development you can control, to the random party development in the runs works very well. As a tabletop gamer of all genres, I love turn-based strategy, but honestly, the auto-battler is doing pretty much what I would be doing only faster, which lets you focus on the overall strategy of the run.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>L5R</em> fans would obviously love to see all of the clans represented, across the full setting with all facets of what we love about the CCG and RPG, but the depth of that game would be huge, and probably not for the mainstream market. What <em>Shadowveil</em> does is capture what's important for <em>L5R</em>, in a perfect mix of theme and gameplay, that while might not be for everyone, looks and plays great and may introduce more players to a deep and incredible setting that tabletop gamers already love.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-ui-problems-fixes-coming<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>developer Firaxis has promised it will implement fixes for some of the most common criticisms being aimed at the game, including its UI, missing gameplay features, and more.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/en-GB/civ-vii/news/message-from-firaxis-games/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Civilization&nbsp;</em>website, the studio says it's been "poring over" player feedback, including Steam reviews the game has received during the first couple of days of its early access (as opposed to Early Access) period.</p>

<p>As a reminder,&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-early-access-mixed-reviews-50k-players" rel="nofollow">picked up a lot of negative reviews</a> from players on Steam since it launched in advanced access yesterday. Players have criticized the game's user interface, as well as what they perceive to be a paucity of features compared to&nbsp;<em>Civilization 6</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/civilization-7-ui-fix-firaxis-tanks.jpg?itok=cGM0YO8k 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/civilization-7-ui-fix-firaxis-tanks.jpg?itok=qBCp5QLz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Firaxis says fixes are coming for some of&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7</em>'s issues.</figcaption></figure><p>Firaxis goes on to say that it's identified three core areas in which&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>needs improvement, and yes, the game's UI is one of them.</p>

<p>The studio says the UI is its "top priority", and that fixes will include making the interface "more intuitive", improving readability, and improving polish, among other things. More information will be shared "as soon as [the studio] can".</p>

<p>According to the post, Firaxis' next major area of improvement is implementing community-requested features into&nbsp;<em>Civ 7</em>, including adding teams to multiplayer games, increasing map variety, and enabling the customization of city and religion names. These things will, of course, be included in upcoming patches for free.</p>

<p>The third major area of improvement for&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>focuses on quality-of-life improvements, with the first of such features rolling out as part of Patch 1.1.0 in March. That's where you'll find improvements and tweaks to the game's AI, as well as UI adjustments and more.</p>




<p>Firaxis says it will share a development roadmap for&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>as soon as it's able, but for now, it wants you to know that fixes are coming for some of the problems you might have been having with the game.</p>

<p><em>Civilization 7</em>'s full launch is scheduled for February 11th, but you can play it now if you picked up the Deluxe or Founders Editions of the game. It's available for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1295660/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_VII/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/sid-meier-s-civilization-vii/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-for-xbox-series-xs/9N23HJHSC6BL" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>
