  </picture><p>Referred to as the "original Mexican bingo," <em>Loteria</em> is rooted in generations of Mexican and Latin American heritage. The game holds a meaningful place in the lives of millions of families through shared symbols, traditions, and cultural storytelling. Now, with <em>Loteria Bilingual Edition</em>, Asmodee USA aims to bring this experience to English-speaking audiences in the United States, expanding its audience and reach.</p><blockquote><p>“Lotería is a bridge between generations and a cultural touchstone that has created memories for families for decades,” states Julien Sharp, Country Manager, asmodee USA. &nbsp;“We are proud to partner with Dreamstar Farms to support the continued growth and accessibility of this important title. This collaboration reflects our commitment to championing games that celebrate culture, community, and the universal joy of play.”</p><p><br>“Lotería is more than a game. It is a vibrant world of symbols, stories, and tradition, a living piece of cultural heritage shared across generations. Through our partnership with asmodee to bring and distribute Lotería to families across the U.S., we are excited for players to pull their first card, read the new rhymes in English or Spanish, and experience the richness of this beloved tradition together,” states Geoffrey Gray, Co-Founder of Dreamstar, a game studio based in Mexico City.</p></blockquote><p><em>Loterial Bilingual Edition</em> is available today on Amazon, Asmodee's web store, and specialty retailers. The game is being sold at an MSRP of $14.99. Retail releases at Target, Barnes &amp; Noble, and Walmart are planned for Spring 2026.</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Legendary industry veteran and <em>Fallout </em>creator Tim Cain has announced that he's made a return to Obsidian Entertainment, and it's the real deal; he's no contractor, but rather a "full-time employee".</p><p>In a video posted on his YouTube channel today, Cain explained that he's returned to the <em>Fallout: New Vegas </em>and <em>Grounded </em>studio "in person" rather than remotely, and that this means he's no longer "working in other places", although there's at least one project on which Cain worked apart from Obsidian that has yet to be released.</p><p>Cain says that the period between 2020 and 2025 was "a weird time in the industry", and as such, there are games on which he's worked that he isn't sure will see the light of day, too. How tantalizing!</p><figure role="group">

<p>Unfortunately, Cain also says he can't elaborate on the project on which he's currently working at Obsidian, but that "you're not gonna guess right" if you try to guess what it is, so it sounds like a novel idea, whatever it might be.</p><p>He also says he's "a lot less retired now than [he] was before", so his previous state of "semi-retirement" is no longer applicable. Additionally, Cain's YouTube channel will remain operational, since "no-one at Obsidian has even remotely suggested that [he has] to stop it".</p><p>Tim Cain first joined Obsidian in 2011, going on to work on the studio's successfully Kickstarted RPG <em>Pillars of Eternity</em>, as well as serving as one of the directors for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/outer-worlds" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="cd8a1852-2307-4184-b0df-b9afab69154e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">2019's <em>The Outer Worlds</em></a>. He also worked as a creative consultant on <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/outer-worlds-2" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f7b9881c-df25-4849-881d-eafe092b40f7" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">this year's <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em></a>, albeit not as a full-time employee.</p><p>You can check out Cain's full video, in which he also discusses other recent events in his life, right here.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen exactly what Tim Cain will do with Obsidian now he's back with the company; let's hope that Microsoft sees sense and opts to give the studio another chance at a <em>Fallout </em>game. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
