<figcaption><em>Bloodlines 2 </em>was a big letdown for Paradox last year.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Revenues for the quarter technically increased, driven largely by Paradox's strategy-focused back catalog (as well as the newly-released <em>Europa Universalis V</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paradox-europa-universalis-v-project-caesar-maybe" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="94d6591e-5da9-4df4-85db-66063c38e046" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">first teased in May last year</a>), but sales for the year as a whole remained static when compared to last year.</p><p>Paradox CEO Fredrik Wester admits that <em>Bloodlines 2 </em>"did not meet [the company's] commercial expectations", but he says his studio is now reassessing its resource allocation to ensure it focuses on the right projects in future.</p><p><em>Bloodlines 2 </em>was released in October following a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-indefinitely" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="14f47468-9696-4619-adfe-4a904a94f05a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">very lengthy</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-back-developed-by-chinese-room" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="424a86e4-db05-4ea2-9339-418c1fb748b3" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">troubled development cycle</a>. The game was met with criticism for its perceived lack of similarities to Troika's original <em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines</em>, as well as shallow gameplay and a lack of meaningful RPG elements.</p><p>The game's poor reception led Dan Pinchbeck, co-founder of developer The Chinese Room, to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloodlines-2-name-chinese-room" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ec744b99-1543-4387-b78c-dd265b6df66b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">suggest that the project's name was ill-fitting</a>, and that he and another former <em>Bloodlines 2 </em>producer attempted to convince execs "to not call it <em>Bloodlines 2</em>". Evidently, those efforts fell on deaf ears.</p>

<p>As well as a release date reveal, the Direct show also contained lots of other information about the upcoming <em>Tomodachi Life </em>sequel.</p><p>Let's get one thing out of the way now: yes, it's possible to date characters with the same sex or gender as your Mii, and you can also specify a romantic preference for nonbinary characters if you want to.</p><p>This course correction on Nintendo's behalf is part of an attempt to make <em>Living the Dream </em>a more inclusive experience, after criticism of the original <em>Tomodachi Life</em>'s <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/video-games/nintendo-apologizes-omitting-gay-marriage-tomodachi-life-n101861" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">omission</a> of gay romance.</p><p>Much like in <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em>, your island in <em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream </em>can be customized extensively, giving your Miis the opportunity to discover the village you've built for them and to create a life for themselves within.</p>
<p>If you don't have enough Miis to populate your island, don't worry; <em>Living the Dream </em>will let you create some from within the game itself as well as importing the ones that are already on your Switch.</p><p>Much like the original <em>Tomodachi Life</em>, the fun in this followup revolves around watching your Miis interact with one another and steering those interactions; it's essentially <em>The Sims</em>, but with Miis (and a heck of a lot more weirdness).</p><p><em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream </em>launches for <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Tomodachi-Life-Living-the-Dream-2786386.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch</a> on April 16th.
