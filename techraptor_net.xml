            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Recently, <em>Highguard</em>'s official website went down, prompting speculation that the ill-fated first-person shooter could be about to fire its last bullet. Thankfully (depending on your perspective), a developer has now confirmed that isn't the case.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/highguard-dev-responds-as-players-fear-shutdown-after-website-outage-3321092/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dexerto</a>, a Wildlight staffer told the game's official Discord server that the website "basically needs to be transferred and simplified", and that this task is "low priority at the moment", with the developers focusing instead on "delivering updates and content to improve".</p><p>The developer also says the "reputational damage" is "already done", although it's not entirely clear whether they're referring to the website going down or to <em>Highguard </em>as a whole. Honestly, there's a compelling case to be made for both interpretations.</p><figure role="group">

</figure>
<p><em>Highguard </em>may not be shutting down, but it's not much of a surprise that that's the conclusion many jumped to when its website went offline. To put it simply, the game has been having a rough time since it launched at the end of January.</p><p>Following a rather underwhelming reveal at the conclusion of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-game-awards-2025-recap" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7f71e644-2289-45c0-a1c9-dc56c3797e8a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">December's Game Awards</a>, <em>Highguard </em>was released on January 26th, and though its player count surged on release, feedback was mixed, with many pointing to poor performance and fundamental gameplay issues as major problems.</p><p>After its release, <em>Highguard</em>'s player count plummeted, and last week, developer Wildlight <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/highguard-developer-wildlight-reportedly-lays-off-most-staff" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="662d78d2-0c4f-4bac-903f-7998daba8b76" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">laid off a number of staffers</a>, leaving a core group of developers to continue to work on the game.</p><p><em>Highguard</em>'s launch has prompted many to compare the shooter to Sony's flop <em>Concord</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ed1fd329-b76e-4ff9-aeb1-683a1c840a0c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">shut down just weeks after its release</a> back in 2024. If <em>Highguard </em>does end up biting the bullet, so to speak, it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazons-ill-fated-mmo-new-world-to-shut-down-next-year" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fa9fca01-ebe1-4d7d-9d03-0b8eab5c442a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">won't be the first live-service game</a> to do so this year, either.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Mewgenics</em>, the new tactical roguelite from <em>Super Meat Boy </em>creator Edmund McMillen, has passed another huge sales milestone, and it only took the game a week to achieve the new figure.</p><p>As revealed by McMillen's fellow designer <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:eerlwrwx25lfeot7dcruvqrv/post/3mf3aeadpfc2z" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tyler Glaiel on Bluesky</a>, <em>Mewgenics </em>sales have hit one million since the game was released last week. That's a pretty impressive milestone when you consider that the game is currently only available on Steam.</p><p>Not only that, but <em>Mewgenics </em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mewgenics-sales-250k-dev-budget-recouped" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5c4f3ffc-15d4-4bbb-a38c-88c9e5c88c13" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">sold 250,000 copies in its first 12 hours</a>, so that means that over the last six or seven days, the game has accrued another 750,000 sales for itself. I'm sure McMillen and Glaiel will be bowled over by <em>Mewgenics</em>' success.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Mewgenics </em>sales have officially reached one million.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><em>Mewgenics</em>' success is perhaps even more impressive when considering that the game is a turn-based tactics title, and while that type of game definitely has its niche, it's fairly rare for tactical RPGs to achieve crossover success like this.</p><p>If you're wondering exactly what <em>Mewgenics </em>is, it's a mixture of tactical turn-based RPG and roguelite that involves breeding cats, then sending them out on dangerous missions to do battle with McMillen's signature grotesqueries.</p><p>The game offers more than a thousand unique abilities for you to discover, as well as a number of class "collars" that allow you to create teams of cats in order to take advantage of their ability synergies.</p><p>Not only that, but you can also look forward to over 900 items to collect, as well as "countless environmental interactions", ensuring that every run "throws fresh tactical puzzles at you".</p>
