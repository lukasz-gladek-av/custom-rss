            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/talsorian-games-announces-cyberpunk-legends-rpg-lite-card-game-set-in-night-city<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Talsorian Games has announced a new card game in the world of <em>Cyberpunk</em>. <em>Cyberpunk Legends</em> is an official coop card game where you and your friends can tell your own stories in the dark future urban hellscape that is Night City.</p>

<h2>The <em>Cyberpunk Legends</em> Announcement</h2>

<p>According to the <a href="https://presale.nightcrewgames.com/" rel="nofollow">official page</a>, <em>Cyberpunk Legends</em> is an RPG-lite, narrative-focused co-op card game set in the world of the <em>Cyberpunk</em> TTRPG. Specifically, it is set in the 2020s, the time when Night City legends like Johnny Silverhand and Alt Cunningham walked the streets.</p>

Each of these classes comes with their own class deck alongside a character avatar card and Health, Damage, and Leader tokens.</p>

<p>From there, your group undertakes different missions in a campaign drawn from one of three different scenario decks. These missions involve unraveling complex mysteries, coordinating strategic combat against daunting foes, and making narrative choices with consequences. Every character class will have its moment to shine between talking, hacking, puzzling, and fighting.</p>

<p>The biggest draw for <em>Cyberpunk Legends</em> is that it offers a TTRPG experience with little prep, rules or DM. The rules are simple, requiring just five minutes to learn. In addition, all of your actions are resolved with cards; no dice required. Ever wanted the thrill of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/cyberpunk-red-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Cyberpunk Red</em></a> but can't get a group together? Have you run out of stuff to see and do in <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/cyberpunk-2077" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></a>? This narrative card game is for you.</p>

The game will be available via a Kickstarter campaign and will be sold at an MSRP of $50. It is unclear at the time of writing if the crowdfunding campaign will include additional expansions or stretch goals.</p>
