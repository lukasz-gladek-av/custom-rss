            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>developer FuturLab has revealed the upcoming cleaning sim's release date, and it's much closer than you might think, so it won't be long before you can load up your power washer once again.</p>

<p>As announced via a brand new trailer,&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>will be launching on October 23rd. As far as we know, the game is due to launch on day one for Game Pass as well, although given <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-tiers-reworked-2025" rel="nofollow">recent developments</a>, that might not be quite such an enticing prospect anymore.</p>

<p>Announced back in March this year,&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>is, as the name suggests, the sequel to 2022's relaxing cleaning sim&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator</em>. Like its predecessor, this followup will let you loose on a variety of filthy environments, and it's up to you to make them clean once more.</p>

<p>Those locations will be part of a brand new campaign that will take you to such aptly-named locations as Sponge Valley, Power Falls, and Lubri City. I wouldn't think too hard about that last one if I were you.</p>

<p>New multi-stage jobs will test your cleaning prowess over several different stages, and naturally, you can expect a range of new tools to help you tackle those jobs, including a new abseiling rig, a cherry picker, and a surface cleaner for bigger areas.</p>

<p>You can check out the new&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>release date trailer, which shows off some of the game's satisfying-looking cleaning action (as well as its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-powerwash-simulator-2-gameplay-trailer" rel="nofollow">frankly criminally adorable cat</a>), right here.</p>




<p><em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2968420/PowerWash_Simulator_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10011314" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/powerwash-simulator-2/9p45ggdtfnsm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and Nintendo Switch 2 on October 23rd.

            <title><![CDATA[Aloft Bloom & Blight Update Set to Bring Big Improvements in November]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Funcom and developer Astrolabe Interactive have announced the Bloom &amp; Blight update for cozy survival adventure&nbsp;<i>Aloft</i>, and it's set to bring big improvements to the game next month.</p>

<p>As revealed in a press release,&nbsp;<em>Aloft</em>'s Bloom &amp; Blight update will arrive on November 4th, and the two studios are talking a big game for the update; it's apparently set to improve "almost every facet" of the game.</p>

<p>According to Funcom and Astrolabe, Bloom &amp; Blight will "revamp and improve almost every aspect of [<em>Aloft</em>], including world generation, tech tree progression, exploration and travel, ecosystem restoration, and combat", so this is a pretty ambitious undertaking.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aloft-bloom-blight-update-cliff.jpg?itok=kwigv55z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aloft-bloom-blight-update-cliff.jpg?itok=_Jing2EI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Aloft&nbsp;</em>is getting a very big update indeed soon.</figcaption></figure><p>Many of the changes coming as part of&nbsp;<em>Aloft</em>'s Bloom &amp; Blight update were outlined in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1660080/view/517473930105061675" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">developer blog</a> back in late September, and it does indeed look like the developers are pulling out all of the stops with this one.</p>

<p>Progression will be overhauled to be less confusing and directionless, and ecosystem restoration will be redesigned so that it feels more "engaging" and less "likely simply ticking items off a checklist".</p>

<p>It's not just content within the game that will be getting changes, however;&nbsp;<em>Aloft</em>'s developers are also working on the technical side of things, with the save data system getting a complete overhaul to "achieve long-term stability".</p>

<p>Suffice it to say that if you haven't played&nbsp;<em>Aloft </em>since its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/aloft-early-access-release-date" rel="nofollow">January Early Access release</a>, or even if you're new to the game, you should hopefully find a significantly improved and expanded version of the survival adventure after Bloom &amp; Blight lands.</p>




<p>News of&nbsp;<em>Aloft</em>'s latest major update comes just a couple of days after publisher Funcom <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-funcom-layoffs" rel="nofollow">embarked on a spate of layoffs</a>, with&nbsp;<em>Metal: Hellsinger&nbsp;</em>developer The Outsiders <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-hellsinger-the-outsiders-shut-down-funcom" rel="nofollow">closing down</a> as a result of these staff cuts.</p>

<p>That's despite the fact that sci-fi survival sim<i>&nbsp;Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</i>proved to be the company's most successful release yet, racking up <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-sales-1m-infographic" rel="nofollow">a million sales within just two weeks of its launch</a> back in June this year.</p>

<p>In any case, you can check out&nbsp;<em>Aloft&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1660080/Aloft/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>, and you can remind yourself what our very own Isaac thought of the game by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/aloft-preview" rel="nofollow">reading his preview from January</a>.</p>
