            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sea-of-stars-throes-of-watchmaker-dlc-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Sabotage Studio has announced the release date for the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Sea of Stars&nbsp;</em>DLC&nbsp;<em>Throes of the Watchmaker</em>, which, as a reminder, is completely free for everyone who plays the game.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://x.com/seaofstarsgame/status/1917581893056303123" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, the DLC, which was revealed in January this year, will be launching across all platforms on May 20th, bringing with it around eight hours of new stuff to enjoy after the ending of&nbsp;<em>Sea of Stars</em>' main storyline.</p>

<p>Sabotage says&nbsp;<em>Throes of the Watchmaker&nbsp;</em>will be based around "a self-contained progression loop" that will offer new classes, skills, and combos for both Zale and Valere to use.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sea-of-stars-throes-of-the-watchmaker-dlc-release-date-characters.jpg?itok=2Y-75KpT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sea-of-stars-throes-of-the-watchmaker-dlc-release-date-characters.jpg?itok=gA1c1FQo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Sea of Stars</em>'&nbsp;<em>Throes of the Watchmaker&nbsp;</em>DLC will be coming in May.</figcaption></figure><p>You'll also discover "never-before-seen areas, puzzles and enemies" across a "compelling storyline wholly unique from <em>Sea of Stars</em>’ core adventure", so you won't need to remember how the ending of the original game went.</p>

<p><em>Throes of the Watchmaker&nbsp;</em>will boast a new soundtrack composed by&nbsp;<em>Sea of Stars</em>' Eric W. Brown, and it'll also see&nbsp;<em>Chrono Trigger&nbsp;</em>composer Yasunori Mitsuda return "as a guest composer".</p>

<p>In story terms, you'll be exploring the clockwork world of Horloge, a land created by the titular Watchmaker (who's also the originator of the in-game Wheels minigame in&nbsp;<em>Sea of Stars</em>' lore). Zael and Valere must adapt to Horloge's unusual rules if they're to put a stop to the "cursed carnival" that is terrorizing the land.</p>

<p>In keeping with the carnival theme, Zael and Valere will also be ditching their signature weapons; Zael will put down his sword and take up juggling, while Valere will drop her staff for a new acrobatic combat style.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Sea of Stars</em>, it's a turn-based RPG inspired by JRPG classics like&nbsp;<em>Chrono Trigger</em>. Released in 2023, the game sees Eclipse magicians Zael and Valere setting out on an epic journey to stop an evil figure known as the Fleshmancer.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Respawn Layoffs Part of Wider EA Staff Cuts, Titanfall Project Reportedly Axed]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/respawn-layoffs-ea-cuts-titanfall-game</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/respawn-layoffs-part-of-wider-ea-staff-cuts-titanfall-project-reportedly-axed.1177566/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/respawn-layoffs-ea-cuts-titanfall-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yesterday,&nbsp;<em>Titanfall&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Jedi&nbsp;</em>developer Respawn Entertainment revealed that it would lay off a number of employees and cancel two "early-stage incubation" projects. Now, it's emerged that these layoffs were part of a wider EA staff cut wave.</p>

<p>Respawn's layoffs were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/respawn-layoffs-project-cancellations" rel="nofollow">announced yesterday</a>, but the studio didn't announce the numbers. Now, though, a Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-29/electronic-arts-lays-off-hundreds-cancels-titanfall-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a> is claiming that the Respawn layoffs ran to around 100 employees, and that they were part of a wider layoff wave that saw "between 300 and 400" EA employees lose their jobs.</p>

<p>An EA spokesperson told Bloomberg that the cuts were part of "select changes within our organization that more effectively aligns teams and allocates resources in service of driving future growth".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/titanfall-2-respawn-ea-layoffs.jpg?itok=cpZL4FSi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/titanfall-2-respawn-ea-layoffs.jpg?itok=8Cf6FUr7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>One of Respawn's canceled projects was apparently a&nbsp;<em>Titanfall&nbsp;</em>game.</figcaption></figure><p>Bloomberg goes on to say that one of Respawn's canceled projects, codenamed R7, was "an extraction shooter set in the <em>Titanfall</em> universe". The report also claims that said project wasn't anywhere near being released.</p>

<p>As Bloomberg points out, reports of EA and Respawn's layoffs come after what has been a relatively tough year for the publisher in terms of revenue. Back in January, EA admitted that big-name releases&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC 25&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-ea-sports-fc-25-underperformed" rel="nofollow">had underperformed</a>, contributing to a "mid-single-digit decline" for the studio.</p>

<p>It's also a difficult time for the industry as a whole, with studios like&nbsp;<em>Veilguard&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioware-layoffs-veilguard-failure" rel="nofollow">BioWare</a>,&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&nbsp;</em>outfit <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rocksteady-layoffs-end-of-2024" rel="nofollow">Rocksteady</a>, and even tech titan <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-layoffs-january-2025" rel="nofollow">Microsoft</a>&nbsp;letting staff go in recent months.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that some of the staff laid off from Respawn were working on the&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Jedi&nbsp;</em>series, work on the next installment of the series apparently continues apace, although we don't know too much about the game yet.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-jedi-respawn-ea-layoffs.jpg?itok=rKdyIXTc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-jedi-respawn-ea-layoffs.jpg?itok=CVTpWWW1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The next&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Jedi&nbsp;</em>game is still in development.</figcaption></figure><p>Newly-announced turn-based tactics game&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: Zero Company</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-zero-company-respawn-bit-reactor" rel="nofollow">revealed earlier this month</a>, also doesn't appear to have been affected by the layoffs.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what Respawn has in store for us next (beyond&nbsp;<em>Zero Company&nbsp;</em>and the new&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Jedi&nbsp;</em>game, of course). Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[China Hero Project Game Lost Soul Aside Delayed to August]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-soul-aside-delayed-august</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/china-hero-project-game-lost-soul-aside-delayed-to-august.1177467/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-soul-aside-delayed-august<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Ultizero Games and publisher PlayStation have announced that China Hero Project game&nbsp;<em>Lost Soul Aside&nbsp;</em>has been delayed until summer.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Lost_Soul_Aside/status/1917433911195353572" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Ultizero says that in order to deliver "a high-quality game experience", the game, which was originally due to be released on May 30th, will now be launching on PC and PS5 on August 29th. That, incidentally, means the game has moved from the&nbsp;release date of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nighreign-release-date" rel="nofollow">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>&nbsp;</em>to just one day before&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-release-date-leak-playstation" rel="nofollow"><em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em></a>.</p>

<p>Ultizero goes on to say that in order to meet the "standards" it's set for itself when it comes to&nbsp;<em>Lost Soul Aside</em>, it needs "some additional time to polish the game".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lost-soul-aside-delayed-boss.jpg?itok=bI-Hy5cG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lost-soul-aside-delayed-boss.jpg?itok=hoe2jY-o 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Lost Soul Aside&nbsp;</em>is going to take a little more time to launch.</figcaption></figure><p>The game, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/impressive-one-man-project-lost-soul-aside-will-be-timed-exclusive-for-ps4" rel="nofollow">at least began life</a> as a one-man development project, was originally intended for PS4. It's been in development for some time, but in December last year, it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-soul-aside-release-window-2025" rel="nofollow">finally given a 2025 release window</a>, before a release date of May 30th was subsequently revealed (although it won't be making that date now, it seems).</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Lost Soul Aside</em>, it's an action RPG in which you'll embark on a journey to save your younger sister, and humanity as a whole, from "mysterious dimensional invaders from beyond the starlit skies".</p>

<p>As part of that quest, you can expect a "gauntlet of formidable enemies and colossal bosses" to take on, as well as lots of exciting combat abilities to upgrade and skills to try out.</p>

<p>Of course, the PC version of the game will also boast a host of graphical options, including 4K resolution, ray tracing, and HDR, but if you want to use your DualSense controller on the Steam version, you'll be able to do that as well.</p>




<p><em>Lost Soul Aside&nbsp;</em>will launch on August 29th for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3378960/Lost_Soul_Aside/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/lost-soul-aside/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>.</p>
