            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-genki-switch-2-lawsuit<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo is suing accessory maker Genki over the latter's "Glitch 2" Switch 2 accessory range, alleging trademark infringement and false advertising under federal and California state law.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://thegamepost.com/nintendo-lawsuit-against-genki-switch-2-mockups-ces-2025/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">The Game Post</a>, Nintendo's lawsuit, which was filed last week, claims Genki used Nintendo's "Switch" and "Joy-Con" trademarks in order to make it seem as though the accessory company's products were approved by Nintendo.</p>

<p>This, according to Nintendo's lawsuit, included the demonstration of what Genki claimed to be accurate Switch 2 mockups at the CES 2025 trade show, which took place prior to the console's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">official announcement in January</a>.</p>

<p>The Japanese gaming giant says that Genki's claims of compatibility on "day one" for the Glitch 2 range was misleading and illegal, because Nintendo hadn't provided Genki with a Switch 2 prior to release.</p>

<p>This means the accessory maker either wasn't in "possession of a genuine console" and thus couldn't make claims of compatibility "in good faith", or said console (or information pertaining to its specs) was "unlawfully or illicitly obtained".</p>

<p>Nintendo also says Genki's use of its trademarks would make it likely consumers would "falsely perceive a connection, association, sponsorship, or affiliation" between the two companies where no such partnership exists.</p>




<p>As for what Nintendo wants from the lawsuit, it's asking the court to put a stop to Genki selling Switch 2-related accessories. In The Game Post's words, it wants Genki to "destroy any products or ads that use Nintendo trademarks", as well as handing over profits related to Switch 2 accessory sales.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-reach-3m.1181079/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-3m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>developer and publisher Warhorse Studios has announced that its medieval open-world RPG has managed to pass a brand new sales milestone.</p>

<p>Speaking <a href="https://x.com/WarhorseStudios/status/1918999047735857429" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">over the weekend</a>, Warhorse said that&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>sales have reached a rather impressive three million <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-moved-forward" rel="nofollow">in three months</a>, thanking players for "making history" with the studio.</p>

<p>The figure means that sales of the game have slowed down a little since its meteoric beginnings;&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>managed to surpass a million sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-1m" rel="nofollow">in its first day on release</a>, going on to break the two million barrier <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-2m-two-weeks" rel="nofollow">in under two weeks</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-3m-combat.jpg?itok=3tJMmDVY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-3m-combat.jpg?itok=WsDrtQ9j 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>is selling pretty well.</figcaption></figure><p>Even so, three million sales is a pretty impressive figure for what is, in the end, a fairly niche title.&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>places a heavy emphasis on realism rather than traditional RPG fantasy elements, so the fact it's managed to find an audience this wide is no mean feat.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>, it's the sequel to <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/kingdom-come-deliverance" rel="nofollow">the 2018 original</a>. Much like its predecessor, the game is a medieval RPG set in 15th-century Bohemia, and it follows the blacksmith's son Henry of Skalitz as he navigates a web of political and historical intrigue.</p>

<p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>boasts a world twice the size of the original game, and it's also got a script that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-script-words" rel="nofollow">runs to a formidable two million words</a>, according to Warhorse Studios.</p>

<p>Naturally, you'll also find new skills and systems to interact with, as well as an entirely new story to discover and a ton of sidequests to hunt down. If you're into open-ended RPGs, then this one should already be on your radar.</p>




<p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1771300/Kingdom_Come_Deliverance_II/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/9N4W31HSMVVD" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.
