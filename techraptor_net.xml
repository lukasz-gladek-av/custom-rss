            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Frogwares has revealed that its upcoming horror game&nbsp;<em>The Sinking City 2&nbsp;</em>will be delayed into next year, and it's all down to the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://frogwares.com/the-sinking-city-2-delay-announcement/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on its official website, Frogwares says that although it technically hasn't announced a release window for the survival horror sequel, it acknowledges that both its fans and Frogwares itself "were expecting a 2025 launch".</p>

<p>However, thanks to "frequent drone and missile attacks, incoming power outages, and the need to adapt to unstable conditions" owing to Russian attacks on Ukraine, Frogwares says it needs additional development time to "finish the game properly".</p>

<p>Frogwares promises that the extra time will allow it to make&nbsp;<em>The Sinking City 2&nbsp;</em>"tense, atmospheric, and deeply unsettling in all the right ways", promising to honor the survival horror genre's focus on "tension, pacing, combat, and atmosphere".</p>

<p><em>The Sinking City 2&nbsp;</em>was originally announced back in March 2024 during that month's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-partner-preview-recap-check-out-all-news-and-reveals" rel="nofollow">Xbox Partner Preview</a> showcase. Like the first game, it promises to deliver "a distinct atmosphere of cosmic horror and twisted designs" inspired by the writing of H.P. Lovecraft.</p>

<p>Unlike the first title, however,&nbsp;<em>The Sinking City 2&nbsp;</em>will focus on survival horror mechanics; Frogwares promises "inventory management, optional puzzles, and backtracking to newly unlocked areas and hidden treasures", just like the genre's stalwarts.</p>




<p><em>The Sinking City 2&nbsp;</em>is set to launch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2825860/The_Sinking_City_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10009208" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and Xbox Series X|S sometime next year.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/report-european-game-devs-quarter-layoffs</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-report-alleges-over-a-quarter-of-european-game-devs-lost-their-jobs-this-year.1330606/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report claims that over a quarter of people working in the gaming industry in Europe have lost their jobs over the last twelve months or so, with many of those affected still looking for work.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/over-26-of-european-game-professionals-were-laid-off-in-the-past-year-more-than-10-still-searching-for-jobs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, the latest Big Games Industry Employment Survey reports that over 26% of workers in game development in Europe have been laid off over the last year or so, and 10.4% of that number are still searching for a new job.</p>

<p>According to the survey, the most commonly-affected areas for layoffs are design, art, and QA testing, and those on the creative side of the industry "also felt the least secure in their roles". Perhaps unsurprisingly, management, HR, and analytics felt a much stronger sense of job security.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gaming-industry-europe-layoffs-report-office.jpg?itok=O-B75yie 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gaming-industry-europe-layoffs-report-office.jpg?itok=DTc-9xz0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Developers across Europe are losing their jobs at a rate of knots, apparently. Sony Santa Monica shown only for illustrative purposes.</figcaption></figure><p>Salaries for many jobs across Europe have fallen as well, including programming, project management, and recruitment. Naturally, that also means salary satisfaction is lower than it was last year.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the survey also found that the gender pay gap is very much alive and well in the gaming industry, with huge gaps between men and women in areas like the C-suite executive level and project management.</p>

<p>That disparity extends to diversity and inclusion initiatives as well; the report found that the majority of studios polled don't have dedicated DEI specialists, and that number has risen since last year as well.</p>

<p>Generally, this year's Big Games Industry Employment Survey does not paint a particularly positive picture of the industry, but given the sheer amount of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hyper-light-breaker-development-ending-layoffs" rel="nofollow">layoffs</a>, project <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">closures</a>, and studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">shutdowns</a> over the last few years, that's hardly surprising.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/funcom-european-game-developer-layoffs.jpg?itok=Yqj8hVBW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/funcom-european-game-developer-layoffs.jpg?itok=AY5KVBjG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Many European studios, like Norwegian outfit Funcom, have let employees go over the last twelve months.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, many of the studios laying employees off, whether that be in Europe or elsewhere, aren't exactly struggling.</p>

<p><em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>has proven a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-sales-1m-infographic" rel="nofollow">very successful project</a> for Funcom, but the studio decided to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-funcom-layoffs" rel="nofollow">lay employees off earlier this month</a> anyway. Similarly, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" rel="nofollow">sweeping layoffs</a> at Xbox don't seem to be down to any performance lull on the studio's part, as its&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-revenue-up-microsoft-2025" rel="nofollow">revenue grew this fiscal year</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dispatch Episode 1 & 2 Impressions - A Tale to Tell]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/dispatch-episode-1-2-impressions</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dispatch-episode-1-2-impressions-a-tale-to-tell.1330498/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Telltale Games created a formula for adventure games that, when done well, is a near-perfect way to absorb a narrative interactively. So many have failed to do it right since their heyday, even Telltale themselves, that releases in that episodic choice-driven style have been few and far between. From what I can tell, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/dispatch-is-episodic-workplace-comedy-first-iterating-where-telltale-refused-to" rel="nofollow"><em>Dispatch </em>has taken all the right lessons</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Dispatch </em>is set in a world of superheroes, where they are so abundant they even solve the world’s pettiest problems and crimes, like de-escalating an argument over someone cutting in line.</p>

<p>You play as Robert Robertson, a former hero who does not have superpowers, who gets a job at a dispatch center for superheroes. You’re tasked with managing a team of still-reforming supervillains to fight crime.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At its core, <em>Dispatch </em>is a classic workplace comedy set in an absurd world. Weird powers lead to weird personalities, and powerful people will have powerful egos.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’re familiar with the style of Telltale adventure games, <em>Dispatch </em>will be readily familiar to you immediately. There are some QTEs during scenes (which you can turn off), and many dialogue choices will be met with a “so and so will remember that” in the corner of your screen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The biggest deviation, and I suppose this may change in future episodes, is that there’s no roaming around or character control. It’s all cutscenes, dialogue, and then some other added gameplay elements I’ll get into with specific episodes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Really, large chunks of <em>Dispatch </em>are like an interactive TV show, which bears out in the playtime with each episode being about an hour (so far anyway). There’s still some interesting gameplay going on, however.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Episode 1 – Pivot&nbsp;</h2>

<p>The first episode gives you all the setup for the world and the character you play, Robert Robertson. He is the third generation of Mecha Man, both his father and grandfather dying as heroes as they served the Southland area of Los Angeles. They were well-beloved, leaving quite the legacy for Robert to live up to.</p>

<p>As the episode starts with the history of the world and your character, we get to see Mecha Man in action. Hot on the tail of Shroud, the villain that killed Robert's father, we infiltrate a steel mill full of his goons.</p>

<p>Things don’t go well, and Robert survive,s but his Mecha Man suit does not. Without that, he can’t be a hero anymore, as he has no powers. And as you see his apartment in the opening minutes of the game... Robert's not exactly flush with cash for repairs.</p>

<p>The story goes on from there, but I don’t want to go into the plot too much to let you experience it yourself. Robert's motivations and personality come through from the opening seconds of the game, and the history of Mecha Man does a great job of showing just how important being Mecha Man is to him.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One scene is a perfect example of why the episode works and sets up what we're in for with <em>Dispatch</em>.</p>

<p>The scene takes place in a bar for superheroes, which does a great job of showing you the world of <em>Dispatch</em>. Heroes are so mundane, so numerous that this isn't some elite club -- just a bar in a normal neighborhood. The decor looks like it'd be a decent stand-in for a bar just about anywhere.</p>

<p>In the scene prior, we're introduced to Blonde Blazer, who rescues the suitless Mecha Man from some thieves who were beating the hell out of Robert until she got there. She takes him to the bar for Robert to unwind and get to know him.</p>

<p>Blonde Blazer works for Superhero Dispatch Network, and you eventually learn that she's there to learn a little about Robert to evaluate whether he'd be a good fit for the company. Considering the name of the game, he turns out to be a pretty good fit.</p>

<p>The scene is pretty short but efficient and effective. The quick interactions with Blonde Blazer and a couple of other characters in the bar and just the setting of the bar itself set up the main thrust of the story, introduce hugely important characters, give you a great sense of the world, and shows you the exact sort of tone and humor to expect from the game.</p>

<p>Of the humor, there's one specific joke I want to talk about in this episode. I think the humor mostly sort of works this episode, but some fall flat for similar reasons as this next one.</p>



<p>The thieves Blonde Blazer helped Robert with were all wearing different colored beanies, so Robert jokingly refers to them as skittles. At the bar, Blonde Blazer laughs, saying she hadn't even noticed that.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Robert replies, “you know what they can taste the rainbow in jail.” Fine enough joke that mostly works. Decent setup, decent payoff.</p>

<p>Then Blonde Blazer says, “What do you mean? Like different colored dicks?”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ah, so close. This sort of wink-wink, nudge-nudge moment comes up a few times in Episode 1. They just don't end up working and feel like a prude's attempt at crude humor sometimes. Having played some more of <em>Dispatch</em>, particularly the next episode, I think it falls into a better groove where the irreverent humor lands most of the time.</p>

<p>If you’re reading a few impressions or reviews on <em>Dispatch</em>, I imagine there’s going to be a lot of <em>The Boys&nbsp;</em>comparisons. The crude humor with shocking visuals is somewhat in <em>Dispatch</em>, but at a much lower level. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Very early on, you fight a guy who is naked with penis flapping in the wind throughout the fight. Because it happens so early, you'd think there would be more things like it. There's really not, though.</p>



<p>It feels like <em>Dispatch </em>wants to dip its toes in every so often, coming across like its a kid getting away with something than embracing the joke. So, the inevitable <em>The Boy</em>s comparisons don't work for me, as <em>The Boys</em> commits to its identity fully and forcefully. <em>Dispatch </em>just wants to be naughty every so often.</p>

<p>Overall, I think Episode 1 does a great job setting up the world of Dispatch and introducing some of the major characters.</p>

<h2>Episode 2 - Onboard</h2>

<p>I'm glad Episode 2 is coming out at the same time as 1, as there's still a whole lot more of the world to learn and characters to meet.</p>

<p>Here, Robert finally gets to work as a dispatcher, and you’re introduced to the team of heroes you’ll be working with. "Hero" may be overstating how to describe them, as they're a bunch of still-reforming villains. Nicknamed the Z Team, they're not the easiest to work with.</p>

<p>One is a man who looks like a bat but can turn more bat-like at times -- he's smart and a former finance criminal. One's a hothead who controls fire, another an arrogant gal who turns invisible -- the list goes on, but suffice to say they are all very vocal and have some loose morals.</p>



<p>Episode 2&nbsp; is where some more gameplay elements enter as well, as you will be dispatching your team to various calls, from fights, to kaijus, to security details.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Team members have unique stats, with some better at fighting, others who are smarter, etc. They can level up and you can put to improve stats as you see fit, and there are even some unique abilities they can gain too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Each call for dispatch will give you some keywords and descriptions to give you a hint as to what stats may be better suited for a job. Depending on what you choose, you’ll see a graph like the above where the orange area shows what the hero or team of heroes covers on that graph, and the white area shows what you need to cover. The white part is revealed after you choose, of course.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Most of the time, you won’t cover it all, so you’re at the whims of a bouncing ball in the white area that you hope eventually ends in the area you have covered, or you'll fail.</p>



<p>Sending heroes to calls, them handling the call, and then returning to base from calls all take time, making you have to juggle a lot of things at once. Calls are on the board for a limited time before you automatically fail them, and you don't want to be caught out with no one to send. Or worse, having only one or two to send that are obviously not suited for the call.</p>

<p>It’s all pretty simple, so don’t expect anything too crazy.&nbsp;<em>Dispatch </em>will just throw a lot of choices and timers at you at once. It's engaging the entire time, and it’s certainly never boring.</p>

<p>While all that is going on, there are a lot of entertaining conversations on the team, whether it's a comment on the call they're sent to, who they're paired with, or just some random conversation as everything is going on. It really lets the all-star cast of incredible voice acting shine.</p>



<p>The other bit of gameplay is how Robert can more directly help the team through hacking. These are presented as little puzzles where you open up pathways to move around and collect information or codes you need.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hacking is simple at first, but they do add some more elements, like some of them being timed, virus protection that chases you around the pathways as you try to quickly input a code, and more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Depending on how you feel about some quick, simple puzzling, I think your mileage will vary. There’s nothing there to wow you, but there are a few standout ones that directly involve members of your team that ratchet the tension nicely. Like quickly hacking some water tanks that may douse you're fire-powered hero on the team.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For me, Episode 2 is where everything started to gel completely. The cast of characters is fun, and dispatching is totally engaging, making the time fly by. Episode 2 is great at making the huge cast shine, and that's where the game's greatest strength lies.&nbsp;</p>

<hr><p>Overall, I’m extremely pleased with the opening of <em>Dispatch</em>. While it may be less interactive than the Telltale games of old, <em>Dispatch </em>streamlines how you interact with its narrative and makes the gameplay elements intrinsic to the game itself. &nbsp;</p>

<p>As a one-two opener, it's a great opening. Episode 1 spends a lot of time with Robert, the main character, and the second episode sets up the gameplay and huge cast of characters, putting its "secret sauce" of incredible voice talent front and center.</p>

<p>This is a style of game that I think people yearning for more of that Telltale goodness from years ago will be very satisfied with. I can't wait for more.</p>
