            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mecha-break-demo-player-count-300k<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The newly-released demo for a little third-person mech shooter called&nbsp;<em>Mecha Break&nbsp;</em>is hitting some serious Steam player numbers, with hundreds of thousands of players flocking to check out the demo since it launched yesterday.</p>

<p>According to SteamDB's <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2870990/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">numbers</a>, the&nbsp;<em>Mecha Break&nbsp;</em>demo reached an all-time peak of 317,522 players yesterday. To put things into perspective, that's higher than the all-time Steam player counts of games like&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>,&nbsp;<em>Halo Infinite</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>, and we know <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-2m-two-weeks" rel="nofollow">how successful the latter is</a>.</p>

<p>That achievement seems even more impressive when we consider that we're comparing a demo to numbers achieved by fully-released games. Sure, these aren't quite&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-steam-records" rel="nofollow"><em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>numbers</a>, but that's a franchise with some name recognition.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mecha-break-demo-player-count-melee.jpg?itok=JTpOjlub 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mecha-break-demo-player-count-melee.jpg?itok=-M67zZFV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Mecha Break</em>'s demo is attracting some serious attention.</figcaption></figure><p>Although&nbsp;<em>Mecha Break&nbsp;</em>is getting some big player numbers for its demo, feedback from those players hasn't been entirely positive. In fact, the demo (which has its own review numbers thanks to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valve-overhauls-steam-demos" rel="nofollow">changes made by Valve in July</a>) has a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2870990/Mecha_BREAK_Demo/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Mostly Negative rating</a> across almost 4,800 reviews at time of writing.</p>

<p>Those who've left negative reviews point to the game's <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/xGCms/recommended/2870990/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">kernel-level anti-cheat</a>, which is never a popular inclusion, as well as its <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198015327365/recommended/2870990/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">monetization model</a> and its lengthy, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197976329976/recommended/2870990/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">unskippable</a> tutorial sequence.</p>

<p>Of course, there are many positive reviews as well, and even negative reviews frequently mention&nbsp;<em>Mecha Break</em>'s <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198061570971/recommended/2870990/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">gameplay</a> as a positive point. Some players are also urging others to <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/ggwhiskey/recommended/2870990/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">show leniency</a> given that the demo doesn't necessarily represent the finished product.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Mecha Break</em>, it's a multiplayer third-person shooter with - you guessed it - an emphasis on mech combat.</p>

<p>The game offers three distinct modes: a 3v3 deathmatch mode, a 6v6 hero shooter-style mode, and a PvPvE extraction shooter. Needless to say, that's a pretty ambitious mix. It also boasts the involvement of some <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiplayer-mech-game-mecha-break-reveals-iconic-mecha-artists-and-beta-window" rel="nofollow">pretty heavy hitters in the mech world</a>, including&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear</em>'s Takayuki Yanase and&nbsp;<em>Gundam</em>'s Junya Ishigaki.</p>

<p>If you'd like to check out the&nbsp;<em>Mecha Break&nbsp;</em>demo, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2870990/Mecha_BREAK_Demo/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">do so right now via Steam</a>.</p>
