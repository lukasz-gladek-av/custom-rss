            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Netflix has closed down&nbsp;<em>Squid Game: Unleashed&nbsp;</em>developer Boss Fight Entertainment, just three years or so after acquiring the developer.</p>

<p>That's according to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/netflix-shutters-squid-game-unleashed-developer-boss-fight-entertainment" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Game Developer</a>, as well as Boss Fight CEO David Rippy, who <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/david-rippy-1b16871_hi-everyone-well-word-has-gotten-around-activity-7387225251513827328-E979/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">confirmed</a> the studio's closure via his LinkedIn account over the weekend, describing news of the developer's shutdown as "rough".</p>

<p>Netflix's decision to shut down Boss Fight might seem a little strange given that it's only been three years <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-acquires-boss-fight-entertainment" rel="nofollow">since the studio was acquired</a>. Not only that, but, as Rippy says in his post, the studio had a bona fide hit on its hands with&nbsp;<em>Squid Game: Unleashed</em>, which "hit #1 in 26 countries".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/squid-game-unleashed-boss-fight-entertainment.jpg?itok=M-oDFlDY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/squid-game-unleashed-boss-fight-entertainment.jpg?itok=DtZJaOmR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Squid Game: Unleashed&nbsp;</em>developer Boss Fight Entertainment has been shut down.</figcaption></figure><p>Neither Netflix nor Boss Fight gave an official reason for the studio's closure, but Game Developer "understands" that it's all down to new Netflix games president Alain Tascan, who took over from Mike Verdu <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-generative-ai-vp" rel="nofollow">back in November last year</a>.</p>

<p>Per Game Developer, Tascan's goal with Netflix's gaming division is to focus things more on "party games, children's titles, and narrative experiences" (that's Game Developer's wording, not Tascan's), and Boss Fight's shutdown is a direct result of that paradigm shift.</p>

<p>Despite Boss Fight's shutdown,&nbsp;<em>Squid Game: Unleashed&nbsp;</em>will apparently still receive support from Netflix, so if you're a fan of the game, you don't need to worry about it going away anytime soon.</p>

<p>This is the second studio Netlfix has (apparently) closed down in the last twelve months or so; last October, it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-team-blue-shut-down-report" rel="nofollow">was reported</a> that the streaming giant had shuttered its all-star Team Blue development outfit, which counted&nbsp;<em>Overwatch&nbsp;</em>and <i>Halo&nbsp;</i>alumni among its number.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/netflix-boss-fight-shutdown-team-blue.jpg?itok=py8ykfwC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/netflix-boss-fight-shutdown-team-blue.jpg?itok=ngzK00St 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Netflix also shut down Team Blue, which boasted the involvement of alumni from&nbsp;<em>Overwatch&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Halo</em>, last year.</figcaption></figure><p>Despite these shutdowns, Netflix is going all-in on gaming adaptations, with its&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>series already having been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-devil-may-cry-renewed-second-season" rel="nofollow">renewed for a second season</a> and its long-gestating&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>series <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-live-action-series-netflix-soon" rel="nofollow">finally going ahead</a>.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what Rippy and his fellow Boss Fight alumni do after the shutdown of the studio, but we may not hear from them for a while, if Rippy's words are to be believed; he says he and his co-executives will "take a little breather" before moving on.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starfinder-afterlight-neil-newbon-preach</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/starfinder-afterlight-voice-cast-gains-iconic-baldurs-gate-3-actor.1336063/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Upcoming CRPG <i>Starfinder: Afterlight&nbsp;</i>has gained a brand new voice cast member in the form of&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil Village&nbsp;</em>alumnus Neil Newbon, whose name you'll probably already have seen if you're following the project.</p>

<p>As revealed in a press release, Newbon will be joining&nbsp;<em>Starfinder: Afterlight&nbsp;</em>to voice Preach, who'll serve as one of your companions in the upcoming RPG. Preach is a Shirren who's aiming to become a galaxy-renowned High Priest, but it'll be up to you whether or not he succeeds.</p>

<p>Newbon is also serving as the voice director for&nbsp;<em>Starfinder: Afterlight</em>; he's heading up a cast that also includes legends like&nbsp;<em>Overwatch</em>'s Carolina Ravassa,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv" rel="nofollow"><em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></a>'s Melissa Medina, and long-time voice acting veteran Fred Tatasciore.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/starfinder-afterlight-neil-newbon-preach-combat.jpg?itok=kmReiZ0g 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/starfinder-afterlight-neil-newbon-preach-combat.jpg?itok=HiP9MpwW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Voice director Neil Newbon will be pulling double duty as a voice actor in&nbsp;<em>Starfinder: Afterlight</em>.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Starfinder: Afterlight&nbsp;</em>made its debut <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starfinder-afterlight-campaign-charges-kickstarter-raising-over-400k" rel="nofollow">via Kickstarter earlier this month</a>, raising over $400,000 in very short order indeed. The game has since passed the $600,000 mark, and it's still got twelve days to go, so there's every chance it'll soar to even greater heights in the next few days.</p>

<p>At time of writing, the game only has one more stretch goal to meet, which will happen if the campaign reaches $700,000 (a feat that's looking increasingly likely given how much has already been raised).</p>

<p>That goal will add full voice acting to the game; in the words of developer Epictellers, that means "every aspect of the game, every NPC, every companion bark, every narrative moment, [will be] fully voiced".</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see whether the studio manages to reach its final stretch goal, but things are looking pretty bright for&nbsp;<em>Starfinder: Afterlight</em>, so I wouldn't be surprised if more goals are added after the fact.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Starfinder: Afterlight</em>, it's a CRPG based on Paizo's popular tabletop RPG (specifically, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/starfinder-second-edition-playtest-bundle-announced-by-paizo-and-humble-bundle" rel="nofollow">second edition version</a> of said game). It'll see players investigating the disappearance of a spaceship captain, during the course of which the fate of the galaxy will hang in the balance.</p>

<p>We don't have a release date for&nbsp;<em>Starfinder: Afterlight&nbsp;</em>yet, but it's due to hit Early Access on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3245640/Starfinder_Afterlight/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> in the second quarter of next year. Stay tuned for more.</p>
