            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A public playtest is now live for The Black Company Roleplaying Game. Developer Arc Dream Publishing is now taking crucial player feedback for their TTRPG adaptation of the beloved dark fantasy series.</p><p>According to its official <a href="https://theblackcompanyrpg.com/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">web page</a>, <em>The Black Company Roleplaying Game</em> is a fast-paced game of swords, sorcery, and soldiers. The development team is the same studio behind <em>Delta Green</em>, the supernatural military RPG series.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>It is, appropriately, set in the dark fantasy setting of <em>The Black Company</em> series created by Glen Cook. The series is known for focusing on the experience of soldiers in heroic fantasy settings. Human fighters that just want to do their job, get a stiff drink, and stay alive one more day.&nbsp;</p><p>The players are mercenaries drafted into the titular Black Company, a group of soldiers sent to fight and die on deadly missions for an Empire ruled by sorcerers with godlike power. This means constant missions and campaigns against impossible odds where death is almost guaranteed.</p><p><em>The Black Company Roleplaying Game</em> will attempt to bring that level of grit and struggle to gaming tables. The game contains rules for making your own characters and campaigns as well as play as key characters from the books.</p><p>The core system revolves around percentile dice, much like Cubicle 7's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/warhammer-old-world-rpg-players-guide-preview" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Warhammer</em></a> TTRPGs. Only the players roll dice for all skill tests. In addition, the game has no hit points or sanity points; players have a single Damage and Stress state respectively.&nbsp;</p><p>The first initial playtest for <em>The Black Company Roleplaying Game</em> will be available until February 1, 2026. This material will focus on the game's core rules. It will contain a 10-page packet, six premade characters, a prewritten adventure, and a one-page city map.</p><p>Players are encouraged to submit feedback via an online survey and are encouraged to do Actual Play recordings. All Arc Dream asks regarding the latter is to disclose the game is a playtest and not the final version.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
