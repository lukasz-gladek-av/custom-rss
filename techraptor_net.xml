            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new prewritten adventure is available for free on D&amp;D Beyond. To promote the upcoming Forgotten Realms books coming to <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> 2024, Wizards of the Coast is releasing one of the book's new adventures, <em>The Tenebrous Stone</em>, as part of a sneak peek.</p>



<p>According to a post on <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/2084-claim-your-copy-of-the-tenebrous-stone-adventure" rel="nofollow">D&amp;D Beyond</a>, the free adventure being released is intended for level 3 adventurers. It is a "Deity Adventure" set in Helmsdale. An adventuring party is sent to a basalt quarry to track down an evil artifact. On their journey, they will face down dark cultists and undead horrors. This one-shot adventure is designed to be completed in about 2-3 hours.</p>

This contains brief, high-level notes about the adventure and a breakdown of key encounters. Additionally, the adventure features digital maps and monsters on the platform's Maps VTT. This isn't to be confused with their dedicated VTT, Sigil, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-closes-doors-on-sigil-dd-beyond-vtt" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ending support</a> at the end of this month.</p>

<p>In short, this adventure is a solid starting point for new adventurers, online or otherwise.</p>

<p>The Tenebrous Stone is just one prewritten adventure that appears in the upcoming Forgotten Realms: Adventures in Faerun book. According to its listing, the book will contain over 50 prewritten adventures and 52 maps, all packed with adventures for heroes of all stripes. It is being sold alongside a player supplement that will include new subclasses, spells, magic items, and a new <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-previews-dungeons-dragons-2024-circle-magic-in-new-forgotten-realms" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Circle Magic</a> gameplay mechanic.</p>

<p>There is no expiration date given for <em>The Tenebrous Stone's</em> availability on D&amp;D Beyond. However, given WOTC has done similar promos before, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/spelljammer-academy-on-dd-beyond-for-free" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">previewing monster</a> statblocks ahead of Spelljammer, providing a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dungeons-and-dragons-vecna-5e-statblock-revealed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">new 5e statblock</a> for The Whispered One, Vecna, and even released official statblocks for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/baldurs-gate-3-character-sheets-released-by-wizards-of-coast" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">cast of <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a>, it is wise to pick up the adventure now while you can.</p>
