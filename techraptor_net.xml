            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hitpoint-press-humblewood-setting-is-now-pay-what-you-want<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hitpoint Press has offered TTRPG fans an enticing sale this holiday season. The publisher behind many beloved books and products, like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/deck-of-many-animated-things-and-spells-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>The Deck of Many,</em></a><em> </em>has announced that two of their campaign settings, <em>Humblewood</em> and <em>Heckna</em>, are now available as pay-what-you-want.</p>



<p>Humblewood and Heckna's announcement as pay-what-you-want happened somewhat unceremoniously on Hitpoint Press' official web store. As the phrase implies, you can now buy a PDF of either the Humblewood campaign setting or the Heckna campaign setting books for whatever amount you decide. Pay a dollar. Pay ten dollars. Pay whatever, the choice is yours.</p>

<p><em>Humblewood</em> is a world entirely occupied by intelligent animals, similar to Brian Jacques' influential Redwall novel series. It contains 10 playable player species, new subclasses, and a prewritten adventure for characters levels 1-5. It's a setting so popular it is even available as a third-party supplement on <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/humblewood-debuts-on-dd-beyond" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">D&amp;D Beyond</a>.</p>

<p>Alternatively, <em>Heckna</em> is a dark carnival setting. A world where various attractions and performers are actually gruesome monsters in disguise. The PDF is both a campaign setting and a prewritten adventure for characters level 1-10. It contains new magic items, a bestiary, a set of safety tools for mindful play, and a "Shuffled Stories" engine designed to remix elements of the campaign on each playthrough.</p>

Hitpoint Press has produced lines of miniatures, GM Screens, and playing cards for Heckna. As for <em>Humblewood</em>, the setting has spawned several prewritten adventures and supplements like <em>Humblewood Tales</em>, as well as an official comic written by Gail Simone.</p>

<p>Hitpoint Press has a respectable reputation in the TTRPG industry thanks in part to their <em>Deck of Many</em> product line alongside TTRPG books nad supplements helmed by prominent creators in the space. These works include <em>Fool's Gold</em> and <em>Hexbound</em> by YouTube personalities DIngo Doodles and Pointy Hat.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/breaking-vault-of-viditya-voleti-brings-nonlinear-heists-for-good-cause<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Independent TTRPG designer Graham Gentz has released a new project. The game, <em>Breaking The Vault of Viditya Voleti</em>, is an experience about groups of criminals, doomed heists, and character development through adversity. Furthermore, the game's sales will go towards assisting trans youth.</p>



<p>As described on its <a href="https://grahamgentz.itch.io/breaking-the-vault-of-viditya-voleti" rel="nofollow">Itch page</a>, <em>Breaking The Vault of Viditya Voleti</em> is a nonlinear collaborative game where your group becomes a team of criminals on a heist that goes wrong.</p>

<p>The group decides on the setting of the heist and their final goal. That goal can be assassination, rescuing a prisoner, or sabotaging a doomsday weapon. The setting can be in Ancient China, World War 2, or even in a dieselpunk fantasy setting. Either way, the group is given an ultimatum and most fulfill their mission.</p>

<p>As the game progresses, character and context is revealed, culminating in a death scene where the group succeeds thanks to one character's sacrifice. The players themselves must decide if this act of selflessness was out of genuine character growth or not. To quote the game's description, "You are not a good person, but will you die that way?"</p>

The titular Viditya Voleti has a distinct body of work, producing system-agnostic fantasy work as well as the competitive card game <em>The Anatomy of Fear</em>.</p>

<p>The author, Graham Gentz, has similarly eclectic work, including <em>Immortal Lich Henry Kissinger</em>, <em>Aggressively Strange: Sailing The Spooky Wildsea</em>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interview/under-autumn-strangely-pastoral-horror-and-shared-stories" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Under The Autumn Strangely</em></a>.</p>

<p>Lastly, 100% of all sales of <em>Breaking The Vault of Viditya Voleti</em> will go to the <a href="https://southernequality.org/tyep/" rel="nofollow">Trans Youth Emergency Project</a>. This nonprofit organization provides logistical and financial support for transgender youth throughout the American South. This includes travel expenses, medication, as well as mental health and wellness needs.</p>

<p>The game is available now in PDF format for as little as $6.</p>
