<p>In case you need a reminder, <em>Hytale </em>is a sandbox RPG that began life as a specialized <em>Minecraft </em>server run by Collins-Laflamme and his fellow Hypixel staffers before being spun off into its own (rather ambitious!) project in 2018.</p><p>In 2020, Riot Games <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/riot-games-hytale-acqusition-adds-blocky-adventure-to-roster" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="cce18a43-847f-48af-84f2-b986b2f91e4f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">purchased Hypixel</a> and the rights to <em>Hytale</em>, but in June last year, the <em>League of Legends </em>and <em>Valorant </em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hytale-canceled-dev-shuts-down" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d7a83480-b8b4-4d84-9282-580c367fefa6" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">announced that it was shutting Hypixel down</a> and canceling <em>Hytale</em>'s development.</p><p>Initially, that seemed like the end of the story, but in November, Collins-Laflamme and some of the original Hypixel staffers <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hytale-rescued-early-access-soon" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="067e1363-c5fc-4311-97f7-059f8a0d8810" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">announced that they had revived the studio</a> and were back working on <em>Hytale </em>again.</p><p>Following that, <em>Hytale </em>received an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hytale-early-access-release-date" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6a5ca1af-847d-401f-92a0-bf49ffc1da92" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Early Access release date of January 13th</a>, so it's less than a day until you can check it out for yourself and see what the game's epic struggle has wrought.</p>
<p>Given how many people have already pre-purchased <em>Hytale</em>, I'd imagine things can only get better for Hypixel from here on out, especially if the Early Access release is well-received (although the studio has attempted to <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-early-access-january-13-2026" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">set expectations</a> on this front accordingly).</p><p>If you'd like to join in the fun, you can pre-purchase <em>Hytale </em><a href="https://hytale.com/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">right here</a> (or just wait until tomorrow, when it officially launches in Early Access). Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
