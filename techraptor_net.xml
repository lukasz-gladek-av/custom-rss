            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b3eb7ef1-31bd-43e4-bd15-aa4e8990ab75" href="https://techraptor.net/games/starrupture" rel="nofollow"><em>StarRupture</em></a> is an open-world, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9e2fac55-7c08-4df9-8cd3-a855c0dff7df" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/survival-games-why-we-keep-on-coming-back-for-more" rel="nofollow">survival crafting game</a> set in space from indie studio Creepy Jar. This is the studio's second survival game, having produced&nbsp;<em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d60f8f93-57ae-418f-9999-eebdf6c54d21" href="https://techraptor.net/games/green-hell" rel="nofollow">Green Hell</a>.&nbsp;</em>Taking more of an automation route with their space title, you'll explore a strange world within the Ruptura system.&nbsp;Your mission: gather resources and ship products to various companies. The only catch is you're a prisoner and you're on this planet to pay off your debt.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><em>StarRupture</em>&nbsp;Preview | Space Based Survival</h2>

<p>For the playtest, you only have one&nbsp;prisoner option: the Scientist. The details of your crime are marked confidential. How much you owe isn't listed anywhere, so you don't actually know what you need to earn to be free. You don't even learn much about the program you're in, which makes a free future possible.</p>

<p>What you do know is that dying increases your debt. This is due to each death triggering a new sleeve, a fresh body, to be fabricated. While the body is also referred to as a shell in some conversations, sleeve is the primary way to refer to it. This reminds me directly of&nbsp;<em>Altered Carbon</em>, which could be an inspiration for&nbsp;<em>StarRupture</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/starrupture-landing-area-walkthrough.jpg?itok=aSzEZFN0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/starrupture-landing-area-walkthrough.jpg?itok=y1uWYizq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Completing shipments is how you unlock new crafting benches, upgrades, and weapons. To finish any of the available shipment lines for a company, you'll have to construct multiple crafting buildings, including smelters, fabricators, furnaces, and more. The assembly lines, known as rails, may cross much of the area by the end of your experience. This makes it similar to games like&nbsp;<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ad287941-87b4-47ba-9bfa-1184bd27b53c" href="https://techraptor.net/games/satisfactory" rel="nofollow"><em>Satisfactory</em></a>&nbsp;that combine survival with crafting automation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When it comes to the region you can explore, there are multiple environments you can interact with, giving you a taste of the different biomes you may experience throughout the full title. There are ponds, a radiation zone, a meadow area that drains your movement and health, as well as the rocky crags where you'll often find large ore veins. There are strange rock pillars you'll discover, holes that are currently covered by vines but have something glowing within, and two different ruins you can pillage.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/starrupture-rock-pillar.jpg?itok=QkWh5tPD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/starrupture-rock-pillar.jpg?itok=t_Xyl8S6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This is where the mystery comes in. In the remaining buildings, you'll find notes about body enhancements gone awry, other prisoners that've worked on the planet, and a potential murder. None of the questions brought up are answered. It's assumed these will be explored when you have free rein in Early Access.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Overall, the playtest had few bugs, the largest one focusing on the enemies, the Vermin. At times and typically affecting only the easiest variety of the creature, you'll see them flickering, as if a broken light was illuminating their bodies. This makes it hard on the eyes and harder to aim shots at them. The only other issue I ran into was that, upon respawn, I would get momentarily stuck in the regeneration pod and have to jump out of it instead of just walking.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/starrupture-basic-vermin-enemy.jpg?itok=GlltlFN9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/starrupture-basic-vermin-enemy.jpg?itok=Rch9Vw_Z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>There are more than just the basic vermin. You can encounter up to four additional types. The blue exploding ones emit infection, green ones spit venom, others have viscous claws, and the final type combines venom with burning for a rapid death. The basic variety is the sole one affected by the flickering.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These are the only enemies you'll run into while playing. They often attack in swarms and can be difficult to deal with initially. Once you get a pistol and grenades, they are easily negated. With little in the way of a challenge, the<em>&nbsp;</em>playtest can feel less like a survival title and primarily a crafting automation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Along with the flickering bug and lack of challenge, the dialogue may use AI-generated voices at some points. This is the most obvious when listening to an audio recording concerning a female prisoner. The voice of Harvey Summers is flat, with no emotion and an odd cadence, all pointing to AI. On the Steam page for the game, there is no note of AI usage in the title, nor is there anything listed on the website. Whether this is a simple placeholder oversight or lackluster voice acting is unknown.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/suspected-ai-audio-starrupture.jpg?itok=CoEE62OE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/suspected-ai-audio-starrupture.jpg?itok=DLGYFY90 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Another issue with the audio is when a Rupture is about to hit. There are dueling lines playing at the same time. It's disrupting to the gameplay and can make it hard to actually understand what's happening during the first instance. It doesn't impact the overall playtest, however, as you can read what's being said to know how to react.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While&nbsp;<em>StarRupture</em>&nbsp;has a mystery, all it presents in the playtest are small tidbits to reel you in. What's known of the story is well written. The gameplay is straightforward survival mechanics utilizing automation to achieve objectives. There's just not enough to differentiate it from other titles on the market at this time. I am intrigued to see how the story and world expand when it finally releases into Early Access.&nbsp;</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/runequest-warlords-preview</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/runequest-warlords-preview-fantasy-strategy-at-its-finest.1255434/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you’re not already familiar with the IP we’re dealing with today, then you’re not alone. Even as a fan of Tabletop RPGs, I hadn’t come across <em>RuneQuest </em>much outside of passive mentions that basically sold it as a more “hardcore” version of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">DnD </a>with deeper lore. Either way, our <em>RuneQuest: Warlords</em> Preview is about this new turn-based strategy title set in the TTRPG’s universe, and whether it’ll stand tall enough to sell some newcomers on this complex and intricate setting.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><em>RuneQuest: Warlords</em> – A Turn-Based Fantasy Throw-Down</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/runequest-warlords-screenshot-showing-various-fantasy-units-hanging-out-in-some-woods.jpg?itok=2FjFmZ2a 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/runequest-warlords-screenshot-showing-various-fantasy-units-hanging-out-in-some-woods.jpg?itok=HTuF7rnm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>These humble beginnings bely a surprisingly deep sense of worldbuilding.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>If you’ve played many strategy titles before, then you’ll probably be pretty familiar with the bread-and-butter of the gameplay in <em>RuneQuest: Warlords</em>. It’s a <a href="https://techraptor.net/genre/strategy-rpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">turn-based strategy RPG</a>/Skirmisher where you control several different units on a grid-based map. Each turn, the various combatants have a certain number of action points to use up, and once you run out, your turn is over, and the other side gets to run around attacking you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There’s also the standard array of special abilities, different stats for the different unit types, and a decent amount of progression brought into the mix from <em>RuneQuest</em>’s TTRPG roots. As you go, both your heroes and your standard army units get stronger, and you’ll have to manage these upgrades and your army in general between each mission of the campaign. Like I said, it’s all relatively standard for a turn-based strategy title, but that’s not to say that the game has nothing interesting or unique to offer.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Welcome to (Fantasy) Flavortown</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/runequest-warlords-screenshot-showing-a-top-down-view-of-a-grid-based-map.jpg?itok=I_Su0jnN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/runequest-warlords-screenshot-showing-a-top-down-view-of-a-grid-based-map.jpg?itok=5GLfQoX7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This tactical view gives you a pretty comprehensive overview of the entire field.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><div><p>A lot of the appeal of <em>RuneQuest: Warlords</em> comes from the lore and storyline. Going into it without any background knowledge, it would be easy to only see a standard ‘European Fantasy’ setting and just shut off your mind during all of the dialogue, but that would be a huge mistake. While there are certainly enough familiar fantasy elements to keep genre fans happy, if you pay attention to the world and the characters, you start to get hints of a pretty deep and involved lore bubbling just under the surface.&nbsp;</p><p>
&nbsp;
There’s clearly a decent focus on religious conflict here, but the tone remains relatively grounded. It is pretty much devoid of any sense of ‘tongue-in-cheek’ or self-parody, meaning things feel genuinely earnest in the way they’re brought across. While this might be an issue if you struggle to take fantasy settings too seriously, if you let yourself go, it can really suck you in. Hell, I only get to play 4 missions and I’m already interested in learning more about everything that’s going on in the larger world setting of the RPG.&nbsp;</p></div>

<h2>Tabletop Pedigree</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/runequest-warlords-screenshot-showing-a-whole-cluster-of-units-fighting-each-other-in-a-narrow-pass.jpg?itok=v1FR9-0O 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/runequest-warlords-screenshot-showing-a-whole-cluster-of-units-fighting-each-other-in-a-narrow-pass.jpg?itok=9X0NL2Qw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sure, my strategy basically boils down to "put all my dudes in a cluster and hope they overwhelm the enemy", but so far, it's working.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>There are other gameplay elements in <em>RuneQuest: Warlord</em> that make it feel even more strongly tied to the tabletop than other physical-to-digital adaptations like this. At the start of each battle, you have to deploy the forces that you’ve managed to keep your hands on in the campaign thus far. All of these units and heroes have a points value, and the mission will have a strict limit on how many points your army is allowed to take up. If you’ve ever played a tabletop miniatures game, then you’ll know this is a pretty common facet of those games, and it leads to some interesting dynamics.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The points limit means you have to be more creative than just dumping all of your points and effort into the same group of characters and units. Sure, they’re going to be killer units, but they’ll cost so much that you won’t be able to cover enough ground on certain missions. It forces you to keep a bit of variety amongst all of your characters, as well as giving you the opportunity to try different approaches on all of the missions, especially if things don’t work in your favor on your first run.</p>

<h2>A High Quality of Life</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/runequest-warlords-screenshot-showing-a-single-unit-left-on-the-field-with-a-large-blood-patch-nearby.jpg?itok=zbclYQ7Z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/runequest-warlords-screenshot-showing-a-single-unit-left-on-the-field-with-a-large-blood-patch-nearby.jpg?itok=qJ2UDMRq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I wonder if the large patch of gore and viscera could be a clue as to what has just occured here.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Another thing that stands out in&nbsp;<em>RuneQuest: Warlords</em>&nbsp;is the quality-of-life additions to the game. Firstly, you can go around handing out commands to all of your units at once instead of having to wait for all of the animations to finish, which is great if you’re itching to see what’s about to happen or you’re going for a speed run. You’ve also got a hotkey that moves onto your next unit, which is pretty standard, but it only works if that unit has any action or movement points left to use up, which is a nice touch that saves you wondering who the hell had AP left when that “are you sure” pop-up hits when you try to end your turn.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On top of that is a layer of polish that sells this as one of the best-assembled fantasy strategy titles in recent memory. Everything from the way the UI notifies you of buffs and debuffs to the intuitive setup of the menus and buttons you need during your turn. You’ve also got a full tactical map from a top-down perspective that gives you an insane tactical advantage over your opponents. Even for hardcore fans of the genre, there’s a lot of promise on display here.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>My Final Thought</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/runequest-warlords-screenshot-showing-a-thick-bundle-of-player-units-in-a-choke-point-between-two-mountains.jpg?itok=5EalYqlS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/runequest-warlords-screenshot-showing-a-thick-bundle-of-player-units-in-a-choke-point-between-two-mountains.jpg?itok=bVnI7WqQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Here I stand again, forcing myself into a choke-point because I refuse to learn any lessons.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>I have managed to hook myself on <em>RuneQuest: Warlords</em>, and I’ve only seen 4 missions so far. This is a fantastic package to experience this world setting, and even if you’re already into turn-based strategy games with a fantasy setting, then you’ll still find that so much of this game has been done right that there’s plenty to get your teeth into. The real test will be if this momentum can be maintained for the rest of the game, and I for one can’t wait to find out.&nbsp;</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Indie Horror Game Vile: Exhumed Banned from Steam Due to "Sexual Content"]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vile-exhumed-steam-removed-sexual-content</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/indie-horror-game-vile-exhumed-banned-from-steam-due-to-sexual-content.1255383/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Solo game dev Cara Cadaver has revealed that her indie horror game&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>has been banned from Steam, and having played the game myself, I can tell you the reason is...a little strange.</p>

<p>Speaking on <a href="https://x.com/dirtlord77/status/1949867514797707531" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">social media</a>, Cadaver says that <i>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</i>was banned from Steam for "sexual content with depictions of real people". As she points out, the game wasn't banned for "its use of gore in storytelling, or the violent themes".</p>

<p>The twist? As Cadaver says in her post, the sexual content for which the game was taken off Steam is "all implied". There's no explicit depiction of any kind of sexual act within the game; there are plenty of shocking and disturbing images, and the narrative is pretty unsettling, but that's about it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vile-exhumed-steam-banned-emails.jpg?itok=uotDK6lT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vile-exhumed-steam-banned-emails.jpg?itok=5CF3h4y2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>isn't coming to Steam anytime soon, it seems.</figcaption></figure><p>Cadaver says she doesn't want to censor&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>or make changes to it; she says she "will not retell a story about these topics in a way to make people who don't understand it more comfortable".</p>

<p>Together with publisher DreadXP, Cadaver says she's currently looking into alternate ways to release&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed</em>, and you can expect to hear "specific details" next week. Make sure to check out Cadaver's X (formerly Twitter) <a href="https://x.com/dirtlord77" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">account</a> or <a href="https://x.com/dreadxpgames" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">that of DreadXP</a> for further info.</p>

<p>For context, Steam delisted a bunch of adult games from its platform earlier this month, citing concern from payment processors regarding the explicit content present in those games. Indie platform Itch.io <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/itch-io-deindexes-adult-pages" rel="nofollow">quickly followed suit</a>&nbsp;(although the original version of&nbsp;<em>Vile&nbsp;</em><a href="https://final-girl-games.itch.io/vile" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">remains intact</a> on that site, ironically).</p>

<p>It all stems from a <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/open-letter-to-payment-processors" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">campaign</a> started by activist group Collective Shout regarding a game by the name of&nbsp;<em>No Mercy</em>, an explicit title the group says "fl[ies] in the face of efforts to address violence against women".</p>




<p>The decision to remove Cadaver's game from Steam is, frankly, bizarre. If the point, as Collective Shout sees it, is to "address violence against women", then removing a game that directly tackles this theme in a frank and open way seems like a big mistake to me.</p>

<p>Of course, it's entirely likely that Steam simply panicked and pulled the plug on any game that might stand even the slightest chance of upsetting its payment processors, even if that game is about as far from "fl[ying] in the face of efforts to address violence against women" as it's possible to be.</p>

<p>Hopefully, Cadaver and DreadXP can find a way to release&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>somewhere else. In the meantime, you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/vile-exhumed-review-dirty-computer" rel="nofollow">read my review</a> to find out why it's not only an important game from a message standpoint, but also a great experience in its own right.</p>

<p>On the official <a href="https://secretlair.wizards.com/us/en/chaosvault#filter-product-1246458|sort-availability_wotc,featured" rel="nofollow">Secret Lair website</a>, there are eight new Chaos Vault drops.
