            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Osprey Games has announced <em>Frostgrave</em> Limited Deluxe Edition. Celebrating the game's 10th anniversary, this limited printing of the fantasy skirmish miniatures game brings high-quality materials and the most comprehensive version of the game's rules.</p>

<h2>The <em>Frostgrave</em> Limited Deluxe Edition Announcement</h2>

<p>The <em>Frostgrave</em> Limited Deluxe Edition is a solid gift for both newcomers and veterans to designer Joseph A. McCullough's award-winning skirmish miniatures game. It is a leatherette-bound copy of the second edition of the core rulebook embossed with the silver-foiled logo. In addition, it is protected in a slipcase with twin book ribbons, ensuring the book is built to last.</p>

Yes, this book contains rules for the Ring of Transference. This is notable because prior printings of the game contained the item in the rulebook, but no rules or mechanics. If you don't like hunting down errata, this book helpfully provides.</p>

<p>Frostgrave takes place within the frozen ruins of the ancient city of Felstad. Each player takes on the role of a wizard specializing in one of ten schools of magic, as well as a band of followers. These followers then duke it out in elaborate wizard duels and fights. All so one arcane scholar can learn the secrets of the city's long-lost empire.</p>

<p>The game won several awards in 2016. Those honors include Best Miniatures Game at UK Expo 2015, a 2016 Silver Ennie for Best Miniature Product of the Year, and Best Miniatures Game award at Beasts of War 2015. It is a miniature-agnostic game, which makes it considerably cheaper to get into compared to the money sinks of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000</em></a>.</p>

<p>The <em>Frostgrave</em> Limited Deluxe Edition will be available exclusively on Osprey Games' website. The book is set to ship out on November 18 in the United States and on November 20 in the UK.&nbsp;</p>
