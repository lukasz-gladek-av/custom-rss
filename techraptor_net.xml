But that was long, long ago, and the immortal god’s children, now locked away in the underworld, are but malevolent powers who leech their influencer into the kingdom of Lethe. But who are you? Well, you’re just a member of a guild, trying to survive the grim and ghastly world of <i>Doomsong</i>.</p>

<h2><b>What Is </b><b><i>Doomsong</i></b><b>?</b></h2>

<p><i>Doomsong </i>is a brand new Tabletop RPG created by Jack Caesar, Chris Caesar, and Morgan Finley (illustrator), published by Caesar Ink. In this game set on the verge of a biblical apocalypse, players take on the role of guild members struggling to eke out an existence and survive in the treacherous kingdom of Lethe.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/doomsong-travelers.jpg?itok=ZLedlZa5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/doomsong-travelers.jpg?itok=l4tC_XGO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>With a core rulebook coming in at nearly 300 pages, as well as additional materials already available for purchase like the adventure <i>Lord Have Mercy Upon Us</i>, printed maps and calendars, and more - <i>Doomsong</i> is hitting the market ready to make a splash.</p>

<h2><i>Doomsong </i>Revels In Simplicity</h2>

<p>The core mechanic of <i>Doomsong</i> can, essentially, be boiled down in wonderfully simple terms: your character makes checks by rolling a d6, and the player will consult their character’s traits and abilities to make a case for why their roll should be higher.</p>

<p>With many of the difficulty checks set at 5, you’ll need those traits to add to your roll. Is your character from the slums with the Slumcaste trait? Then you’ll have an easier time navigating the city and get a +1 to your roll. But traits can be hindering, too. For example, if the same character from the slums wants to impress a noble, that Slumcaste trait could end up giving them a -1 to their roll!</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/doomsong-attack-sequence.jpg?itok=-2vqodas 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/doomsong-attack-sequence.jpg?itok=Dr2uXdvA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Combat follows a similar logic, with the difficulty of the roll to attack set by your opponent’s toughness. As you hack away at your opponents (and they do the same to you), that toughness level will drop (damage is dealt to a character’s toughness, there’s no HP as it were), making it easier and easier to hit them with each successive strike.</p>

<p>But combat also has a great dice-assignment mechanic to it. Each PC has two dice that they assign at the start of their combat round to various actions. The faster they happen, the less powerful, the longer they take to go off in a round, the more valuable or powerful the action. It's a great way to handle what ends up being a really interesting, mixed activation initiative.</p>

<h2>The World of <i>Doomsong</i> is Rich and Deep</h2>

<p>While you can pick this game up <a href="https://caesar.ink/shop" rel="nofollow">off the shelf</a> (or off of <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/499566/doomsong" rel="nofollow">DrivethruRPG</a>), learn the basic mechanics, and set your table off on their (not so) merry way, <i>Doomsong</i> really rewards GM’s who are into the world building, into the lore, and take the time to read through the book.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/doomsong-fish-monster.jpg?itok=QO1dNOzM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/doomsong-fish-monster.jpg?itok=WHP8Cnmo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>That’s the experience I had with this game. I sat down and read this book cover to cover, totally engrossed in the world created here. Subway ride after subway ride to and from the day job, I had my nose stuck in this book, learning about the various powers that shape and control the Kingdom of Lethe.</p>

<p>Ruled by a vicious ecclesiastical government who seeks to root out and destroy any who perform heretical magic (as all supernatural power comes not from the dead true god, but his ruinous children), and set in a low-magic world that is, for lack of a better term, falling apart at the seams, <i>Doomsong</i> and its world was right up my alley.</p>

<p>For fans of medieval horror like myself, sometimes playing this game feels like the TTRPG equivalent of the baroque, terrifying, chokingly religious vibe of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13543121-between-two-fires" rel="nofollow"><i>Between Two Fires</i></a>, which is… just about exactly what I’m looking for in a game.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/doomsong-enemy.jpg?itok=CEweoPbh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/doomsong-enemy.jpg?itok=hQOfXQFo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The game contains a full bestiary of nasty adversaries, from your common mercenary to talking bears, stomping giants to the Sublime demi-god named Hope (not as good an entity to run into as the name implies).</p>

<h2>Death is a Fact of Life in <i>Doomsong</i></h2>

<p>This is not the kind of roleplaying game where you create your character, kit them out with incredible gear, and set out to avenge the murdered one true god. Not by a long shot. <i>Doomsong</i> is a game that revels in its own lethality, and encourages players to think of their characters as one part of a great story, actors who can - at any moment - exit stage left.</p>

<p>In my first game with my table, after a bit of carousing with other members of the Ratcatchers guild, they set off to find out why a church bell won’t stop ringing (I pilfered a few of my favorite adventure hooks from the <i>Lord Have Mercy Upon Us </i>campaign book for my custom campaign), and were soon ambushed by robbers on the road.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/doomsong-villagers.jpg?itok=Ou39HPxg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/doomsong-villagers.jpg?itok=EEyq8SFJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>A fair fight, weighted slightly in my players’ favor, and still they left the fight bruised, banged around, and with one of my characters missing an eye! That was just the first fight, with little nobodies in the grand scheme of the bestiary. What a rush!</p>

<p>And the one thing I think <i>Doomsong</i> does <i>so</i> right here to soothe some of that sting from a highly lethal game is simple: character creation is quick and really, really fun.</p>

<h2><i>Doomsong </i>Character Creation - Roll With It!</h2>

<p>In <i>Doomsong</i>, creating your character is all about rolling on tables and making decisions based on those rolls. First, you roll on the Origins table to see where you’re from, originally.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/doomsong-character-origin.jpg?itok=Eu1uH98u 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/doomsong-character-origin.jpg?itok=CpylUMJ6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>You could end up rolling and being from the uncharted wilds of the Weald, born in the slums, from a working family on a farm, the middle class, or wealthy elite (or you could be something really strange/special). After determining your birthplace - which does make a lot of difference in the world of <i>Doomsong</i> - you’ll be instructed to turn to another page to resolve another life path roll.</p>

<p>Rolling on that table may offer you options, and this is where you acquire traits, abilities, and sometimes (though its more rare) starting gear: do you gain some new trait from having lived at one time as a performer? Were you a soldier in the army? Only the dice (and your own decisions you make throughout) will tell.</p>

<p>In this way, character creation is fun and fast, and does an incredible job of mixing intense randomness through dice-rolling with giving you choices and options throughout. Hell, you can even die during character creation!</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/doomsong-lifepaths.jpg?itok=fkbBHK1p 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/doomsong-lifepaths.jpg?itok=wzKD_ssK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2><i>Doomsong </i>TTRPG - Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>And that’s why I love <i>Doomsong</i> so much, every step of the way you’re</p>

<p>invited to truly choose your own adventure, from character creation on up to how you interact with the world, it’s the perfect blend of gritty details (do you have enough food to last your journey) and abstraction (your weapon gives you a +1 to your roll… that’s usually it).</p>

<p>With absolutely stunning artwork that truly evokes a feeling of dread, and gameplay that is as entertaining and thought-provoking as it is brutal, <i>Doomsong </i>is an absolute must-try for fans of classic RPG’s, and for players who want to get away from the plot-armor of other big-name fantasy RPGs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Give it a try, there’s even <a href="https://caesar-ink.itch.io/doomsong-demo" rel="nofollow">a free download of trial rules available on </a><a href="http://itch.io/" rel="nofollow">itch.io</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/fromage-review-say-cheese<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s the early 20th century, and as an artisanal French cheese maker, your to-do list keeps growing! There’s the cheese to make, of course, but do you have everything you need for the cheese festival? Are you ready to deliver your cheese around France? These questions, and more, curdle players in the all-new board game <i>Fromage </i>designed by Ben Rosset &amp; Matthew O'Malley (<em>The Search for Planet X</em>), and published by R2i Games.</p>

<h2>What Is <i>Fromage</i>?</h2>

<p><i>Fromage </i>is a simultaneous worker placement board game where players take on the role of French cheesemakers, trying to gain prestige points to become the best in all of France.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Fromage</i> Stats:</p>

<ul><li>1 - 4 Players</li>
	<li>Est. Game Time: 30 - 45 min.</li>
	<li>Game Genre: Simultaneous Worker Placement</li>
	<li>Complexity: Medium+</li>
</ul></blockquote>

<p>In the game, you’ll use your limited amount of workers to make cheese and place that cheese in various parts of a rotating board. Each player has 15 cheese tokens, and the game ends when one player places their final token. From there, you’ll tally up points you gain in four different sections of the board, and your own personal player mat, and the player with the most points wins.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fromage-different-cheeses.jpg?itok=M40a20n5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fromage-different-cheeses.jpg?itok=HjrSrBCX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bleu, Hard, and Soft cheeses all vie for dominance in various regions of France, this the Villes venue of the board.</figcaption></figure><h2>How Do You Play <i>Fromage</i>?</h2>

<p><i>Fromage </i>is all about carefully planning out your turns to balance using your limited workers - of which you only have three - either to gather resources (needed to gain various benefits), or to make cheese on the quadrant of the board currently facing you.</p>

<p>And that’s the most crucial part of <i>Fromage</i>, in my opinion, that bit about “currently facing you.” Implementing a unique rondel component for the central board, you’ll assign your workers to the quarter of the board facing you at the table.</p>

<p>Then, once everyone has played their workers and the round ends, the board rotates one quarter of the way around. You recover any worker of yours currently pointing at you when the board rotates. Less valuable/quicker actions will have your worker pointing at you the next turn of the game, but longer actions could take up to three turns.</p>

<h2>So Much To Do At The Dairy Farm!</h2>

<p>I love this style of worker-placement game, where you have so many options, and can see so many different paths to victory laid out ahead of you. The four main quadrants of the board, called venues, each offer a tantalizing way to earn victory points - but you’ll only see them once every four spins.</p>

<p>First, there’s the Festival venue, where you’ll show off your cheeses to crowds at a cheese festival in the town square (I want to go to a cheese festival in <i>my</i> town square!), and you score points by making orthogonally adjacent cheeses on the game board grid.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fromage-board.jpg?itok=0OpTG3M9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fromage-board.jpg?itok=2KcdbU75 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The entire Fromage board offers so many possibilities in each of the four different villes. In front of us is the Fromagerie ville.</figcaption></figure><p>The Fromagerie venue is all about placing down cheeses on shelves to gain immediate resources in return, and you’ll score in the end for have cheese on different shelves. This is a great venue for trading some lighter points for useful resources like fruit (which some cheese spots across the four venues call for).</p>

<p>Third is the Bistro venue, where you’ll offer up your cheeses at a prestigious French restaurant for pairings. Each time you successfully pair two cheeses of your own on the same table, you’ll increase the value of all your cheeses at this venue.</p>

<p>And finally there’s the Villes venue, which is - I’m not joking - a fun little area control portion of the game where you’re trying to deliver cheese to cities across France to grow your customer base.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fromage-territories.jpg?itok=EGl2DqYQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fromage-territories.jpg?itok=lkz3v8S0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The villes invite friendly local competition.</figcaption></figure><p>There’s so much to do, and it would be in your best interest to mostly ignore some of these venues and focus on gathering resources and honing in on one section - but that’s easier said than done when every rotation of the board opens up new possibilities.</p>

<h2>Fromage Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>As you can tell from this review, I’m totally enamored with <i>Fromage</i>. I think this is an absolutely unique gameplay style, with a fun and innovative approach to worker placement that I’ve not come across previously.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I really like how each venue feels very different from one another, and though I didn’t cover it much here in this review, you have your own player board that allows you to stash resources needed to gain extra points and build up your farm.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fromage-player-board.jpg?itok=xQb1R2HD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fromage-player-board.jpg?itok=w5Le4PE8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Upgrade your player board to help boost your cheese production and reputation!</figcaption></figure><p>Though the order cards, and some upgrades to your farm, feel a little under-ripened (who has enough time in this game to devote to special orders and fully upgrading?), it all works together to hint at many different areas of opportunity to score points.</p>

<p>All said, if you’re looking for a new take on worker placement, then it may just be time to get cheesy with <i>Fromage</i>!</p>
