Here's everything that was shown off during The Game Awards this year!</p><hr><h2><em>The Free Shepherd </em>kicks things off</h2><figure role="group">

<figcaption>D'awww. Look at the lil' dog.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The first trailer we got to see was for a rather cute-looking herding game by the name of <em>The Free Shepherd</em>. It's got <em>Herdling </em>vibes, and it lands on PC and PS5 in 2027.</p><h2><em>Decrepit </em>looks ideal for <em>King's Field </em>fans</h2><p>If you like first-person dungeon crawlers like <em>King's Field</em>, <em>Arx Fatalis</em>, or the <em>Might and Magic </em>games, then <em>Decrepit </em>looks like it'll be for you. This one's coming to PC, and you can sign up for its playtest now.</p><h2><em>Audio Mech </em>is a musical adventure you can play tomorrow</h2><p>Next up, it's a new game from the folks behind <em>Audio Surf</em>, and <em>Audio Mech </em>will let you set any music to the action, including streaming. A demo is coming to Steam tomorrow!</p><h2><em>Pragmata </em>finally has a release date</h2><figure role="group">

<figcaption>We finally know when <em>Pragmata </em>is coming.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Capcom's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pragmata-thrusts-you-into-strange-new-earth" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="dfa99aa5-9c5b-422d-88a1-08160cdee4be" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">weird action-strategy hybrid...thingy</a>, <em>Pragmata</em>, finally has a release date. It's launching on April 24th on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch 2, and a demo for consoles is available too!</p><h2><em>Solasta 2 </em>brings RPG goodness in March</h2><p>Have you been hankering for some good old-fashioned <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>-style dungeoneering? If so, then <em>Solasta 2 </em>is here to whet your appetite. It's launching into Early Access on March 12th.</p><h2><em>Tankrat </em>has...well, lots of tanks</h2><p>Our next reveal brings post-apocalyptic <em>Mad Max </em>vibes along with it. <em>Tankrat </em>is a vehicular combat game that has a strong junkyard aesthetic, and it's coming to PC and PS5 in spring next year.</p><h2><em>Bradley the Badger </em>is an unexpectedly gory platformer</h2><figure role="group">
<article>
  
      
  

  </article>

<figcaption><em>Bradley the Badger </em>looks...odd.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I'll admit I wasn't expecting <em>Bradley the Badger</em>'s titular mammal to brutally stab one of his enemies through the gut during the debut trailer, but hey, surprises are fun! This ambitious-looking game is coming to PC via Steam.</p><h2><em>Stupid Never Dies </em>looks pleasingly old-school</h2><p>Next up is a hack-and-slash-style action game with a graffiti-inspired aesthetic and plenty of enemies to mow your way through. <em>Stupid Never Dies </em>is what <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-capcom-producer-founds-new-studio-at-netease" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="872fe8bd-eb94-4ab0-bdbb-86eb30e948c8" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">GPTRACK50</a> has been working on, and it comes to PC and PS5 next year.</p><h2><em>Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic </em>isn't the <em>KotOR </em>remake</h2>
<p>I know you're waiting on tenterhooks for news of that <em>Knights of the Old Republic </em>remake, but this isn't it. It's a whole new action RPG in the <em>Star Wars </em>universe, and it boasts the involvement of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mark-darrah-and-casey-hudson-leave-bioware" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c7cc9db0-f244-434c-b9b0-07e2c1b3c006" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">ex-BioWare bod Casey Hudson</a>.</p><h2><em>John Carpenter's Toxic Commando </em>has a release date</h2><p>Next, we got to see a snippet of the brutal and heavily 80s-inspired <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/john-carpenters-toxic-commando-announced" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6b106e7f-a32b-4f2b-aea8-fe1cd5f39efb" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>John Carpenter's Toxic Commando</em></a>, which will be arriving on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S on March 12th.</p><h2>Surprise! That statue was for <em>Divinity</em></h2>
<p>Hey, who'd have thunk? That mysterious statue out in the desert was for a new <em>Divinity </em>game by Larian Studios, so it looks like that's the developer's next big focus after the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/baldurs-gate-3-has-way-over-10-million-players-mod-support-has-been-in-works-since" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a6faddb2-01d3-46aa-a769-c7be021e6a4f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">hugely successful <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a>.</p><h2><em>4Loop </em>is a <em>Helldivers</em>-esque co-op shooter</h2><p>Next, it's <em>4Loop</em>, a <em>Helldivers</em>-style co-op shooter in which you and your squad are constantly reprinted (hence the "loop" of the title) to do endless battle with robots. PC and PS5 for this one, but no release date.</p><h2><em>Coven of the Chicken Foot </em>looks whimsically fun</h2><p><em>The Last of Us </em>director Bruce Straley's new game is next, and <em>Coven of the Chicken Foot </em>looks...not a lot like that game, actually. It's a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/last-of-us-director-announces-intimate-puzzle-platformer-coven-of-chicken-foot" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e089c2ce-c3ac-4580-a171-b9aee3afdbfd" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Last Guardian</em>-style companion puzzler</a> coming at some point in the future.</p><h2><em>Ontos </em>is <em>Amnesia </em>studio Frictional's new game</h2><figure role="group">
<article>
  
      
  

  </article>

<figcaption>Frictional's next game is the very unsettling-looking <em>Ontos</em>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Frictional Games has developed a reputation for itself for making genuinely creepy, thought-provoking horror, so let's hope new sci-fi spook-'em-up <em>Ontos </em>continues that legacy. It'll arrive next year.</p><h2>Hey, Leon's in <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>!</h2><p>Another of gaming's worst-kept secrets was revealed next: Leon Kennedy is in <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>, and he's playable as well. February for this one, remember?</p><h2><em>Order of the Sinking Star </em>looks suitably mind-bending</h2><p>Here's a puzzler for everyone who's smart enough to handle it (which, if I'm being honest, probably isn't me). <em>Order of the Sinking Star </em>is a reality-bending puzzle game coming sometime next year.</p><h2><em>Exodus </em>looks a little bit <em>Mass Effect</em></h2>
<p>Has <em>Mass Effect </em>left a hole in your life? Are you looking for a new sci-fi space opera to laugh and cry to? <em>Exodus </em>may well be the game for you. It's brought to you by Wizards of the Coast, and it's coming in early 2027.</p><h2><em>Warlock: Dungeons &amp; Dragons </em>has those high fantasy vibes</h2><p>Next, it's...erm, well, we don't really know what <em>Warlock: Dungeons &amp; Dragons </em>is just yet. We will do by summer 2026, though, when a gameplay reveal has been promised.</p><h2><em>Screamer </em>proves once again that driving and storytelling can work</h2><p>I'm honestly extremely glad that narrative racing games appear to be trying to make a comeback, and so is the beautifully-animated <em>Screamer</em>, apparently. March 26th for this one.</p><h2><em>Control Resonant </em>promises another mind-bending story</h2><figure role="group">
<article>
  
      
  

  </article>

<figcaption>More <em>Control </em>is on the way!</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If you played the original <em>Control</em>, you'll know it was a wild and at least partly nonsensical (in a good way!) journey, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/control-2-announcement-promises-more-mind-bending-fun" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5caf8cb7-4c43-4da3-a766-14ea52221751" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">long-awaited sequel</a> <em>Control Resonant </em>promises more of the same next year.</p><h2><em>Gang of Dragon </em>looks very <em>Yakuza</em>, which is apropos</h2><p>Next, it's a trailer for <em>Gang of Dragon</em>, the debut game from <em>Yakuza </em>creator <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/yakuza-creators-team-up-to-create-nagoshi-studios" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5bc54607-2218-4966-b372-9d5bd3fca3c5" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Toshihiro Nagoshi's new studio</a>. Unbelievably, it looks a lot like <em>Yakuza</em>-slash-<em>Like a Dragon</em>, although there's sadly no release date.</p><h2><em>Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight </em>arrives in May</h2><p>The new <em>Lego Batman </em>game, which retells many of the Dark Knight's most iconic stories in Lego form, is arriving on May 29th, and you can pre-order it now. Wahey!</p><h2><em>Tomb Raider Catalyst </em>is the next big <em>Tomb Raider </em>game</h2><p>Cards on the table: I'm not really a pre-rendered game trailer fan. I want to see what the game plays like! That said, that's all we got for <em>Tomb Raider Catalyst</em>, but at least we got to see a new interpretation of Lara Croft. 2027 for this one.</p><h2>Surprise! It's actually two <em>Tomb Raider </em>games</h2>
<p>Crystal Dynamics announced a second <em>Tomb Raider </em>game next in the form of <em>Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</em>, a remake (yes, another one) of the first game in the series. It looks a bit more modernized this time around, though. 2026!</p><h2>Hey, <em>Forest 3 </em>looks pretty weird</h2><p>Endnight Games is working on a third <em>Forest </em>game, it turns out, and this one's taking...a more science fiction-y direction? It'll probably be a while before we hear from it again, at any rate.</p><h2><em>Orbitals </em>is one for classic anime fans</h2><p>Next up, it's <em>Orbitals</em>, a rather beautiful-looking retro anime-style sci-fi adventure game that also appears to be co-op. It's coming exclusively to the Nintendo Switch 2 next year.</p><h2><em>Diablo 4</em>'s next expansion is <em>Lord of Hatred</em></h2><p>Are you ready for yet more clicking on things to get EVEN BIGGER numbers and colors? <em>Diablo 4: Lord of Hatred </em>sure hopes you are. You can expect this one on April 28th.</p><h2><em>Lords of the Fallen 2 </em>is a Soulslike - who'd have thunk?</h2><figure role="group">
<article>
  
      
  

  </article>

<figcaption>Oh, look! <em>Lords of the Fallen 2 </em>is a Soulslike!</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>CI Games showcased <em>Lords of the Fallen 2 </em>next, and it's got pretty much exactly what you'd expect from a Soulslike, to wit: lots of monsters, lots of killing, and, uh, the Pet Shop Boys. 2026 is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lords-of-fallen-2-2026-epic-exclusive" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a29f068a-b045-498e-a3eb-221278f803c0" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">when this one is coming out</a>.</p><h2><em>Saros </em>launches in April</h2><p>Housemarque's next game, <em>Saros</em>, which continues the roguelite action trend of <em>Returnal</em>, is launching on April 30th, the studio announced last night. Get your pre-orders ready!</p><h2><em>No Law </em>has serious <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>vibes</h2><p>At first, I thought <em>No Law </em>would be some kind of <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>expansion, but nope: it's a new game from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-acquires-ascent-developer-neon-giant" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a6b43493-28f9-4c5a-b90d-f0cb178c2f71" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Krafton and <em>The Ascent</em>'s Neon Giant</a>. You can wishlist it now across platforms!</p><h2><em>Total War: Warhammer 40k </em>is finally happening</h2>
<p>It's a match made in heaven (or perhaps the Warp), and so the existence of <em>Total War: Warhammer 40k </em>probably shouldn't come as a surprise. You can expect it on PC and consoles, although we don't know when.</p><h2><em>Ace Combat 8: Wings of Theve </em>soars in next year</h2><p>That's right: another <em>Ace Combat </em>game is coming! <em>Ace Combat 8: Wings of Theve </em>looks to continue the series' signature blend of high drama and, well, high drama when it launches next year.</p><h2><em>Star Wars: Galactic Racer </em>has podracing action for you</h2><figure role="group">
<article>
  
      
  

  </article>

<figcaption>Time to show off your podracing prowess.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Hey, do you miss the glory days of <em>Star Wars Episode I: Racer</em>? If so, then <em>Star Wars: Galactic Racer </em>is the podracing game for you. It's launching next year!</p><h2><em>Out of Words </em>feels a bit <em>Unravel</em>-y</h2><p>Next, it's puzzle-platformer <em>Out of Words</em>, which has a rather lovely (if very <em>Unravel</em>-esque) woolen aesthetic. You'll be able to check this one out next year as well.</p><h2><em>Phantom Blade Zero </em>is action-packed, and it has a release date</h2><p>Action game <em>Phantom Blade Zero </em>was up next, and we've got a release date for this definitely-not-a-Soulslike, too: September 9th on both PC and PlayStation 5.</p><h2>The Blue Bomber returns in <em>Mega Man Dual Override</em></h2>
<p>The good news: Mega Man is returning in a brand new sidescrolling adventure. The bad: we'll have to wait until 2027 to play it. Still, it looks like classic Mega Man, which is great.</p><h2><em>Highguard </em>is a free-to-play fantasy FPS from Respawn</h2><p>If you were hoping for the return of <em>Titanfall </em>during this Game Awards, then sadly, you'll be disappointed. We did get to see a new free-to-play fantasy FPS called <em>Highguard</em>, though, which is launching in January.</p><hr><p>We made it! That's everything that was announced during this year's Game Awards ceremony. Join us around the same time next year for more!</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-game-awards-2025-recap]]></content:encoded>
