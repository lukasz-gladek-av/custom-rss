<figcaption><em>CorgiSpace </em>wants to serve as an antidote to bloated modern triple-A epics.</figcaption>

<p>As well as the games themselves, <em>CorgiSpace </em>also offers developer diaries to show you how each game was made. Charmingly, Finji says some of these games "can even save progress". Imagine!</p><p>Games you can check out as part of <em>CorgiSpace </em>include run-based puzzler <em>Kuiper Cargo</em>, "mini roguelike" <em>Cave of Cards</em>, and <em>Mole Mole</em>, a sokoban puzzler with an explosive twist.</p><p>It's not just <em>CorgiSpace </em>Finji is announcing, either. If you're interested in making your own micro-style games, the studio is hosting a game jam between today and January 11th. It'll wrap up with a stream in the week of January 19th, during which Finji staffers and guests will play some of the games created as part of the jam.</p><p>If you want to get a sense for what <em>CorgiSpace </em>will play like and what you can expect from the collection, you can check out a trailer here.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>No More Robots head Mike Rose has lamented Valve's review moderation process for Steam after he and his team flagged a racist review for <em>Little Rocket Lab</em>, only for Valve to seemingly unflag it.</p><p>Speaking on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mikerose.bsky.social/post/3m7nfhwfwms2a" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Bluesky</a>, Rose pointed out that he'd flagged a review criticizing the factory-building sim because it "has muslims" (sic) and is a "woke game", with the reviewer claiming that "noone is asking for this type of stuff, in a building cozy game".</p><p>Rose filed a complaint against the review, but was then told that the flag had been "cleared by a moderator" and that he couldn't flag it again "unless the reviewer changes the review".</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>No More Robots' <em>Little Rocket Lab </em>has a problem with Steam reviewers throwing around the "woke" accusation.</figcaption>

<p>It's not just that review, either. Rose <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mikerose.bsky.social/post/3m7hr6fuv5c2l" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">points</a> to another review that accuses <em>Little Rocket Lab </em>of featuring "forced politics" and of "force-fe[eding]" the player "DEI nonsense", also pointing to a review for <em>Yes, Your Grace </em>in which the reviewer claims the second part of the game "jam[s] in...DEI crap".</p><p>There are <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198001374812/recommended/2451100/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">several</a> other <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/Privacy%20Policy%20Legal%20Accessibility%20Cookies%20Steam%20Subscriber%20Agreement%20%C2%A9%20Valve%20Corporation.%20https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198026506561/recommended/2451100/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">reviews</a> making similar complaints to the one Rose has flagged as well, with Rose lamenting that "this is where we're at now" with Steam reviews and that the rejection constitutes a confirmation that Valve believes "I don't like Muslims" is "a valid reason to leave a negative review" on a Steam game.</p><p>It's tempting to slap the libertarian label on Valve and call it a day, but recent movements by the company with regards to games on Steam would suggest that isn't the case.</p><p>Recently, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/horses-steam-ban-indie-horror" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a4a11cd5-8771-4a5c-86ba-ff196e272f59" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">indie horror game <em>Horses </em>was banned</a> from Steam and no explanation was offered to developer Santa Ragione, and it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vile-exhumed-steam-removed-sexual-content" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3d619c44-1572-4d4c-9fdf-64af4c3b37db" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">not the only horror game with controversial themes</a> to be banned from the platform in recent memory either.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Steam's moderation policies have been...curious recently, to say the least.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Much like <em>Horses</em>' ban, Valve didn't give a reason to Rose as to why the <em>Little Rocket Lab </em>review in question was considered OK to leave up.</p><p>In the meantime, though, Rose has been fighting the good fight by replying to these objectionable reviews himself, urging reviewers to look elsewhere for their gaming experiences in future.
