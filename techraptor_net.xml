            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bethesda and MachineGames have announced the&nbsp;<em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle&nbsp;</em>PS5 release date, with the legendary adventurer's latest jaunt coming to Sony's console next month.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://x.com/PlayStation/status/1904186452851994817" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the official PlayStation X account,&nbsp;<em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle&nbsp;</em>launches for PS5 on April 17th. The game is already available for PC and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

<p>We're not yet sure whether the PS5 version of <i>Great Circle&nbsp;</i>will feature any kind of DualSense haptic support, but given that the PS5 version of racer&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 5&nbsp;</em><a href="https://support.forzamotorsport.net/hc/en-us/articles/39144665637651-Forza-Horizon-5-on-PS5-FAQ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">does boast</a> some nice DualSense haptics, it wouldn't be unreasonable to expect something similar from MachineGames' latest.</p>

The first three - namely&nbsp;<em>Pentiment</em>,&nbsp;<em>Grounded</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Sea of Thieves&nbsp;</em>- were announced for PlayStation <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sea-of-thieves-grounded-and-pentiment-officially-announced-for-playstation-platforms" rel="nofollow">back in February last year</a>.</p>

<p>Following that, it was revealed that&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 5&nbsp;</em>would be coming to PlayStation, and rumors currently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-xbox-exclusive-games-coming-to-playstation/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">abound</a> that the&nbsp;<em>Gears of War&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>games could be about to get themselves PlayStation ports as well.</p>

<p>Just in case you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>, it's a first-person action-adventure game developed by&nbsp;<em>Wolfenstein: The New Order&nbsp;</em>studio MachineGames. The game casts you as (who else?) Indiana Jones, who's investigating a characteristically complex mystery involving a cat mummy.</p>

<p>As you'd expect from an&nbsp;<em>Indiana Jones&nbsp;</em>game, you'll be visiting some pretty exotic locations throughout the course of the game, including Vatican City, Thailand, and more places besides.</p>




<p>Gameplay-wise,&nbsp;<em>Great Circle&nbsp;</em>blends scrappy melee combat, stealth, and exploration, and it's spread across a series of hub levels with plenty of distractions and sidequests to pursue. If you haven't played this one yet, you're in for a treat.</p>

<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a> on April 17th, and it's also currently available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2677660/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Great_Circle/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/games/store/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/9n8fq28z6qx3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-steam-player-count<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>, the latest game in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>series of stealth action-adventure games, has launched to the franchise's highest Steam player count of all time.</p>

<p>As spotted by the folks at <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/assassins-creed/assassins-creed-shadows-sets-huge-franchise-record-with-growing-player-count-3168000/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Dexerto</a>,&nbsp;<em>Shadows</em>' peak player count on Steam <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3159330/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">hit 64,825</a> over the weekend. At time of writing, that's still the game's peak; 43,263 players are currently enjoying&nbsp;<em>Shadows</em>, which still isn't bad considering today is a Monday.</p>

<p>That figure puts&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>slightly ahead of Greek epic&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Odyssey</em>, which managed to achieve a peak player count of 62,069 around the time of its release. There's not much in it, but&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>is officially the series' biggest Steam launch.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-steam-player-count-sneaking.jpg?itok=4STrPyMk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-steam-player-count-sneaking.jpg?itok=kuspaO07 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>is officially the franchise's biggest Steam launch.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're wondering how the game stacks up against other Ubisoft releases, it still can't quite hold a candle to the publisher's biggest Steam launches ever, at least not according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/publisher/Ubisoft/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB's numbers</a>.</p>

<p>Ubisoft's biggest Steam launch ever was the crunchy melee brawler&nbsp;<em>For Honor</em>, which achieved an impressive 225,831 peak player count in August 2018. It's followed by&nbsp;<em>Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege</em>'s peak of 201,933, with&nbsp;<em>The Division</em>'s 114,228 (a very satisfying number) putting it in a comfortable third.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>can't reach those lofty heights, its success will doubtless come as a relief to Ubisoft, given that the game hasn't exactly had an easy time of it in recent months.</p>

<p>Announced last year,&nbsp;<em>Shadows&nbsp;</em>was originally set to launch in November, but was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-february" rel="nofollow">subsequently delayed to February</a> as Ubisoft announced it would rethink some of its business practices (including releasing PC games on Steam on day one in future).</p>




<p>The game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-march" rel="nofollow">then delayed again</a>, with publisher Ubisoft <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing" rel="nofollow">closing down</a> three of its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-layoffs-leamington-closure" rel="nofollow">locations</a>&nbsp;and revealing its intention to pursue <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-financials-cost-cutting-q3" rel="nofollow">further cost-cutting measures</a> after a pretty dire third-quarter performance.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen whether&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>can single-handedly turn Ubisoft's fortunes around, but the game is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3159330/Assassins_Creed_Shadows/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/assassins-creed-shadows/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/assassins-creed-shadows" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.
