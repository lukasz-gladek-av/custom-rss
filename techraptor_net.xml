            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/code-violet-pc-vulgar-mods<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>TeamKill Media, the developer of upcoming dino horror game <i>Code Violet</i>, has revealed that the game won't be coming to PC, and it's all to do with what the studio thinks modders will do with its characters.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/TeamKillMedia/status/1880780993813987541" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, the studio confirms that its game, which looks rather like a mixture of Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Dino Crisis&nbsp;</em>and EA's&nbsp;<em>Dead Space</em>, will remain a console exclusive because it doesn't want modders creating "vulgar versions of the main character" or any other characters.</p>

<p>TeamKill goes on to say it holds its "voice actresses and actors with high regard", as well as its "artistic vision for the game and story", and that modders creating "sexual mods" would make "a joke out of [the studio's] art" and possibly tarnish&nbsp;<em>Code Violet</em>'s actors' "reputation".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/code-violet-not-coming-to-pc-dino-chase.jpg?itok=kx07jV1m 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/code-violet-not-coming-to-pc-dino-chase.jpg?itok=CdJo8erV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Code Violet&nbsp;</em>isn't coming to PC anytime soon.</figcaption></figure><p>When asked whether the game will be coming to Xbox or not, TeamKill <a href="https://x.com/TeamKillMedia/status/1880816290572718525" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">says</a> it will "be exclusive to PS5", and in response to a suggestion that&nbsp;<em>Code Violet&nbsp;</em>is Sony-funded, the developer <a href="https://x.com/TeamKillMedia/status/1881075725786394847" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">clarifies</a>&nbsp;it is "100% independent" and has "no investment or support from anyone but ourselves".</p>

<p>The game apparently won't be coming to Xbox because TeamKill doesn't "have the time or expertise" to devote to creating an Xbox port, and that doing so would "need additional manpower".</p>

<p>Given <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-xbox-port-series-s" rel="nofollow">how difficult an Xbox port would apparently have been</a> for&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>, another PlayStation 5 exclusive, perhaps TeamKill is right not to commit to leaving the PS5 exclusivity den anytime soon.</p>

<p>You can take a look at the (rather enigmatic) debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Code Violet</em>&nbsp;right here.</p>




<p>Given that Capcom doesn't seem immediately interested in reviving&nbsp;<em>Dino Crisis&nbsp;</em>(and that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shinji-mikami-dino-crisis-monster-hunter-comments" rel="nofollow">original creator Shinji Mikami certainly isn't</a>),&nbsp;<em>Code Violet&nbsp;</em>might be the best you'll get on that front, so it's a bit of a shame it won't be coming to PC.</p>

<p>At any rate, the game is set to launch for <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012908" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a> sometime in July this year. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/malediction-preview-mtg-meets-warhammer.1086984/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/malediction-preview-mtg-meets-warhammer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After checking out the upcoming <i>Malediction</i> at <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/best-new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024" rel="nofollow">PAX Unplugged this winter</a>, creators of the game Loot Studios sent us home with some starter sets to check out ahead of the game’s launch on <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/projects/loot-studios/malediction" rel="nofollow">GameFound</a>. Now that we’ve played a suite of matches, we’ve got first impression thoughts!</p>

<h2><i>Malediction - What Is It?</i></h2>

<p><i>Malediction</i> is a unique blend of a few different genres of tabletop gaming. It takes the skirmish tabletop warfare of a Games Workshop <i>Warhammer</i> game like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-warcry-guide" rel="nofollow"><i>Warcry</i></a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/kill-team-brutal-and-cunning-review" rel="nofollow"><i>Kill Team</i></a> but adds a unique card draw element.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/malediction-combat-on-blood-pool.jpeg?itok=aYw14SyX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/malediction-combat-on-blood-pool.jpeg?itok=1owfaJ0o 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>When I met with the team at PAX Unplugged, their one sentence elevator pitch put it succinctly: it’s like Commander<i> </i>meets <i>Warhammer</i>. After having played a few test games of <i>Malediction</i>, I have to agree!</p>

<p>Want to try the game out for yourself? They’ve got <a href="https://malediction.gg/print-and-play/" rel="nofollow">a free print-and-play version of the game</a> ready to download now!</p>

<h2>Building A Deck And Army In <i>Malediction</i></h2>

<p>In <i>Malediction</i>, when you construct your force, you’re not just going to bring together a collection of miniatures. You’ll also be building a deck of cards centered around a leader. Choosing cards within that leader’s faction, you’ll build a deck that includes unit cards, gear, slower channel spells, and quick swift spells.</p>

<p>This is one of my favorite twists on the wargaming genre. To bring a miniature out onto the battlefield, you have to play the card from your hand and spend Echo (your mana-like resource in the game) to put it on the battlefield.</p>

<p>Spells you have in hand may let you spend Echo to heal a unit, perform an extra attack, move for free, and myriad other special abilities. In this way, you’re customizing both your forces and the ways you can upgrade or augment them.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/malediction-cards.jpeg?itok=ixzVLmPU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/malediction-cards.jpeg?itok=_kViWyu3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Gameplay Is Fast In <i>Malediction</i></h2>

<p>One of the things I liked most about my playthroughs of <i>Malediction</i> is just how quickly the game goes. We tried it with two players and as a free-for-all three person game (which the rules don’t account for so we homebrewed a little bit), and both where snappy - finishing up in less than an hour.</p>

<p>Part of this comes from what it takes to win the game. It’s a rush to a set amount of victory points - in our games we played to 25. You gain victory points equal to the cost of enemies you defeat, <i>and</i> you get points for securing powerful artifacts strewn about the board.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/malediction-combat-moment.jpeg?itok=pEjXAraD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/malediction-combat-moment.jpeg?itok=C_G-v2y1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Combat here clustered around a Husk (black-based miniature toward the back) where a powerful artifact waits to be claimed!</figcaption></figure><p>The other reason this game zips along is the way you field units. At the start of the game, you can field units from the corner of your battlefield. But after that, you can bring a unit in next to a unit of yours already on the board - no matter where they are - provided you’re not engaged with an enemy unit. This removes the slog of having to slowly advance your models across the battlefield.</p>

<h2>The Forces of <i>Malediction </i>All Feel <i>Very</i> Different</h2>

<p>We were sent home with copies of all four of the forces made for the premiere of the game - Primal Blood, Order of the Shattered Throne, Legion of the Fallen, and&nbsp; and each has its own distinct play style.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Primal Blood faction is all about aggression - they willing sacrifice both accuracy and health to gain bonuses to attack, and many of their units can make reckless charges and extra moves across the battlefield.</p>

<p>The Order of the Shattered Throne are angelic guardians, who guard each other well. Many of the figures in this faction can absorb damage intended for nearby enemies, and their spell cards involve a lot of healing and damage negation.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/malediction-soulwhisperer-by-guilherme-motta-large.jpeg?itok=16EQH8aV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/malediction-soulwhisperer-by-guilherme-motta-large.jpeg?itok=Kf2Iotr1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Soulwhisperer, a unit in the Legion of the Fallen, shows off the macabre aesthetic of the faction.

Image: Loot Studios.</figcaption></figure><p>The Legion of the Fallen are comprised of the walking dead (or nearly dead) in many iterations, and focus on damage through swarming enemies with low cost minions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally, there’s the Conclave of the Spheres faction, who dabble most heavily in magic and are willing to sacrifice their minions to achieve their goals.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/malediction-units-and-cards.jpeg?itok=nUKm8hV5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/malediction-units-and-cards.jpeg?itok=erqUXfd7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Units from the Order of the Shattered Throne (Gold bases) and Primal Blood (Red Base) with their unit cards.</figcaption></figure><p>It’s easiest, perhaps, to think of these four factions as colors on the <i>Magic: The Gathering </i>wheel. Primal Blood is like Red cards with their aggression, Order of the Shattered Throne, with its life gain and defense, is like White cards. Legion of the Fallen, full of undead and devastatingly deadly, is like Black MTG cards. And Conclave of the Spheres, with its mana-manipulation and spell-focused trickery, is very MTG Blue.</p>

<h2>STL Files in <i>Malediction</i></h2>

<p>In closing, one of the more interesting aspects to this skirmish wargame is the fact that the box itself contains no plastic miniatures. Instead, you’ll receive cardboard standees (as pictured throughout) to represent your models and the terrain. But when you crowdfund the game, you’ll receive the STL files to print their gorgeous 3D minis.</p>

<p>If you don’t have a 3D printer of your own, they have a list of recommended 3D print-on-demand vendors they’ll recommend.</p>

<p>All in all, this is one of the more unique approaches to tabletop wargaming I’ve played in a long time. You’ll need some table space - but no more than a normal wargame would expect from you - and there are elements here that are direct references to other games (you “exhaust” or tap your models’ cards once they’ve activated, you can cast spells ala <i>MTG</i> with sorcery or instants), but the culmination of how <i>Malediction </i>brings it all together is pretty incredible.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Infinity Nikki Version 1.2 Release Date Revealed for This Week]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/infinity-nikki-version-12-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/infinity-nikki-version-1-2-release-date-revealed-for-this-week.1086981/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/infinity-nikki-version-12-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Infold Games has revealed the release date for&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>Version 1.2, which will bring new outfits, new activities and minigames, and much more later this week.</p>

<p>The official release date for Version 1.2 is January 23rd, which means that&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>will have to compete with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-developer-direct-january-2025-announced" rel="nofollow">the upcoming Xbox Developer Direct</a> for your time. I'm sure you've already figured out which of the two you'll be checking out come Thursday, though.</p>

<p>Following on from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/infinity-nikki-version-1-1" rel="nofollow">excitement of Version 1.1</a>, Version 1.2 - also known as "Firework Season" - will introduce the Firework Isles. There, you'll find the "stunning" Songbreeze Highland, the "serene" Crescent Shoal, and the "lively" Camp Kaboom.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/infinity-nikki-version-1.2-firework-season.jpg?itok=Ea-HO4LH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/infinity-nikki-version-1.2-firework-season.jpg?itok=jFuFqwuF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Infinity Nikki</em>'s next update brings new areas, new activities, and, of course, beautiful fireworks.</figcaption></figure><p>New story content will take Nikki and Momo to the Firework Isles in order to prepare for an event called the Carnival of Fireworks. Of course, complications quickly arise, and before long, Nikki and Momo will be facing off against a new boss known as The Dark Bouquet.</p>

<p>The new update will also bring "an array of dazzling new outfits", just as you'd expect from an&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>update, as well as new activities and minigames.</p>

<p>You'll get the chance to enjoy the New Bloom Festival, which will bring a "festive celebration full of music, lanterns, and even firecrackers". What's more, you can participate in a range of events to win rewards including free pulls, Diamonds, and "two exclusive outfits".</p>

<p>If you've been clamoring to listen to&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki</em>'s music, then you'll be pleased to know the game's soundtrack will soon launch on "all major music platforms" and will include tracks like "Find My Way" and "Nikki Nikki", as well as many other pieces.</p>




<p><em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>is the latest game in the&nbsp;<em>Nikki&nbsp;</em>series. It's a cozy open-world adventure that emphasizes platforming, minigames, and collecting outfits over traditional combat (although it does have that too, albeit in its own rather quirky way).</p>

<p>Released in December, the free-to-play game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/infinity-nikki-downloads-10m" rel="nofollow">quickly notched up 10 million downloads</a>, and according to a press release, it's now passed the 20 million mark as well. Impressive stuff!</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://infinitynikki.infoldgames.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices</a>. Version 1.2 launches on January 23rd, and Firework Season runs until February 25th.</p>
