            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Krafton has announced&nbsp;<em>PUBG: Black Budget</em>, a brand new extraction shooter that can add its name to the growing list of titles that want to knock&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov</em>'s crown off a head increasingly plastered with bullseyes.</p>

<p>The publisher says that&nbsp;<em>Black Budget&nbsp;</em>is "designed as an FPP-first experience" (i.e. first-person perspective), so if you're used to playing&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>in third person, there may be some adjustment required to get used to this one.</p>

<p>You'll play as a Contractor who's sent to an island "trapped in a time loop" and "consumed by a supernatural phenomenon known as the Anomaly", so&nbsp;<em>PUBG: Black Budget&nbsp;</em>has a decidedly supernatural bent to it, it seems.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pubg-black-budget-gameplay.jpg?itok=KqJjxsBU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pubg-black-budget-gameplay.jpg?itok=c0yKAqDn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>PUBG: Black Budget&nbsp;</em>is a supernatural extraction shooter where things get real weird.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Black Budget</em>'s core gameplay loop involves searching the island for artifacts to extract, all while contending with both hostile threats in your environment and other players determined to extract the same artifacts as you.</p>

<p>Sessions will last "up to 30 minutes", according to Krafton, and will feature "level- and squad-based matchmaking for up to 3-player squads and 45 players per session", so it sounds as though duos may be supported on launch. Take note,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/arc-raiders-cosmetics-duos" rel="nofollow"><em>Arc Raiders</em></a>.</p>

<p>Since it's a&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>game, you probably won't be surprised to learn that&nbsp;<em>Black Budget</em>'s map will gradually shrink as play progresses, which Krafton says will help to create "tense and unpredictable scenarios every loop".</p>

<p>While you're not searching the island for artifacts, you'll expand your base, craft equipment for yourself, and improve "skills and proficiencies". The difficulty of the game will also scale depending on your level and the time you've spent inside each loop.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has revealed the release date for the next major&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>update, and it's set to bring a new Archon Quest, new characters, and more early next month.</p>

<p>Following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-luna-ii" rel="nofollow">last month's Version Luna II</a>, the aptly-named&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version Luna III, otherwise known as "A Nocturne of the Far North", will see the region of Nod-Krai preparing for its Moon-Prayer Night festival.</p>

<p>During the course of said event, you'll meet with some unexpected guests and team up with some old allies to investigate the appearance of strange new phantoms that are threatening to tear Nod-Krai's borders asunder.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/genshin-impact-version-luna-iii-archon-quest.jpg?itok=dbcn-GMe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/genshin-impact-version-luna-iii-archon-quest.jpg?itok=sUucz6hV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version Luna III is coming in December.</figcaption></figure><p>As usual, it wouldn't be a&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>update without new characters to play as, and so you can expect two in Version Luna III.</p>

<p>The first is Durin, a 5-star Pyro sword user who can either play the role of a support or a damage dealer. As a support, he can lower the elemental resistance of enemies and deal AoE damage, while as a damage dealer, he's a single-target monster.</p>

<p>A new 4-star bow user by the name of Jahoda is also joining the roster for this latest update, and she can heal her team while also absorbing elemental attacks to deal corresponding damage to enemies. This cycle's reruns are Venti, Varesa, and Xilonen.</p>

<p>Version Luna III will also introduce a new Hexerei mechanic, whereby some characters will be enhanced with new abilities and Constellation effects through becoming Hexerei versions of themselves. Having multiple Hexerei characters in your party allows you to boost your party's battle prowess as well.</p>




<p>As ever, a new&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>also brings with it brand new bonuses for you, and here are this update cycle's goodies. Remember, you've got until November 24th to redeem them!</p>

<ul><li>1203Kuunrukous - 100 Primogems, 10 Mystic Enhancement Ore</li>
	<li>Dragon1203Durin - 100 Primogems, 5 Hero's Wit</li>
	<li>GOGOCraftspeople - 100 Primogems, 50,000 Mora</li>
</ul><p><em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version Luna III will be available on December 3rd. You can check the game out for free right now on PC, PlayStation (although it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-ps4-support-ending" rel="nofollow">losing PS4 support next year</a>), and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
