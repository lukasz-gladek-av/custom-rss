            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shotgun-cop-man-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Devolver Digital and developer DeadToast Entertainment have announced the release date for shoot-'em-up&nbsp;<em>Shotgun Cop Man</em>, in which you must descend into hell in order to arrest Satan himself.</p>

<p>Announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shotgun-cop-man-my-friend-pedro-creator" rel="nofollow">in February</a>,&nbsp;<em>Shotgun Cop Man&nbsp;</em>is the next game from DeadToast, whose name you might recognize from the similarly irreverent shooter&nbsp;<em>My Friend Pedro&nbsp;</em>(although this one doesn't feature any talking bananas, to the best of my knowledge).</p>

<p>It's launching on May 1st, also known as May Day in Europe, which feels particularly appropriate given the frantic nature of your mission. The game will be landing on Switch and PC, and while there's no word of a Switch 2 release, I'm not sure this one would benefit from the new machine's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-specs-revealed" rel="nofollow">beefier specs</a> anyway.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shotgun-cop-man-release-date-shooting.jpg?itok=Wx1t8aGX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shotgun-cop-man-release-date-shooting.jpg?itok=K2JJIdKt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Shotgun Cop Man&nbsp;</em>is coming to a PC or Switch near you in May.</figcaption></figure><p>In&nbsp;<em>Shotgun Cop Man</em>, you play as the titular law enforcement officer, and it's your job to enter hell in order to arrest Satan. As you can probably imagine, he's none too pleased about the intrusion, so you must battle your way through the hordes of the underworld to reach him.</p>

<p>DeadToast says you'll be armed with "a devastating arsenal and a relentless thirst for glory" in the pursuit of said goal; not only will you have access to a range of weapons (including the titular shotgun), but you'll also use them to propel yourself through&nbsp;<em>Shotgun Cop Man</em>'s world.</p>

<p>The game will feature a handcrafted campaign with more than 150 levels to take on, but once you're done with that, you can also try out user-generated levels or perhaps even make your own.</p>

<p>Various challenges are also available if you want to step up your&nbsp;<em>Shotgun Cop Man&nbsp;</em>experience a notch, including No Damage runs, Speedrun parameters, and Kill All stipulations.</p>




<p><em>Shotgun Cop Man&nbsp;</em>is coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2966850/Shotgun_Cop_Man/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and Nintendo Switch on May 1st.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-roadmap-q2-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stalker-2-roadmap-for-q2-2025-promises-a-life-updates-and-more.1163775/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-roadmap-q2-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GSC Game World has released a brand new&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>roadmap that covers the second quarter of the year, and it promises more fixes to the game's A-Life system, plus lots of other new features and tweaks.</p>

<p>A-Life, which is the name GSC Game World gives to the system that governs its NPCs' ambient behavior, has been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-a-life-20-gsc-game-world" rel="nofollow">the subject of some controversy</a> since&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>'s launch, with numerous <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-update-1-1-a-life" rel="nofollow">updates</a> attempting to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-update-12" rel="nofollow">address</a> some of its most critical issues.</p>

<p>That hasn't changed in the new roadmap, which promises "A-Life/AI updates" in Q2. These updates consist of "persistent" improvements to the system, as well as "smarter human combat", mutants eating corpses, and more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stalker-2-roadmap-q2-2025-pointing.jpg?itok=zc-NJulR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stalker-2-roadmap-q2-2025-pointing.jpg?itok=PZ3yqgs2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>is getting some big changes throughout the rest of the quarter.</figcaption></figure><p>It's not all about A-Life, though. The new&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>is also promising the release of a beta modding SDK (software development kit), allowing you to make your own&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>mods. A closed beta will also be held with mod makers to test out the feature.</p>

<p>Also on the list are features like mutant loot, the ability to skip the game's shader compilation, and an increase to the player's stash window, as well as two new weapons. Naturally, this all sits alongside "further stabilization, optimization, and 'anomalies' fixing" (i.e. bugs).</p>

<p>The next-gen update to the&nbsp;<em>Stalker: Legends of the Zone&nbsp;</em>trilogy, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-roadmap-legends-of-zone-next-gen-2025" rel="nofollow">promised for 2025 back in December</a>, is also scheduled for this quarter, although it may well get delayed again.</p>

<p>GSC Game World says this roadmap, which is the first of a new three-monthly cycle, will help&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>to "become the game we imagined - and you deserve".</p>




<p>In case you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>, it's the long-awaited sequel to the cult classic 2007 FPS&nbsp;<em>Stalker: Shadow of Chernobyl&nbsp;</em>(which still maintains the old Russian spelling of the town's name, unlike <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl" rel="nofollow">the sequel</a>).</p>

<p>Like the first game,&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>has you exploring the Chornobyl nuclear exclusion zone (albeit a heavily fictionalized version of same), seeking out anomalies and artifacts while also grappling with disparate factions.</p>

<p><em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/stalker-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. You can read our very own Robert's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/stalker-2-review" rel="nofollow">review of the game here</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[PS5 Prices Rising in Certain Regions Due to "Challenging Economic Environment"]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-prices-rising-europe-uk-australia-new-zealand</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ps5-prices-rising-in-certain-regions-due-to-challenging-economic-environment.1163715/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-prices-rising-europe-uk-australia-new-zealand<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has announced that it's raising the prices of the PS5 in certain regions, although the price of the accompanying disc drive accessory is actually going down.</p>

<p>In a PlayStation <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/13/ps5-price-to-rise-in-europe-australia-and-new-zealand/?sf276959904=1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a>, Sony says that because of a "challenging economic environment" which involves "high inflation and fluctuating exchange rates", the PlayStation 5's price will be increasing in Europe, the UK, Australia, and New Zealand.</p>

<p>Happily (or perhaps not if this is the model you're thinking of buying), the PS5 Digital Edition is the only model affected in Europe and the UK, although both models are getting a price increase in Australia and New Zealand, unfortunately.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ps5-price-rises-consoles.jpg?itok=Xhcr_JYv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ps5-price-rises-consoles.jpg?itok=hPGVbS8F 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The PS5 is getting a price hike in some areas.</figcaption></figure><p>Although the PS5 itself is getting a price hike, the PS5 Disc Drive's RRP will be decreasing in all four of the previously-mentioned areas. These price changes kick in today.</p>

<h3>Europe</h3>

<ul><li>PS5 Digital Edition:&nbsp;€499.99</li>
	<li>PS5 Standard Edition: no change</li>
	<li>PS5 Disc Drive:&nbsp;€79.99</li>
</ul><h3>UK</h3>

<ul><li>PS5 Digital Edition: £429.99</li>
	<li>PS5 Standard Edition: no change</li>
	<li>PS5 Disc Drive: £69.99</li>
</ul><h3>Australia</h3>

<ul><li>PS5 Digital Edition:&nbsp;AUD $749.95</li>
	<li>PS5 Standard Edition:&nbsp;AUD $829.95</li>
	<li>PS5 Disc Drive:&nbsp;AUD $124.95</li>
</ul><h3>New Zealand</h3>

<ul><li>PS5 Digital Edition:&nbsp;NZD $859.95</li>
	<li>PS5 Standard Edition:&nbsp;NZD $949.95</li>
	<li>PS5 Disc Drive: NZD $139.95</li>
</ul><p>As you'd probably expect given its price is already pretty high, the PS5 Pro's price isn't going anywhere, at least for now. These price increases are strictly for the base PS5 models (well, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-slim-officially-announced-coming-this-holiday-season" rel="nofollow">newer slim models</a>, at any rate).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ps5-price-rises-pro.jpg?itok=FNgXJ0dR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ps5-price-rises-pro.jpg?itok=RcaptrO5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The PS5 Pro won't be subject to the new price hikes.</figcaption></figure><p>This isn't the first time in the last couple of years that Sony has hiked PS5 prices. Back in October 2023, the company upped the cost of its console's Digital Edition by $50 alongside the announcement of the slimmer redesign.</p>

<p>Sony's PS5 price hikes also come at a time when the price of consoles is a hot topic, largely thanks to two things: the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">announcement of the Nintendo Switch 2</a> and its $449.99 price tag, and President Donald Trump's sweeping economic tariffs, which appear to be in constant flux at time of writing.</p>

<p>At any rate, if you want to buy a PS5 (and not a PS5 Pro) in the aforementioned regions, the new price hikes go into effect today. Bear that in mind before you go shopping!</p>
