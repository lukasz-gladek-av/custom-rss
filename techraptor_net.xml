            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-version-20-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has revealed the release date for&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 2.0, which the developer says will mark the "grand beginning" of the gacha action RPG's second season.</p>

<p>Following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-version-17-release-date" rel="nofollow">April's Version 1.7</a>, Version 2.0 will arrive on June 6th across all platforms on which&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>is available. It'll bring a new area to explore, new characters to add to your lineup, and more, just as you'd expect from a HoYoverse update.</p>

<p>First up, you'll be embarking on "an exhilarating new journey" that will take you to the Waifei Peninsula, a "remote yet vibrant district of New Eridu". There, you'll discover new exploration gameplay mechanics, "further uncover the hidden secrets of Phaethon", and more.</p>

<p>She's joined by fellow S-rank Agent Ju Fufu, a Yunkui Summit disciple who deals Physical and Fire damage and boosts her squad's critical damage with her Tiger's Roar buff.</p>

<p>Finally, rounding out the playable character roster for Version 2.0 is the A-rank Physical Defense Agent Pan Yinhu, a "kitchen-savvy panda" who brings some serious attitude to your team. S-rank Bangboo Belion will also be added to the game in this update.</p>

<p>They'll join Astra Yao and Caesar, two S-rank Agents who are getting reruns as part of&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero</em>'s Version 2.0 banners. Not only that, but since this update marks the game's first anniversary, you'll be able to "choose one S-rank Agent and one S-rank W-Engine from the Stable Channel for free".</p>




<p>Of course, this update also introduces plenty of quality-of-life improvements like a new 3D map for navigation, new beacons that allow you to revive characters and restore HP, and other optimizations.</p>

<p><em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 2.0 launches across <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices</a> on June 6th.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[An Elden Ring Movie Is in the Works for Some Reason]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-movie<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco and FromSoftware's runaway smash hit&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>is getting a movie adaptation, and a celebrated sci-fi director and writer is attached to the project already.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/05/elden-ring-alex-garland-directing-a24-movie-1236408999/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Deadline</a>, the&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>movie will be produced by indie studio A24, which is also responsible for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-movie-a24" rel="nofollow">upcoming&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>movie adaptation</a>, although adapting&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>is arguably going to be significantly more of a challenge than Kojima's already-fairly-cinematic game.</p>

<p>Helming the project is Alex Garland, the creative force behind movies like&nbsp;<em>Annihilation</em>,&nbsp;<em>Ex Machina</em>, and his most recent movie&nbsp;<em>Warfare</em>, an on-the-ground depiction of the Iraq war. He's also on writing duties.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-movie-erdtree.jpg?itok=qHpVIosd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-movie-erdtree.jpg?itok=CqPD1w-W 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>is getting a movie adaptation, because money is really, really appealing, I guess.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>co-writer George R.R. Martin will serve as a producer on the movie, but Deadline makes no mention of either FromSoftware or Hidetaka Miyazaki, which could suggest they're not involved in the project.</p>

<p>Naturally, movies are a very different business to games, but it's still a little troubling that&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s chief creative force doesn't appear to be a part of the movie. I suppose he's busy with next year's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-duskbloods-fromsoftware-nintendo-switch-2" rel="nofollow">Switch 2 exclusive&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods</em></a>.</p>

<p>I can only speak for myself here, but an&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>movie seems like a pretty bad idea right from the outset. FromSoftware's open-world masterpiece is, after all, a game that tells its story in a fragmented, non-linear fashion, and it's hard to see how that's going to work in a two-hour ultra-linear movie.</p>

<p>Garland isn't necessarily the worst choice to helm&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>; he's got form when it comes to intelligent fantasy and sci-fi, after all. Still, I can't shake the feeling that&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>is unfilmable, and that A24 and Garland have made rods for their own backs here.</p>




<p>We're likely a couple of years away from the&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>movie at the very least, but for now, if you want more&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>shenanigans, you can content yourself with upcoming multiplayer spinoff&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nighreign-release-date" rel="nofollow">due to arrive next week</a>.</p>
