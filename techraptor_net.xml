            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-hardcore-mode-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Warhorse Studios has released a new update for&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>, and if you've been waiting for the immersive medieval RPG to up its difficulty a few (hundred) notches, this one's for you.</p>

<p>Patch 1.2.4's biggest addition is Hardcore Mode, which was promised as part of the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-roadmap" rel="nofollow">post-launch roadmap back in January</a>. As the name suggests, this isn't one for the faint of heart, so be sure you know what you're in for before you fire it up.</p>

<p>Hardcore Mode removes a number of gameplay elements to which you may have become accustomed, like your character's position appearing on the map, compass directions, and the ability to fast travel. It really is that brutal.</p>

Sorry, friend. We don't know what that is."</figcaption></figure><p>As if that wasn't enough, you'll also have to choose at least three negative perks that will weigh you down for the rest of your playthrough. These include "Sweaty", which "increases your personal pungency", and "Numbskull", which slows your XP gain. Yikes.</p>

<p>You can read a little more about Hardcore Mode <a href="https://kingdomcomerpg.com/en/news/hardcore-mode" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>, but suffice it to say this definitely isn't one for you if you prefer a more leisurely stroll through Bohemia. You'll have to get, well, sweaty if you want to succeed.</p>

<p>If you're not interested in Hardcore Mode, don't worry; there's still plenty for you to enjoy as part of this update. Other changes include rebalanced herb prices in shops, as well as a new bald hairstyle (or lack of, I suppose) for Henry.</p>

<p>The full patch notes for&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>Patch 1.2.4 are available <a href="https://kingdomcomerpg.com/en/news/patch-notes-1-2-4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">via Warhorse's official website</a> if you want to know everything that's new. It's not a long list, so don't worry!</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>, it's an open-world RPG set in 15th-century Bohemia, and like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/kingdom-come-deliverance" rel="nofollow">its predecessor</a>, it places an emphasis on realism over fantasy elements like magic or monsters.</p>

<p>The game was a hit for Warhorse and parent company Embracer Group, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-2m-two-weeks" rel="nofollow">racking up two million sales</a> within its first two weeks.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-frostpunk-game-2027-11-bit-studios<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Frostpunk&nbsp;</em>developer 11 bit studios has announced that a new game in the series is on the way, although you're going to have to wait a fair while for it, unfortunately.</p>

<p>The new&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk&nbsp;</em>game was revealed as part of 11 bit's <a href="https://ir.11bitstudios.com/en/news/11-bit-studios-boldly-invests-in-new-titles/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">financial statement</a> for the 2024-25 fiscal year, in which CEO&nbsp;Przemysław Marszał says "production on the next project set in the <em>Frostpunk</em> universe" has begun. The company is currently aiming to launch the game in 2027.</p>

<p>11 bit CEO&nbsp;Przemysław Marszał says the decision is part of his studio's response to a shifting market, with 11 bit looking to "diversify both the scale of projects and the time [it devotes] to each of them".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/11-bit-studios-new-frostpunk-game-frostpunk-2.jpg?itok=vmuZrUji 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/11-bit-studios-new-frostpunk-game-frostpunk-2.jpg?itok=2NTHoh5i 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>11 bit studios has revealed that a new&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk&nbsp;</em>game is set for 2027.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, Marszał stopped short of explaining exactly what the new&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk&nbsp;</em>game is, so we don't yet know whether he's referring to a potential&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 3&nbsp;</em>or simply to a new spinoff game set in the same world as the city-builders.</p>

<p>We do, however, know that 11 bit is also working on "a slightly larger title", which the company expects to launch in 2029. It's also not clear whether that will be a <em>Frostpunk&nbsp;</em>game as well, but we're still a good few years away from that one, so don't expect to hear any more about it for a while.</p>

<p>The news comes as 11 bit reports an operating loss of around $750,000 for 2024, despite a 168.9% sales increase marking "the highest sales in the Company’s history".</p>

<p>Marszał points to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/11-bit-studios-layoffs-project-8" rel="nofollow">cancellation of&nbsp;<em>Project 8&nbsp;</em>earlier this year</a> as one of the reasons for 11 bit's loss, as well as losses made on 2024 titles&nbsp;<em>Creatures of Ava&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Thaumaturge</em>.</p>

<p>Additionally, 11 bit's publishing department will release&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/moonlighter-2-announced-2025" rel="nofollow"><em>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault</em></a>, a sequel to the 2018 shop management sim-come-dungeon crawler, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-howl-soulslike-deckbuilder-11-bit" rel="nofollow">"Soulslike deck builder"&nbsp;<em>Death Howl</em></a>.</p>
