            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rumbleverse-and-killer-instct-studio-iron-galaxy-suffers-layoffs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Another day, another set of layoffs it seems. Iron Galaxy layoffs are the latest to strike the industry as the studio responsible for a lot of porting work, co-development, and the creation of the free-to-play game <em>Rumbleverse</em> and fighting game <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/killer-instinct-anniversary-edition-coming-years-after-latest-update-with-patch-notes" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Killer Instinct Anniversary Edition Released Years After Latest Update">Killer Instinct</a> </em>has let go of over 60 people.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://www.irongalaxystudios.com/blog-posts/an-update-on-our-staff" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="AN UPDATE ON OUR STAFF">announcement on their site</a>, they mention the state of the industry which has <a href="https://techraptor.net/topic/layoffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Video Game Layoffs">seen many layoffs</a>, many studio closures, and a lot of games fail to perform, including <em>Rumbleverse</em>. This follows the layoffs yesterday at <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sumo-group-layoffs-refocus" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Sumo Group Announces Layoffs Amid Refocus on Support and Work for Hire">Sumo Group</a> who were a similar type of studio that had focused on co-development and services, before expanding to do more their own work. Through the last two years they had managed to keep their team together, but they no longer have the room to continue without cutting some of their staff, after having taken many steps over the past few years.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Today, Iron Galaxy is parting ways with some of our developers and support staff. In total, we have reduced our employee base by 66 people. This was a means of last resort for us. It’s a measure we do not take lightly to enable our long-term survival.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Iron Galaxy has four studios, and the contraction comes after they had spent the years growing in the lead-up to <em>Rumbleverse</em> as they attempted to build doing original projects on top of their co-development, and porting work. During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, they <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/orlando/inno/stories/news/2021/07/23/video-game-studio-iron-galaxy-hires-100-it-s-sti.html?ana=e_or_ae&amp;j=24538920&amp;senddate=2021-07-23" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Video-Game Studio Iron Galaxy Hires 100-Plus, It's Still Growing">hired 100 people</a>, which took them near 300 people in the studio, thus this represents likely somewhere between 20 and 25% of the headcount among employees.</p>

<p>Beyond their work on <em>Killer Instinct</em> and <em>Rumbleverse</em>, many ports for PC and Switch bear the marks of Iron Galaxy's work. Titles like <em>The Last of Us Part 1</em> on PC were ported by them, and they helped Blizzard bring games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/overwatch" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Overwatch"><em>Overwatch</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/how-diablo-3-found-itself-journey-through-hell-and-madness" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/how-diablo-3-found-itself-journey-through-hell-and-madness"><em>Diablo </em><em>3</em> </a>to Nintendo Switch. Other titles that they have done some work on include <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/spyro-reignited-trilogy" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Spyro Reignited Trilogy"><em>Spyro Reignited Trilogy</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/crash-bandicoot-n-sane-trilogy" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy"><em>Crash Bandicoot N-Sane Trilogy</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Skyrim"><em>Skyrim</em></a>, and <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/uncharted-legacy-of-thieves-next-gen-difference" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection - The Next-Gen Difference">Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves</a></em>.</p>

<p>In the note, the studio concludes by saying,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At this moment, our focus is on our teammates who have begun a journey toward their next role. We thank them for working with us. We’ll be doing everything we can to support them in the search for the next phase of their careers. Keep an eye out for them if you need good people. We are sorry to see them go.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We wish everyone impacted by layoffs over the past few years the best, and our hearts go out to all the people impacted by the Iron Galaxy layoffs. Here's hoping you find the perfect job for you just around the corner.</p>

There are no new products, but a new way for players can obtain and enjoy the miniatures of the officially licensed skirmish game. The entire game's range will be available to 3D print.</p>

<h2>The <em>Elder Scrolls: Call to Arms</em> 3D Print Announcement</h2>

<p>In an official press release, Modiphius announced that the complete range of Elder Scrolls: Call to Arms will be available as digital 3D print-at-home and print-on-demand releases.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-elder-scrolls-call-to-arms-dragon-priest.jpg?itok=T01LgYcr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-elder-scrolls-call-to-arms-dragon-priest.jpg?itok=uGgxiBQ_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The first four Chapters of the game will be re-released as pre-supported STL print-at-home sets. Buy the set, feed them into your (or a friend's) 3D printer, and create as many miniatures as needed for your game.</p>

<p>For those who want print-on-demand for <em>Elder Scrolls: Call to Arms</em>, that will happen as part of a FronTier campaign on MyMiniFactory. The first campaign will go live on March 5, 2025. This will cover the first Chapter of the game alongside existing add-ons of existing core sets and terrain. Another campaign will follow six months afterwards covering the next chapter.</p>

<p>Those who sign up early for this campaign will receive an extra: An STL file of a Dragon Priest miniature at no additional cost. You can even take part in a painting contest. Whoever has the best-painted priest will receive Modiphius vouchers for <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/fallout-tv-show-miniatures-announced-by-modiphius-entertainment" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Fallout</em> </a>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/modiphius-announces-elder-scrolls-call-to-arms-dawnguard-sets" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Elder Scrolls</em></a>-related minis, a 3D printer, and two Thin Coats paints.</p>

<p>For those concerned this means the end of active support, Modiphius isn't done with this game yet. All prior releases, including the recent Two-Player Starter Set, are still going to retail stores. This includes Chapter 5 of the game and the recent Tales of Tamriel rules, which introduced settlement building and warband progression.</p>

<p>In addition, the game's core rulebook has been updated with streamlined rules and updated errata. The updated core rulebook is available for free in print and PDF format.</p>
