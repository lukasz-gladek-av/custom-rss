            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sunless-sea-director-travelling-at-night<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Sunless Sea&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Cultist Simulator&nbsp;</em>designer Alexis Kennedy has announced&nbsp;<em>Travelling At Night</em>, which he describes as a "dialogue-driven choices-matter combat-free CRPG" that's not a million miles away from the likes of&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://weatherfactory.biz/announcing-travelling-at-night/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an announcement post</a> on his studio Weather Factory's official website, Kennedy says that while he's been "making narrative games for fifteen years", he's "never made a traditional isometric CRPG", likening doing so to a composer "hav[ing] a go at opera".</p>

<p>Rather tantalizingly, Kennedy says he was once contracted as a narrative consultant on a "really promising and heavily NDA'd RPG for a developer [he admires] and on a franchise [he likes]". Of course, he doesn't name what that RPG is, but he does say its cancellation made him regret not working within the genre.</p>

<p>He says that while he and his partner Lottie Bevan considered using the word "discolike" to describe their game, they didn't want players thinking they were pursuing&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>'s "distinctive nihilistic funny sex'n'drugs'n'disco vibe".</p>

<p>However, Kennedy and Bevan did incur a "creative debt" to&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Travelling At Night&nbsp;</em>is aiming to find the same "audience for something CRPG-esque with really unorthodox creative choices".</p>

<p>As such, while Weather Factory isn't <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-disco-elysium-devs-new-studios-spiritual-successors" rel="nofollow">one of a number of studios</a> currently operating out of the ashes of&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>developer ZA/UM (including <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/game-development/for-a-while-it-seemed-like-miracles-were-possible-and-with-them-redemption-a-follow-up-to-the-legendary-disco-elysium-might-have-been-ready-to-play-within-the-next-yearzaums-devs-loved-it-management-canceled-it-and-laid-off-the-team/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ZA/UM itself</a>), you can consider&nbsp;<em>Travelling At Night&nbsp;</em>another contender for the&nbsp;<em>Disco&nbsp;</em>crown.</p>

<p>He describes the game's art direction as "determinedly non-realistic" while still being "plausibly CRPG", and confirms that&nbsp;<em>Travelling At Night&nbsp;</em>won't have an "intentionally inchoate player-cipher" character, but instead a defined protagonist by the name of Spencer Hobson.</p>
