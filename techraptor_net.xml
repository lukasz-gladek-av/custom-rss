            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Stories about artificial intelligence aren’t a new phenomenon, but they’re increasingly relevant in relation to the real world.<em> D-topia</em>, a new game in development by Marumittu Games and published by Annapurna Interactive, looks to bridge their own take on an AI world with a gentle-paced puzzle adventure.</p>

<p>In <em>D-topia</em>, you take on the role of a Facilitator, whose job is to keep the residents of D-topia happy and the facility running as it should, as part of a project known as Utopia. We had a chance to check out a short demo that introduces us to this world, as well as what to expect in terms of puzzle-solving and the adventure aspect.</p>

<p>The demo opens with the newly minted character, known in the world as No. 046. From the jump, we can see that the world of <em>D-topia</em> is very clean and minimalistic – certainly by design.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dtopia_screenshot1.jpg?itok=14o19O1J 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dtopia_screenshot1.jpg?itok=x85epFdx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>No. 046 begins his journey by waking in his newly minted home. It’s an apartment of sorts that can be explored and used as a place for easy-going life-sim moments. For example, food is provided, so it’s appropriate to eat. No. 046 can check today’s weather and then prepare to leave by washing up.</p>

<p>Once that’s done, it’s time for No. 046 to fulfill their role as the newest Facilitator, so it’s off to the factory. On the way, he can talk to the numerous bystanders scattered around, who have plenty of positive things to say about D-topia.</p>

<p>The work component involves solving a series of puzzles, and the ones in the demo seemed straightforward enough. Most of them involve moving numbered blocks to their marked endpoints. For example, blocks marked 1 and 2 need to be dragged to the 1 and 2 labeled on the field.</p>

<p>These puzzles do get more complex as No. 046 completes each one – some involve passing through a barrier that increases the number, or some involve having to move a block to keep down barriers and figure out how the correct blocks need to move across the board.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dtopia_screenshot2.jpg?itok=RNvrF7wj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dtopia_screenshot2.jpg?itok=J3qTAwI7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>There’s a little trial and error involved, but the puzzles in <em>D-topia</em> – at least those in the demo – seemed easy enough and not particularly stressful. Solving each puzzle earns points, which then turns into the currency earned for the day.</p>

<p>After work, No. 046 is afforded some leisure time, so it’s worth exploring around D-topia. He runs into a curious character named Eebie, who drops his a memory card and skates away. No. 046 can choose to pursue him and learn a little more about them.</p>

<p>During this encounter, there’s a bit of a disturbance, and No. 046 is able to enter a nearby shop to see what’s going on. As the Facilitator, he learns from the shop manager that there’s a malfunctioning robot that needs attention, and can be investigated by interacting with a panel that triggers the Block Side.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dtopia_screenshot3.jpg?itok=WeO1vUzb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dtopia_screenshot3.jpg?itok=KpYAkjQI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In <em>D-topia</em>, the Block Side seems to be a darker place – one hidden from the eyes of the public, but it allows No. 046 to see underneath and fix problems in the game world.</p>

<p>By completing this particular task, he earns some plants that can be decorated in his room. The demo wraps up here, but not without some mysterious dialogue that suggests No. 046 is going off-key, that he needs to be investigated.</p>

<p>So while time with <em>D-topia</em> was short, it was just enough to get a taste of what this AI-based world is all about and how small decisions move the adventure forward. With its cute art style and soothing music similar to Annapurna's own <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/stray-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Stray</em></a>, it’s easy to see <em>D-topia</em> as the type of game to relax and vibe with when it comes out in 2026.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[People of Note Preview - Give Life Back to Music]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/people-of-note-preview-give-life-back-to-music</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/people-of-note-preview-give-life-back-to-music.1328563/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Turn-based RPGs seem to be all the rage these days, what with games like <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-french-revolution" rel="nofollow">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> </em>lighting up the zeitgeist. <em>People of Note</em> is another such game looking to enter the scene, although it’s not out until next year, it already looks like a creative twist on the classic genre.</p>

<p>That creativity comes in the form of music, and not just as something that exists in the background. <em>People of Note</em> incorporates the very soul of music into the way it’s played. This, of course, means that not only is music ongoing, but in battle it becomes important as different styles and rhythm-based mechanics take up a lot of the action.</p>

<p>In the demo, we’re thrown right into the midst of the story, which sees the main character, Cadence – an up-and-coming popstar from the city of Chordia – put together her dream of making it to the top of the Noteworthy Song Contest and the music charts. Although she was met with resistance, she travels to the rock city of Durandis to try something unheard of: combining her own pop music with the sounds of classic rock.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/20251016182357_1.jpg?itok=ie_rKsGM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/20251016182357_1.jpg?itok=anAkSyF- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Right away, this concept is introduced as Cadence and her group get pulled into their first turn-based battle. Here, each turn is known as a stanza, and on that stanza, the top number indicates how many actions – including basic attacks and abilities – characters can take per turn. The number on the bottom indicates how many actions the enemy can then take per stanza.</p>

<p><em>People of Note</em> evolves this even further with the addition of a style gauge. Each stanza takes on different styles, and if a bandmate’s style is active, many of their abilities will gain a power boost. There’s a certain amount of ebb and flow here as the battle system opens up, and keeping track of BP is important as it's spent and gained each turn.</p>

<p>The rhythm game aspect comes into play every time a party character takes an action, and it’s fairly straightforward. Similar to something like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/hi-fi-rush-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Hi-Fi Rush</em></a>, simply tap a button every time the incoming circle lines up, and it’ll score your effort accordingly. The better the score, the more efficient the damage.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/20251016182229_1.jpg?itok=ydHC3XWO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/20251016182229_1.jpg?itok=uo-G2pLo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Outside of battle, <em>People of Note</em> includes a puzzle-adventure aspect that is required to get through sections of the level. These, from what was shown in the demo, involve basic ideas such as positioning mirrored lasers to open a door. There’s not a lot of direction, but with some trial and error, these puzzles aren’t too challenging. It’s easy to see how they can become tedious after a while, though, so hopefully it’s mixed up more in the full game.</p>

<p>The other element is the story itself, which is told in cutaways with 2D-sketchy artwork. The art style in general has a pleasant, painterly feel to it, with plenty of colors to go around. The music in <em>People of Note</em> is also noteworthy, of course. It seems like it’s ever-present in a way that helps flesh out the world.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/20251016180545_1.jpg?itok=8b_LUyun 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/20251016180545_1.jpg?itok=ieQUsd4z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Time with the demo was brief, but the beginnings of the mechanics were all there, and it’s clear that <em>People of Note</em> is going to be one to watch out for going into 2026. The intricacies of the battle system help it stand out from the usual turn-based outings, and it feels like the demo is only scratching that surface.</p>

<p>For now though, it remains to be seen just how much deeper the gameplay in <em>People of Note</em> is willing to go. Hopefully, it’s quite a bit because the potential is certainly there for all to see.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Recently emerging from brooding in their fortresses, the Helsmiths of Hashut, the Chaos Duardin, have decided to take back by force what's rightfully theirs, leaving destruction in their wake.&nbsp; In this article, we check out the new wave of&nbsp;<em>Age of Sigmar</em> releases for the spiritual cousins of <em>Warhammer's</em> Chaos Dwarfs, the Helsmiths of Hashut.</p>

<p>We've been covering <i>Age of Sigmar </i>for a while on the site, and you can check out our review of the <em>Age of Sigmar</em> 4th Edition launch box <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-skaventide-review-perfect-starter-set" rel="nofollow">here</a>, as well as our review of the first Helsmith's release, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/age-of-sigmar-helsmiths-of-hashut-army-set-review-let-fire-duardin-of-war" rel="nofollow">Helsmiths of Hashu Army Set</a>. You can read our getting started with the <em>AoS</em> Spearhead style of gaming <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/how-to-get-started-with-age-of-sigmar-4th-edition-with-spearhead" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>




<h2>Thick Beards, Horns, And Tusks</h2>

<p>Following the release of the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/age-of-sigmar-helsmiths-of-hashut-army-set-review-let-fire-duardin-of-war" rel="nofollow">Helsmiths of Hashu Army Set</a>, which acted as an introduction to the faction (and included their Spearhead force and Battletome), they now get their full release of units to flesh out the rest of their army.</p>

<p>The Helsmiths playstyle focuses on a small number of durable and powerful units, in close combat and at range, and also uses demonic power points that can be placed on specific key units to make them more powerful. Like their noble Duardin cousins, the Helsmiths are also slow, and even as durable as they are, initial positioning during deployment and early movement choices are crucial to capturing objectives and countering key opposing units.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/age-of-sigmar-helsmiths-of-hashut-army-units-2.jpg?itok=FEOSQlVu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/age-of-sigmar-helsmiths-of-hashut-army-units-2.jpg?itok=xq2gXWPQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Urak Taar The First Daemonsmith</h2>

<p>Urak Taar is an absolute beast, as would be expected of someone titled The First Daemonsmith. It is said that he trained directly under the Helsmith's god, Hashut himself. Urak Taar's miniature towers over the rest of the range, even the hulking Dominator Engines that came in the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/age-of-sigmar-helsmiths-of-hashut-army-set-review-let-fire-duardin-of-war" rel="nofollow">Helsmiths of Hashu Army Set</a>.</p>

<p>On the tabletop, Urak Taar is the only other Helsmith who can keep up with the Bull Centaur's movement of 10, which is great for getting them into combat, which you absolutely want to do. While Urak has a ranged attack with 6 attacks, each doing D3 damage (which can also shoot in combat), Urak and the massive Infernal Taurus, Ghorrakos that he rides, excel in close combat, where Urak has 4 attacks, each dealing D3 damage, and Ghorrakos has 6 attacks dealing 4 wounds each on the charge.</p>

<p>Urak also has a once-per-turn ability that deals D3 mortal wounds to an enemy unit if they charged that turn, and they can also move 2D6 inches after combat, but must end their move in combat, allowing them to skip over a unit into combat with another unit behind. Along with having bonuses to having demonic power points themselves (we discussed DPP in our&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/age-of-sigmar-helsmiths-of-hashut-army-set-review-let-fire-duardin-of-war" rel="nofollow">Helsmiths of Hashu Army Set</a>&nbsp;review), during the enemy hero phase, they can also reallocate 3 DPP between any units within 18 inches, allowing you to switch from units with offensive DPP bonuses to those with defensive DPP bonuses for your opponent's turn.</p>

<p>The Urak Taar miniature can also be built as a standard Daemonsmith on Infernal Taurus, but with Urak Taar's devastating attacks and abilities, the choice is always The First Daemonsmith.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/age-of-sigmar-helsmiths-of-hashut-army-units-3.jpg?itok=qf9NbijT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/age-of-sigmar-helsmiths-of-hashut-army-units-3.jpg?itok=bRBWlsk0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>War Despot</h2>

<p>The War Despot is the same miniature from the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/age-of-sigmar-helsmiths-of-hashut-army-set-review-let-fire-duardin-of-war" rel="nofollow">Helsmiths of Hashu Army Set</a>, but using them outside of the Spearhead gives them a slightly different profile. They're not mounted, so move at the same rate as the Helsmiths' infantry units. They boost the control scores of nearby infantry units, so you don't want them to drift to far from them anyway, but with each DPP, the range of the ability is boosted by 6 inches.</p>

<p>The War Despot also has the ability to make a friendly infantry unit within their fight range, fight immediately after them, boosting their attacks by 1 for the rest of the turn. For their own attacks, the Despot has a Daemonflame Glavie, with 5 attacks, each at damage 2.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/age-of-sigmar-helsmiths-of-hashut-army-units-4.jpg?itok=tzxpG6dF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/age-of-sigmar-helsmiths-of-hashut-army-units-4.jpg?itok=WDv_bSRS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Bull Centaurs</h2>

<p>I'd already spotted the Bull Centaurs as one of my favorite Helsmiths' units when reviewing the Army Set, and the miniatures don't disappoint, delivering everything you want in a Helsmiths unit, including all the beards, all the horns, and all the tusks. The box can be built as either 3 Bull Centaurs or 3 Anointed Sentinels.</p>

<p>Both the Centaurs and the Sentinels have a move of 10, giving the Helsmiths a much-needed fast unit ahead of the sturdy advance of their infantry, but the Bull Centaurs are much better offensively, with an extra attack and the ability to deal mortal wounds after they charge with their Bull Charge ability. Both the Centaurs and Sentinels add 1 to charge rolls for each DPP they have, so unless you need to save the points (Sentinels are slightly cheaper than the Centaurs), then you're always going to pick Centaurs (despite the golden bull head helmets looking super cool).</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/age-of-sigmar-helsmiths-of-hashut-army-units-5.jpg?itok=ZyXMUR-p 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/age-of-sigmar-helsmiths-of-hashut-army-units-5.jpg?itok=8spxW_RT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Infernal Razers</h2>

<p>Another of our favorite units are the Infernal Razers, who come in two distinct flavors. Armed with Flamehurlers or Blunderbusses, the flamehurlers have a shorter range, but more attacks, and the blunderbusses have a slightly longer range, but are easier to wound and deal 2 damage each. They both have the ability to gain rend for each DPP they have, and the flamehurlers can lower the control score of a targeted unit, while the blunderbusses can give a targeted unit strike-last by rolling a 6+, adding in the number of models slain by that unit to the roll.</p>

<p>Their box comes with 5 miniatures that can be built as either, depending on what role you want them to fill. They both look incredibly thematic, but the blunderbusses look awesome with their demon-possessed weaponry ready to unleash havoc.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/age-of-sigmar-helsmiths-of-hashut-army-units-6.jpg?itok=iSM5WJln 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/age-of-sigmar-helsmiths-of-hashut-army-units-6.jpg?itok=-oNpBmnY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Hobgrot Vandalz</h2>

<p>The final unit we're going to look at in this article are the Hobgrot Vandalz. The Hobgrots' entire existence is to get in the way of your opponent's units, and they do that with a slightly higher movement than the rest of the Hashut infantry and the ability to take a normal move during the deployment phase to screen ahead of your main force.</p>

<p>The Helsmiths' disdain for the Hobgrots means that all their abilities and the demonic power points don't apply to the Hobgrot (most specify non-Hobgrot), but that allows you to just throw them into combat, for which they have 2 attacks. Their box allows you to build 20 Hobgrot Vanalz, including a champion, musician and standard bearer.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/age-of-sigmar-helsmiths-of-hashut-army-units-7.jpg?itok=WSGxZkyq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/age-of-sigmar-helsmiths-of-hashut-army-units-7.jpg?itok=MkDeghxK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Age of Sigmar Helsmiths of Hashut Army Units Final Thoughts?</h2>

<p>I absolutely love the Helsmiths of Hashut theme and the aesthetics of their miniature range. Urak Taar offers an incredible centerpiece, and the clean standardization of the range, infantry, cavalry, artillery, and chaff to screen the core units makes them easy to get into. As previously mentioned, their slow movement can mean that poor positioning and movement phase choices don't make them a forgiving force, but they are durable, and when in doubt, fire with the artillery and smash into targets with Urak and the Bull Centaurs.</p>
