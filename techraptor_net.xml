            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Kickstarter campaign for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/doom-arena-board-game-will-rip-and-tear-until-it-is-done" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Doom Arena Board Game</em></a> is live. Publisher Modiphius is using the power of crowdfunding to bring two distinct board game adaptations of the iconic shooter franchise to gaming tables inspired by its two distinct eras.</p>

<h2>The <em>Doom Arena Board Game</em> Kickstarter Campaign</h2>

<p>As the official <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/modiphius/doom-arena-board-game/description" rel="nofollow">campaign page</a> states, the <em>Doom Arena Board Game</em> aims to bring the carnage and fast-paced strategic combat of the Doom series into a tabletop experience. To that end, the game is an asymmetrical experience. One player controls Doom Guy; the other one controls the Hordes of Hell.</p>

Whenever someone deals damage to the opponent, they generate Blood and Tempo. Tempo is used for certain powerful abilities. Between each round, players can spend Arsenal Points to either summon stronger demons or get stronger weapons. Whoever spills the most Blood after round 3 wins.</p>

<p>The Kickstarter campaign includes two versions of the game. <em>Doom (1993) Arena Board Game</em> is based on the original PC release that started it all. This version will include stylized miniatures of classic <em>Doom</em> enemies, the Doom Guy, and old-school maps. The second one, <em>Doom: The Dark Ages Arena Board Game</em>, is based on the most <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/doom-dark-ages" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">recent release</a>, complete with its dark medieval fantasy aesthetic.</p>

<p>Notably, the campaign includes some variation with the game's pieces. If you're frugal, there's a version of the game with acrylic standees. But if you want to pay extra, you can buy unpainted miniatures for either game. This includes Kickstarter-exclusive versions of both the Doom Guy and Doom Slayer miniatures.</p>

<p>There are several stretch goals and add-ons promoted as well. These include alternate miniature sculpts, Demon Reinforcement packs that add new enemies to the game, themed dice trays, and expansions that add new enemies and allies like the Arch Vile and the mecha dragon Serrat.</p>

<p>The different pledge tiers for the <em>Doom Arena Board Game</em> are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><em>Standard Edition for $61:</em> Your choice of the standee version of either Doom (1993) or Doom: The Dark Ages board game</li>
	<li><em>Premium Edition for $81:</em> Your choice of the miniatures version of either Doom (1993) or Doom: The Dark Ages board game</li>
	<li><em>Both Premium Editions and Reinforcements for $254:</em> Miniature versions of both games and both Demon Reinforcements add-ons</li>
	<li><em>All-In&nbsp;for $441:</em> Everything in&nbsp;Both Premium Editions and Reinforcements tier, all expansions, and two themed dice trays</li>
</ul><p>At the time of writing, the <em>Doom Arena Board Game</em> Kickstarter has raised&nbsp;<span><span>$92,162, which is short of its initial funding goal of&nbsp;</span></span><span><span><span>$133,559. The campaign ends on November 21 and the game is expected to ship to backers on October, 2026.</span></span></span></p>
