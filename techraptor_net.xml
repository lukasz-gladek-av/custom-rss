Here's everything that was announced during the show!</p>

<hr><h2><em>Lumines Arise&nbsp;</em>is an all-new puzzler coming later this year</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lumines-arise-playstation-state-of-play-june-2025.jpg?itok=eUWLMrvS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lumines-arise-playstation-state-of-play-june-2025.jpg?itok=QCnw9ywE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A new&nbsp;<em>Lumines&nbsp;</em>game is on the way.</figcaption></figure><p>First up, we got a look at a new puzzle game in the&nbsp;<em>Lumines&nbsp;</em>series, which is coming to PS5 later this year (and also to PlayStation VR2, if that matters to ya). It'll pack in 30 stages across a number of new backdrops, plus more of the music you know and love.</p>

<h2>Hey, Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Pragmata&nbsp;</em>isn't dead</h2>




<p>Capcom stepped up next to reveal a new trailer for sci-fi adventure&nbsp;<em>Pragmata</em>, which has been missing in action <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pragmata-thrusts-you-into-strange-new-earth" rel="nofollow">for quite some time</a>, prompting some to believe it was dead. Turns out it isn't, and its rather unique-looking gameplay has you controlling two characters at once. This one launches in 2026.</p>

<h2><em>Romeo Is a Dead Man&nbsp;</em>looks very, very Suda51</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/romeo-is-a-dead-man-playstation-state-of-play-2025.jpg?itok=8X6Wdx6h 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/romeo-is-a-dead-man-playstation-state-of-play-2025.jpg?itok=BvHNR3P1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Romeo Is a Dead Man&nbsp;</em>is a characteristically Suda51 game.</figcaption></figure><p>Grasshopper Manufacture's&nbsp;<em>Romeo Is a Dead Man&nbsp;</em>was next on the slate, and it looks like exactly what you'd expect from a Grasshopper game. It's an action title with exactly the kind of over-the-top aesthetic you've come to love from the studio and its founder, and it's coming next year.</p>

<h2><em>Silent Hill f&nbsp;</em>launches on September 25th</h2>

<p>Konami revealed the release date for its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-f-officially-revealed-konami" rel="nofollow">upcoming psychological horror game</a>&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f</em>, which will be launching on September 25th. That release date holds true not only for PS5, but also for PC and Xbox, so don't worry if you're not a PS5 owner.</p>

<h2>A new&nbsp;<em>Bloodstained&nbsp;</em>game is coming</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bloodstained-the-scarlet-engagement-playstation-state-of-play-june-2025.jpg?itok=oyZ4HlOj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bloodstained-the-scarlet-engagement-playstation-state-of-play-june-2025.jpg?itok=0EFdev1f 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Bloodstained: The Scarlet Engagement&nbsp;</em>returns to the Metroidvania stylings of&nbsp;<em>Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Next, a brand new game in the&nbsp;<em>Bloodstained&nbsp;</em>series,&nbsp;<em>Bloodstained: The Scarlet Engagement</em>, was announced for 2026, and unlike the old-school&nbsp;<em>Curse of the Moon&nbsp;</em>spinoff series, this one's a true blue Metroidvania. You'll be switching between two characters,&nbsp;<em>Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin</em>-style, to explore a new castle.</p>

<h2><em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger&nbsp;</em>gets a release date</h2>

<p>If you've been excited to check out the next game in the&nbsp;<em>Digimon Story&nbsp;</em>series, you're in luck.&nbsp;<em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger&nbsp;</em>launches on October 3rd, and we got some more info about its story, characters, and customization elements as well.</p>

<h2><em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles&nbsp;</em>revives a strategy classic</h2>




<p>In a similar vein to 2022's&nbsp;<em>Tactics Ogre: Reborn</em>, a remastered version of&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy Tactics&nbsp;</em>was announced during the State of Play June 2025 show. It'll boast improved visuals, quality-of-life improvements, and fully voiced dialogue when it launches on September 30th.</p>

<h2>Release date sizzle reel</h2>

<p>Next, we got release dates for some games that have already been revealed. Here's a list of the new release dates we got!</p>

<ul><li><em>Baby Steps&nbsp;</em>(<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/baby-steps-bennett-foddy" rel="nofollow">from Bennett Foddy and Devolver Digital</a>): September 8th</li>
	<li><em>Hirogami&nbsp;</em>(origami platformer from Bandai Namco): September 3rd</li>
	<li><em>Everybody's Golf Hot Shots&nbsp;</em>(golfing sim from Bandai Namco): September 5th</li>
	<li><em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound&nbsp;</em>(action-packed 2D platformer): July 31st</li>
	<li><em>Cairn&nbsp;</em>(climbing game from the&nbsp;<em>Haven&nbsp;</em>devs): November 5th</li>
</ul><h2><em>Mortal Kombat Legacy Kollection&nbsp;</em>brings retro fighting thrills this year</h2>

<p>Next up, Digital Eclipse revealed&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat Legacy Kollection</em>, a package containing (or perhaps that should be "kontaining") many old-school&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat&nbsp;</em>games. Eight have been announced so far, and more reveals are on the way before release later this year.</p>

<h2>Project Defiant is a wireless fight stick made by Sony</h2>

<p>If you're into your fighting game peripherals, you may want to take a look at Project Defiant, a wireless fight stick created by Sony. It's got the signature PS5 look to it, but built into a classic fighting peripheral design. This one is coming next year.</p>

<h2><em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater&nbsp;</em>shows off its boss battles</h2>

<p>Boss battles have always been the cornerstones of a&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear&nbsp;</em>game, and&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater&nbsp;</em>is no exception. Konami's upcoming remake looks like it'll faithfully recreate Snake's battles against the Cobra Unit when it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-release-date-leak-playstation" rel="nofollow">arrives in August</a>.</p>

<h2><i>Nioh 3&nbsp;</i>announced for next year, limited-time demo available now</h2>




<p>That's right: there's going to be a new&nbsp;<em>Nioh&nbsp;</em>game, and what's more, you can try it out right now.&nbsp;<em>Nioh 3&nbsp;</em>is coming to PS5 next year, offering a choice between two distinct combat styles. A limited-time demo can be downloaded right now on the PlayStation Store.</p>

<h2><em>Thief&nbsp;</em>is back...in VR form</h2>

<p>Next was perhaps one of the cruelest teases of the entire State of Play show. The venerable&nbsp;<em>Thief&nbsp;</em>franchise is back, but&nbsp;<em>Thief VR: Legacy of Shadow&nbsp;</em>is, as you've probably come to realize, a VR-exclusive game. It comes to PS VR2 later this year.</p>

<h2><em>Tides of Tomorrow&nbsp;</em>is a colorful-looking adventure from the&nbsp;<em>Road 96</em>&nbsp;devs</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tides-of-tomorrow-playstation-state-of-play-june-2025.jpg?itok=SziQv_NQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tides-of-tomorrow-playstation-state-of-play-june-2025.jpg?itok=5OSFFtmj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Tides of Tomorrow&nbsp;</em>is an asynchronous multiplayer game from&nbsp;<em>Road 96&nbsp;</em>developer DigixArt.</figcaption></figure><p>DigixArt, the studio behind&nbsp;<em>Road 96</em>, appeared next to show off&nbsp;<em>Tides of Tomorrow</em>, its colorful adventure with an "intriguing asynchronous multiplayer" element that shows you not only your choices, but a previous player's choices as well. It's coming in February.</p>

<h2><em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>is getting new challenge levels</h2>

<p>Team Asobi head Nicolas Doucet took to the virtual stage next to reveal that beloved platformer&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>is getting five new challenge levels later this month, and you'll be able to rescue new PlayStation-inspired bots as well.</p>

<h2><em>Sea of Remnants&nbsp;</em>is a new pirate RPG coming next year</h2>




<p>If, like many, Ubisoft's&nbsp;<em>Skull and Bones&nbsp;</em>didn't do anything to quell your desire for pirate adventure,&nbsp;<em>Sea of Remnants&nbsp;</em>could well do the trick. It's a stylized puppetry-inspired pirate RPG coming sometime next year.</p>

<h2><em>Sword of the Sea&nbsp;</em>is the&nbsp;<em>Journey&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Pathless&nbsp;</em>artist's next adventure</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sword-of-the-sea-playstation-state-of-play-june-2025.jpg?itok=bDWQyvox 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sword-of-the-sea-playstation-state-of-play-june-2025.jpg?itok=R73wxomm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll never guess who's behind this one.</figcaption></figure><p>The first few seconds of the trailer for&nbsp;<em>Sword of the Sea&nbsp;</em>pretty much gave away who was behind it. This one comes from Matt Nava, the artist behind&nbsp;<em>Journey&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Abzu</em>, and it's coming on August 19th, with a day one PS Plus Extra release lined up.</p>

<h2>More games are heading to PS Plus</h2>

<p>As well as&nbsp;<em>Sword of the Sea</em>, Sony also revealed during the showcase that the PS2 version of classic immersive sim&nbsp;<em>Deus Ex</em>, as well as racers&nbsp;<em>Twisted Metal 3&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>4</em>, are coming to the Classics Catalog in June and July. Not only that, but&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>3</em>, as well as&nbsp;<em>Myst&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Riven</em>, are also coming to the service.</p>

<h2>IO Interactive shows off a little bit of&nbsp;<em>007 First Light</em></h2>

<p>Next, it was IO Interactive's turn to show off <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/io-interactive-007-first-light" rel="nofollow">upcoming&nbsp;<em>James Bond&nbsp;</em>adventure&nbsp;<em>007 First Light</em></a>, and it looks...well, like a&nbsp;<em>James Bond&nbsp;</em>game, shockingly enough. This one's coming next year, and we'll get more info about it in the coming days.</p>

<h2><em>Ghost of Yotei&nbsp;</em>is getting a gameplay deep dive in July</h2>

<p>A very brief clip of&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yotei&nbsp;</em>was shown next, and Sony says a gameplay "deep dive" is coming in July, so we'll get to learn more about the game then. This one is launching in October, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ghost-of-yotei-release-date" rel="nofollow">as previously revealed</a>.</p>

<h2><em>Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls&nbsp;</em>is an anime-inspired fighter coming next year</h2>




<p>Finally, we got a reveal trailer for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls</em>, a gorgeous-looking anime fighter from&nbsp;<em>Guilty Gear&nbsp;</em>developer Arc System Works. The game will feature Marvel mainstays like Captain America, Spider-Man, and Storm, and it's coming next year.</p>

<hr><p>That's everything we got to see during this year's Sony State of Play show! Hopefully, we'll be learning more about some of these rather exciting-looking games in the coming months.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Who Is Van Chapman And What Is Epic Level 6? Cloudward, Ho! Interview With Siobhan Thompson]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/who-is-van-chapman-and-what-is-epic-level-6-cloudward-ho-interview-with-siobhan</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/who-is-van-chapman-and-what-is-epic-level-6-cloudward-ho-interview-with-siobhan-thompson.1207791/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/who-is-van-chapman-and-what-is-epic-level-6-cloudward-ho-interview-with-siobhan<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dimension 20</em> is heading out on another adventure, and this time they're taking it to the skies. <em>Cloudward, Ho</em> tells the story of a group of adventurers reuniting to search for the mythical land of Zood. Van Chapman is the bosun on this adventure, making sure that everything is ship-shape. I got to catch up with <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b6ff64e2-0570-485e-860b-402771d3faf6" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/we-chat-dimension-20-burrows-end-generational-trauma-and-environmental" rel="nofollow">Siobhan Thompson</a> ahead of the premier to learn more about Chapman's motives, what the inspiration was for Chapman's very 'milennial' restaurant, and how <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3579fb91-ffa9-4c99-a750-de9f92ba642f" href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow"><em>D&amp;D</em></a> is getting a new twist for <em>Cloudward, Ho!</em></p>



<p>To begin, I wanted to know what inspired this competent character and her retirement from the life of adventuring.</p>

<p>"Van Chapman is a retired ship bosun and now she is running a very greyscale, small plates-large plates, gastropub with her very tiny husband." Thompson began.</p>

<p>Where we first meet Champan, though Thompson wanted to be clear, "she's done with adventure, she doesn't need to go back, she's living a vey happy retirement."</p>
<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed//P0B-JHNnH28"></iframe></p>

<p>The cast of <em>Cloudward, Ho!</em> is filled with the other members of the Intrepid Heroes; Lou Wilson, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="07cb71f8-cd27-491b-a25d-4583267bfba1" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/ally-beardsley-talks-fantasy-high-junior-year-and-how-kristen-has-changed-between" rel="nofollow">Ally Beardsley</a>, Brian 'Murph' Murphy, Emily Axford, and Zac Oyama not to miss <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="55a80c6c-ea7c-4151-9523-d332db6f6cd5" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/how-brennan-lee-mulligan-created-never-stop-blowing-up-love-letter-to-80s" rel="nofollow">Brennan Lee Mulligan</a>, the DM.</p>

<p>For the player, I was also interested in learning what it was that Thompson found most important in a character introduction. What notes she always wanted to hit when coming into a new game.</p>

<p>She was able to describe it quite succinctly as "give a physical description, even though we have art, there's something about the linguistic description that's helpful. I always try to give a description of how they're feeling in this moment."</p>

<h2>Getting The Band Back Together? I'm In</h2>

<p>As the party is getting pulled back together over the course of episode one, in a mix of <em>Oceans Eleven</em> meets <em>Atlantis: The Lost Empire</em> style recruiting, we learn how each member is integral to the crew. Whether it's Maxwell Gotch (played by Murph) as the wallet bankrolling the trip, Marya Junkova (played by Emily Axford) as the engineer, or Olethra MacLeod (played by Ally Beardsley) as the new member with a key piece of information to draw everyone together.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cloudward-ho-full-party-artwork.jpg?itok=_NSY1QSJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cloudward-ho-full-party-artwork.jpg?itok=nOLtG7eK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Knowing that each member of the Intrepid Heroes had an important role to play in the crew it was interesting to hear how each player and character fell into place.</p>

<p>"We all came in with a bunch of different ideas, for me the Bosun was so fun because it's that you're not the Captain, but you're the one telling everyone what to do," Thompson explained "and it was fun to come in with a character whose big defining trait is loyalty."</p>

<p>"She's a good soldier and in the real, true sense of the word, if there was an order that she recieved that she thought was stupid she would push back on it but she also knows that her job is to make things happen for other people"</p>

<p>I questioned Chapman's drive saying "I know you're playing a fighter, but it almost sounds like you have a Paladin oath."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is very philosophically where she is. She is a pirate to her bones. She comes from this long line of adventurers and she's very… she's not even proud of it, it's just so utterly defining of her"</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cloudward-ho-sky-ship-miniature.jpg?itok=IySS7Pl0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cloudward-ho-sky-ship-miniature.jpg?itok=KdPDz4l0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>The Rusty Nut Is Milennial Incarnate</h2>

<p>A key part of Chapman where we pick up with her is in the description of the Rusty Nut, the gastropub that she runs with her husband. With "Milennial Grey" walls, and rustic lights all at head height there was a very clear idea in her mind when creating this setting.</p>

<p>"It was [based on a specific location], unfortunately there are so many of these places. I also have to give credit to my friend Bea Roberts who I asked 'What are good pub names?' and we just sent pub names back and forth and she came up with Rusty Nut"</p>

<p>"I feel like calling it Milennial Grey is so unfair because none of us painted it that color it's just the houses we've ended up living in and none of us can afford to buy anything"</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Some are born Milennial, some achieve Milennialdome, and some have MIlennialship thrust upon them"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thompson also added that with her own experience working in the restaurant industry she "also loves making fun of the way that the service industry works. It was a fun little side game for me"</p>

<h2><em>Cloudward, Ho!</em> Uses Old <em>D&amp;D</em> Rule: Epic Level 6</h2>

<p>As each character is introduced and we're provided their stats I couldn't help but notice that there's a currently empty field labeled Epic Epiphanies. Thompson revealed that for this season of <em>Dimension 20,</em> the characters wouldn't be leveling up, but would instead use a remixed version of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 3rd Edition</em>'s Epic Level 6 ruling.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cloudward-ho-van-chapman-character-sheet.jpg?itok=Aw0NjvDv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cloudward-ho-van-chapman-character-sheet.jpg?itok=ZKGwqbO2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>"Instead of leveling up you take a feat everytime that you would level up. It gives you a much more 'adventure genre' set of stats"</p>

<p>Thompson explained it by comparing <em>Cloudward, Ho! </em>to classic adventure titles like <em>Indiana Jones</em>. "Indiana Jones is very smart, and strong, and quick but if a giant Nazi is going to come and punch him he'll die and he's very aware of that and whatever his 'in-universe' health stats are"</p>

<p>This shift from leveling to Epic Level 6 allows for the adventure for <em>Cloudward, Ho!</em> to continue to develop mechanically without fear of the characters reaching the kinds of god-like powers that are seen in higher levels of <em>D&amp;D</em> play.</p>

<p>Thompson also highlighted that on top of keeping the game tense this approach to leveling also really promoted players getting deep into the different feats available to characters.</p>

<p>The first episode of <em>Cloudward, Ho! </em>is available right now to watch on <a href="https://www.dropout.tv/browse" rel="nofollow">Dropout.</a></p>
