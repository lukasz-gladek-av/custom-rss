  </picture><h2>Third Place - Hollow Knight: Silksong</h2><p>Developer: Team Cherry | Release Date: September 4th, 2025</p><p>Written by Andrew Otton</p><p><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> is a hard game. It demands precision, and mere millimeters can mean the difference between success and failure. Because of that, the visual language of the game is paramount. Thankfully, <em>Silksong </em>is great at showing you exactly what you need to see in an absolutely gorgeous way.</p><p>The linework is impeccable, the silhouettes of the enemies and bosses unique and varied, and the animations are crisp and clean. Every enemy is choreographed wonderfully and fits the world of bugs incredibly well.</p><p>And it's not just the technical level that <em>Silksong </em>excels, either. There are beautiful vistas, backgrounds, and amazingly detailed environments in every place you get to explore. It's a gorgeous game in its own right that marries its style perfectly with the technical needs of the intense platforming and combat.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Second Place - Hades II</h2><p>Developer: Supergiant Games | Release Date: September 25th, 2025</p><p>Written by Andrew Otton</p><p>It feels like any time a new game from Supergiant Games releases, it will end up somewhere on that year's list of beautiful games, if not just outright winning it. That was true with the first <em>Hades</em>, which won not only <a href="https://techraptor.net/blog/2020-techraptor-awards-best-visual-design-award" rel="nofollow">best visual design in our 2020 awards</a> but our overall <a href="https://techraptor.net/blog/2020-techraptor-awards-game-of-year" rel="nofollow">Game of the Year</a> as well.</p><p><em>Hades II</em> just shows Supergiant Games at the top of their game. Ever since <em>Bastion </em>they've shown a high degree of skill in creating amazing art, animations, and a cohesive visual language that perfectly fits their games. <em>Hades II</em> continues that, with just an incredibly high level of polish.</p><p>Every new area full of enemies is gorgeous, full of incredible detail, and the enemies themselves fit its weird underworld aesthetic perfectly. Character portraits in dialogue are delightful, the amazing effects on-screen dazzling, and the vistas you're treated to now and then truly beautiful to look at.</p><p><em>Hades II</em> is a clear sign that Supergiant has mastered their craft and approach to visual design.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Winner - Ghost of Yotei</h2><p>Developer: Sucker Punch Productions | Release Date: October 2nd, 2025</p><p>Written by Austin Suther</p><p><em>Ghost of Yotei </em>is the most beautiful game I’ve ever played, bar none. Before that, I might’ve said <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>, but Sucker Punch Productions just one-upped itself with <em>Yotei</em>.</p><p>At first glance, <em>Ghost of Yotei </em>is a realistic rendition of the Hokkaido region of Japan. What this title does different from other high fidelity, ultra-realistic games is there’s an exaggerated beauty to <em>Ghost of Yotei</em>’s world. The colors are lively and the landscape is meticulously crafted so that just about every frame looks like its own painting. The leaves in the air or the ash falling from the sky create an atmosphere few games can match.</p><p><em>Ghost of Yotei</em> is an exceptionally detailed game. Give the photo mode a try and zoom in on parts of the environment to see the various wildlife up close, or even get right up in the face of Atsu and see the ever-present Mount Yotei reflected in her eyes.</p><p>Be sure to stop by one of many Sumi-e Painting locations and craft your own little work of art by flicking your finger across the Duelsense touchpad. Atsu is quite an artist herself, see, and so you can see her admiration of the beautiful lands of Hokkaido in these paintings, which she proudly hangs on the wall of her dilapidated family home.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has officially revealed new information on their latest <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> set. The release of Lorwyn Eclipsed will contain new cards for fans to enjoy, new prebuilt decks, and some sly marketing courtesy of the Jim Henson Workshop.</p><h2>The <em>Magic: The Gathering Lorwyn Eclipsed</em> Announcements</h2><p>In an official <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/feature/collecting-lorwyn-eclipsed" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>, Wizards of the Coast showcased the card and products included in the <em>Lorwyn Eclipsed</em> set. Like most major set releases, it will contain Play Boosters, Collector Boosters, Draft boxes, and Prerelease boxes. The set will also include several prebuilt decks. These include two 60-card theme decks designed for Standard format, and two 100-card Commander decks.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The post showcases the artwork on the new cards. As the name suggests, this new set returns to the land of Lorwyn, a place separated by day and night by the twilight god Isilu. As such, shock land cards like Blood Crypts and Steam Vents will be reversible with Day and Night versions. In addition, certain Legendary Creatures and Planeswalker cards transform, such as Oko and Eridu. further representing the dichotomy.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>This comparison to fairytale worlds is made more overt by some coy marketing on Wizard's part. In addition to a debut trailer, the studio released a three-minute promo video, titled <em>The Ballad of Squen and Cragg</em>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCQ5EF69rSQ" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">on YouTube</a>. The video is a musical number centered on two characters, Squen from the sunny Lorwyn, and Cragg from the dark Shadowmoor, all brought to life through Jim Henson Muppets.</p><p>Additional posts confirm that Lorwyn Eclipsed will include borderless and art variants of certain cards. The big draw is a serialized, double rainbow foil, borderless version of Bitterbloom Bearer, brought to life by artist Rebecca Guay. Only 500 copies will be printed, so happy hunting.&nbsp;</p><picture>

  </picture><p>Second are Special Guest cards. These are reprints of older cards from previous Lorwyn sets, presented with a new woodcut artstyle. Among these returning cards is one with a nasty history in Legacy format: <em>Painter's Servant</em>.</p><p>Prerelease events for Lorwyn Eclipsed will begin January 16-22. The set will then debut in <em>Magic: The Gathering Arena</em> on January 20. The set officially releases on January 23.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
