Australian designer Steve Dee, who was a pillar of the community thanks to his outspoken social advocacy, has passed away.</p><h2>The Passing of Steve Dee</h2><p>According to a social media post <a href="https://www.facebook.com/622121166/posts/10162318714106167" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">on Facebook</a>, the body of Steve Dee was found by his romantic partner, Hilary Kincaid, on Friday January, 2nd. The post states the cause of death was not determined, but he did not suffer. At the time of writing, an official cause of death has not been disclosed.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>Steve Dee, also known as Steve Darlington, had a considerable impact on the tabletop industry. His work credits include officially licensed work like <em>Doctor Who Adventures in Time and Space</em>, <em>Vampire: The Requiem</em>, and multiple editions of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-fantasy-roleplay-4th-edition-review" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay</em></a> system.&nbsp;</p><p>Dee also published several board games under his own imprint, Tin Star Games. He has won several Ennies for a few of these published titles, including 2023's card-based heist game <em>The Score</em>, 2021's co-op improvised story game, <em>Partners</em>, the mystery TTRPG <em>Relics</em>, and the 2019 detective game <em>There's Been a Murder</em>.</p><p>But above all, Steve Dee was a vocal member of the community. In an in-depth post by <a href="https://www.rascal.news/steve-dee-game-designer-tin-star-games-obituary/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Rascal News</a>, many tabletop developers spoke up about Dee's passion for the medium and his active advocacy. Indie Game Developer Network's own James Kerr highlighted one of Dee's blogs on the network discussing the importance of worldbuilding. A blog so successful it became a book, titled <em>Worldbuilding for Game Designers</em>.</p><p>But Dee's biggest platform was on his personal blog, Just Do Something. This blog was an account of Dee educating himself on the atrocities happening in Gaza and discussing the use of genocide as a system of control. The ultimate goal of the blog was to encourage others to speak out and, well, do something, in light of horrible events.&nbsp;</p><p>The last post on the blog was a rough draft for a resource management and accrual game called NAKBA. A game where the goal is prevent genocide before it begins. Dee was designing the game as part of the <a href="https://www.games4palestine.it/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">games4palestine</a> initiative.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I'm probably condemning myself to the Oubliette of Hot Takes with this statement (it's a real place and it's a nightmare), but for me, 2025 was a pretty weak year in terms of video games.</p><p>"How can you say that?" you explode. "This is the year of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-5m-update" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a11aa258-e2c1-48df-ac44-95f3a37e9c4a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">our lord and savior</a> <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>! Surely it is the single greatest year in the history of interactive media, and thus are you branded a heretic for your divergence from scripture."</p><p>Reader, <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 </em>left me not just cold, but frozen thanks to its ending, and while I'm sure I just didn't understand it because it was actually very clever and well-constructed, I have no interest in revisiting the game to confirm or deny that.</p><p>Thankfully, I managed to find five other games to keep me warm during that cold snap, so here, in tantalizingly reverse order, are my top 5 games of 2025!</p><h2>Honorable Mentions</h2><p>If I may, I'd like to start with a couple of games that just about didn't make the grade. I won't take much of your time with these, but I wanted to nod in their general direction without officially numbering them.</p><ul><li><em>Look Outside</em>. Very strong horror theming and non-linear exploration, but the combat's just a little too basic for my tastes.</li><li><em>Hades II</em>. The gameplay is complex and exciting, and there's loads to do, so it's a shame the story is terrible.</li><li><em>The Alters</em>. I found <em>The Alters</em>' core gameplay stressful and just a little dull, which is a shame because the story is superb. It's the inverse <em>Hades II </em>problem.</li></ul><p>Right, that's that out of the way. Here are the real heavy hitters!</p><h2>5. <em>Shinobi: Art of Vengeance</em></h2><figure role="group">

Well, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shenmue-4-footage-fake-ys-net" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e7156030-a639-47c2-8009-93c5c9789d71" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">except <em>Shenmue</em></a>.</p><h2>4. <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em></h2><figure role="group">

  </article>

<figcaption>Yeah, yeah, alright. It's good.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It would be churlish not to acknowledge one of the biggest and most generous Metroidvania platformers ever created on this list, even if I do have some issues with wonky storytelling and some questionable difficulty choices.</p><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e6454f0b-6800-4e17-96eb-7c686c1e2c90" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em></a><em> </em>is, to put it simply, the platformer that keeps on giving. Like its predecessor, it keeps going when you think it surely must have run out of ideas, and then it tacks on entire extra areas and bosses after that as well.</p><p><em>Silksong </em>also represents a level up for Team Cherry's already drum skin-tight combat design; Hornet is an acrobatic protagonist, and she's an absolute thrill to control as she bounces and weaves her way through Pharloom's many and varied denizens.</p><p>Much like <em>Hades II</em>, however, things come apart for me in the story stakes. <em>Silksong</em>'s narrative is unfocused and sprawling, and it never quite coalesces around an identifiable goal, nor does it succeed in making Hornet feel like a genuine character for me.</p><p>I'm also not sure <em>Silksong </em>needed to be quite so frustrating. Some of its boss runs are <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/death-to-death-runs" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bc88c70a-a511-49c5-9fc0-4b3f70907424" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">a little patience-testing</a>, and while its encounters feel perfectly tuned to me, one or two of its nastier surprises feel unfair rather than punishing.</p><p>With all that said, <em>Silksong </em>is a superb sequel to <em>Hollow Knight</em>, and I look forward to knitting my broken fingers back together to play its upcoming free expansion.</p><h2>3. <em>The Roottrees Are Dead</em></h2><figure role="group">
<article>
  
      
  

  </article>

<figcaption>Do you like genealogy puzzlers? <em>The Roottrees Are Dead </em>is for you.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Representing an extremely strong start to the year, <em>The Roottrees Are Dead </em>is exactly what I think deductive puzzle games should be, which is to say it's inspired by <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/return-of-obra-dinn" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="cf4c55bd-209b-4472-8975-e018955d838d" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Return of the Obra Dinn</em></a>.</p><p>Tasking you with sorting through a tangled web of genealogy in order to uncover the secrets of a family of candy magnates, <em>The Roottrees Are Dead </em>isn't particularly flashy or sexy, but it is rich with puzzle goodness.</p><p>Discovering the identity of a particularly elusive family member by digging through periodicals and books might not sound like your idea of fun, but it's certainly mine, so I for one am grateful to Evil Trout.</p><p>In an era of AAA games treating players like complete morons (looking at you, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/metroid-prime-4" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c195faed-5d46-484c-bbea-f034fca5544b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em></a>), <em>The Roottrees Are Dead </em>represents a refreshing and exciting trend towards do-it-yourself puzzle-solving, and I'm very much here for it.</p><p>The art is a little uncanny at times, and it's true that there's no pulse-pounding action or multi-stage boss fight to captivate adrenaline junkies, but <em>The Roottrees Are Dead </em>thrilled me thoroughly, so onto the list it goes.</p><h2>2. <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></h2><figure role="group">
<article>
  
      
  

  </article>

<figcaption><em>Donkey Kong Bananza </em>shows Nintendo's innovative spirit isn't dead.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Yes, yes, alright. I'm a Nintendo shill, I admit it. Still, there were very few games that matched <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>'s sheer joie de vivre and inventive spirit for me this year.</p><p>Okay, so DK's latest adventure can sometimes feel like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/donkey-kong-bananza-super-mario-odyssey-team" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="95f40f3e-5162-45ed-8871-019d18466db6" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">a reskin (presumably a banana skin) of <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em></a>, and the dynamic between Donkey Kong and his young charge Pauline is odd, to say the least.</p><p>None of that changes the fact that Nintendo is still creating best-in-class platformers, and that <em>Donkey Kong Bananza </em>represents a thrilling demonstration of the legendary Japanese company's design chops.</p><p>Even without DK's ability to tunnel through levels, thus skipping entire platforming challenges and causing potentially devastating sequence breaks, <em>Bananza</em>'s many and varied challenges would be the cherry on top of the chef's kiss, as it were.</p><p>Taken with its innovative <em>Minecraft</em>-style digging systems, though, <em>Bananza</em>'s responsive platforming and wealth of diverse levels made it a joy to play through. I'm not collecting every banana, though. That way madness lies.</p><h2>1. <em>Blue Prince</em></h2><figure role="group">
<article>
  
      
  

  </article>

<figcaption><em>Blue Prince </em>has its flaws, but it's just so gosh-darn interesting.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Dogubomb and Raw Fury released roguelite adventure puzzler <em>Blue Prince </em>in April, and not only was it easily the highlight of that month for me, it was also easily the year's best, with a couple of heavy caveats.</p><p>Let's get this one out of the way first: yes, the RNG is a problem. It's baked into <em>Blue Prince</em>'s design, so I can't think of a way to fix it, but having a puzzle most of the way solved only to repeatedly fail to get the room you need can be aggravating.</p><p>Despite that, though, <em>Blue Prince</em>'s mixture of randomized room-laying and puzzle-solving that stretches across multiple runs absolutely captivated me this year.</p><p>Between this and <em>Roottrees</em>, 2025 really was the year of retrieving an actual pen and notepad with which to make notes (I also thoroughly enjoyed <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes </em>this year, but I'm restricting myself to 2025 releases for this list).</p><p>As well as the wealth of puzzles to solve, <em>Blue Prince </em>also has a story to discover, and it's told out of order, so you'll need to be paying attention if you want to piece together what happened in this cozy but deceptively complex world.</p><p>I won't deny that <em>Blue Prince </em>frustrated me at times, but it's still my game of the year simply for its uniqueness and experimentation. I'd rather play a single <em>Blue Prince </em>than a thousand <em>Ghost of Yotei</em>s (<em>Ghosts of Yotei</em>?).</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/anson-chan-top-games-2025</link>
            <guid>1401931</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>While 2025 was a relatively tame year when it came to AAA game releases, there were still plenty of standout titles if you knew where to look. <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> of course was the breakout hit of the year, definitively proving that you don't really need 20 different studios and billions of dollars to deliver a top-tier experience.&nbsp;</p><p>Naturally, the success of one game isn't indicative of an upheaval in the entire industry. However, between the apparent stagnation of old guard studios, the rapid maturation of Chinese gaming studios as a whole, and the proliferation of new software that enables smaller teams to pump out competitive titles, 2026 may be a very interesting year in terms of both individual games and the industry at large.</p><h2><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></h2><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/expedition-33-player-characters.jpg?itok=Nu8y_tmV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p>What else can be said about <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-french-revolution" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Expedition 33</em></a> that hasn't already been said by others? If you're a fan, or have even a passing interest in turn-based RPGs and you have the time to try the game, you should.&nbsp;</p><p>While the idea of implementing action-game mechanics into a turn-based RPG isn't new, <em>Expedition 33</em> does it so flawlessly that it sets a new standard for the genre. Throw in some excellent music and writing with some very creative world design and it's no surprise that it's one of the more undisputed Game of the Year contenders in recent memory.</p><p>On a small side note, I personally quite like the default skins of the playable characters. They all have similar uniforms with a very neat color scheme, but with just enough personalization that you can tell who is who with a mere glance. Given the context of the expeditions, it seems like a logical and practical choice, and it's a small deviation from the norm of every party member having completely different clothing and armor.</p><p>There are two small quibbles I have with <em>Expedition 33</em> though in that it seems like no matter what language you play on, the lip syncing seems to be just a little bit off. The second is that the jumping animation is a little stiff. Yet these are such a relatively minor issues in an otherwise excellent game.</p><h2><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em></h2><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/doom-the-dark-ages-mech_0.jpg?itok=3FK3KbBh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/doom-the-dark-ages-mech_0.jpg?itok=zgwYi9QC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p>Sequels to first-person shooters tend to be rather hit or miss in my experience and thankfully, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/doom-dark-ages-review" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6c34b81d-7c3a-4488-97a7-1de8454240f4" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em></a> delivers more of the former than the latter. While the changes to <em>Doom's</em> core gameplay formula took a little bit to get used to, the shield and all of its abilities opens up so many more venues for violence that it's hard to see it as anything but an upgrade.</p><p>The shift from a sci-fi setting to a more fantasy-inspired backdrop was a great idea though. There have been a million and one interpretations of what humanity in space might look like, yet there are only so many games that take medieval design and decide to use that as a starting point for a sci-fi society.</p><p>Unfortunately, the new mech and dragon levels kind of just exist. They're a step up from those on-rails segments that were in every FPS decades ago, although in practice they're fundamentally identical. Simply put, if there was any real disappointment to be found in <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>, it's that the on-foot combat is somehow more visceral and more dynamic than flying a dragon with guns or piloting a huge mech.&nbsp;</p><h2><em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em></h2><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ninja-gaiden-4-tokyo.jpg?itok=-c_wKVfN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p>After so many years it's nice to see one of original "git gud" game franchises make a return in the modern era, and what a humbling return it is. The gameplay is ridiculously fast paced and the enemies aren't pulling their punches, even on normal difficulty. Miss a dodge and that random generic goon is taking off a big chunk of your health. Oh and there's usually several goons per encounter. The damage goes both ways though, and if you play correctly you can eviscerate bosses in mere minutes.&nbsp;</p><p>Admittedly, some of the difficulty comes from the camera and how it sometimes struggles to track enemies, but for the most part you really do have to just learn how to play. It's less "memorize these attack patterns and parry" and more "combo this guy out of existence before his friends spawn in," which I personally find to be more visually satisfying.&nbsp;</p><p>The injection of cyberpunk elements into the art direction of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/ninja-gaiden-4-review-blackened-rain-beckons" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="cd1796d1-2f9f-45e0-9bc3-182e5870632c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em></a> is quite neat too. There are chapters where you have a mix of contemporary, cyberpunk, and traditional/demonic themes playing off of each other and it's usually very well done.&nbsp;</p><h2><em>Where Winds Meet</em></h2><picture>

While countless games draw from European fantasy for their setting, <em>Where Winds Meet</em> stands out because it quite obviously inspired by Chinese fantasy. The broad strokes of both genres are actually quite similar in concept, although the latter typically involves things like using martial arts to throw bears around or flying through the air with special sword moves and such.&nbsp;</p><p>Thankfully, such physics-defying tropes are used sparingly in the main quest and are seemingly there mostly for exploration purposes. <em>Where Winds Meet</em> plays like any other action game with parry and dodge mechanics otherwise.&nbsp;</p><p>Your arsenal is quite unique though. You have access to your standard array of swords, spears, and bows, but you also have more atypical options like umbrellas and fans. Similarly, your "magic" options are to get drunk and fist fight your enemies, throw geese at people, meditate really hard to get a damage reduction buff, and other similar moves that don't usually appear in games.&nbsp;</p><p>Again, this ties into the aspect that sets <em>Where Winds Meet</em> apart from its competitors. Without the strong adherence to the Chinese fantasy art direction, you're left with a mechanically sound yet somewhat mundane action game.&nbsp;</p><h2><em>Persona 5: The Phantom X</em></h2><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/persona5x-trial.jpg?itok=_jruadxn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1200">

  </picture><p>While it's certainly not ideal that the latest <em>Persona </em>game is a spin-off of <em>Persona 5</em> but with gacha mechanics, credit should be given to the developers of <em>Persona 5: The Phantom X</em> for implementing a lot of features that demonstrably improve the classic Persona experience. The most obvious addition would be the inclusion of multiple adult confidants and playable characters of various ages, ranging from college students and young adults to senior citizens.</p><p>Another neat change is the modernization of various core gameplay mechanics. For instance, party roles are more strictly defined, so you might have characters that are specialized buffers or tanks. Personas have similar niches, so while you do have the freedom to build a Persona however you want, you're still encouraged to pick certain Personas based on what your team needs. Navigators also play a more active role in combat, functioning as a kind of off-screen support.&nbsp;</p><p>The most controversial changes might be the removal of the calendar system and some of the writing. The mere notion that you might miss relevant story content in previous Persona games due to the calendar was like a specter that haunted every dialogue decision that you could make, so I certainly didn't miss its absence.</p><p>Unfortunately, most everyone can agree that <em>Persona 5: The Phantom X's</em> story has a very weak opening act. While I like the first two antagonists on a conceptual level, the execution of these concepts in terms of both writing and presentation left much to be desired.</p><p>The narrative only starts to shine at the third Palace, which is much better executed thus far. While it's not quite on the level of Dr. Maruki's arc in <em>Persona 5 Royal</em>, it has the potential for greatness, and its themes are quite contemporary too.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Boy, there were a lot of games this year, huh? One would think I'd get fatigued from playing so many different titles, but I always try to experience as much as I can in a given year. So, even though this is my Top 10 list, I could very well make it my Top 20 if I had the room for it.</p><p>Honorable mentions go to <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X </em>and <em>System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster </em>for being amazing games that have already had their time in the limelight, and <em>Avowed</em> for being an outstanding RPG, just not quite as good as the rest of the games on this list.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>10 - <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em></h2><p>If you read the above paragraph, you'll see that I'm contradicting myself. <em>Oblivion</em> has had plenty of time in the limelight, but this one holds a special place in my heart. <em>Oblivion </em>is easily one of my favorite games from childhood, and I was itching to go back and play it with or without a remaster.</p><p>Now that we have a remaster, I'm reminded of why it's so special. It's goofy and janky as all hell. But then you have this amazing sense of immersion and exploration with all these engrossing questlines and locales. This remaster captures all of what made <em>Oblivion</em> both flawed and fantastic back in the day while giving it a fresh coat of paint and QOL fixes for only what's needed. This is how you do a remaster, folks.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>9 - <em>Promise Mascot Agency</em></h2><p>Save a dilapidated Japanese town by running a mascot agency. These mascots aren't just people in suits, they're real-life creatures: A walking, talking severed finger, for instance. As you try to repay your sumptuous debt to your Yakuza boss, you'll unravel an intriguing mystery surrounding the town of Kaso-Machi.</p><p>Gameplay is far from conventional, taking place mostly within your little kei truck while also managing the logistics of a business. <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/promise-mascot-agency-review-little-kei-truck-that-could" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Promise Mascot Agency</em></a><em> </em>is fresh and vibrant, and there isn't anything else out there quite like it.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>8 - <em>Kirby Air Riders</em></h2><p>Coming out at the tail end of the year was <em>Kirby Air Riders</em>, and what better time to come out than during the holidays when everyone is surrounded by friends and family. It got my brothers and I to play a game together for the first time in years, so that in itself made the purchase worth it.</p><p>Gameplay-wise, it is, essentially, a better and improved version of <em>Kirby Air Ride, </em>though its mechanics are deceptively deep. There are so many challenges to complete and unlocks to collect, so it'll keep me occupied way into 2026.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ninja-gaiden-4_0.jpg?itok=vWVOSpBl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><h2>7 - <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em></h2><p>This year saw the release of several <em>Ninja Gaiden </em>titles, including <em>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</em>. That was my first true introduction to the series, and I was hooked from there. After beating <em>Black </em>last January, I was very excited to sink my teeth into <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/ninja-gaiden-4-review-blackened-rain-beckons" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em></a><em> </em>(which, at that time, had just been announced the same day as <em>Black</em>'s release).</p><p>This is one of the most exciting, challenging, intense, bloody, and badass action games I've played. Not just this year, but period. Every fight shot adrenaline through my veins as I pulled off awesome combos and took down droves of enemies. <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> just slaps.&nbsp;</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ragebound-top-10-2.jpg?itok=ks56Fad7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><h2>6 - <em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em></h2><p>I did indeed play all three <em>Ninja Gaiden </em>games to release this year, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-review-razor-sharp-retro-platformer" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em></a><em> </em>might just be the most bullet-proof of the bunch. This 2D platformer is tough-as-nails and pays homage to the series' roots with modern sensibilities.</p><p><em>Ragebound</em> boasts top-of-the-line pixel art and excellent stage design. Combat is fast-paced, simple, but brutal, requiring precision from players in order to succeed. It also introduces two intriguing characters, Kumori and Kenji. I truly hope their dynamic is expanded upon. Something tells me we haven't seen the end of them just yet.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-top-10.jpg?itok=NM7y0kI3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-top-10.jpg?itok=qOmtgjSc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><h2>5 - <em>Ghost of Yotei</em></h2><p>Maybe it's because I got around the playing this in December rather than its launch month of October, but it felt like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/ghost-of-yotei-review-new-ghost-in-familiar-tale" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Ghost of Yotei</em></a> didn't get as much hype as its predecessor. Nonetheless, it's a technically excellent title with bulletproof gameplay, and it's also one of the most beautiful games to release since, well, <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>. It's a little lacking in story, but were it not for that, this might have landed in my first pick.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hades-2-top-10.jpg?itok=R5ZaNLRf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hades-2-top-10.jpg?itok=YrrwyLjE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><h2>4 - <em>Hades II</em></h2><p>More <em>Hades</em> is just what the doctor ordered, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/hades-2-review-new-standard-for-rougelites" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Hades II</em></a><em> </em>delivers. It's essentially a better game in every regard, even though the first game was exceptional. What really blew me away here was the Underworld <em>and </em>Overworld, adding even more variety to a sumptuous game. Also, it has Ben Starr as Prometheus. Need I say more?</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-quest-i-and-2-hd2d-1.jpg?itok=a9Vjwsyo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><h2>3 - <em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em></h2><p><em>Dragon Quest </em>never got much traction in the West; at least, not as much as Japan. Even so, the <em>Dragon Quest</em> <em>HD-2D</em> remakes have been wonderful to experience. Both last year's remake of the third entry and this year's combination of the first two games have made me a lifelong fan.</p><p><em>Dragon Quest I</em> is a brief experience, but its context is important to fully appreciated <em>Dragon Quest II. </em>I'd like to think of the first game as a prologue to the full-fledged JRPG that is <em>Dragon Quest II</em>. Common sentiment is, this is the quintessential remake, adding so many wonderful additions to expand the story while paying homage to the original.&nbsp;</p><p>The journey of the four cousins in <em>Dragon Quest II HD-2D Remake</em> is heartfelt and uplifting, even when there are moments of darkness. It's a story of perseverance and camaraderie that warms my soul. Oh yeah, and it's downright gorgeous with its new HD-2D visuals.&nbsp;</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>2 - <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></h2><p><em>Mario Kart World</em> is all well and good, but the real power behind my decision to purchase the Switch 2 was, of course, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/donkey-kong-bananza-review-oohh-banana" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></a>. It was a purchase well worth the price, as this is one of the most charming and addicting platformers Nintendo's ever put out.&nbsp;</p><p>The destruction physics are spectacular. I spent most of my time just digging and destroying these levels, scouring the earth for collectibles and the like. It's damn near perfect and can comfortably stand as the premier 3D platformer of the system in the same vein that <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> was for the Nintendo Switch.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dispatch_0.jpg?itok=bzRIbPYB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><h2>1 - <em>Dispatch</em></h2><p>This game lives rent free in my head. I binged the <em>hell</em> out of this game when all the episodes released. I was absolutely hooked by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dispatch-sales-3m-stats-adhoc" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Dispatch</em></a>, with its clever writing, stellar performances from its wonderful cast of characters, and outstanding art style.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm not even that big into super heroes, but <em>Dispatch</em> has a fresh take on the whole genre, and now I'm begging AdHoc Studios to give me another season. Even if there isn't a Season 2, I can't wait to see what else they cook up.</p>
