            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-record-breaking-financials-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>PUBG: Battlegrounds&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Callisto Protocol&nbsp;</em>publisher Krafton has released its financial statement for the 2024 fiscal year, and the company has reported "record-breaking" sales and profits.</p>

<p>Per a press release, Krafton's sales grew by 41.8% in 2024 when compared to the previous year, while its profits grew by a staggering 54%. Both of these figures were, Krafton says, "driven by the continued expansion and sustainability of the&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>IP".</p>

<p>The figures mean that Krafton's average annual sales growth rate for the past five years stands at 20%, which isn't too shabby at all. I'm sure the studio will be happy with these numbers.</p>

<p>According to Krafton,&nbsp;<em>PUBG</em>'s transition to a free-to-play model, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pubg-player-count-doubles-on-steam-after-free-to-play-launch" rel="nofollow">took place in late 2021</a>, "has continued to drive growth", along with the IP's various successful collaborations. As a reminder, those collaborations have historically included the likes of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/payday-pubg-crossover-starbreeze-krafton" rel="nofollow">Payday</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pubg-crossover-adds-dead-by-daylight-for-spooky-frights" rel="nofollow"><em>Dead by Daylight</em></a>, among many others.</p>

<p>With regards to its future, Krafton says it wants to make "significant investments in securing a 'Big Franchise IP'", although it's not clear whether that means the company wants to acquire a new property or transform its&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>IP into a "Big Franchise".</p>

<p>The company's slate of games for this year includes the likes of survival sequel&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/subnautica-2-early-access-2025-co-op" rel="nofollow">Subnautica 2</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Sims&nbsp;</em>competitor&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/inzoi-release-date-delayed" rel="nofollow"><em>inZoi</em></a>, as well as the global launch of&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker Mobile&nbsp;</em>and multiplayer life sim&nbsp;<em>Dinkum Together</em>.</p>

Not only does the company have a packed slate of upcoming games, but it also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-acquires-tango-gameworks-and-hi-fi-rush-ip-with-plans-for-future-expansion" rel="nofollow">acquired Tango Gameworks</a> and the rights to the&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush&nbsp;</em>IP after Microsoft <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown" rel="nofollow">turned its back on the studio</a>.</p>

<p>Krafton is also planning to develop a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-mobile-version-krafton" rel="nofollow">mobile version of global smash hit&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em></a>, although we don't have a release window for that yet. Hopefully, that won't have the rather <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-generative-ai-characters-pubg-inzoi" rel="nofollow">nightmarish-sounding AI-generated player characters</a> the studio is currently going all-in on.</p>
