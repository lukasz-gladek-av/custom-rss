            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>New data has revealed that the Nintendo Switch 2 has already surpassed the lifetime sales of one of the Japanese gaming giant's previous pieces of hardware in the UK, as well as two other consoles from the annals of history.</p><p>As pointed out by <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/2006017882128285792" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">analyst Chris Dring on X</a> (citing data from the analytics firm NielsenIQ), the Switch 2 has now passed the lifetime sales of the Wii U, which was released back in 2012 (and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-cans-project-giant-robot-wii-u-production-ceases" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3f5a85c7-dec2-4131-b5e3-122748abca15" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">discontinued in 2017</a>) in the UK.</p><p>Admittedly, the Wii U was largely considered to be a commercial failure, but the Switch 2 managing to surpass its entire sales total in the UK within just six months or so is still a fairly impressive achievement, even if the competition isn't particularly fair.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Ah, Wii U. We hardly knew, er, U.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>According to Dring and NielsenIQ, the Switch 2 has also managed to pass the UK's lifetime sales total for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/days-of-playstation-vita-are-over" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4acfe571-2451-4f5a-a457-7180f86e895c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">PlayStation Vita</a> and the Sega Dreamcast, although, again, it's fair to say both of those machines were fairly ill-fated.&nbsp;</p><p>Again, though, fewer people bought those consoles across their entire life cycles than the Switch 2 in its first six months (in the UK, at least). Whether or not figures are similar across the world is hard to say, but I wouldn't be surprised if the picture is the same in the US and elsewhere.</p><p>Nintendo released the Switch 2 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c11b67d9-d8b1-4556-871d-041c5101dcf0" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">back in June this year</a>, and within the console's first two months on sale, it had managed to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-financials-q1-2026" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="0df1a582-9b9c-40ce-97e3-524ba446cf4f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">pass the six million sales mark</a>. Reportedly, Nintendo has asked its Switch 2 manufacturing partners to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-25m-production-report" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7d44c0b0-340a-4585-9a19-51b01545f6f9" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">produce 25 million units of the console</a> by March 2026.</p><p>Many popular games will be making their way to the Switch 2 in the coming months, too, including the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-switch-2-delayed-2026" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e7fa2ba9-4e00-4f97-a4ff-d9244ef5b612" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>, ghost-hunting game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-switch-2-version-on-way-next-year" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="159fca3c-8df3-41ad-98da-95af3a28123c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Phasmophobia</em></a>, and choice-based adventure title <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dispatch-switch-2-switch-eshop-listing" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1bcf2169-2693-40a4-ab6c-88b2398c75da" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Dispatch</em></a>.</p>
<p>You can nab a Nintendo Switch 2 for yourself via official channels right now. The same sadly can't be said for the Wii U, the Vita, or the Dreamcast, although I'm sure second-hand markets have their fair share of machines if you're interested. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Gun-fu action game <em>Spine </em>was supposed to get a release date this year, but, as you've probably already noticed if you're following its progress, that didn't happen. Now, developer and publisher Nekki has taken to social media to explain why.</p><p>In <a href="https://x.com/playspine/status/2005664237407145990" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">a message</a> on X, Nekki acknowledges that they promised to reveal a release date for <em>Spine </em>this year, but that the team wasn't "ready" to announce a date or even a rough window.</p><p>Nekki says that since <em>Spine </em>is the team's first PC and console game, the project is "setting a new bar for quality, scope, and production values", and that the team's top priorities are <em>Spine</em>'s "product quality and...overall gameplay experience".</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Spine </em>didn't get a release date this year, and developer Nekki has explained why.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Nekki says that <em>Spine </em>is now "entering the final stages of development", and that the team is currently polishing the game's "content, locations, animations, voice acting, and interface". Developer diaries will continue between now and whenever <em>Spine</em>'s release date ends up being.</p><p>Sadly, you're not going to get that date today, either; Nekki says the team doesn't want to "name a release date [it isn't] fully confident in", but that you'll be hearing the date "in the near future". Expect more in the new year.</p><p>If you're not familiar with <em>Spine</em>, Nekki describes it as "a single-player action game about close-quarters gunfights with aesthetics of Gun-Fu movies", so you can expect inspiration from the likes of <em>John Wick </em>and the <em>Matrix </em>movies, as well as games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/cyberpunk-2077" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c4cdcb94-eb27-4726-bc08-ac26ee9ad89e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></a><em> </em>and the tragically-dormant <em>Deus Ex </em>series.</p><p>The game casts you as "rebellious street artist Redline and her sentient combat implant Spine", and together, the two must battle an "autocratic AI regime". What else, after all, does one do in a cyberpunk setting?</p>
<p>When <em>Spine </em>does eventually launch, you'll be able to check it out on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1731290/SPINE__This_is_Gun_Fu/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch 2. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
