            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Modiphius has announced a <em>Mass Effect Board Game</em> expansion for N7 Day. The tabletop publisher will be bringing new material for both <em>Mass Effect</em> fans and board game enthusiasts:<em>&nbsp;</em>more enemy miniatures and an official expansion&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The <em>Mass Effect Board Game</em>&nbsp;Expansion Announcement</h2>

<p>In an official press release, Modiphius made several announcements regarding a <em>Mass Effect Board Game</em> expansion. The first announcement was for a new wave of miniatures. These sets will provide unpainted resin miniatures of different Mass Effect enemies to use in your game if the base experience's cardboard tokens aren't cutting it for you.</p>

<ul><li>Priority Threats Delta</li>
	<li>Priority Threats Gamma</li>
	<li>Priority Threats Epsilon</li>
	<li>Battlefield Scenery Alpha</li>
	<li>Battlefield Scenery Beta</li>
	<li>ATLAS Mech and Marker</li>
	<li>YMIR Mech and Marker</li>
	<li>Brute and Marker</li>
</ul><p>The second, more notable announcement is confirmation that the studio is working on an official expansion. This will introduce six new squadmates, new loyalty missions, and new locations. At the time of writing, the exact details on the expansion's contents, release date, or price, is unknown.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/mass-effect-legendary-edition" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Mass Effect</em></a> series was created by Bioware and published by Electronic Arts in 2008. It followed Commander Shepard, a custom player character, as they explored a vast sci-fi universe with unique aliens, factions, and history. The unique selling point was that you could import your save data from each game, with your choices and partnerships having widespread consequences as the series progressed.</p>

<p>The <em>Mass Effect Board Game</em>, aka <em>Mass Effect: Project Hagalaz</em>, released last year. It is a cooperative game set during the events of <em>Mass Effect 3</em> and follows Commander Shepard and their crew on a mission involving Cerberus and The Reapers. The game was designed by Eric Lang (<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bloodborne-board-game-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Bloodborne: The Board Game</em></a>) and Calvin Wang Tze Loon.</p>

<p>The game garnered a bit of controversy at launch. Namely, a culture war spat regarding squadmates' personal pronouns being featured in the game. This led to a series of review bombing on Board Game Geek, Lang being harassed <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/mass-effect-board-game-designer-harrassed-over-culture-war-review-bombing" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">off social media</a>, and pronouns being removed in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/czech-release-of-mass-effect-board-game-will-remove-squadmate-pronouns" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Czech version</a> of the game.</p>
