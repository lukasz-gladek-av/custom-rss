            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/renegade-game-studios-announces-price-increases-in-response-to-us-trade-tariffs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Renegade Game Studios has announced some board game price increases. In response to the adjusted, but <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/adjusted-us-trade-tariffs-to-china-still-poses-problems-to-board-game-industry" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">still damaging</a>, US trade tariffs on imported Chinese goods, the tabletop studio is bumping up the price on several board games in its catalog.</p>



<p>In an official newsletter, Renegade Game Studios states the effects the trade tariffs have had on board game production. It states the tariffs went into effect well after the company had already manufactured and produced certain board game reprints. The statement also notes that, while the studio will try to absorb some of these costs, some of those costs will be passed on to consumers. Hence, price increases.</p>

The games, <em>Naishi</em>, <em>Arboretum</em>, and <em>The Tea Dragon Society Card Game</em>, will be sold at an MSRP of $25.</p>

<p>At first, these price increases seem innocuous. All three of these games' original MSRP's were roughly $20. But, bear in mind that most smaller board games are purchased in bulk from retailers, generally in packs of 12 or so. That means a 12-pack of a game just went from $240 to $300 for that retailer. That adds up when it comes to inventory management.</p>

<p><em>Naishi</em> is a board game set in feudal Japan where you attempt to control all of the Japanese Imperial Court through strategic hand management. It was designed by Mathieu Bieri and Alex Fortineau.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Arboretum</em>, designed by Dan Cassar, is a card game about planting a strategic path through a beautiful garden you plant and cultivate.</p>

<p>Lastly, <em>The Tea Dragon Society Card Game</em>, based on the graphic novel series, is designed by Steve Ellis and Tyler Tinsley. It is a light card game about nurturing a tea dragon throughout seasons. It is designed to be accessible and kid-friendly.</p>

<p>It is unclear at this time if these price increases will continue for Renegade Game Studios' catalog. While it is debatable whether or not <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/ttrpg-books-might-be-exempt-from-us-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">RPG books</a> will be affected like World of Darkness or the recently released <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/welcome-to-night-vale-rpg-comes-to-backerkit-this-october" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Welcome to Night Vale RPG</em></a>, there is the manner of other Renegade-produced franchises like the recently revived <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/renegade-takes-over-axis-allies-and-other-classics" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Axis &amp; Allies</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/heroscape-returns-to-retail-by-renegade-game-studios" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Heroscape</em></a>.</p>
