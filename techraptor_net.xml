Unexpected Games' latest premium expansion, <em>The Mandalorian: Adventures Clan of Two</em> will add new game elements to the base game based on Season 2 of the popular streaming series.</p>

<p>According to an official press release, <em>The Mandalorian: Adventures Clan of Two</em> was designed by Unexpected Games' studio head Corey Konieczka, the same mind behind the original release. The expansion introduces four new characters, four locations, and a brand new mission book. The expansion is not a standalone experience and requires the base game.</p>

This season involves the titular Mandalorian Din Djarin attempting to reunite his companion Grogu with the nomadic Jedi Order, all while avoiding attacks and plots by the Imperial Moff Gideon.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Season 2 of <em>The Mandalorian</em> included some of my favorite Star Wars™&nbsp;scenes in the last decade. It was a blast recreating these moments for the board game, and this expansion includes so much more. From Boba Fett and Ahsoka Tano to duels and dangerous cards, I can't wait for you to see all the new content.” said Konieczka.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In addition to new characters and missions, <em>The Mandalorian: Adventures Clan of Two</em> introduces new enemy types, ongoing events, and a duel deck. These elements can be integrated into the base game, adding more replayability to the experience.</p>
