            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Episodes 3 and 4 of <em>Dispatch </em>are a great pairing, both ratcheting up the player choice. Each episode does a good job of layering on some new gameplay elements that perfectly fit the story, too.</p>

<p>Be sure to check out my <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/dispatch-episode-1-2-impressions" rel="nofollow">preview of the first two episodes</a> to learn more about what <em>Dispatch </em>is.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Episode 3 – Turnover&nbsp;</h2>

<p>This episode begins with Blonde Blazer explaining that a decision has been made to reduce the size of your squad by one. It's part to cut some that are underperforming, but also to show that SDN means business. Someone has to go, and at the end of the day, you’re making the decision.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Robert informs the team, and they are less than thrilled, obviously. Their performance has always been something public, though, as we get to see the "leaderboards" of heroes at SDN with some sort of point system. Z Team is, of course, all clumped at the bottom.</p>

<p>Immediately after, the workday starts, and calls come in that need heroes dispatched. Because their performance is being graded, they're all giving it their all, right?</p>



<p>Well, the chosen&nbsp;tactic by the Z Team is not to do their best but to sabotage their fellow teammates on the job. When you send off some heroes together, one of them is probably going to sabotage the other. These pop up like those emergencies you get to weigh in on in the previous episodes.</p>

<p>Here, you get some choices on how to get them out of that sabotaging situation. If they succeed, they avoid an injury. Either way, the sabotage takes them out of helping on a specific mission, so their stats aren't added to the potential success rate of that mission -- so expect a lot of failure.</p>

<p>I think it would be easy to take this sort of gameplay wrinkle and be frustrated by it. It’s going to make you fail way more missions than you would otherwise, and there’s nothing you can do about it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But the gameplay marries so well with the story and the characters that I really love the choice. It’s simple but plays out exactly how it was intended, I’m sure, with the day being chaotic, filled with sabotage and failure, and shows the exact problem at the heart of Z Team that Robert has to solve.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sabotaging drives home the personalities of these still villainous “heroes” who aren’t all that committed to the work they do. It’s a job and nothing more. It's like they got sentenced to some community service, and they just really need to put in some hours, not that they really want to be there.</p>

It’s just between two, and I won’t say who, but the choice is a genuine one.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I can confirm that, at least through the next episode, that character is off the team and not in the episode. I can’t wait to see what future implications that may have, as none of the characters seem much of a “throwaway” and have a decent amount on offer. It's not just that they aren't around either, as some characters aren't exactly happy with your choice.</p>

<p>With how much of the game is bantering between the characters and their weird personalities colliding, this felt like a big choice. Will it hugely affect the plot? Obviously, I don’t know, but I doubt it. But it absolutely affects the interactions in the game, which is where <em>Dispatch </em>shines. &nbsp;</p>

<p>It's a game-changing choice that absolutely alters your experience with the game, which is really all you can ask for.</p>

<h2>Episode 4 – Restructure&nbsp;</h2>

<p>The episode opens with a nice scene with Royd, who is tasked with repairing and rebuilding the Mecha Man suit. It’s a quick reminder of that looming plot above all the dispatching that Robert really wants to be his own hero again and go after Shroud.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Where Episode 3 left us on a huge choice, Episode 4 also opens with a pretty monumental one. Now that there is a vacancy on the team, you get to choose who is going to fill it.</p>



<p>This time it’s not a reformed villain either, but someone who did get into the hero business with good intentions. I won’t spoil the choice, but they are wildly different people to choose from.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Z Team may not be the nicest to the new member, which isn’t the most shocking thing. While they are all pretty selfish, villain-like people, they do have a sense of camaraderie in their situation. And we saw the team mentality start to shine last episode.</p>

<p>So, an outsider coming in is going to have a rough time.&nbsp;The dispatching experience reflects this again, with a lot of smack talk and making fun of the new member. Sometimes, without them even realizing. And the newest member will have some... issues that will affect how certain missions go.</p>

<p>The gameplay takes a bit of a backseat this episode, though. A lot of the focus is on relationships with people like Blonde Blazer, Invisigal, and you even get to spend time with Phenomaman, the sort of Superman of <em>Dispatch</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Except, this is a very depressed Phenomaman who is in a very sad place. He's a powerful man whose emotions show up just as powerfully, and he's pretty self-absorbed. And he doesn't really understand our small human problems, so he's pretty out of touch. He has some wild comments and funny moments throughout the episode.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The end of Episode 4 has a monumental feeling. It’s a choice that seems like it will have significant effects on the rest of the game. Unfortunately, they’ve asked us not to spoil it, which I agree with, as it’s something worth seeing for yourself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I may be repeating myself from the previous episode, but I am loving these big choices <em>Dispatch </em>tosses our way. So many games will set up choices that don’t really go anywhere or may let you see one small scene or dialogue later on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here, <em>Dispatch </em>is letting you change who you interact with and while I haven’t seen the effects of the choice at the end of this episode, it may fundamentally change Robert’s relationships with some characters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is what player agency looks like in a narrative-driven game like this. Character interactions and relationships are at the very heart of narrative, and choices that swing those one way or another are always going to be satisfying.</p>

<hr><p>Episode 3 and 4 continue the trend of adding new elements and wrinkles to the game, so each episode is not just more of the same. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I’m excited to see where it goes and just what sort of twists are in store for the second half of the game.&nbsp;</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Don't Nod Working on New Narrative Game Based on "Major" Netflix IP]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-nod-netflix-game</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dont-nod-working-on-new-narrative-game-based-on-major-netflix-ip.1338415/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><i>Life Is Strange&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage&nbsp;</em>developer Don't Nod has announced that it's signed a development deal with Netflix to produce a new game based on one of the streaming giant's IPs.</p>

<p>The news was announced as part of Don't Nod's <a href="https://www.dontnod-bourse.com/en/financial-information/press-releases/?ID=ACTUS-0-94850" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">financial results</a> for the first half of the 2025-26 fiscal year, which show that revenue has increased by a factor of 3.8 when compared to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-nod-financials-first-half-2024" rel="nofollow">the same period last year</a>.</p>

<p>The studio puts its revenue growth down to the "solid progress of its operational transformation" and the signing of the aforementioned Netflix deal, although I'm not sure the employees who <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-nod-employees-strike" rel="nofollow">lost their jobs</a> as part of that "operational transformation" would be particularly happy with their part in things.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lost-records-dont-nod-netflix.jpg?itok=OQ2UJ4If 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lost-records-dont-nod-netflix.jpg?itok=ekFOSdWg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage&nbsp;</em>studio Don't Nod is making a game with Netflix.</figcaption></figure><p>With regards to the Netflix deal, Don't Nod simply says it has signed an agreement with Netflix "for the creation of a new narrative video game based on a major IP", and that the studio intends to build on its "recognized expertise in the genre" for the project.</p>

<p>It's not clear what the IP in question is, but my money's on 80s throwback horror property&nbsp;<em>Stranger Things</em>. Back in 2018, it was announced that <i>The Walking Dead</i>'s Telltale <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/telltale-is-making-stranger-things-adventure-game-with-netflix" rel="nofollow">would work on a&nbsp;<em>Stranger Things&nbsp;</em>adventure game</a>, but the project was closed when the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/updatedtelltale-games-begins-closing-entering-assignment-proceedings" rel="nofollow">closed its doors that same year</a>.</p>

<p>Don't Nod's experience with games like&nbsp;<em>Life Is Strange</em>,&nbsp;<em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Tell Me Why&nbsp;</em>would arguably make them the ideal choice for reviving that project, although since nothing official has been announced yet, this is all just speculation.</p>

<p>The Netflix game will take its place alongside two other in-development projects at Don't Nod, namely narrative-led action-adventure title&nbsp;<em>Aphelion&nbsp;</em>and a mysterious game known only as "P14" at present.</p>

Stay tuned for more.</p>
