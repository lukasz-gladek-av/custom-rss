<h2>DK and Pauline's Big Day Out</h2>

<p>The game opens where most Nintendo adventures do, a world at peace and our protagonist enjoying what they do the most. For Donkey Kong, this is to head into the mines to uncover Banandium Gems, a resource that seems to do everything from filling bellies or allowing you to power up your abilities, and even power gigantic drilling machines capable of reaching the center of the Earth.</p>

DK then learns about the Banandium Root, which will grant wishes and allow Pauline to get home and Donkey Kong to experience his greatest dream… more bananas.</p>

<p>This adventure takes DK and Pauline through a variety of themed layers as they descend through the Earth's crust. You've got the staple video game worlds filled with sand, lava, and ice, but also some fun and unique twists on the idea like a Resort Layer, Racing Layer, and even a Feast Layer (which immediately made me think of <em>Super Mario Odyssey's</em> Luncheon Kingdom).</p>

<p>This narrative is surprisingly deep as you learn more about Pauline, who at this point is just a child and prone to stage fright, and her dream to return to her city after being captured by Void Kong. You also get to learn about each of the different races that live in the different layers, how they've made homes for themselves, and what troubles they have.</p>

It was so nice to see the lifeblood of classic collectathon titles like <em>DK64 </em>and <em>Banjo-Kazooie</em> live and well in the colorful world of <em>DK Bananza</em>.</p>

<h2>A Big Destructible World…</h2>

<p><em>DK Bananza</em> takes a lot of inspiration from <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>. Each Layer (the levels of this game) is themed with is own enemy types, common mechanics, and materials. They're also filled to the brim with collectibles.</p>

<p>The biggest change for <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> is that a lot of the world is destructible. As DK, you'll be able to dig down, punch through mountains, and pick up and hurl chunks as a weapon. Immediately this gameplay change felt as groundbreaking as some of the building mechanics in <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>. A level of technical achievement and flexibility that I was not expecting.</p>

<p>A downside of the environment being so breakable was the number of times I found myself tripping into a Bananium Gem only to look around and realize that I'd missed some kind of platforming or laser puzzle by reaching the banana through the wall.</p>

<p>For a lot of players this ability to shortcut a puzzle or challenge could bring its own level of reward, but it felt like I was cheated out of a gameplay experience.</p>

<h2>…Filled With Collectibles</h2>

<p>Each Layer is filled with the Bananium Gems collectibles, which can be used to upgrade DK's abilities, as well as fossils of varying levels that can be used to purchase and upgrade outfits that provide additional boosts to different abilities.</p>

<p>In my time playing <em>Donkey Kong Bananza,</em> I collected around 500 Bananium Gems by the time I reached the ending, and I think I would have been hard pressed to find a gap of longer than five minutes where I wasn't hearing the classic "Ooh, Banana!" to signify picking up a new one. [Editor's note: Some quick math on the 15 hour play time means our reviewer found a banana about every two minutes!]</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-ooh-banana.jpg?itok=CjXJn30i 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-ooh-banana.jpg?itok=6bM4AcJ2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Much like <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, especially when first reaching a new area, you can pan the camera and spot half a dozen objectives. By the time you reach one of those, you're normally able to whip your camera around and find another dozen.</p>

<p>While I was always progressing towards a goal marker, the path that I took to reach them probably looks like one created by a madman.</p>

<h2>Upgrade Your Outfit And Abilities</h2>

<p>As you pick up collectibles, you can level up DK's abilities with Bananium Gems, or purchase outfits that deal incremental increases to DK's powers, defence, or abilities.</p>

<p>The Bananuim Gem abilities were fantastic to unlock. You can punch faster, recharge your meter quicker, and take your <em>Bananza </em>abilities and turn them up to 11. The costume abilities were far more underwhelming.</p>

<p>You might move 20% faster in mud, or take 20% less damage. Each of these outfits can be upgraded further, but they're so situational unless you knew what was going to be ahead of you there likely wasn't much reason to change. Those slight increases in speed or defence could be helpful, but I feel the time to reach a shop and get changed would almost take as long as just getting through that muddy patch, especially when something like surfing can allow you to mitigate the speed loss regardless.</p>

Chests appearing can net you additional gold or treasure maps that put collectibles on your map.</p>

<h2>Music To Make You Clap Your Bongos To</h2>

<p>To top off the fun gameplay and charming visuals, the soundtrack is always good to tap your toe to. Whether you're exploring a world as DK, getting to jam along to any of the <em>Bananza </em>vocal tracks, or you've warped into a <em>Donkey Kong Country</em>-inspired sidescroller and get to hear reimaginings of tracks like "Jungle Japes," you'll always be having a good time.</p>

<p>It was so important not just for the game, but also narratively to link with Pauline and her love of singing and confidence issues, that the soundtrack would be a large part of this, and <em>DK Bananza</em> absolutely nails it on every front.</p>

<p>For Donkey Kong, who hasn't had a true 3D platforming outing since <em>Donkey Kong 64, DK Bananza</em> is an incredible return to form. Capitalizing on everything that <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> did so well — unique open worlds, fun platforming challenges, and an over abundance of quick to obtain collectibles — <em>DK Bananza</em> then spins off to create its own novel genre-bending game with destructible environments and a return of DK specific features like transformations.</p>

<p>While I did feel the destructible environment robbed me of experiencing some of the platforming puzzles of the game, the destructible environment still did far more to enhance the overall experience.</p>

<p>If you own a Switch 2 and you are a fan of <em>Mario Odyssey,</em> then this should be a game you pick up immediately, whether you're wanting to marathon through the story or pick it up for 10-15 minutes at a time collecting a few Bananium Gems along the way.</p>
