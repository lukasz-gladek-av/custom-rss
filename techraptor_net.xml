The release of Lorwyn Eclipsed will contain new cards for fans to enjoy, new prebuilt decks, and some sly marketing courtesy of the Jim Henson Workshop.</p><h2>The <em>Magic: The Gathering Lorwyn Eclipsed</em> Announcements</h2><p>In an official <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/feature/collecting-lorwyn-eclipsed" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>, Wizards of the Coast showcased the card and products included in the <em>Lorwyn Eclipsed</em> set. Like most major set releases, it will contain Play Boosters, Collector Boosters, Draft boxes, and Prerelease boxes. The set will also include several prebuilt decks. These include two 60-card theme decks designed for Standard format, and two 100-card Commander decks.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The post showcases the artwork on the new cards. As the name suggests, this new set returns to the land of Lorwyn, a place separated by day and night by the twilight god Isilu. As such, shock land cards like Blood Crypts and Steam Vents will be reversible with Day and Night versions. In addition, certain Legendary Creatures and Planeswalker cards transform, such as Oko and Eridu. further representing the dichotomy.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>This comparison to fairytale worlds is made more overt by some coy marketing on Wizard's part. In addition to a debut trailer, the studio released a three-minute promo video, titled <em>The Ballad of Squen and Cragg</em>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCQ5EF69rSQ" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">on YouTube</a>. The video is a musical number centered on two characters, Squen from the sunny Lorwyn, and Cragg from the dark Shadowmoor, all brought to life through Jim Henson Muppets.</p><p>Additional posts confirm that Lorwyn Eclipsed will include borderless and art variants of certain cards. The big draw is a serialized, double rainbow foil, borderless version of Bitterbloom Bearer, brought to life by artist Rebecca Guay. Only 500 copies will be printed, so happy hunting.&nbsp;</p><picture>

Among these returning cards is one with a nasty history in Legacy format: <em>Painter's Servant</em>.</p><p>Prerelease events for Lorwyn Eclipsed will begin January 16-22. The set will then debut in <em>Magic: The Gathering Arena</em> on January 20. The set officially releases on January 23.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>From cackling goblins to crackling spells, the world of <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> and other trading card games has no shortage of iconic imagery and artwork shot throughout its history. For the off-the-wall art collective known as Puke (yes, Puke... for real!), the magical worlds of TCG's have served as their inspiration, as they bring their wild creations to life via playmats, stickers, and other TCG accessories. I got the chance to sit down with the Puke gang to talk gross out humor, design aesthetic, and the importance of hand-made art in the world of <em>MTG</em>.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>To start, I wanted to know... just what in the world is Puke? "Puke is two dudes," says Stefhan Alvarado, one half of the two dudes. "I’m Stefhan and, like my partner in crime Josh, I'm an Illustrator. Puke is everything the both of us creatively agree on rolled up into one neat little brand." To which Josh Lees, the other half of Puke, adds, "Yeah to piggyback on this nerd's back, we're trying to bring something new and fresh to the community that isn’t defined by boundaries, and speaks to every purveyor of the wacky, weird, and outsider swag."</p><p>They're bringing the new and fresh something via <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/vomitspit/puke-presents-a-barf-bonanza?ref=user_menu" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">a Kickstarter called Puke! Presents: A Barf Bonanza</a>. "Aside from just making cool merchandise and getting it out to the public," says Alvarado, "the Kickstarter’s main goal is to kick off Puke as a brand. Get the word out on the streets." With vibrant, colorful illustrations, the group seems to me to be kicking down the doors of what's established and expected in the tabletop art world, letting their unhinged creative juices flow.</p><blockquote><p>You can both have the same idea but how the artist chooses to channel their talent always leads to a different ending.</p></blockquote><p>Friends and collaborators since their art school days, both Alvarado and Lees have extremely distinct and unique visual styles. I wanted to know how they go about infusing those styles into one cohesive brand. "Our styles are very interesting to me," Alvarado explains.&nbsp;</p><p>"We have almost the same exact influences when it comes to our art but somehow what we each produce almost feels like polar opposites. Art is funny in that way. You can both have the same idea but how the artist chooses to channel their talent always leads to a different ending."</p><picture>

  </picture><p>"I think Stefhan nailed this on the head," says Lees, "It’s kind of dope to see how our styles meld together and how we work as a team. I think art style-wise, we both have a great respect for the other's craft, not to be too sappy. But we also aren’t afraid to tell each other if we have a different opinion."</p><p>"If I were to describe both of us in a different light," Alvarado continues, "I’d say that I lean more towards a traditional illustrator and Josh leans more into the fine artist territory. Those roles are all very shallow though, you learn pretty quickly as a working artist that you are a sum of your parts, and most of the time for illustrators that means that you have to be good at a lot of different things. In the end you end up being a Designer, Animator, draftsmen, illustrator, visual story teller, sequential artist, painter, etc."</p><p>For Alvarado, the coolest part of their collaboration is "that we’re both each other’s number one fans. We’re both competitive, but in a very healthy way. We push each other to keep upping the ante with our art. The product in the end speaks for itself it’s always the coolest it can be at that moment."</p><picture>

  </picture><p>Since I'm here sitting down with two real-deal artists, I wanted to get their thoughts on the future of art and the increasing presence of AI. "With AI being forced down everybody’s throat," says Lees, "I think people want something that’s more human. As companies go full tilt into that landscape, they fail to understand that, for the viewer, AI art does nothing! Maybe it makes you mad or makes you laugh for a second, and then what? It's just slop."</p><blockquote><p>I think that’s why board games and TCGs are so fascinating right now. They feel very human.</p></blockquote><p>Alvarado agrees, "I think there's no better time than now to take creative risks with your art. I think it needs to feel tactile, gritty and imperfect, “punk” in a way. I think that’s why board games and TCGs are so fascinating right now. They feel very human. You’re basically collecting art and playing with it. You’re showing your individuality through the games by showing off your interests."</p><p>Lees continues, "While this is a terrible thing being implemented into our society, I do think that there will be a sort of Dada era of the arts where people make creative that rebells against the slop-apocalypse. That being said I do think that there is some really great music and art coming out these days; most likely being fueled by the times that we live in. Artists thrive in chaos and hard times."</p><picture>

  </picture><p>Puke channels all of this frustration and inspiration into a concept they call "Art First." I asked them to explain this concept a bit more. "We keep hammering this Art First mantra down each other’s ear-holes because it makes everything simple. It keeps the brand from getting muddy. We keep pushing each other to make the dopest art we can make."</p><p>Lees adds to this sentiment, "It’s always been art, it’s always gonna be art, and it’s never <em>not</em> art. We want to strive to put out work that has an undeniable quality to it - and that goes from the quality of the playmats, stickers, and sleeves we're producing, to the image itself. We aren’t afraid to tell each other, 'hey that looks baddddd,' which keeps us honest and always makes us push it as far as we can go. Easy way to think of it is: Indiana Jones. We are Indiana Jones, and art Is our holy grail."</p><picture>

  </picture><p>As we wind down our conversation, I wanted to hear about their favorite <em>Magic</em> cards. "I think that aesthetically and mechanically," Alvarado says, "<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/a25/82/dark-ritual" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Dark Ritual</a> is my favorite card. It represents its color so well and in the simplest way possible. Pay a little to get more. It feels like the spell a dark necromancer or warlock would use to summon a demon. Real Metal."</p><p>For Lees, his love of the game, and his favorite color and card, all started when he was a kid. "I started playing magic in the Time Spiral block," Lees explains, "when my childhood best friend gave me the gift of <em>Magic</em>." He and his buddy each bought a horrible pre-constructed deck during that block, "You people don’t know how nice you have it these days" Lees laughs.</p><p>"But from that, I was sorted into the house of Blue: the best color ever. Funny enough this leads into my fav magic card every which would be Mark Poole's <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/4ed/65/counterspell" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Counterspell</a>." The artwork, which depicts a mage with his spell fizzling as it leaves his fingertips, is described by Lees as, "just goated with the sauce, dripping with swag, sick, beautiful and wonderful all at the same time. Plus the best magic card mechanically ever created."</p><p>With that, our conversation comes to a close. Full of art, ambition, and clear-eyed intentions on what they want to create, there's a lot to love about Puke!</p><hr><p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/vomitspit/puke-presents-a-barf-bonanza?ref=user_menu" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">To learn more about Puke and their outrageous Kickstarter, head over to the crowdfunding page!</a></p></div><div><p><span><div>
