            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/capcom-financials-2024-25<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has released its financial report for the 2024-25 fiscal year, and the company is doing very well indeed, bolstered by the major success of the latest entry in one of its biggest franchises.</p>

<p>Last year, Capcom celebrated its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/capcom-financials-2024-record-profits" rel="nofollow">seventh straight year of record profits</a>, and according to the studio's latest results <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e250513b.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">summary</a>, it can now roll that figure over to eight, as both profits and net sales hit record highs this year.</p>

<p>According to Capcom, net sales jumped by 11.3% compared to last year, while operating income is up by 15.2%. As you'd probably expect if you've been following Capcom's progress this year, it's mainly&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>the studio has to thank for that success.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/capcom-monster-hunter-wilds-mizutsune.jpg?itok=9SNbtu18 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/capcom-monster-hunter-wilds-mizutsune.jpg?itok=qv1tz4S- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>has given Capcom its eighth straight year of record profits.</figcaption></figure><p>Released in February,&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-steam-player-record" rel="nofollow">broke Steam player records</a> for Capcom at launch, hitting 1.2 million players within just a few hours of its release. The game went on to sell <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-8m" rel="nofollow">eight million copies</a>&nbsp;within three days, hitting the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-10m" rel="nofollow">ten million mark</a> by the end of March.</p>

<p>As well as&nbsp;<em>Wilds</em>, Capcom says its performance this year was also helped by "strong catalog title sales" in the&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>series across the board, suggesting that <em>Wilds</em><em>&nbsp;</em>also bolstered the sales for past entries like&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Rise&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter World</em>.</p>

<p>Although Capcom doesn't specifically mention it in the report, it's also important not to forget&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil</em>; latest entry <i>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</i><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-sales-10m-village-11m" rel="nofollow">broke the ten million sales mark last month</a>, and other entries in the franchise aren't doing too badly for Capcom either.</p>

<p>The company also credits its booming pachislo business, including units based on&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter</em>, with this aspect of the Japanese studio's operations enjoying "increasing unit sales volume".</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/helldivers-2-update-brings-new-enemies-weapon-customization-and-more.1187883/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-update-illuminate-weapon-customization<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Arrowhead Game Studios and Sony have released a brand new&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>update, and it's bringing new Illuminate for you and your squad to take on, plus new weapon customization systems and more.</p>

<p>First up, you can expect "larger, more powerful enemies" joining the Illuminate armies, including the Stingray jetfighter, which targets your squad to line up "devastating strafing runs".</p>

<p>These airborne menaces are joined by the Crescent Overseer, which "has the ability to lay barrages on Helldivers in cover", and the Fleshmob, a "terrifying" new enemy that serves as a "brute battlefield force" constructed of Voteless parts.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-update-weapon-customization.jpg?itok=zoDiYmz7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-update-weapon-customization.jpg?itok=q5IoabLj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>now lets you customize your weapons.</figcaption></figure><p>Arrowhead also says there are "sightings of other, even larger ships", although it doesn't go into detail regarding what those ships are or what they can do. Suffice it to say you'd better watch out for more than just what's been revealed in this update briefing.</p>

<p>As well as new Illuminate enemies, the latest&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>update also brings with it a new weapon customization system, which allows you to unlock new weapon attachments and patterns to make your armaments truly your own.</p>

<p>You can complete missions in order to level up "most" primary weapons, and doing so will allow you to spend Requisition on new attachments. It sounds like a good way to spend a resource that has a tendency to pile up once you've bought all the good stratagems.</p>

<p>Other additions include new patterns for the FRV based on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-viper-commandos-warbond" rel="nofollow">several</a> of&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-freedoms-flame-warbond" rel="nofollow">existing</a> <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-truth-enforcers-warbond" rel="nofollow">Warbonds</a>, which will unlock at the same time the new <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-masters-of-ceremony-warbond" rel="nofollow">Masters of Ceremony Warbond</a> is made available (that's May 15th).</p>




<p>Elsewhere in&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>news, a board game adaptation based on the popular shooter was <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/helldivers-2-board-game-fully-funded-in-12-minutes-on-gamefound" rel="nofollow">recently fully crowdfunded in just 12 minutes</a>, demonstrating there's still a clear appetite for bringing managed democracy to Super Earth's enemies.</p>

<p>Despite that, the game's creative director Johan Pilestedt <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-johan-pilestedt-sabbatical" rel="nofollow">revealed back in January</a>&nbsp;that he's taking an extended break from working on&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>, and that when he returns, he'll be devoting his attention to Arrowhead's next game.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/helldivers-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>. The game's latest update is out now.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Stellar Blade PC Release Seemingly Leaked for June]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-pc-release-june-leak</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stellar-blade-pc-release-seemingly-leaked-for-june.1187880/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-pc-release-june-leak<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It looks like that mooted&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>PC release is about to be announced, if a recent trailer uploaded to the PlayStation YouTube channel is anything to go by.</p>

<p>As spotted by Redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stellarblade/comments/1kkza3w/someone_made_an_oopsie_pc_trailer_june_11th/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Alekstra</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/05/stellar-blade-for-pc-launches-june-11-alongside-complete-edition" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gematsu</a>), a trailer was uploaded, then hastily deleted, to the official YouTube channel for PlayStation. The trailer confirms that&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>is set to hit PC on June 11th.</p>

<p>According to said trailer, when&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>does arrive on PC, it'll bring a lot of the features you'd expect from a release on the platform, including support for DLSS 4 and FSR 3 (but not FSR 4, unfortunately), an unlocked frame rate, and ultrawide display support.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stellar-blade-pc-release-leak-june.jpg?itok=oOLEr5F6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stellar-blade-pc-release-leak-june.jpg?itok=rWycVjeP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Cheer up, Eve. It looks like you'll be coming to PC soon after all.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as new technical features, the PC version will also add an extra boss fight against Sentinel leader Mann, plus 25 new outfits to try on. Hey, at least Shift Up knows its audience, I suppose.</p>

<p>Of course, the game will also be compatible with the DualSense controller on PC, and the PC version will support haptic feedback and trigger effects too. You won't have to use a DualSense, though.</p>

<p>There's no word on whether these extra features will be added to the PS5 version of&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>as well, but I think it's a pretty safe bet that they will be, so you should be able to enjoy the new outfits and boss fight even if you're still on PS5.</p>

<p>Technically, this hasn't been announced officially yet, but given that the trailer was uploaded to the PlayStation YouTube channel before being removed, it's fairly safe to assume the June 11th release date is legit.</p>




<p>A PC version of&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>has been talked about for some time now. Back <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-sales-one-million" rel="nofollow">in June last year</a>, developer Shift Up said it was actively considering releasing the game on PC, and it made comments to the same effect in its <a href="https://shiftup.co.kr/eng/ir/ir.php?ptype=view&amp;code=ir_eng&amp;idx=203&amp;category=" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Q3 2024 financial report</a> as well.</p>

<p>It's likely the&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>PC port will be officially revealed soon. For now, though, you can check the game out on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/stellar-blade/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and you can read our Austin's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/stellar-blade-review-mother-sphere-knows-best" rel="nofollow">review of it here</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-5-phantom-x-western-release-atlus-tease</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/persona-5-the-phantom-x-western-release-teased-by-atlus.1187838/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-5-phantom-x-western-release-atlus-tease<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It looks like free-to-play mobile game&nbsp;<em>Persona 5: The Phantom X&nbsp;</em>is about to break free of its China-exclusive moorings and make its way West, if a new teaser image is anything to go by.</p>

<p>Over on social media platform X, Atlus <a href="https://x.com/Atlus_West/status/1922064435763438012" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">posted</a> a single image of artwork for&nbsp;<em>Persona 5: The Phantom X</em>&nbsp;earlier today, together with the captions "Think you dropped this..." and "Stay tuned!".</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the announcement wasn't accompanied by any kind of release window, nor do we know exactly when we can expect more news about the Western release of the game. Still, it looks like the mobile RPG is definitely making its way to Western shores, at the very least.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/persona-5-the-phantom-x-atlus-city.jpg?itok=mcrrblmE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/persona-5-the-phantom-x-atlus-city.jpg?itok=2Y8zCD9U 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Persona 5: The Phantom X&nbsp;</em>hasn't been released outside of China yet.</figcaption></figure><p>Many <a href="https://x.com/clevercolt64/status/1922070053752656266" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">people</a> in the replies to Atlus' post (including <a href="https://x.com/discord/status/1922081428956664148" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Discord</a>, perhaps semi-jokingly) are <a href="https://x.com/Soyskay96/status/1922067835708215359" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">speculating</a> that the announcement could refer to&nbsp;<em>Persona 6</em>, or at least to a new game in the&nbsp;<em>Persona 5&nbsp;</em>series, but the artwork in question is for&nbsp;<em>The Phantom X</em>, so you'll want to adjust your expectations accordingly.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Persona 5: The Phantom X</em>, it's a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-5-phantom-x-announced-for-mobile-platforms-in-china" rel="nofollow">free-to-play mobile-focused RPG</a> that follows a new group of characters who find themselves able to use Personas.</p>

<p>Like mainline&nbsp;<em>Persona&nbsp;</em>games, <i>The Phantom X&nbsp;</i>is split between <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-5-phantom-x-looks-too-good-to-be-confined-to-mobile-in-new-trailer" rel="nofollow">dungeon-crawling and social simulation gameplay</a>, but since this is a free-to-play mobile game, it uses energy-style mechanics to regulate timing for the social sim side rather than a standard calendar system.</p>

<p>It's one of a number of&nbsp;<em>Persona 5&nbsp;</em>spinoffs, alongside tactical RPG&nbsp;<em>Persona 5 Tactica</em>, dancing game&nbsp;<em>Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight</em>, and the more action-heavy&nbsp;<em>Persona 5 Strikers</em>.</p>

Hopefully, it won't be too long before we learn more about the Western release of this one.</p>
