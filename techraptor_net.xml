            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-successor-will-be-backwards-compatible<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In Nintendo's 'Corporate Management Policy Briefing', aligning with their recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-sales-nintendo-financials" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom Sold 2.5m Copies in Four Days">second quarter fiscal release</a>, the company made several key announcements about their next console. The biggest of these is that the Nintendo Switch successor will be backwards compatible.</p>

<p>In a post on the social media platform <a href="https://x.com/nintendocoltd/status/1853972163033968794" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Nintendo Company Limited Post about backward compatibility">formerly known as Twitter</a>, President Furukawa shared the announcement stating:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"<span>At today's Corporate Management Policy Briefing, we announced that Nintendo Switch software will also be playable on the successor to Nintendo Switch."</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p><span>In their policy briefing, Nintendo further elaborates stating that, "consumers will be able to choose their next purchase from a broad selection of titles released for Nintendo Switch." While stopping short of promising that all titles will be purchasable on the new platform, it does indicate that there are plans for purchasing Switch games on their new console.</span></p>

<p><span>Additionally, Furukawa announced that Nintendo Switch Online will be on the Nintendo Switch successor, providing even further backwards compatibility of sorts. It presumably means that the games on Switch Online via emulation will also be available on their next console in this way.</span></p>

<p>As we near the end of the Switch's lifespan, we can expect to hear more about the Switch successor, as it will be announced by the end of the 2024 fiscal year, which for Nintendo ends in March 2025. Complementing this we can expect some celebratory stats about the Switch, as its sales are declining heavily, thus we are going to see more lifetime stats, even as Nintendo is predicting to sell 1m less Switch's than it predicted at the start of the year.</p>



<p>For example, Nintendo's corporate presentation shared that it has sold throughout its lifetime over 1.3 billion pieces of software, the most ever on a Nintendo console. Every year, over 100 million people are playing Nintendo Switch, with the last year having 127m players getting on the console at least once since October 2023, as counted by Nintendo accounts on devices.</p>

<p>Nintendo talks some more about their structure of business in console gaming going forward, which can help us see some of what the Nintendo Switch successor might be aiming to do. The first is the mention of merging of handheld and console, creating a unified ecosystem for Nintendo titles. This gets three separate slides in the presentation, and with the announced backwards compatibility seems extremely like to continue.</p>

<p>The second point is a focus on consumer touchpoints, such as dedicated Nintendo spots in retail (apparently in Japan only for now it appears), and providing more ways for users to digitally purchase software. One could see the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-music-app-announced" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" Nintendo Announces Bespoke Music Streaming App Nintendo Music">Nintendo Music App</a> as another way of this digital outreach. Another way is through free updates and DLC, which gets emphasized, including as a way to revitalize titles.</p>

<p>Nintendo Switch Online is another example of this, with them sharing there are over 34 million Nintendo Switch Online members as of September 30th. While they have seen a decline in subscriptions, which they attribute to fewer new releases, they have seen more people opting to get the more expensive Expansion Pack part of the service as well.</p>



<p>Nintendo is preparing for the future without the Nintendo Switch as its main money maker, and setting up to match the other major consoles with the offer of backwards compatibility, and otherwise interoperablility between generations. Sometime, in the next five months, we can expect Nintendo to finally replace that question mark with an actual device and name.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/talisman-alliances-review-work-together-for-even-harder-challenge<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Setting out on an adventure across the world of Talisman, in a quest for the Crown of Command, has always been a perilous and lonely one. With the release of <em>Talisman Alliances</em>&nbsp;Avalon Hill flipped the formula on its head turning <em>Talisman </em>into a cooperative experience where you'll party up with all other players to take on the game itself.</p>

<h2>What is in the <em>Talisman Alliances</em> box?</h2>

<p>Opening up the <em>Talisman Alliances</em> game box you'll immediately be greeted with a warning. This warning is to indicate to you that while there's a lot present in the box, you need to be following the instructions to not only ensure how to set up the game, but what you aren't allowed to look at.</p>

<p>The box comes with instructions, Doom tracker and token, Villain Strength and Craft tokens, as well as Adventure, Spell, and Villain cards.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The most interesting aspect of this box to inquisitive players will be the Trial 1 card, the sealed envelopes, and the small boxes that state "Don't Open Until You've Completed Trial X"</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/talisman-alliances-instructions.jpg?itok=jtMG1PrG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/talisman-alliances-instructions.jpg?itok=SCWyMfz7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In order to be a good cooperative game the team at Avalon Hill haven't just created a way for a party of players to have a focus for their adventure, but they have built a narrative into the game. Each Trial has an introductory story, a relevant loose plot, and a conclusion that tees up the next adventure.</p>

<p>Each subsequent trial also has an increased difficulty and allows you to not only progress the story, but also unlock new characters for the base game. I won't go too far into the spoilers but after completing Trial 1 you unlock the ghostly Will Of The Wisp character adding new mechanics and an expanded way to play not just in the cooperative expansion, but as a way to further enhance the base game.</p>

<p>In this way, <em>Talisman Alliances</em> reminded me of what I've seen for examples of game progression in titles like Frosthaven.</p>

<h2>Changes To Setup</h2>

<p>The instruction booklet shows you exactly how you're mean to set up <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fd34cf48-e3d7-4dbb-ab3c-d2e1a4c191be" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/talisman-5e-review-fast-paced-high-fantasy-adventures"><em>Talisman 5e</em></a> to function as a cooperative adventure.</p>

<p>This process isn't entirely simple, requiring you to filter out a number of Adventure and Magic cards, sub in different cards from the expansion, and then add the Villain Cards in a very specific manner to the Adventure deck to allow for a better pace and balance.</p>

<p>While it might not be simple it does show how much planning went into how to take a game that has historically been very competitive and turn it into an entirely cooperative experience.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/talisman-alliances-active-play.jpg?itok=ZxjhcMQP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/talisman-alliances-active-play.jpg?itok=Ev1a3S3U 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>How Does It Work?</h2>

<p>For<em> Talisman Alliances</em> the goal of the game is to complete each of the prescribed Trials. Each Trial has a sealed and an unsealed state. For example the first Trial has the players obtaining two Talismans, either from the Adventure deck or by completing the regular other Talisman-obtaining tasks, and burying those Talismans in two of the four corners of the map.</p>

<p>Completing this then unseals the Trial, flipping over the card you're now given additional instructions as well as the true villain of the Trial. While this does end up leading you to the center of the map in Trial 1 the rest of the trials take you to different objectives around the board.</p>

<p>Unsealing the Trial will also reveal the winning objective. This is a powerful creature that will have appeared somewhere on the board. Once you've built your strength up enough one, or multiple, members of the party can join up in battle to try to thwart this foe.</p>



<p>These boss fights are hard, progressing through the trials you'll see cases where these monsters aren't just stronger (with stats going into the mid to high teens) but they will also start to have additional mechanics or multiple lives. Cooperation doesn't just become a side effect of the game, but a necessity, as you start filling into certain RPG roles where you can.</p>

<p>If you were the type of competitive <em>Talisman </em>player before then interacting with the game in this way will force you to have just as competitive friends as some of these fights are a real uphill struggle.</p>

<h2>The Villains Who Try To Stop You</h2>

<p>The primary antagonists aren't the only thing getting in your way as you'll also have to deal with a number of Villains that will be roaming the board.</p>



<p>Villains act as a natural hazard around the game board, some are placed at the start of the game while others are revealed naturally as the Adventure deck is drawn from. Each of these Villains when pulled trigger a turn for the game's AI. Here Villains will progress around the board with simplistic movements until they reach a player and fight them.</p>

<p>It's in the best interest for the stronger players to try to seek out these encounters, while the squishier classes move out of the line of danger.</p>

<p>I played the Troll, a character that starts out very strong, but in a regular game of <em>Talisman </em>his low Craft and Fate would be a massive detriment. In <em>Talisman Alliances</em> where I didn't need to worry about other players preying on my weaknesses, but working to support them, it was a lot of fun coordinating attacks and grouping up to take on some of these terrifying Villain characters.</p>

<p>I was very interested to try playing <em>Talisman Alliances</em> after my experiences, I wondered how a game build based on competitive competition would achieve this shift and they absolutely nailed it.</p>

<p>Sure there's extra legwork to assemble/disassemble it into it's competitive game mode but the goals to complete and the way you approach even character selection is so wildly different it almost feels like playing an entirely different game.</p>

<p>I do feel like the difficulty scale probably could have started a bit easier, but after a first loss it left my table rearing for another try now that we really understood how each of us had to fit our role.</p>

<p>Keeping in mind that the buy-in to this experience is not only <em>Talisman Alliances</em> but also the base <em>Talisman </em>game I'd definitely recommend trying the original first, but if the idea of playing that as a party against powerful enemies is up your alley then you'll have a blast.</p>

<p><em>Blades in the Dark: Deep Cuts</em> is available right now in PDF form for $10.00. It is also sold in a bundle with the original <em>Blades in the Dark</em> for $27. There are currently no plans for a physical release.</p>
