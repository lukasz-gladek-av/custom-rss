            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-roadmap-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Kinetic Games has shared the&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>roadmap for 2025, showing what you can expect from the multiplayer-focused ghost-hunting horror game throughout the rest of this year.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.kineticgames.co.uk/blog/phasmophobia-2025-roadmap" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on its blog, Kinetic splits said&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>roadmap into three elements: major updates, maps and reworks, and seasonal events. In the first column, you can look forward to the Chronicle update first, which will revamp evidence recording and bring "a few extra bits". It has no release date yet, sadly.</p>

<p><em>Phasmophobia</em>'s second major update this year will bring a player character overhaul to give you more choices when it comes to your ghost hunter. You can expect refreshed models, improved animations, and more. Full customization, however, isn't coming until 2026.</p>

Kinetic is keeping its cards close to its chest, but the developer does say the map will be "small" and based in a "totally unique" location.</p>

<p>Reworks are also coming for several maps. You can expect redone versions of Bleasdale and Grafton Farmhouses, as well as 6 Tanglewood Drive.</p>

<p>The first rework for Bleasdale Farmhouse will arrive sometime in March, Kinetic says, and the latter two will be coming sometime later in the year. In 2026, more map reworks and new maps will be coming, although Kinetic doesn't share any details about those.</p>

<p>Finally, the new 2025&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>roadmap looks ahead to seasonal events, with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-crimson-eye-update" rel="nofollow">Halloween</a> and winter events repeating "with the same themes" this year. A "new take" on the Easter event will also be coming in April.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-extended-after-psn-outage.1104948/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-extended<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has announced that the upcoming second week of February's&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>open beta will be extended thanks to a recent PSN outage that saw many unable to log into PlayStation's online services.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1888907040879485237" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message</a> on X, Capcom says the open beta period, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/second-monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta" rel="nofollow">set to begin on February 13th</a> (or 14th depending on your timezone), will be extended by 24 hours. That means it'll now be coming to an end on either February 17th or 18th, again dependent on timezone.</p>

<p>If you're a PC or Xbox player, don't worry; the open beta has been extended across all platforms, so even if you weren't directly affected by the outage, you'll still be able to enjoy the game for an extra day.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-extended-fleeing.jpg?itok=IrkoceCC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-extended-fleeing.jpg?itok=DgdAHT5k 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' open beta has been extended by a day.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as the extension itself, Capcom has also <a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1888907223285256244" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">confirmed</a> that the rewards you'll get for participating in the open beta will remain available for the additional day, so you don't need to miss out on those.</p>

<p>The PSN outage to which Capcom is referring <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/live/playstation-network-outage-february-2025-live" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">began on Friday evening</a> (Eastern time) and was resolved the following day, meaning PSN was unavailable for around a 24-hour period.</p>

<p>Sony hasn't revealed the reason behind the outage, simply putting it down to an "operational issue" in an apologetic <a href="https://x.com/AskPlayStation/status/1888454556125708758" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message on X</a>.</p>

<p>If you're a PlayStation Plus member, then you'll be getting an extra five days of subscription by way of apology. Non-PS Plus members don't get anything, but it looks like it doesn't matter which tier you're subscribed to, at least.</p>




<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, it's the upcoming next major installment in the&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>series. The game will see you sally forth into the Forbidden Lands to investigate rumors of a mysterious monster attacking villages.</p>

<p>Along the way, you will, of course, hunt and kill plenty of monsters, collecting unique gear and discovering a deep ecosystem as you go.</p>

<p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/monster-hunter-wilds/9NMT6XFN0LVD" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on February 28th. You can check out our <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/monster-hunter-wilds-preview-wildly-impressive" rel="nofollow">preview of the game here</a> to find out how it's shaping up.</p>
