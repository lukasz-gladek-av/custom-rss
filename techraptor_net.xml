            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>The Elder Scrolls 6&nbsp;</em>director and Bethesda studio head Todd Howard has some bad news for you: the game is not launching anytime soon.</p>

<p>In a new <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/fallout-4-anniversary-todd-howard-interview" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">interview</a> with GQ, Howard says that&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls 6&nbsp;</em>(which still doesn't have its&nbsp;<em>Morrowind&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Skyrim</em>-style secondary title) is "still a long way off", although it is "the everyday thing" on which Bethesda is currently working.</p>

<p>Howard says that his "perfect version" of&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls 6</em>'s launch is that "it's going to be a while and then, one day, the game will just appear", calling the&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remaster's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-released" rel="nofollow">shadowdrop</a> a "test run" that "worked out well". It sounds like&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls 6&nbsp;</em>may well have no fanfare at all when it does eventually release.</p>

Back in September 2023, he said that the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elder-scrolls-vi-after-2026-no-ps5" rel="nofollow">would launch in "2026 or later"</a>, and that it probably wouldn't appear on the PlayStation 5. Of course, that may well have changed in the interim, given Xbox's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sea-of-thieves-grounded-and-pentiment-officially-announced-for-playstation-platforms" rel="nofollow">new multiplatform strategy</a>.</p>

<p>The last we heard of&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls 6</em>&nbsp;was in February this year, when Bethesda announced that it would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elder-scrolls-vi-auction-charity-npc" rel="nofollow">hold a charity auction</a> allowing the winner to create their very own character to appear in the game. We still don't know where the RPG will take place or what its story might look like.</p>

<p>As a quick reminder,&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls 6&nbsp;</em>was originally announced all the way back in 2018. The reveal was so long ago that it predates Microsoft's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-acquires-zenimax-media-for-75-billion" rel="nofollow">acquisition of Bethesda and its parent company ZeniMax</a>.</p>

<p>When the game was announced, it was through a trailer that simply showed a logo for&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls 6</em>, along with a rural fantasy landscape. To date, that's still all we have in terms of the art direction and location for the highly-anticipated RPG.</p>




<p>It remains to be seen whether any more news on&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls 6&nbsp;</em>will be revealed in the near future (or, indeed, throughout the rest of next year). Stay tuned for more.</p>
