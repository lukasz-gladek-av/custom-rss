            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Just Cause&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Mad Max&nbsp;</em>developer Avalanche Studios has announced that it will be laying off some of its employees, and that it intends to close down its UK location.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://avalanchestudios.com/stories/studio-update" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news update</a> on its official website, Avalanche says these layoffs are happening in order to "best ensure Avalanche Studios Group's long-term success", blaming "current challenges to [its] business and the industry".</p>

<p>The developer's UK location, which is based in Liverpool, will be closed, and staff reductions will also be happening at its Malmo and Stockholm offices, although Avalanche stops short of revealing exactly how many employees will be losing their jobs, or which departments the layoffs will hit hardest.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avalanche-studios-layoffs-just-cause-4.jpg?itok=U8UnXseI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avalanche-studios-layoffs-just-cause-4.jpg?itok=071uBIfE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Avalanche Studios is best known for the&nbsp;<em>Just Cause&nbsp;</em>series.</figcaption></figure><p>The studio closes by saying that its "immediate focus" is helping those who are losing their jobs, and that it remains "deeply committed to providing amazing games" to its "passionate player communities".</p>

<p>News of Avalanche Studios' layoffs and UK studio closure comes after reports that&nbsp;<em>Contraband</em>, the game the studio was working on for Xbox Game Studios, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/contraband-canceled-report-avalanche-studios" rel="nofollow">was canceled</a> as part of a wider wave of layoffs and cancellations at Microsoft.</p>

<p>That wave also hit the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">Rare's&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">Everwild</a>&nbsp;</em>and The Initiative's <i>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</i>reboot, with the latter's cancellation also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">resulting in the demise of the studio</a>.</p>

<p><em>Contraband</em>'s cancellation was, perhaps, not particularly surprising; the game was announced all the way back in 2021, and between then and its eventual shutdown, both Avalanche and Xbox were very quiet indeed about the project.</p>

<p>As far as we know, Avalanche Software isn't being hit by layoffs, although given the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warner-bros-financials-2024-revenue-falls" rel="nofollow">dire time</a> Warner Bros. has been having in the gaming space recently, news of layoffs or closures wouldn't come as a surprise. Stay tuned for more on all things industry-related.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties-movie</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/yakuza-kiwami-3s-dark-ties-addon-was-originally-just-a-movie.1312417/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has revealed that&nbsp;<em>Dark Ties</em>, the fully-fledged spinoff launching alongside&nbsp;<em>Yakuza Kiwami 3&nbsp;</em>in February, was originally intended as a movie before being expanded into a playable game.</p>

<p><i>Dark Ties&nbsp;</i>was announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties-announced" rel="nofollow">alongside <i>Yakuza Kiwami 3&nbsp;</i>last week</a>; while <em>Kiwami 3&nbsp;</em>was&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/yakuza-kiwami-3-apparently-leaked" rel="nofollow">leaked via an accidental listing</a> on the developer's official website prior to the reveal, <em>Dark Ties&nbsp;</em>was a surprise. It's a spinoff that revolves around Yoshitaka Mine, a prominent character in the original&nbsp;<em>Yakuza 3</em>.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202509/53863" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Famitsu</a> interview (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/yakuza-dark-ties-was-originally-supposed-to-be-just-a-viewable-movie-but-rgg-studio-couldnt-miss-out-on-its-last-opportunity-to-make-mine-playable/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Automaton</a>), game director Ryosuke Horii says that&nbsp;<em>Dark Ties&nbsp;</em>was supposed to be "something that could be viewed like a video", but that the "best way" to tell the expansion's story would be to allow players to play as Mine themselves.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties-mine-cigarette.jpg?itok=YqWu-Q8y 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties-mine-cigarette.jpg?itok=Lhs4ox6R 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dark Ties&nbsp;</em>has been significantly expanded compared to its humble origins.</figcaption></figure><p>Additionally, Yoshitaka Mine is, according to series producer Hiroyuki Sakamoto, one of the franchise's most popular characters. Supposedly, he consistently places in the top five when polls are conducted to discover fans' favorites.</p>

<p>Given that&nbsp;<em>Yakuza 3&nbsp;</em>(and, now,&nbsp;<em>Yakuza Kiwami 3</em>) is Mine's only appearance, the team thought it was the right thing to do to make him playable rather than relegating him to a simple movie project.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Dark Ties</em>, it's a spinoff of&nbsp;<em>Yakuza Kiwami 3&nbsp;</em>in which you'll play as Mine, discovering new side stories and a new "boxing-based combat" system that stand in contrast to Kazuma Kiryu's established fighting style.</p>

<p>Rather than being paid DLC,&nbsp;<em>Dark Ties&nbsp;</em>will launch alongside&nbsp;<em>Yakuza Kiwami 3</em>, and it'll be included with the main game at no additional cost.</p>




<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Yakuza Kiwami 3&nbsp;</em>itself, it's a remake of&nbsp;<em>Yakuza 3</em>, which takes us back to a younger Kiryu as he juggles his responsibilities to his orphanage and to the yakuza clan he's left behind.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Yakuza Kiwami 3&nbsp;</em>when it launches on February 12th for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3937550/Yakuza_Kiwami_3__Dark_Ties/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10015219" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties/9n2370ncnw1m" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties-switch-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p>
