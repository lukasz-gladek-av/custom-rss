Suffice it to say that <em>RuneScape </em>at the end of 2026 should look a lot different to how it looks today.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>RuneScape</em>'s 25th anniversary is shaping up to be special.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In April, player character avatars will be completely updated, with features like models, animations, and hairstyles getting an overhaul. More updates will be introduced "based on community feedback" as well.</p><p>You'll gain more control over your house this year, too, allowing you to build a space that "feels personal, welcoming, and worth visiting", according to Jagex. The Construction skill will increase to 120, and you'll get a new recipe system that lets you unlock and build new furniture.</p><p>It's not all tweaks to existing systems and features, though. <em>RuneScape </em>is also getting "the largest area expansion" in its history in the form of Havenhythe, which will be arriving "in multiple parts throughout the year".</p><p>Havenhythe is a "progressively vampiric" area that brings new quests, new early-game bosses, and a new level cap for your Hunter skill, with new story and boss content also arriving later in the year.</p>
<p>News of <em>RuneScape</em>'s overhaul comes after Jagex <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/jagex-layoffs" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="611f0a88-3fdc-4d5c-a015-22d2ff230293" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">laid off a number of employees</a> back in June in order to "increase agility", although the studio clarified that the "vast majority" of those layoffs were in "non-game development and non-player-facing functions".</p><p>You can check out <em>RuneScape </em>for free right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1343400/RuneScape/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC via Steam</a>, as well as on mobile devices.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Scottish police and fire crews have been called to Rockstar North's Edinburgh HQ to respond to reports of an explosion, an incident that police describe as "ongoing".</p><p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/explosion-reported-at-rockstar-north-studio-as-police-cordon-off-gta-development-building-3306152/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dexerto</a>, the explosion was reported at around 5am local time today, with a spokesperson confirming that the call resulted in the mobilization of "three pumps and four of our specialist appliances".</p><p>At time of writing, the incident hasn't been closed yet; Edinburgh fire and police services are still on the scene "with other agencies", although specialist fire crews departed around four hours after the fire began. Additionally, there have been "no reported casualties", so thankfully, it sounds like nobody's been hurt.</p><figure role="group">

<p>At present, it's thought that the explosion was caused by some kind of boiler issue; Dexerto says that "reports from the area" point to a boiler room as the source of the blast, so it sounds as though the damage was accidental, although it's hard to say this early on.</p><p>Just in case you need a reminder, Rockstar North is the studio responsible for <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, which is currently scheduled to be released <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-november-2026" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e57d7053-b3ca-42ed-afdb-4ef5c5958b99" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">in November this year</a> after two <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-vi-release-date-delay" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fbc88268-1772-45bc-9881-7e2e1cd1ca6d" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">delays</a> pushed it back from its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-released-early-following-leak-coming-in-2025" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6fad3f9b-bebd-4488-8603-3fe30fd9ffe3" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">original 2025 release window</a>.</p><p>The game is one of the most hotly-anticipated releases on the calendar this year. It'll follow two protagonists, Jason and Lucia, and it'll be set in the fictional state of Leonida, which is based on Florida (which means you'll be able to visit Vice City once again).</p><p>It's unclear whether the explosion will hamper <em>GTA 6</em>'s development any further. Let's hope that operations resume as normal and that employees are able to return to work safely.</p>
<p>This explosion also comes just a couple of months after Rockstar <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rockstar-union-busting-accusation-gta-6" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2fb963bf-6dd1-47b3-bfbd-3f16511b3076" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">fired a number of employees</a> who were involved in union activity, a move that parent company Take-Two insists wasn't motivated by union-busting.</p><p>Following that decision, hundreds of Rockstar employees <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rockstar-employees-letter" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="419ae453-4f41-4d14-ac9c-25d978963601" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">banded together to write an open letter</a> demanding the terminated employees' reinstatement, although it doesn't sound as though Take-Two acceded to that demand.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Marc-Alexis Côté, the former boss of the <em>Assassin's Creed </em>franchise at Ubisoft, is suing his ex-employer to the tune of over $1.3 million, alleging "constructive dismissal".</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/2221328/marc-alexis-cote-ubisoft-assassins-creed" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CBC Radio Canada</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/former-assassins-creed-boss-sues-ubisoft-for-more-than-1-3-million-alleging-constructive-dismissal/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">VGC</a>), Côté says that during Ubisoft's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-creative-houses-q1-financials" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="acd9f3a1-9a63-4e42-9b91-122a243964e9" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">reshuffle into its new Creative House structure</a>, he was told Ubisoft would be looking for a new "Head of Franchise" to oversee the three major IPs allocated to its new Vantage label (i.e. <em>Assassin's Creed</em>, <em>Far Cry</em>, and <em>Rainbow Six</em>).</p><p>Côté says he wasn't considered for this position and was instead offered a role as "Head of Production", which he says would have meant he lost the chance to oversee the <em>Assassin's Creed </em>franchise and to make creative decisions about it.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Ex-<em>Assassin's Creed </em>boss Marc-Alexis Côté is suing Ubisoft.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As Côté tells it, Ubisoft offered him a leadership position at one of its new Creative Houses, but Côté saw this as a demotion since the Creative Houses wouldn't be in charge of Ubisoft's first-tier franchises.</p><p>Following this, Côté took two weeks off work, and when he returned, Ubisoft gave him an ultimatum to accept the job or not. Côté declined and formally demanded severance pay from Ubisoft, which he says they didn't give him.</p><p>For context, Côté <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-boss-leaves-ubisoft-report" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bedd26ab-2db9-443d-9a58-5d57561ce134" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">departed Ubisoft in October last year</a>. According to the studio, his departure was voluntary, with the company stating that he had decided to "pursue a new path elsewhere outside of Ubisoft".</p><p>That's why Côté is demanding such a high sum of money; it effectively amounts to two years' worth of severance pay, as well as an extra $75,000 for moral damages (i.e. harm to his reputation and an abuse of power on Ubisoft's part).</p><figure role="group">
