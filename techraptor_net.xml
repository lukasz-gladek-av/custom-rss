            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloodborne-producer-teruyuki-toriyama-sirius-studio<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Producer Teruyuki Toriyama, who worked on the likes of&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>and 2020's&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls&nbsp;</em>remake has opened up a brand new studio, and it sounds like he's going big right out of the gate.</p>

<p>According to an Automaton Media <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/bloodborne-demons-souls-producer-establishes-new-game-company-sirius-studio-following-departure-from-sie-japan-studio/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, Toriyama's new venture will be called Sirius Studio, and it's been opened under the auspices of Osaka's Gz Group, which is usually focused on creating games in the PC and mobile spaces, as well as VR games.</p>

<p>Despite that, Automaton says Toriyama's Sirius Studio will be focusing on making "high-end console" games, as well as VR and XR (virtual and extended reality) titles. Sirius' efforts will span a range of both new and existing IPs as well.</p>

<p>Toriyama's time as a producer with Sony's Japan Studio includes credits on the likes of&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls&nbsp;</em>(both in its original form and its remade version),&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne</em>, and the PS Vita game&nbsp;<em>Freedom Wars</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/freedom-wars-remastered-announced" rel="nofollow">got a remaster earlier this year</a>.</p>

<p>He left Japan Studio, as well as Sony as a whole, in 2020, and his former outfit was subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-japan-studio-reportedly-shutting-down-this-year" rel="nofollow">shut down in 2021</a>&nbsp;(which may be a significant contributing factor in the lack of a&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>remaster or remake).</p>

<p>After working with Sony, Toriyama moved to&nbsp;<em>Soul Covenant&nbsp;</em>developer Thirdverse, but according to a Famitsu <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202504/38560" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">interview</a> (with Automaton's translation), he left when it became clear Thirdverse was shifting away from higher-end console and PC game development.</p>

<p>Additionally, layoffs are still sweeping across the industry, affecting <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-studio-shockingly-closed-by-netease-laying-off-everyone" rel="nofollow">bigger</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bossa-studios-layoffs-restructuring" rel="nofollow">smaller</a> studios alike. Toriyama certainly faces a challenge in founding a new studio and creating a high-budget game in this climate, so let's hope he and Sirius can surmount that challenge.</p>
