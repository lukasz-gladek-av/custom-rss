            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-browser-workaround-discovered<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Enterprising PS5 players have once again found a way to access the console's hidden browser feature, circumventing crackdowns Sony recently put in place to attempt to stop people using the last method that worked.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2024/12/27/ps5-browser-new-workaround-december-2024/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation Lifestyle</a>, Sony recently implemented a fix for a browser workaround wherein users could include Google or Bing search links in messages they sent to one another, thereby allowing them to access the browser via those links.</p>

<p>Those links are now automatically removed whenever a message containing one is sent, but clever PS5 players have found another way to access the console's browser, and amusingly enough, it still involves sending a message with an embedded link.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ps5-browser-workaround-grinning-player.jpg?itok=4Eg96P1b 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ps5-browser-workaround-grinning-player.jpg?itok=h9r1YB5d 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'd better not be accessing the PS5's browser, friend.</figcaption></figure><p>The latest workaround, per <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/1hn1iit/how_to_use_google_on_ps5_not_patched/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Redditor Andreo_11</a>, involves messaging another player a link to Wikipedia. After receiving said link, all you need to do is search for the Wikipedia page on Bing, and you'll find a link to the search engine on that very page.</p>

<p>The Redditor doesn't say whether or not this works for Google, but at the very least, you can still access all your favorite websites through Bing using this simple trick. Whether or not Sony decides to patch it out in future is another matter, of course.</p>

<p>If you're wondering why Sony wants to stop people accessing its console's web browser, it's likely because the browser is the main method by which many PS5 users mod or jailbreak their consoles, and, well, let's just say Sony doesn't look too kindly on such behavior.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ps5-browser-workaround-bing.jpg?itok=6_46ygPk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ps5-browser-workaround-bing.jpg?itok=d9xivkDw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Wikipedia page for Bing is a big part of the latest PS5 browser workaround.</figcaption></figure><p>This new workaround comes after Sony <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1hk1qxa/psa_sending_googlecom_urls_is_now_a_breach_of_the/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reportedly sent breach-of-conduct emails</a> to users who were utilizing the previous message-based trick, with that workaround apparently falling under the "sharing malicious URLs" provision of said code of conduct.</p>

<p>Of course, since the new workaround also involves sending links in messages, there's no guarantee Sony won't go after you for using this one as well. Player discretion is very much advised.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that Microsoft's Xbox line allows you to use the company's Edge browser with no impediments. Nintendo, of course, doesn't allow you to use the Switch's browser, although it does have one hidden away, and accessing it isn't particularly difficult.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/infinity-nikki-version-1-1</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/infinity-nikki-version-1-1-brings-new-outfits-and-more-next-week.1069896/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/infinity-nikki-version-1-1<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Infold Games has announced the release date for the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>Version 1.1 update, as well as the kind of content you can expect when said update lands.</p>

<p>The cozy open-world adventure's first major update will bring the Shooting Star Season with it on December 30th, and the season will run until January 23rd, introducing plenty more stuff to do and collect.</p>

<p>Infold says that the Shooting Star Season will usher in "shimmering meteors" that shoot over the skies of Miraland, bringing with them "festive decorations" that should give your surroundings an even more relaxing and chilled-out feel.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/infinity-nikki-version-1.1-shooting-star-season.jpg?itok=KapKM2ZH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/infinity-nikki-version-1.1-shooting-star-season.jpg?itok=JB8KMyZ2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You can look forward to new activities and more when&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>Version 1.1 drops.</figcaption></figure><p>Along with the new decorations, you can also look forward to new storylines being added to the game, as well as new platforming challenges to test your prowess. Don't worry, though; they'll almost certainly be just as low-stakes as the main game.</p>

<p>Infold is also promising new "time-limited events" to enjoy in Version 1.1, and it wouldn't be an <i>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</i>update without new outfits to get excited about as well. The ones shown off in the trailer look suitably breathtaking.</p>

<p>It's not clear whether the outfits and other content being introduced in Version 1.1 will also be time-limited or whether you'll be able to unlock them after the season ends on January 23rd. Since this is the game's first update, we'll just have to wait and see.</p>

<p>You can check out the trailer for&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>Version 1.1, which shows off a couple of the new outfits you'll get the chance to unlock in the update, right here.</p>




<p>In case you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki</em>, it's a cozy open-world adventure game that emphasizes platforming, exploration, and relaxation over combat.</p>

<p>The game has a storyline to pursue, but you're just as welcome to spend time with Miraland's locals, take part in some minigames, or just vibe at your own pace.</p>

<p><em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>has obviously managed to strike a chord with its player base; Infold's game managed to rack up <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/infinity-nikki-downloads-10m" rel="nofollow">10 million downloads within its first few days</a>, and while many of those players will simply have been curious, that's still a whole bunch of downloads.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>right now for free on <a href="https://infinitynikki.infoldgames.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices</a>. If you'd like to know whether Miraland is worth exploring, be sure to take a look at <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/infinity-nikki-preview-open-world-fun-meets-fashion" rel="nofollow">our very own Brittany's pre-release impressions</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nier: Automata Sales Cross 9m as Eighth Anniversary Looms]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nier-automata-sales-9m</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nier-automata-sales-cross-9m-as-eighth-anniversary-looms.1069893/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nier-automata-sales-9m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Nier: Automata&nbsp;</em>sales have crossed another big milestone as the game nears its eighth anniversary, publisher Square Enix has revealed.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/NieR_JPN/status/1872522683411558507" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post on the official Japanese X account</a> for the&nbsp;<em>Nier&nbsp;</em>franchise, it's revealed that the game has managed to surpass 9 million copies sold. That's counting both physical shipments and digital sales, of course.</p>

<p>The announcement post (for which we're using machine translation) is a fairly brief and impersonal one, simply thanking fans for their continued support and hoping to rely on them for more support in the future.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nier-automata-sales-9m-engels.jpg?itok=L4xfP_7e 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nier-automata-sales-9m-engels.jpg?itok=8UjADv7X 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Nier: Automata&nbsp;</em>has crossed 9 million sales.</figcaption></figure><p>The sales milestone means that&nbsp;<em>Nier: Automata&nbsp;</em>has sold another million copies in less than a year; back in February, it was revealed that the game had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nier-automata-achieves-8-million-copies-sold" rel="nofollow">crossed the 8 million sales threshold</a>.</p>

<p>In general, it seems like sales are pretty steady for&nbsp;<em>Automata</em>; it had hit <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nier-automata-has-sold-over-75-million-copies" rel="nofollow">7.5 million sales in April 2023</a>, so it's trundling along at a pace that Square Enix will no doubt be pleased with, especially given its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-16-rebirth-profits-square-enix" rel="nofollow">need for reliable sellers</a> at this point.</p>

<p>So, what's driving&nbsp;<em>Nier: Automata</em>'s success? Well, it's a pretty well-liked game, to start with. Over on <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/3540/nier-automata" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">OpenCritic</a>, 93% of critics recommend the game, and although <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/nier-automata-review-robots-in-love" rel="nofollow">our very own Sam's review</a> is somewhat less effusive, he still praises its "unique, shocking, and interesting" story, as well as its final ten hours or so.</p>

<p>The game is also enjoying something of a resurgence elsewhere in gaming right now; it's had crossovers with the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-nier-automata-crossover" rel="nofollow"><em>Stellar Blade</em></a>, fighting game&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/granblue-fantasy-versus-rising-reveals-2b-from-nier-automata-dlc-on-top-of-vane-and" rel="nofollow"><em>Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/naraka-bladepoint-nier-crossover" rel="nofollow">battle royale game&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/naraka-bladepoint-nier-crossover" rel="nofollow">Naraka: Bladepoint</a>&nbsp;</em>in the last year or two, among others.</p>




<p>If you've somehow missed out on&nbsp;<em>Nier: Automata&nbsp;</em>up until now, you can check the game out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/524220/NieRAutomata/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0082-CUSA04551_00-GOTYORHADIGITAL0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 4</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/NieR-Automata-BECOME-AS-GODS-Edition/BPPZVT8BZ15N" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox One</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nier-automata-the-end-of-yorha-edition-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>. It's also playable on current-gen consoles thanks to the magic of backwards compatibility.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/huge-halo-leak-digsite</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/huge-halo-leak-reveals-more-than-two-decades-worth-of-material.1069872/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/huge-halo-leak-digsite<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A huge amount of&nbsp;data relating to the&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>franchise has been leaked online, including developer builds for various games, unreleased content, and more, spanning the 25-plus years&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>has been around for.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/massive-halo-leak/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Insider Gaming</a>, the leak was first spotted by dataminer and leaker <a href="https://x.com/zvis_ceral/status/1872351879843439101" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Visceral</a>, who also revealed that around 90GB of data had been leaked. The leak, according to Visceral, "contains some builds, tools, docs etc from various&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>titles".</p>

<p>Visceral also says that the leak happened because&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>steward 343 Industries (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/halo-unreal-engine-5-new-games" rel="nofollow">now known as</a> Halo Studios) enlisted the help of community modders to work on restoring cut&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>content from past games in the franchise.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/halo-leak-master-chief-collection.jpg?itok=_rPGdmG_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/halo-leak-master-chief-collection.jpg?itok=THNnMhNt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A huge amount of&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>data has leaked online.</figcaption></figure><p>The&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>leak was further confirmed by <a href="https://x.com/DogbrainLudus/status/1872256501982839002" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">X user DogbrainLudus</a>, a modder who was part of the aforementioned project, <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/digsite-deep-dive" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">known as "Digsite"</a>. He says that neither he nor any other Digsite members who recently departed the project are responsible for the leak.</p>

<p>DogbrainLudus also says he doesn't care how modders use what's in the leak, although "Microsoft might not agree". I think that's probably putting it mildly.</p>

<p>The reason for the leak hasn't been disclosed, although an exchange between Visceral and <a href="https://x.com/Rythayze/status/1872429533611393103" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">another user</a> on X <a href="https://x.com/Rythayze/status/1872457396813213968" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">suggests</a> that the team wasn't being paid for its work. A <a href="https://x.com/zel_is_here_now/status/1872578699037753350" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">third user then claims</a> the Digsite team told Halo Studios it wanted to be paid for the work it was doing and Halo Studios refused.</p>

<p>Of course, Halo Studios itself hasn't confirmed any of that information, so you should take it with a pinch of salt. Naturally, we're also not going to be listing any of the data that's leaked as part of this&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>leak; it's easy enough to find online if you look.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/halo-leak-digsite.jpg?itok=bLeZBDwp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/halo-leak-digsite.jpg?itok=MvBHREfH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Team members on the "Digsite" project were apparently responsible for the&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>leak.</figcaption></figure><p>With regards to what's next for&nbsp;<em>Halo</em>, Halo Studios has confirmed that multiple new games in the series are in the works, and that the franchise has switched from the proprietary Slipspace engine to Unreal Engine 5.</p>

<p>We also know that the next game in the&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>series is not "imminent", according to Halo Studios, so it's likely to be quite a while before you get to revisit Master Chief's story again. Stay tuned for more.</p>
