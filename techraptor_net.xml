It's in many games to justify violence, aggression, and prejudice, though few explore it in a visceral, gut-wrenching way that holds a mirror up to our souls. <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/last-of-us-part-ii" rel="nofollow"><em>The Last of Us Part II</em></a> did it (especially <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/hbos-last-of-us-season-2-review-skeleton-of-story-no-heart" rel="nofollow">with its recently finished season 2</a>), and now, I have a feeling <em>Hell Is Us</em> will be the next one to do it with similar depth.</p>

<p><em>Hell Is Us</em>, Rogue Factor's first original IP, balances weighty melee combat with cerebral investigatory gameplay reminiscent of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/outer-wilds-review-groundhog-universe" rel="nofollow"><em>The Outer Wilds</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinion/15-years-later-legacy-deus-ex" rel="nofollow"><em>Deus Ex: Human Revolution</em></a>. It's a labor of love for the small but mighty team of 50 or so developers, and a lot of it comes from the passionate vision of Creative Director Jonathan Jacques-Belletête.</p>

<p>I spent some time on site at the studio in Montreal to see the game and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/interview-how-hell-is-us-shows-true-horrors-of-violence-and-war" rel="nofollow">chat with him about the game's themes</a>. After spending two hours hands-on with <em>Hell Is Us</em>, I found myself hooked by the mysteries of its world and eager to investigate further.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hel-lis-us-remi.jpg?itok=mtJ4E1PZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hel-lis-us-remi.jpg?itok=5yBk2FPQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>The Reward of Player-Driven Exploration</h2>

<p>In <em>Hell Is Us</em>, you play as Rémi, a soldier in search of his parents whom he hasn't seen since he was 5 years old. He joins the Organized Nations (you know, the totally-not-UN) to become a Peacekeeper and then goes AWOL to sneak into Hadea, his home country. Why sneak in? Well, it's a locked-down country, much like North Korea. Even worse, it's in the midst of an ugly, brutal civil war.</p>

<p>The story setup starts in media res, with Rémi being interrogated by a surreal, unsettling man. He's forced to recount how and why he entered Hadea, which then puts you right into the gameplay, at the beginning of his journey via his recollection.</p>

<p>As you explore the countryside, you'll pick up clues and talk to NPCs, both vital to Rémi's goal of finding his parents. His data pad contains his quest log, though it's not as straightforward as you might expect from other games.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hell-is-us-captain-vaas-chat.jpg?itok=shgyczBt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hell-is-us-captain-vaas-chat.jpg?itok=wXIRfs6K 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Every conversation uncovers new information for Rémi to explore.</figcaption></figure><p>A big part of the philosophy behind <em>Hell Is Us</em> is something that Jacques-Belletête calls "player plattering," an inversion of "silver plattering." To him, signposts like quest markers and minimaps tend to deliver objectives to the player on a silver platter. It's a false form of discovery; did the player <em>really </em>discover that cave if a magical overhead map and quest marker told them it was there?</p>

<p>Instead, <em>Hell Is Us</em> harkens back to a more old-school philosophy that requires players to do a bit more digging into the world, all while making it feel more lived in. As an example, early in the game, an NPC will tell Rémi to find a vehicle that's in a forest. The entrance to the forest is to the north, but then you have to follow windchimes to get to the other side—the very same chimes his kids followed to return home, back when they were alive.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hell-is-us-investigation-web.jpg?itok=wqAGT_0h 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hell-is-us-investigation-web.jpg?itok=JXP6xLfv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Jova is the first major village players will explore in&nbsp;<em>Hell Is Us</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Already, the focus is on the details of the world and its characters, rather than an objective marker that tells you where to go. How this manifests in the data pad is similar to games like <em>The Outer Wilds</em>, where the clues are laid out in a web. It's up to you to figure out where your objectives are and how you'll get there, hence the phrase "player plattering."</p>

<p>Exploring the world is also gate checked by puzzles in the environment, though I didn't see any that were too complex. For example, match three glyphs to open a door, or discover a secret code hidden in nearby pictures.</p>

<p>This player-driven exploration creates a sense of satisfaction that I intrinsically felt whenever I chased down a lead, and it's a satisfaction that felt better than getting 100 gold for turning in some fetch quest. Fans of the recent indie breakout hit <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/blue-prince-review-i-finished-game-50-hours-ago-and-theres-still-puzzles-to-solve" rel="nofollow"><em>Blue Prince</em></a> probably know exactly what I'm talking about here--though so far <em>Hell Is Us </em>isn't nearly as complicated.</p>

<h2>Hadea Is a Land of Dark Curiosities</h2>

<p>There's more to investigate besides Rémi's personal connection to Hadea, of course. The country is a character unto itself, with many layers hiding within. The civil war between the Sabinians and Palomists paints the soil red with blood, and there are seemingly endless letters, diary entries, audio logs, and military orders that paint a full picture of hate, horror, and hubris.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hell-is-us-mural.jpg?itok=IzZv0Uu1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hell-is-us-mural.jpg?itok=ex-P7mWI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some murals in dungeons give you hints, others give you lore. Sometimes, it's both.</figcaption></figure><p>The first major Palomist town I came across was recently occupied by Sabinians, who ruthlessly killed every "devil" they could find. A mass grave sits just outside of town, while notes and other moments of environmental storytelling show just how terrified the Palomists were—and how vindictive the Sabinians are.</p>

<p>That's juxtaposed by a large tree just outside of town, where Sabinians were hanged and left to rot. Graffiti in town mocked it as a "family tree," laying out the stomach-churning tit-for-tat that's plagued Hadea. In fact, the area beforehand is laden with Palomist religious text that literally demonizes the Sabinians for believing in a false god.</p>

<p>Clearly, <em>Hell Is Us</em> paints an ugly picture of both sides of this civil war. I don't get a centrist "both sides" argument from it, though; instead, this clearly illustrates how we have a tendency to "other" certain groups, demonizing them until they aren't considered human anymore. The wider the gap gets, the more likely violence is to break out. We see it in real life, like with the Hutus and Tutsis, or North and South Korea, or... well, I'm sure you can come up with another example.</p>

<p>I saw the results of this in-game barbarism in the survivors of the conflict. A husband grieved for his lost children, who only wished for a possession of theirs so he could have a proper Palomist burial. A tooltip came up, hinting at a potential side quest there. I assume I could find one of their possessions and give it to him, which is a powerful way to turn a random fetch quest into something more meaningful to the world and its lore.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hell-is-us-graves.jpg?itok=PDr4AXNB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hell-is-us-graves.jpg?itok=8XgX7zTD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There's no shortage of human suffering and gravesites in Hadea.</figcaption></figure><p>This is all before we even get into the Hollow Walkers. Yeah, those horrific humanoid monsters with holes in them, that you saw in the trailer? According to Jacques-Belletête, they're like the manifestation of the hate and suffering that plagues Hadea. The country was hit with something called the Calamity, which is likely the supernatural cause behind these Hollow Walkers.</p>

<p>That mystery is just another thread to tug at in <em>Hell Is Us</em>. All this is to say, naturally curious minds will find a lot to sink their teeth into here. Sure, the main mystery about Rémi's parents is interesting, too, but for me, I'm curious to see what Rogue Factor has to say about human nature as a whole. It's only made even better that the player-driven gameplay neatly complements that.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hell-is-us-hollow-walker-2.jpg?itok=wVZkJP9K 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hell-is-us-hollow-walker-2.jpg?itok=RiVDj-S6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hollow Walkers aren't exactly the friendliest looking creatures.</figcaption></figure><h2>Hacking and Slashing Through Hadea</h2>

<p>While the war rages between Sabinians and Palomists, Rémi doesn't directly fight either side. Instead, he fights against Hollow Walkers using specially treated weapons and his trusty drone sidekick. He can equip weapons like swords, greatswords, and twin axes, and it's your standard light and heavy attack system.</p>

<p>Holding down either trigger gives Rémi access to four special active abilities each. One set is based on his weapon, while the other set is for his drone. He can dodge, block, and parry, too, and breaking an enemy's stance leaves them open to a big special attack.</p>

<p>All of this should sound pretty familiar if you've played third-person melee action games, and <em>Hell Is Us</em> feels mostly serviceable. The standard difficulty did feel more punishing than expected, especially for a game that is supposedly not a soulslike. However, that's something that the studio is still finessing ahead of the game's release.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hell-is-us-combat-2.jpg?itok=uJG_guW4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hell-is-us-combat-2.jpg?itok=f1CeFfPP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Regardless, fighting Hollow Walkers proved to be a little tricky. Parry windows are really tight, and the way enemies move is so erratic that it's hard to pin down exact strikes. Arguably, that's part of the point though; these creatures, despite being vaguely humanoid, are obviously anything but. It's what makes them so unsettling.</p>

<p>To add some complexity, some Hollow Walkers come with what's called a Haze, which are brightly colored, highly geometric shapes that are attached to the Walkers. You have to neutralize the Haze to make the Walker vulnerable, so you'll be fighting two enemies at once.</p>

<p>That's where abilities come in handy. The drone can distract a Walker for a certain time frame, and it can also make Rémi spin around with his weapon stretched out to damage a wide area.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hell-is-us-haze-1.jpg?itok=3lGdmqG4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hell-is-us-haze-1.jpg?itok=DC4I4-j7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Perhaps my favorite part of the combat, however, is something called the Lymbic Pulse. Every time you land a hit, some energy circles around you. When it flashes white, pressing R1 lets you absorb the energy and restore endurance (aka health). The longer the combo, the more the pulse will restore.</p>

<p>It creates a nice risk-reward system that reminded me a bit of <em>Bloodborne</em>. However, I also found that most enemies, even the basics, would nearly always attack me through any combo. I could reliably do a two-hit tap maybe 80% of the time, but anything beyond that felt like too much risk, not enough reward.</p>

<p>Overall, though, I see a lot of potential in the combat in <em>Hell Is Us</em>. What I played isn't quite where Jacques-Belletête wants it either, but I have faith that he and the team at Rogue Factor can get it to a place that's satisfying most of the time instead of some of the time.</p>



<h2><em>Hell Is Us</em> Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><em>Hell Is Us</em> is one of those game titles that feels a bit aggressively edgy, but it's an apt, concise description of the game's main themes. Hell is the human experience when you look at it through the lens of our constant proclivities toward violence and othering over the course of human history.</p>

<p>So far, I'm intrigued with what Rogue Factor is trying to say with this game, though whether the whole story will land is yet to be seen. And the combat, which has potential, has yet to really fully impress me. Nonetheless, <em>Hell Is Us</em> is a story I want to keep an eye on and explore every lead I can find.</p>

<p>If you're curious to try <em>Hell Is Us</em> for yourself, a demo will hit Steam next Monday ahead of Steam Next Fest.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/interview-how-hell-is-us-shows-true-horrors-of-violence-and-war<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In <em>Hell Is Us</em>, an information web connects all your evidence, leads, and clues, replacing the classic quest log so you can find things using your own deduction skills. It immediately reminded me of the information log in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/outer-wilds-review-groundhog-universe" rel="nofollow"><em>The Outer Wilds</em></a>.</p>

<p>Funnily enough, Rogue Factor Creative Director Jonathan Jacques-Belletête had no idea until after development of <em>Hell Is Us</em> was already in full swing.</p>

<p>"I played [<em>Outer Wilds</em>] for quite a few hours and I had figured out a few things, and I hadn't at all seen that," he said with a laugh. "It's literally last year that I said, 'Let's go back to it,' and I was like, 'Oh f***, they have this wall of clues interconnected.'"</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hell-is-us-old-man-npc.jpg?itok=KGaSeA1v 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hell-is-us-old-man-npc.jpg?itok=_oNSE-FP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>In&nbsp;<em>Hell Is Us</em>, you talk to NPCs like this character to round out your investigation.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Hell Is Us</em> isn't the first time he's had this idea, either. Back when he was working on <em>Deus Ex: Human Revolution</em>, the concept of an information web was already on his mind. As with many things in game development, though, some ideas can be lost for one reason or another.</p>

<p>"It's very common with designers. We have these things that we carry with ourselves for years and years and years, and then at one point is the right time to do it, you know?" he said. "It doesn't look it when you look at the system, but it's very complex to make. It's in terms of like how the interrelationships between the info and the updates and this and that."</p>

<p>Despite the lighthearted place where its core mechanic comes from, <em>Hell Is Us</em> is anything but lighthearted.</p>



<p>At its core, it's about a civil war between Palomists and Sabinians in the fictional country of Hadea, and the war has made it a no-go zone. As you explore, environmental storytelling shows how deep the hatred between them runs. The Palomists are religious by nature, so they paint the Sabinians as devils and heretics. On the flip side, Sabinians believe they know the country's true ruler, making the Palomists liars and cheats.</p>

<p>"They're the exact same people from the same stock," Jacques-Belletête said. "They have different religious beliefs, but it's also from the same religion. Think of the Protestants and the Catholics, right? And look at how much bloodshed has been from that.</p>

<p>"At the same time, the game is not about 'religion is bad' or 'religion is the cause of all suffering.' But it still had to be part of it, right? As you play the game more and you learn about all the history and where the hatred comes from, it's much more. It's really much more about what makes us decide that we're different."</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hell-is-us-religious-leader.jpg?itok=G1OhZf8W 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hell-is-us-religious-leader.jpg?itok=mjblSUO5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Essentially, this conflict showcases the cycle of violence and human suffering. He compared it to other real-world conflicts, like the Hutus and Tutsis in Rwanda or the Bosnian War. Maybe it's my American slant, but I also see early moments of this along the political divide here. The division isn't as violent, but the "us or them" rhetoric strongly resonates with what I see.</p>

<p>"[<em>Hell Is Us</em> is] thematically saying, even though we're the same, humanity tries to find a way. We always find a way. And it's all about grievances and it's about who's got the most scars," Jacques-Belletête said.</p>

<p>Because of how raw and real this message is, the team at Rogue Factor landed on a middle ground in terms of realism. <em>Hell Is Us</em> is set in a facsimile of reality, where real countries like Canada and fictional nations like Hadea coexist.</p>

<p>Even the Organized Nations is an overt reference to the United Nations. Rogue Factor reached out to the UN to get permission to use its colors and some iconography, like the stencil lettering. However, the actual name and logo were off the table.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hell-is-us-injured-soldier.jpg?itok=t7hevf3j 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hell-is-us-injured-soldier.jpg?itok=PBObUcdk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>"We're talking about this capacity that I truly believe we all have inside each human being. That with the right circumstances, the right context, everything, we can wake up one morning and decide that our neighbors should be eliminated," Jacques-Belletête said.</p>

<p>"History just proves it, you know? Maybe a few people are immune to it," he continued. "The structure of society is in big part to keep that beast in check, in a way, right? So when those structures fall is when people just bloody lose it. So that was important for me, that all this was as close to the real world as possible."</p>

<p>Of course, it'd be quite a statement to specifically use real-world groups to convey such a difficult, harsh message. Thus, it made sense to create Hadea, a made-up nation where the people suffering are fictional, yet their suffering echoes some of the worst moments of human history.</p>

<h2>Are the Hollow Walkers the Real Monsters?</h2>

<p>When it comes to how you interact with <em>Hell Is Us</em>, though, the player won't ever fight another human, despite all the hatred in the air. Instead, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/hell-is-us-preview" rel="nofollow">all the combat is strictly against the Hollow Walkers</a>, the pale, unsettling, human-ish monsters that you see in the trailers. This was very important to Jacques-Belletête—despite the barbarism on display, he didn't want the player to contribute to the violence against other humans.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hell-is-us-marshes.jpg?itok=iTMSn7cx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hell-is-us-marshes.jpg?itok=xOOOxSIx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>So Hollow Walkers were the answer to that. They roam the land, and some have colorful, geometric entities attached to the giant holes on their torso via an "umbilical cord," per Jacques-Belletête. These entities, called the Haze, represent intense human emotions, as expected from people amid a civil war.</p>

<p>Figuring out what an emotion looks like was one of the big design challenges for the team at Rogue Factor. The big creative leap, according to Jacques-Belletête, was how the Haze ends up attached to the Hollow Walkers.</p>

<p>"An emotion cannot walk by itself, right? You can project it around you to a certain perimeter, depending on how pissed you are," he said. "It has an area of effect. But technically, you can't send it anywhere else. It goes with you, right? The Haze cannot just move by itself. It's kind of like the analogy to how much we can project our emotions around us."</p>

<p>In a fight, the Haze will come out of the Hollow Walker, and you have to neutralize it first before you can defeat the Walker. Otherwise, the emotion stays inside; it comes out as a literal fight or flight response, which is a pretty on-the-nose metaphor.</p>

<p>"Just like you, you decide how much you keep your emotions inside and how much you project them. So it's all these things that you think about that, and then it informs your designs and it informs your gameplay," Jacques-Belletête said. "I think that's how things should be created."</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hell-is-us-haze-2.jpg?itok=zgyjh5aD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hell-is-us-haze-2.jpg?itok=yB-D8YgM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>How Hollow Walkers are... made? born? manifested? is still a mystery that awaits us in <em>Hell Is Us</em>. The inspiration behind their designs, though, comes a bit from the horror genre, as you might expect. However, they've become less horrific across different design ideations, primarily because of how action-oriented the game is.</p>

<p>"<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/why-there-should-never-be-bloodborne-remake" rel="nofollow">Bloodborne</a> </em>is super— the themes are horror, the monster design are horrors, but I wasn't scared playing the game. I'm sure you weren't, but it's horror," Jacques-Belletête said. "But It's not like playing <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/silent-hill-4-room-interesting" rel="nofollow"><em>Silent Hill 4: The Room</em></a> where you're literally s***ting your pants, you know what I mean?"</p>

<h2>On the Industry at Wide</h2>

<p>Speaking of s***ting your pants, while I had him, I wanted to know how Jacques-Belletête felt about the industry at large, considering we're amid an endless barrage of layoffs and turmoil. Obviously, Rogue Factor has weathered the storm so far, but I wanted to know his thoughts on everything that has happened in recent years.</p>

<p>For him and studio co-founder Yves Bordeleau, part of their vision is remaining a "small-ish," tight-knit team of experts that doesn't need $200-something million dollars to make a game. At the time of the interview in early May, the studio had roughly 50–55 people directly working on the game (not including business needs like human resources, finance, and so on).</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hell-is-us-jova.jpg?itok=e4_Fso3b 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hell-is-us-jova.jpg?itok=qD9D4Iak 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>I got the sense that, with Montreal being a historic hub for huge studios like Ubisoft, WB Games, and Eidos-Montreal, the veterans at Rogue Factor have lots of experience with large companies. This commitment to a tighter ship felt like a direct response to that.</p>

<p>"You don't build on [success] to get to a company that has 500 people. Because usually, in Montreal it's like, 'Oh, we have success, we get bigger, we get bigger,'" Jacques-Belletête said. "Especially in this city, the minute a studio has success, it's like, 'Alright, three projects at the same time now, blah, blah, blah.'"</p>

<p>Instead, at Rogue Factor, the goal is to be good at what they do, develop new skills together as a team, and keep getting better at what they can do. <em>Hell Is Us</em> let their third-person melee action skills bloom, and it'll only get better as they develop new worlds.</p>

<p>"Here, if we have success, it just makes the foundation stronger, and we build on it."</p>

They're not recruiting hundreds of new developers or expanding the budget to ridiculous levels. And of course, having a publisher like Nexon doesn't hurt for maintaining the bottom line, either.</p>

<p>"It's not to say that it hasn't been hard, it's not to say that we haven't had to regularly go like, 'Oh my god, how are we going to make sure that it's not going to happen to us' or this or that," he said. "And there's a bit of luck always there, but you kind of make your own luck as well."</p>

In a way, it's a mirror that reflects the worst parts of humanity, but it's in that ugliness that we're able to learn and, hopefully, be better.</p>

<p>Even though I only played a small slice of the game, I found myself wanting to learn more about it—how and why these people hate each other, what gruesome extents they've gone to against each other. It's these sorts of thoughts that Jacques-Belletête wants the player to explore after the game releases on Sept. 4.</p>

<p>"If it stays in your head, if you think about it driving to work, if you go to bed and you're thinking about your next session or what does it mean, or if you just think about the themes, that's what it's all about."</p>
