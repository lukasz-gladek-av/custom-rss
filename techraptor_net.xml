            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced who's going to be playing the two main roles of Link and Zelda in the upcoming live-action&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda</em>&nbsp;movie, which is currently set for release in 2027.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://x.com/Nintendo/status/1945433161124688335" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">social media post</a> by none other than Nintendo legend Shigeru Miyamoto, the role of Link will be played by actor Benjamin Evan-Ainsworth, whose previous roles include Miles in Netflix's <i>The Haunting of Bly Manor&nbsp;</i>and Pinnochio in the live-action Disney remake of the same name.</p>

<p>He'll be acting opposite Bo Bragason as Princess Zelda. You might recognize Bragason's name from shows like&nbsp;<em>The Jetty&nbsp;</em>or the Disney+ show&nbsp;<em>Renegade Nell</em>, and she also served as the model for the young Lunafreya in the animated movie&nbsp;<em>Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV</em>.</p>

<p>The movie, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-announces-live-action-legend-of-zelda-movie-distributed-and-co-financed-by" rel="nofollow">announced back in late 2023</a>, will be co-produced by Miyamoto and Avi Arad, whose previous producer credits include the critically-acclaimed&nbsp;<em>Spider-Verse&nbsp;</em>animated films, as well as many other blockbusters.</p>

<p>Directing duties will be handled by&nbsp;<em>The Maze Runner&nbsp;</em>head Wes Ball. We don't yet know who's going to be writing the&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>movie, nor do we know whether it will adapt a specific game or tell a story of its own.</p>

<p><em>The Legend of Zelda&nbsp;</em>is, however, just one of several video game franchises getting its own movie in the coming months and years. Others include ghost-hunting phenomenon&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-movie-blumhouse" rel="nofollow"><em>Phasmophobia</em></a>, smash hit open-world action RPG&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-movie" rel="nofollow"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>, and co-op platformer&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-movie-sydney-sweeney" rel="nofollow"><em>Split Fiction</em></a>, among others.</p>

Movie</em>, which <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/84343-highest-grossing-live-action-videogame-to-film-transfer-single-film" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">currently stands</a> as the highest-grossing video game movie adaptation of all time.</p>

<p>Whether it manages to achieve that feat or not remains to be seen, but in any case, the movie is set to be released in theaters around the world on May 7th, 2027. Stay tuned for more.</p>
