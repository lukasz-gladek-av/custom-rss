            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/deltarune-chapters-three-and-four-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Deltarune&nbsp;</em>creator Toby Fox has provided an update on the release timing for the game's long-awaited third and fourth chapters, and it sounds like you've got reason to be optimistic if you're excited to play them.</p>

<p>In a thread on X (formerly Twitter), Fox first wishes his followers a happy Halloween before celebrating&nbsp;<em>Deltarune</em>'s sixth anniversary. Unfortunately, yes, it really has been that long since the game's first chapter was released.</p>

<p>Fox then provides an update on&nbsp;<em>Deltarune&nbsp;</em>chapters three and four, which he says will "100%" be released next year. There's not much room for doubt in that statement, eh?</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/deltarune-chapters-3-and-4-2025-halloween.jpg?itok=V7ZfvPQ6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/deltarune-chapters-3-and-4-2025-halloween.jpg?itok=mNjyTpYb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This rather cute Halloween artwork was shared to commemorate&nbsp;<em>Deltarune</em>'s sixth anniversary, and Halloween as well.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Fox, he can't divulge a more specific release window for the third and fourth&nbsp;<em>Deltarune&nbsp;</em>chapters owing to "localization and console porting", so we don't technically know exactly when the two chapters will arrive.</p>

<p>However, if Fox keeps to his word, then it's likely one of the chapters will release earlier in the year, and the other will launch later on. I wouldn't expect the two of them to arrive simultaneously, as fun as that would be.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Deltarune</em>, it's a followup to the 2015 hit&nbsp;<em>Undertale</em>, and the name is also an anagram of that game's title, although it doesn't take place in the same world.</p>

<p>Much like&nbsp;<em>Undertale</em>, however,&nbsp;<em>Deltarune&nbsp;</em>allows you to decide whether to tackle battles violently or peacefully, and it also features bullet hell-inflected turn-based combat. Some characters, like Alphys, return directly from&nbsp;<em>Undertale</em>, while others, like Ralsei, nod to similar&nbsp;<em>Undertale</em>&nbsp;characters.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/deltarune-chapters-3-and-4-2025-store.jpg?itok=jnFPx3sJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/deltarune-chapters-3-and-4-2025-store.jpg?itok=wmHvrKuR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Deltarune&nbsp;</em>features very similar aesthetics and characters to&nbsp;<em>Undertale</em>, although it isn't technically a direct sequel.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Deltarune</em>'s first chapter arrived in 2018, and its second chapter followed three years later in 2021.</p>

<p>In late 2022, Fox announced that the third and fourth chapters <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-deltarune-chapters-not-coming-this-year">wouldn't be released that year</a>, but just over a week later, he <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/deltarune-update-promises-smoother-development">promised</a> that development on the game would be "smoother" going forward.</p>

<p><em>Deltarune&nbsp;</em>chapters three and four are due to launch sometime in 2025. Until then, you can check out the game's first and second chapters entirely for free on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1671210/DELTARUNE/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP3893-CUSA15235_00-TFSHVCDRPS400084" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 4</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/deltarune-chapter-1-and-2-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-series-tops-500m-sales-black-ops-6-enjoys-franchises-biggest-launch.1024224/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-series-sales-black-ops-6-launch<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Activision has announced that&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>series sales have topped the 500 million mark, and Microsoft has also revealed that&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>enjoyed the series' biggest launch ever.</p>

<p>Speaking to the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2024/10/30/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-500-million-copies-sold/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Washington Post</a>, Activision confirmed the massive sales milestone for the first-person shooter franchise, and that milestone likely explains why Microsoft's gaming revenue <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/fy-2025-q1/press-release-webcast" rel="noopener" target="_blank">increased 61%</a> in the first quarter of the 2024-25 fiscal year, with 53 of those points <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-activision-blizzard-merger-finalized">driven by Activision</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, in an earnings call (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-sets-records-for-game-pass-subscriber-adds-on-launch-day-says-microsoft" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>), Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella&nbsp;described&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6</em>'s launch as "the biggest&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>launch ever", pointing to its "record for day one players as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-will-be-on-game-pass-day-1">Game Pass subscriber adds on launch day</a>".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-snow.jpg?itok=eaNISuAl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-snow.jpg?itok=szBY8Sit 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>'s success has added to a huge sales milestone for&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>as a whole.</figcaption></figure><p>Nadella didn't give any specifics regarding sales figures or Game Pass subscriber adds for&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6</em>, although as Eurogamer notes, he did previously say that Bethesda's spacefaring RPG&nbsp;<em>Starfield&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starfield-passes-11-million-players-sets-record-of-most-new-game-pass-subscriptions-on">set a similar record last year</a>.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, this monumental success, as well as&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em>'s sales figures as a whole, will no doubt add to the happiness Nadella feels about scoring an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-ceo-payrise-layoffs">eye-watering payrise</a> this year despite <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-gaming-layoffs-september">massive layoffs</a> across his company.</p>

<p>If you've somehow missed out on the hype,&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>is the latest game in the long-running and phenomenally successful <i>Call of Duty&nbsp;</i>franchise.</p>

<p>The game is a co-development effort between longtime&nbsp;<em>Black Ops&nbsp;</em>studio Treyarch and Raven Software, who also collaborated on 2020's&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War</em>. It boasts a single-player campaign, as well as the usual multiplayer and zombies modes.</p>




<p>Despite its massive success,&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>has garnered its fair share of controversy as well, with elements like its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-always-online">always-online campaign</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-paid-audio-option">paid audio package</a> drawing fire from irate fans.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2933620/Call_of_Duty_Black_Ops_6/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and it's also playable via Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass, although <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-price-hike-new-tier">not via Xbox Game Pass Standard or Core</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-h1-2024-25-fiscal-results</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-hemorrhaging-money-after-high-profile-flops.1024188/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-h1-2024-25-fiscal-results<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has released its financial results for the first half of the fiscal year, and if you've been following the company's fortunes recently, then it probably won't come as a shock to you to learn that things aren't looking good.</p>

<p>In its <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/5kn4pUVx6Vtb1Hir4vpqvq/fe35b53a1514635b0257418d1409d9e1/Ubisoft_FY25_H1_Earnings_PR_vFinal.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">financial summary</a>, Ubisoft reveals that it's effectively hemorrhaging money right now; the company lost&nbsp;€271.8 million in the period between April and September this year, and it's currently staring down the barrel of around&nbsp;€1 billion's worth of debt.</p>

<p>In addition, net bookings are down 22% year-on-year, while digital revenues have fallen 27% and player spending (although Ubisoft uses the somewhat ghoulish term "recurring investment") has fallen 39% compared to the same period last year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-outlaws-ubisoft-financials.jpg?itok=g7fbpxOf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-outlaws-ubisoft-financials.jpg?itok=luABiqCE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>High-profile flops like&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>have driven poor performance for Ubisoft in the first half of the 2024-25 fiscal year.</figcaption></figure><p>These doomy numbers are likely driven largely by the apparent failure of&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, which Ubisoft has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-february">admitted didn't perform according to its expectations</a>, although the company doesn't mention the game in these latest financial results, nor does it give official sales numbers.</p>

<p>Rather cunningly, Ubisoft refers to its "unique player" count rather than its sales in an <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/5XbTPPv7a94dZmmmhSwtDA/c091b601b2b467f5829465c26d0b8551/Ubisoft_H1_FY25_Slideshow_vFinal.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">accompanying presentation</a>, declaring that "more than 30 million unique active players" played&nbsp;<em>Rainbow Six Siege&nbsp;</em>and the&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>franchise over the last twelve months.</p>

<p>The company also says its cost reduction plan is "well on track", with its "total headcount" dropping by over 2,000 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-lays-off-124-people-to-streamline-operations-and-enhance-collective-efficiency">over the past 24 months</a>.</p>

<p>All in all, the presentation and its accompanying slideshow paint a pretty grim picture for Ubisoft, and that's probably a result the company doesn't feel it needs after a prolonged period of turmoil.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft.jpg?itok=BBb3O36u 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft.jpg?itok=6iwePV2G 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ubisoft is releasing&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>next year.</figcaption></figure><p>Ubisoft's&nbsp;<em>annus horribilis&nbsp;</em>arguably began with the launch of&nbsp;<em>Skull and Bones&nbsp;</em>back in February, with <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/16299/skull-and-bones" rel="noopener" target="_blank">critics</a> and players alike responding to the long-awaited pirate game with a resounding "eh".</p>

<p>Following that, a prominent investor in the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activist-ubisoft-investor-open-letter-change">called for "strategic and structural change"</a> in September, calling out perceived failures in management and company policy on the part of Ubisoft's owners the Guillemots.</p>

<p>Major release <i>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</i>was subsequently delayed to February 2025, alongside which Ubisoft revealed that&nbsp;<em>Outlaws&nbsp;</em>had underperformed and confirmed a return to day-one Steam releases for its PC games, as well as the abandonment of the traditional season pass model for DLC.</p>

<p>More investor threats followed, alongside a declaration of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-strike-investor-letter">employee strike action</a> over return-to-work policies and poor pay. All of that is in addition to a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-lawsuit-data-policy">data policy lawsuit</a> that Ubisoft is currently facing.</p>

<p>Of course, none of these issues stopped Ubisoft <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-nft-game">releasing a rather oddly-timed NFT game</a>&nbsp;last week. One rather suspects this isn't the sort of strategy Ubisoft needs to get back on track, but I suppose we'll have to wait and see.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Valve Now Requires Devs to Disclose Kernel-Level Anti-Cheat Measures on Steam]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valve-steam-anti-cheat-disclosure</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/valve-now-requires-devs-to-disclose-kernel-level-anti-cheat-measures-on-steam.1024146/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valve-steam-anti-cheat-disclosure<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Valve has announced that developers who want to put their games on Steam will need to disclose whether those games are using any kind of kernel-level anti-cheat software going forward.</p>

<p>Announcing the changes via the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/4547038620960934857" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steamworks community page</a>, Valve says this is a change that's been requested by both developers and players; devs want better options to "share anti-cheat information" with players, while players are requesting more anti-cheat "transparency".</p>

<p>To that end, a new field has been added in which developers can indicate the anti-cheat software that comes with their game. If a developer's game contains kernel-level and client-side anti-cheat measures, then those measures must be disclosed via this new field.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/apex-legends-anti-cheat-valve-steam.jpg?itok=8kk1YJzE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/apex-legends-anti-cheat-valve-steam.jpg?itok=0MDDgsSn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Online games like&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends&nbsp;</em>often use anti-cheat software to prevent hacks and other exploits.</figcaption></figure><p>This also applies to games that are already on Steam, so developers who are currently using kernel-level anti-cheat solutions will need to add this disclosure to their games' Steam pages.</p>

<p>If games are using anti-cheat that isn't kernel-based or is server-side, then their developers aren't technically required to disclose this information, but Valve says it thinks that letting players know about this would be beneficial on both sides.</p>

<p>If you're a Steam developer, you can find this new option in your Steamworks landing page, under the "Edit Store Page" heading. A new "Anti-Cheat" option will be available, and Valve says it's made a list of the most common software providers so you can easily fill out the field.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that even if a Steam page already discloses its measures somewhere else in its text, then that information should now be migrated to the new field and removed from the existing area.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/genshin-impact-anti-cheat-valve-steam.jpg?itok=BfMLwYiM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/genshin-impact-anti-cheat-valve-steam.jpg?itok=EomXAilH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some games, like&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact</em>, have been the subject of controversy thanks to anti-cheat software.</figcaption></figure><p>Plenty of games use kernel-level anti-cheat measures, with big guns like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/halo-infinite-march-update-preview"><em>Halo Infinite</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sea-of-thieves-getting-easy-anti-cheat-and-removing-game-pass-requirement-for-solo"><em>Sea of Thieves</em></a>, and more incorporating it into their online components.</p>

<p>However, some games have been the subject of controversy due to their anti-cheat measures.</p>

<p>Back in 2022, for instance, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-anti-cheat-vulnerability-discovered">vulnerability was discovered</a> in&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact</em>'s anti-cheat protocols potentially allowed hackers to bypass users' virus protection, and the game didn't even need to be installed for players to be susceptible.</p>

<p>In July that same year, VR social platform<em>&nbsp;VRChat&nbsp;</em>implemented Easy Anti-Cheat, one of the most popular anti-cheat solutions, thereby also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vrchat-mods-ban-by-easy-anti-cheat-addition-sparks-community-outrage">banning the use of mods</a> for the platform, a decision that wasn't exactly received well by the&nbsp;<em>VRChat&nbsp;</em>community.</p>
