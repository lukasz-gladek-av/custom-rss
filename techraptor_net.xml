            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Redemption Road and publisher tinyBuild have announced that their highly ambitious action-strategy game&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>has been delayed indefinitely in order to ensure players feel like their money was "well spent" when they buy it.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2109770/view/543369627969783348" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a message</a> on Steam, Redemption Road says that&nbsp;the game, which was originally slated to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingmakers-early-access-release-date" rel="nofollow">launch in Early Access on Wednesday</a>, needs some additional time in the oven before the studio "feel[s] good about charging money for it".</p>

<p>The developer says it doesn't want to cut any of&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers</em>' planned features in order to get the game "out the door earlier", and that the game's many ambitious systems mean it's pushing Unreal Engine 4, on which it's based, to its "absolute limits".</p>

<p>Additionally, walking away from a battle doesn't stop the carnage; the developer says the fight "continues to play out", and that each mission in the game happens on "a massive map that each player on the server is free to explore".</p>

<p>All of this is to say that&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers</em>' ambition is big, and so Redemption Road says it wants to spend "a bit more time on content polish" before the game is released, even as an Early Access title.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>has been delayed. The game was originally due to launch in 2024, but in December of that year, it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingmakers-delayed-q1-2025" rel="nofollow">pushed back to 2025</a>. Whether or not it's still able to launch this year isn't clear right now, but I wouldn't put my money on that happening.</p>




<p>Redemption Road is promising more information about&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers</em>, including a gameplay "deep dive", soon. In the meantime, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2109770/Kingmakers/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wishlist the game on Steam right now</a> if you want to keep up with its progress.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/millennia-final-update-paradox</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/paradoxs-civ-like-4x-strategy-game-millennia-receives-final-update.1317382/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It is, in a quite literal sense, the end of an era. Paradox has announced that the latest update for 4X strategy sim&nbsp;<em>Millennia&nbsp;</em>will serve as the game's final patch, but don't worry - it's not actually going anywhere.</p>

<p>As revealed in a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1268590/view/518599830010857584" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a>, Update 8, which is, as the name suggests, the eighth major update for&nbsp;<em>Millennia</em>, will be the last major update the game will receive.</p>

<p>Despite its momentous nature, it's not bringing anything particularly huge; Paradox says it's packing "a host of bugfixes, localization updates, and some added mod support". You can check out the update's <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/millennia-update-8.1853194/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">full patch notes here</a> if you want to.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/paradox-millennia-final-update-map.jpg?itok=xdn3h4PT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/paradox-millennia-final-update-map.jpg?itok=8olHFfUW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Paradox's&nbsp;<em>Civilization</em>-esque 4X game&nbsp;<em>Millennia&nbsp;</em>will receive no further updates.</figcaption></figure><p>In its Steam post, Paradox thanks&nbsp;<em>Millennia&nbsp;</em>developer C Prompt for its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/millennia-roadmap-2024" rel="nofollow">work on the game</a> since launch last year, and it also confirms that&nbsp;<em>Millennia</em>'s social channels will go dark, so don't expect any further chatter from the devs on those platforms.</p>

<p>However,&nbsp;<em>Millennia&nbsp;</em>will remain available to play "indefinitely", according to Paradox, and the publisher will also continue to support the game in terms of game-breaking bugs or glitches, so things should still be ticking along nicely if you do intend to head back in at any point.</p>

<p>The publisher closes its statement by saying it hopes to see players again "in a future era", but given that&nbsp;<em>Millennia</em>'s support is ending, I wouldn't bank on a followup anytime soon.</p>

<p>You may just have to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-ui-problems-fixes-coming" rel="nofollow">make your peace with&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-ui-problems-fixes-coming" rel="nofollow">Civilization VII</a>&nbsp;</em>if you want your 4X fix, or revisit an earlier game in the series. Then again, I suppose, since&nbsp;<em>Millennia&nbsp;</em>will still be getting support patches every now and then, you could just keep playing that.</p>




<p>If you do want to check out&nbsp;<em>Millennia</em>, you can do so right now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1268590/Millennia/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on PC via Steam</a>. Stay tuned for more on all things Paradox-related.</p>
