You'll be getting a refund either way; the two studios say "all players" who bought <em>King of Meat </em>will get their money back "in the coming weeks".</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>King of Meat </em>is shutting down. Quelle surprise.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As of yesterday, it's no longer possible to buy <em>King of Meat </em>on any storefront, and you can't buy in-game Stamps either, so if you don't own the game, you've missed your chance to check it out.</p><p>However, there's a silver lining if you did buy <em>King of Meat</em>; not only will you be entitled to a full refund for the game, but the Stamp packs you purchased will also be refunded. You can, of course, also continue to spend Stamps you do have on in-game content if you want.</p><p><em>King of Meat </em>represents the latest game to fall foul of Amazon Game Studios' chopping block. It follows the likes of MMO <em>New World</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazons-ill-fated-mmo-new-world-to-shut-down-next-year" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fa9fca01-ebe1-4d7d-9d03-0b8eab5c442a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">shutting down next year</a>, and ill-fated hero shooter <em>Crucible</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazon-takes-crucible-off-life-support-and-kills-it" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9b063179-6c1f-4568-bfca-bb65e787d1f1" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">shut down in the same year it was released</a>.</p><p>In general, it looks like Amazon is pivoting away from the kind of full-throated development represented by <em>King of Meat</em>, <em>Crucible</em>, and <em>New World</em>, and towards more casual experiences like its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazon-luna-rework-later-this-year" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a4199f9c-3f78-478b-b2f3-b566d7133e1b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">recently-redesigned Amazon Luna service</a>.</p>
<p>This is usually where I'd tell you where you can check out <em>King of Meat</em>, but, well, you can't anymore. If you did already buy it, though, the game will remain online until April 9th.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Daniel Vavra, the creative director behind the hugely successful <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance </em>games, has stepped down from his role at Warhorse Studios in order to help make a movie out of his series.</p><p>As reported by Czech news platform <a href="https://cc.cz/daniel-vavra-uz-nepracuje-pro-warhorse-studios-na-nove-hre-misto-toho-pripravuje-hrany-film-kingdom-come/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CzechCrunch</a> (via ResetEra's <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/daniel-v%C3%A1vra-creative-director-at-warhorse-studios-steps-down-to-focus-on-turning-kingdom-come-deliverance-into-a-live-action-movie-or-series.1444474/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GodGraviel</a>; we're using machine translation for the original article), Vavra is stepping down so that a movie or TV series based on <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance </em>can be made.</p><p>Warhorse CEO Martin Frývaldský told CzechCrunch that he and Vavra have been discussing "moving the <em>Kingdom Come </em>brand away from video games for some time now", and that "copmics, concerts, and tourism" have been discussed, but that the two were "most attracted by film".</p><figure role="group">

</figure>
<p>Whether Vavra has actually quit Warhorse is unclear from Frývaldský's comments (and, honestly, the machine translation probably isn't helping things either). He says that Vavra is "still part of Warhorse", even though employees "don't meet him every day in the office anymore".</p><p>Later in CzechCrunch's interview, Frývaldský refers to Vavra as "transmedia director" on <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em>, so it seems his position within Warhorse is a little more fluid than it was, but that ties are still strong between the two.</p><p>Leaving was apparently Vavra's idea. Frývaldský says the creative director "wanted to move on", and that making "three games that were a worldwide success" prompted Vavra to want to "try it with something else".</p><p>Frývaldský won't be drawn on whether the <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance </em>movie will follow the games or tell a new story entirely. He does, however, say that "negotiations are already underway", so it may not be too long before we hear more about Vavra's debut movie project.</p>
<p>If you're wondering why Warhorse and Vavra want to make a <em>Kingdom Come </em>movie, look no further than the games' sales figures. At last count, <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 </em>had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-embracer-group" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fe50d517-d627-4fd8-90a9-f33dfd15cfc7" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">reached the five million sales mark</a>, while its predecessor is reportedly sitting at around twice that figure.</p><p>There are also plenty of other movies in development based on video game properties right now. In the last year or so alone, announcements have been made regarding movies for franchises like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-movie-director" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a9c59ec8-3853-4f23-9cd0-2a0396cacad7" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Helldivers</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-movie" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5bcbe900-0a2b-4995-b155-09cc3df0eb7f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Call of Duty</em></a>, and Bloober Team's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-medium-movie-adaptation" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e0434c55-69de-42fa-ae8a-44da5f936f37" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>The Medium</em></a>, to name but a few.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Blizzard has revealed <em>Overwatch Rush</em>, a brand new top-down hero shooter "set in the <em>Overwatch </em>universe", and it's currently in active development, although there's no release date yet.</p><p>In a <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24244645/development-update-overwatch-rush" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">news post</a> on the official Blizzard website, the studio describes <em>Overwatch Rush </em>as a new game "designed specifically for mobile" and developed by a "dedicated team" with "deep mobile experience". The company also released an in-development gameplay preview to show off what <em>Overwatch Rush </em>will offer.</p><p>According to Blizzard, the team working on <em>Overwatch Rush </em>is separate from <em>Overwatch</em>'s Team 4, which remains "fully focused" on the main game. Testing in select countries and regions should begin soon, Blizzard says.</p><figure role="group">

</figure>
<p>By the looks of the trailer, <em>Overwatch Rush </em>will share some of its DNA with games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/league-of-legends-coming-to-mobile-and-consoles-with-wild-rift" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1677dde0-b02a-457d-abb1-56798dbc3723" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>League of Legends: Wild Rift</em></a><em> </em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/pokemon-unite" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="686e435d-5353-438b-99f6-31ea1dd5be84" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Pokemon Unite</em></a>, although it's worth noting that Blizzard doesn't describe the game as a MOBA.</p><p>It'll feature recognizable <em>Overwatch </em>heroes like Mercy, Reinhardt, and Soldier 76, and like the main game, it looks like gameplay will revolve around contesting objectives in fast-paced shootouts, although this time from a top-down perspective.</p><p>We don't know too much else about <em>Overwatch Rush </em>yet, except that Blizzard says that there's still "a lot of work to do" on the game, and that you should check out the official <a href="https://discord.gg/overwatchrush" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Discord server</a> if you want to keep up with the newly-announced project's progress.</p><p>You can take a look at the debut trailer for <em>Overwatch Rush</em>, which shows off what the gameplay will look like and how some of the heroes in the game will play, right here.</p>
<p><em>Overwatch Rush</em>'s announcement comes after a <a href="https://x.com/PlayOverwatch/status/2019118032635724211" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">major relaunch</a> for the original <em>Overwatch</em>, which saw Blizzard <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/blizzard-announces-overwatch-2-includes-shared-multiplayer-environment" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="61f2536d-30de-44b4-853e-caef9bf9646c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">dropping the "2" from the title</a> and reverting to just "<em>Overwatch</em>", as well as the launch of several new heroes and more.</p><p>We'll have to wait and see what comes of <em>Overwatch Rush</em>, but it could be a little while before Blizzard reveals more about this one. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
