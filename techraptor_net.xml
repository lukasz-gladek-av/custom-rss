            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-canon-mode<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has revealed that it's including something it calls "Canon Mode" in upcoming action RPG&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>, and if you've ever wondered which dialogue option your character would actually pick, this one's for you.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1hbq6qg/hi_we_are_brooke_charles_jonathan_and_thierry/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">recent Reddit AMA (Ask Me Anything) session</a>, creative director Jonathan Dumont says Canon Mode was included to address the fact that&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed</em>'s fanbase is "divided on branching dialogues".</p>

<p>If you select Canon Mode, then dialogue choices will be made for you so that you don't have to worry about whether what you're doing is in character or not. Dumont says this should give players a "choice free experience", which feels like a slightly odd way of wording it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-canon-mode-conversation.jpg?itok=5Yj3fe7q 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-canon-mode-conversation.jpg?itok=ceIC5JxH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>will let you have the game decide which response it should give on your behalf in dialogue trees.</figcaption></figure><p>When it comes to the length of the game, Dumont says that while it's "hard to evaluate" such things in open-world games due to player variables, he thinks&nbsp;<em>Shadows</em>' main campaign is "comparable to&nbsp;<em>Origins</em>/<em>Odyssey&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Valhalla</em>" in terms of length.</p>

<p>Again, that feels like a slightly odd answer to give when considering that these three games take different amounts of time to beat.&nbsp;<em>Origins</em>' campaign sits at around 25-30 hours, while&nbsp;<em>Odyssey</em>'s takes about 45 hours and&nbsp;<em>Valhalla</em>'s can take up to 60.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Suffice it to say that you're probably not in for a short ride with&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>, so hopefully it doesn't have the same level of bloat that&nbsp;<em>Odyssey&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Valhalla&nbsp;</em>could often exhibit.</p>

<p>The AMA offers plenty of other interesting information about&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>; it'll <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1hbq6qg/comment/m1jz42g/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">feature an "immersive mode"</a> with a full Japanese voiceover, for instance, and its <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1hbq6qg/comment/m1jv74t/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">modern story</a> will be "limited" and connected to the new Animus Hub, although we'll get more on this "later".</p>




<p><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>is the latest mainline installment in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>series. Set in Sengoku-era Japan, it'll follow the RPG stylings of the likes of <i><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/assassins-creed-odyssey" rel="nofollow">Odyssey</a>&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/assassins-creed-valhalla" rel="nofollow">Valhalla</a>&nbsp;</em>and not the back-to-basics approach of last year's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/assassins-creed-mirage" rel="nofollow"><em>Mirage</em></a>.</p>

<p>Since its announcement, the game has garnered its fair share of controversy. Some players <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-assassins-creed-shadows-controversy" rel="nofollow">objected to the inclusion of historical figure Yasuke</a> as one of the main playable characters, an inclusion Ubisoft says demonstrates its ability to take "creative license" to construct "engaging and immersive experiences".</p>

<p><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>also prompted outcry when a concept art book was found to have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-concept-art-apology" rel="nofollow">appropriated images from a Japanese group</a> without permission, and when an "insensitive" figurine depicting a one-legged Torii gate was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/insensitive-assassins-creed-shadows-figurine-controversy" rel="nofollow">pulled from sale in October</a>.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3159330/Assassins_Creed_Shadows/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/assassins-creed-shadows/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/assassins-creed-shadows" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> in February next year, having been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-february" rel="nofollow">delayed</a> from its original November release date.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-hit-3-5m</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/balatro-sales-hit-3-5m-in-less-than-a-year-as-game-awards-near.1058985/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-hit-3-5m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>developer LocalThunk and publisher Playstack have announced another major new sales milestone for the game, further cementing its massive success as this year's Game Awards loom.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/BalatroGame/status/1866905061609078866" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a message on social media platform X</a>,&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>has managed to rack up an eye-watering 3.5 million sales since its release earlier this year, which is a pretty monumental figure given the game's relatively small size and niche subject matter.</p>

<p>As the post itself says, developer LocalThunk started out simply wishing to make "a game for myself and a few friends", but&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>quickly grew beyond those boundaries, reaching the kind of global audience many indies can only dream of.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/balatro-3.5m-sales-cards.jpg?itok=hzNSLVYb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/balatro-3.5m-sales-cards.jpg?itok=JAID0XoJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>has hit yet another big sales milestone.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>was released back in February, and since then, it's become an absolutely huge hit. The game managed to rack up <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-half-million" rel="nofollow">half a million sales in just ten days</a>, and its pace didn't let up; just twelve days after that,&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-one-million" rel="nofollow">crossed a million sales</a>.</p>

<p>By August, the poker roguelike's sales figures <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-reach-2-million-as-devs-promise-first-major-update-soon" rel="nofollow">had hit two million</a>, with developer LocalThunk promising that&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>'s first major update would arrive in 2025, bringing "new ideas and strategies" to freshen the game up.</p>

<p>As an indie darling,&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>has hardly stayed in its own pen, either. It's crossed over with other indie smash hits like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-update-crossovers-cyberpunk" rel="nofollow">Stardew Valley</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Potion Craft</em>, as well as the likes of&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/big-dave-diver-collaboration-update-balatro" rel="nofollow"><em>Dave the Diver</em></a>.</p>

<p>While the game was initially released for PC and consoles, it also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-mobile-release-date" rel="nofollow">secured itself a mobile release</a> back in September, and given the bite-sized nature of&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>, it's hard to imagine that release hasn't contributed significantly to the game's success.</p>




<p>Such is&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>'s monumental success that it's the only indie game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/game-awards-2024-nominees-announced" rel="nofollow">nominated for the Game of the Year award</a> at this year's Game Awards, the ceremony for which will take place later today.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Pokemon TCG Pocket Reveals New Mythical Island Expansion Set]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mythical-island-expansion</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pokemon-tcg-pocket-reveals-new-mythical-island-expansion-set.1058982/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mythical-island-expansion<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has announced a brand new&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>expansion set, which will bring over 80 new cards for you to collect and battle with next week.</p>

<p>Landing on December 17th, the Mythical Island set isn't the game's next full expansion; rather, it's a sort of stopgap set that introduces a new kind of booster pack. It looks from the pack's in-game artwork that Mythical Island represents expansion A1a.</p>

<p>Although this set won't quite be on the same level as&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>'s base Genetic Apex set, it will introduce new EX cards, new Trainer cards, and some new immersive artwork cards as well, so it's still worth getting excited about if you're a&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>fan.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mythical-island-expansion-mew-ex.jpg?itok=NoIvBy3U 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mythical-island-expansion-mew-ex.jpg?itok=nHlZd1x5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>'s new set may not be Genetic Apex-sized, but it's got plenty of new cards for you to collect.</figcaption></figure><p>Among the new cards are EX versions of Mew and Aerodactyl. The former packs a move called Genome Hacking that allows you to use one of your opponent's attacks, while Aerodactyl has the Primeval Law ability, preventing an opponent's active Pokemon from being evolved.</p>

<p>Plenty of other new cards will be introduced as part of this set, including full art versions of Marshadow, Vaporeon, and Dedenne, as well as an EX version of Marowak.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to Trainer cards depicting iconic Pokemon Trainers like Blue and Leaf, as well as new basic cards for the likes of Magmar, Tauros, and Exeggcute, among others.</p>

<h2>When is the new&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>expansion launching?</h2>

<p>Since&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>'s Mythical Island set doesn't represent the next major expansion, you might well be wondering when that expansion will launch.</p>

<p>If a <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1855422922384351518" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Centro Leaks event leak</a> from November (which accurately predicted the launch of this A1a pack) is to be believed, then we can expect the new expansion to arrive on January 30th. It's currently codenamed A2, although we don't know what it will actually be called or what the theming will be yet.</p>




<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>is, it's a condensed mobile version of the popular trading card game that allows you to collect and battle lots of different Pokemon in card form.</p>

<p>Released <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-release-date" rel="nofollow">in late October</a>, the game features a basic version of the standard&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG&nbsp;</em>battle system, as well as over 200 cards to collect as part of the Genetic Apex set. Future updates will also add <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-future-updates" rel="nofollow">new features like trading</a>&nbsp;in the coming months.</p>

<p>You can download&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>for free right now on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pok%C3%A9mon-tcg-pocket/id6479970832" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.pokemon.pokemontcgp&amp;hl=en_GB" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Android</a> devices.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sunless-sea-director-travelling-at-night</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sunless-sea-director-announces-new-narrative-crpg-travelling-at-night.1058913/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sunless-sea-director-travelling-at-night<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Sunless Sea&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Cultist Simulator&nbsp;</em>designer Alexis Kennedy has announced&nbsp;<em>Travelling At Night</em>, which he describes as a "dialogue-driven choices-matter combat-free CRPG" that's not a million miles away from the likes of&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://weatherfactory.biz/announcing-travelling-at-night/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an announcement post</a> on his studio Weather Factory's official website, Kennedy says that while he's been "making narrative games for fifteen years", he's "never made a traditional isometric CRPG", likening doing so to a composer "hav[ing] a go at opera".</p>

<p>Rather tantalizingly, Kennedy says he was once contracted as a narrative consultant on a "really promising and heavily NDA'd RPG for a developer [he admires] and on a franchise [he likes]". Of course, he doesn't name what that RPG is, but he does say its cancellation made him regret not working within the genre.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/alexis-kennedy-sunless-sea-travelling-at-night.jpg?itok=zxv5TDBP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/alexis-kennedy-sunless-sea-travelling-at-night.jpg?itok=nX5qPVyA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Sunless Sea&nbsp;</em>designer Alexis Kennedy is back with a brand new project.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're thinking that&nbsp;<em>Travelling At Night&nbsp;</em>looks an awful lot like&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>from the screenshot above, then you're not wrong, and it's a game Kennedy himself brings up in the game's announcement post.</p>

<p>He says that while he and his partner Lottie Bevan considered using the word "discolike" to describe their game, they didn't want players thinking they were pursuing&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>'s "distinctive nihilistic funny sex'n'drugs'n'disco vibe".</p>

<p>However, Kennedy and Bevan did incur a "creative debt" to&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Travelling At Night&nbsp;</em>is aiming to find the same "audience for something CRPG-esque with really unorthodox creative choices".</p>

<p>As such, while Weather Factory isn't <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-disco-elysium-devs-new-studios-spiritual-successors" rel="nofollow">one of a number of studios</a> currently operating out of the ashes of&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>developer ZA/UM (including <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/game-development/for-a-while-it-seemed-like-miracles-were-possible-and-with-them-redemption-a-follow-up-to-the-legendary-disco-elysium-might-have-been-ready-to-play-within-the-next-yearzaums-devs-loved-it-management-canceled-it-and-laid-off-the-team/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ZA/UM itself</a>), you can consider&nbsp;<em>Travelling At Night&nbsp;</em>another contender for the&nbsp;<em>Disco&nbsp;</em>crown.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/travelling-at-night-stats.jpg?itok=U1PhEwQT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/travelling-at-night-stats.jpg?itok=saT476ht 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Travelling At Night&nbsp;</em>isn't subtle about its influences.</figcaption></figure><p>With regards to the production cycle, Kennedy says he estimates&nbsp;<em>Travelling At Night&nbsp;</em>will take "between two and four years", and that he's hoping for a day one Steam Deck launch as well.</p>

<p>He describes the game's art direction as "determinedly non-realistic" while still being "plausibly CRPG", and confirms that&nbsp;<em>Travelling At Night&nbsp;</em>won't have an "intentionally inchoate player-cipher" character, but instead a defined protagonist by the name of Spencer Hobson.</p>

<p>We'll bring you more on&nbsp;<em>Travelling At Night&nbsp;</em>as soon as we get it.
