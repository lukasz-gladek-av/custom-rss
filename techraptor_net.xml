            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Sega and developer Sports Interactive have announced&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 26</em>, the next iteration in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Football Manager&nbsp;</em>series of management sims.</p>

<p>The game was revealed earlier today via a new trailer titled "Guess Who's Back", in which we get to see some footage of the Premier League trophy, as well as several players who will presumably be included in the game.</p>

<p>The trailer is pretty short, so we don't get to learn much about&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 26</em>&nbsp;by its conclusion, but the game's very existence will likely be enough to get&nbsp;<em>Football Manager&nbsp;</em>fans excited, albeit tentatively given the franchise's recent history.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/football-manager-26-announced-premier-league.jpg?itok=D0iJeLqz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/football-manager-26-announced-premier-league.jpg?itok=tSJ1whnr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Football Manager 26&nbsp;</em>is officially going ahead.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Football Manager 26&nbsp;</em>exists largely thanks to the fact that&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>doesn't, at least in its current form.</p>

<p>Back in June last year,&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-25-dev-update" rel="nofollow">was unveiled</a>, but it was met with immediate consternation from fans regarding some of the features Sega would remove, which included the Create-a-Club system, as well as Touchline Shouts and other more minor systems.</p>

<p>Initially, <i>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</i>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-25-release-date" rel="nofollow">set to launch in November</a> last year, but it was subsequently delayed following what Sports Interactive referred to as a "difficult development cycle". This drew further fan ire, since the delay would potentially mean that the game would miss the league window, which would make newer rosters and transfers irrelevant.</p>

<p>Following that, and the news that&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 24&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-24-data-update-2024-25" rel="nofollow">wouldn't be getting a data update</a> ahead of the&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>release, Sega eventually made the call to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-25-canceled" rel="nofollow">cancel&nbsp;<em>FM25&nbsp;</em>altogether</a>, instead choosing to focus on its successor.</p>




<p>We'll likely learn more about&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 26&nbsp;</em>in the coming weeks, including a first look at its gameplay and (hopefully!) a timely release date as well. For now, you can keep your eyes glued to the game's <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official website</a> for further updates.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced the next GameCube game to join its Switch Online library, and it's none other than much-loved mid-2000s 3D platformer&nbsp;<em>Chibi-Robo!</em>.</p>

<p>As revealed in a new trailer, Skip Ltd and Nintendo's game will be added to Switch Online next week. It'll be the second major <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-gamecube-switch-2-online" rel="nofollow">GameCube game</a> to join the service after the Switch 2's launch, following on from&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/super-mario-strikers-switch-2" rel="nofollow"><em>Super Mario Strikers</em></a>.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Chibi-Robo!</em>, it was released in Japan in 2005, but it didn't get a Western release until the following year (as was fairly common for Japanese releases back then). You play as the titular Chibi-Robo, an adorable robot performing household tasks and aiming to become the best Chibi-Robo in the world.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/chibi-robo-nintendo-switch-online-platforming.jpg?itok=2hAUs9Cp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/chibi-robo-nintendo-switch-online-platforming.jpg?itok=HMk9-5_- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Chibi-Robo!&nbsp;</em>will be joining the Nintendo Switch Online library next week.</figcaption></figure><p>Gameplay consists of exploring the Sanderson house, finding collectibles, and cleaning up messes as you go. You'll also need to keep an eye on your battery levels, which are essentially your health bar; failing to charge yourself up on a regular basis will result in the loss of half of your accumulated currency.</p>

<p>Since the release of the original game,&nbsp;<em>Chibi-Robo!&nbsp;</em>has spawned several sequels, with the latest being 2015's 3DS exclusive&nbsp;<em>Chibi-Robo! Zip Lash</em>. Incidentally, that game, along with its predecessor&nbsp;<em>Chibi-Robo! Photo Finder</em>, is currently unavailable on any modern system.</p>

<p>It's one of several GameCube games to be available as part of a Switch Online membership on Switch 2, joining the likes of&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Sunshine</em>,&nbsp;<em>Soulcalibur II</em>, and&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</em>, among others. You'll need an Expansion Pack addon if you want to play it, though.</p>

<p>You can check out the trailer for&nbsp;<em>Chibi-Robo!&nbsp;</em>on Nintendo Switch Online 2 right here.</p>




<p><em>Chibi-Robo!&nbsp;</em>will be available on Nintendo Switch Online for Switch 2 players (but not original Switch players) on August 21st, so keep an eye out for it if you're a member.</p>
