            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-powerwash-simulator-2-gameplay-trailer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>FuturLab has released a brand new&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>gameplay trailer, and it shows off some of the game's new features, as well as the little cat you can presumably pet to your heart's content.</p>

<p>Naturally, if you're expecting&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>to serve as a significant reinvention of the wheel, you might be disappointed. If, however, you're after more refined and more satisfying cleaning gameplay, it looks like FuturLab has you covered.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rLMus-sx1I" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">new trailer</a> kicks off with the player spraying some filthy structures with the titular power washer, including a teapot-shaped building, a still-operational fairground (surely a safety hazard?), and a car that looks like it desperately needs the TLC.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/powerwash-simulator-2-new-gameplay-trailer-spraying.jpg?itok=brerRuib 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/powerwash-simulator-2-new-gameplay-trailer-spraying.jpg?itok=kwVJKTgC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>will bring more of the satisfying cleaning gameplay you know and love.</figcaption></figure><p>While much of the gameplay looks similar to <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/powerwash-simulator" rel="nofollow">the first game</a>,&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>will boast some innovations as well.</p>

<p>We get to see the player sitting in a chair on wires to reach harder spots (sorry, cleaning aficionados, but I'm not sure what this contraption is called), and we also get to see a window-cleaning platform extending to help with trickier places.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the trailer, we get to see the player customizing their base by hosing down a piano (which I wouldn't necessarily recommend doing in real life) before rotating it and placing it in their ideal spot. The trailer also shows off&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em>'s new co-op mode, which will let you take on tough cleaning jobs with a friend.</p>

<p>Finally, and perhaps most excitingly,&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>will let you pet Ulysses the cat. Ulysses made an appearance in the original game, but you couldn't pet them, which I think is an actual breach of the law. Thankfully, that egregious oversight has been rectified in the sequel.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/powerwash-simulator-2-new-gameplay-trailer-co-op.jpg?itok=CRoi9XSm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/powerwash-simulator-2-new-gameplay-trailer-co-op.jpg?itok=ZYOfuM6D 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>will feature co-op play, as well as a cat you can pet (not pictured).</figcaption></figure><p><em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/powerwash-simulator-2-2025" rel="nofollow">announced back in March</a>. It'll serve as a sequel to the original game, which has attracted a cult following thanks to its soothing gameplay and breadth of jobs to complete.</p>

<p>We don't have a release date for&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>yet, but when it launches, it's coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2968420/PowerWash_Simulator_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10011314" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/powerwash-simulator-2/9p45ggdtfnsm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> (no word of a Switch 2 port yet).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/capcom-spotlight-announced-resident-evil-requiem-pragmata<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has announced a new Spotlight showcase for next week, and you can expect to see new info about some of the company's biggest upcoming releases during the presentation.</p>

<p>As revealed on the official Capcom <a href="https://www.capcom-games.com/showcase/spotlight/en-us/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, the new show will air on June 26th (that's next Thursday at time of writing) at 3pm Pacific/6pm Eastern. If you're in Europe, it's going to be a late one for you, unfortunately.</p>

<p>The show will apparently revolve around four Capcom pillars, two of which have yet to be released. You'll be getting new info about&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil Requiem&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;Pragmata</i>, both of which were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-state-of-play-june-2025-recap" rel="nofollow">announced</a> during one of this year's Summer Game Fest-adjacent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/summer-game-fest-2025-recap" rel="nofollow">shows</a>, and new info about&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>will also be coming.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/resident-evil-requiem-capcom-showcase.jpg?itok=jZnO8gLD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/resident-evil-requiem-capcom-showcase.jpg?itok=0lIQXwtu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>More&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil Requiem&nbsp;</em>info is coming next week.</figcaption></figure><p>If I had to guess, I'd say we'll probably get some gameplay footage of&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>, which is currently due to arrive in February next year. As for&nbsp;<em>Pragmata</em>, I wouldn't be surprised if Capcom revealed a release date for the game, which recently got a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/pragmata-preview" rel="nofollow">shot in the arm in the form of a revival</a> after several years of silence.</p>

<p>When it comes to the two already-released games, we'll probably get some more info about upcoming&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>DLC fighters, and again, I'd be surprised if we didn't learn what's coming as part of the next&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>Title Update, which will <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-1-release-date" rel="nofollow">follow on from the first in March</a>.</p>

<p>Just in case you missed it, the world of the former recently invaded the latter when demon fighter Akuma <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-street-fighter-6-crossover" rel="nofollow">joined the ranks of&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-street-fighter-6-crossover" rel="nofollow">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>&nbsp;</em>hunters, complete with unique moves and visual effects.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-street-fighter-6-capcom.jpg?itok=Pf5a2w4h 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-street-fighter-6-capcom.jpg?itok=OrWrBh9f 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>recently enjoyed a crossover.</figcaption></figure><p>Whether or not the showcase will contain any surprises remains to be seen. You can check out Capcom's next Spotlight presentation on June 26th at 3pm Pacific/6pm Eastern/11pm BST. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-adel-upgraded-update</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-nightreigns-first-superpowered-boss-is-here-in-new-update.1223013/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-adel-upgraded-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has released a new&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>update, and it's got the first of the promised upgraded Nightlord bosses for you to take on.</p>

<p>These bosses were first teased as part of a preview of what's next for the multiplayer-focused spinoff <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-confirmed-sales" rel="nofollow">earlier this month</a>, along with duos, which aren't being included as part of this update, unfortunately. They're due to land later this year.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://www.bandainamcoent.com/news/elden-ring-nightreign-the-everdark-sovereigns-have-emerged" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the official Bandai Namco website, the first upgraded boss you'll be facing is Adel, Baron of the Night, otherwise known as Gaping Jaw on the game's menu screen. The publisher is promising "new moves and increased power", constituting "an even greater threat" to you and your squad.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-upgraded-nightlords-adel.jpg?itok=tlwKx71f 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-upgraded-nightlords-adel.jpg?itok=OV-XRv95 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>'s first upgraded boss is waiting for you.</figcaption></figure><p>Bandai Namco and FromSoftware haven't revealed exactly how Adel will be upgraded for your battle against him, so you'll have to head in and take him on if you want to see exactly how he's going to wreck your squad anew.</p>

<p>Beating the new version of Adel - and, indeed, any other upgraded Nightlords - will net you a new resource named Sovereign Sigils, which you can exchange for unique Relics and other rewards. The first time you beat an upgraded Nightlord will net you extra Sigils as well.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with <i>Elden Ring Nightreign</i>, it's a multiplayer-focused spinoff of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-30m" rel="nofollow">massively successful</a> open-world action RPG&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>, and it also serves as the first ever spinoff of a game in the&nbsp;<em>Souls&nbsp;</em>series or its ancillaries.</p>

<p>The game sees players descending on a randomly-generated map to scavenge for resources and defeat minibosses, level up, and prepare for battle against a Nightlord, a unique boss with new attack patterns and weaknesses, at the end of a three-day period.</p>




<p><em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>has proven hugely successful, but&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>is no slouch in the sales department either; it managed to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">top two million sales on its first day</a>, and it had reached 3.5 million at last count.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2622380/ELDEN_RING_NIGHTREIGN/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/elden-ring-nightreign/9PJ22QNVCZ3G" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/elden-ring-nightreign-review-fort-night" rel="nofollow">read my review of it here</a> if you want to know how I felt about it.</p>
