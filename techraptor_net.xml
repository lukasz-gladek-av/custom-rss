            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The October Steam Next Fest ends today, and we decided to look into how many upcoming games claim they are using generative AI. Many of these games release in the next few months, which gives us a good current snapshot of where small to mid-size game development is at when it comes to generative AI.</p>

<p>By pulling the information from Steam about which Next Fest titles had enabled the AI Generated Content Disclosure, we discovered that over 500 demos disclosed using AI. The data here is necessarily imperfect, as it only counts the games that have disclosed AI Usage.</p>

<p>As we saw with games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-alters-possible-generative-ai" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="The Alters Players Reckon They've Spotted Some Undisclosed Generative AI Work"><em>The Alters</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2286600/view/503963131223999762" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Statement on AI use in Hotel Barcelona"><em>Hotel Barcelona</em></a>, some games will not disclose it on the Steam page but do use or had used generative AI. In the case of <em>The Alters</em>, their Steam page doesn't disclose that the game previously had generative AI content used in development.</p>

<p>The exact total of games disclosing generative AI was 507 games out of the total 2960 titles in Steam Next Fest. By briefly examining their AI Generated Content Disclosure, we found out that three of them had situations that made us believe they may not have qualified as using generative AI in the making or marketing of their game, giving us a new total of 504 games.</p>

<p>This gave us a percentage of 17.03%, which is close to 1 in 5 games. As mentioned above, this is only a baseline figure, with more games potentially making use of it either in early stages of production or in areas that aren't seen (such as code) and not disclosing it.</p>

<p>Games had a variety of uses for generative AI in their disclosures, which we haven't yet fully reviewed, but we saw several major areas of use emerge:</p>

<ul><li>Marketing and Steam Store Page Assets&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Art assets in-game (from concept art, to placeholders, to all of the art in a game)</li>
	<li>Audio assets (music, sound effects, voice over)</li>
	<li>Translation</li>
	<li>Coding</li>
	<li>Writing</li>
	<li>Ideation</li>
	<li>In-Game Live Calls</li>
</ul><p>Those are roughly in the order of frequency of usage we saw in the 100 games we examined. There will be a more in-depth report on more games in a future report. There were also a number of games that used AI for creating Steam capsule images, store page pictures, or for translating their store page with no other use of generative AI.</p>

<h2>What Was the Most Popular Demo with Generative AI In Steam Next Fest?</h2>

<p>The most popular game that had an AI generated content disclosure was <em>Cloudheim </em>by Noodle Cat Games. It broke into the top 50 of Steam Next Fest October 2025 most played demos and had a max concurrent user count of 667. Here is what their AI Content disclosure said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our primary use of generative AI is for internal communication: we made a bot called InfoSage which helps us search our documentation, notify others of interesting discussions, and look through recent changes to pinpoint when bugs occurred.</p>

<p>Our developers can choose to use generative AI as part of an iterative exploratory process, but the decision of how and when is left up to individuals, and the final product always reflects the creativity and expression of our own development team.</p>

<p>No people have been replaced by AI. This includes artists and engineers on our team, voice actors, localization, or other roles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>How generative AI will shape our hobby and industry going forward is something that is yet to be determined, and what players are willing to accept will play a huge role in how it is used as well. Keep an eye out for a more in-depth report of AI usage on Steam Next Fest games.</p>
