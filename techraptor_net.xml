            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/avowed-cross-buy-xbox-battle-net<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Blizzard and Xbox have announced that if you buy Obsidian's upcoming action RPG&nbsp;<em>Avowed&nbsp;</em>on the Battle.net platform, you'll be able to play it on Xbox, and the reverse is also true.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24177681/avowed-breaks-down-barriers-with-cross-buy" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the Blizzard website, the company grandly proclaims that the feature "breaks down barriers with cross-buy" and confirms that&nbsp;<em>Avowed&nbsp;</em>represents the introduction of this feature between Battle.net and Xbox, suggesting more games could support it in future.</p>

<p>In short, if you buy&nbsp;<em>Avowed&nbsp;</em>on Battle.net, then by linking your Xbox account with your Battle.net account, you'll be able to pick up where you left off on Xbox and won't need to buy the game again on that storefront.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avowed-battle.net-xbox-xaurip.jpg?itok=ZpiOwGkD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avowed-battle.net-xbox-xaurip.jpg?itok=vtFVgzOh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Avowed&nbsp;</em>will let you play on both Battle.net and Xbox if you buy it on either platform.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're wondering why this is a thing, we've racked our brains here at TechRaptor Towers, and the only real benefit we can come up with is that this will technically allow you to play&nbsp;<em>Avowed&nbsp;</em>on both Xbox and Steam Deck.</p>

<p>The Steam Deck doesn't play very nice with the Microsoft Store, but with a little fiddling under the hood, you can install Battle.net on your Deck and it'll work alright. As such, it should theoretically be possible to play&nbsp;<em>Avowed&nbsp;</em>across Xbox (or PC) and Steam Deck.</p>

<p>Of course, if you're going to play the game on PC exclusively (for which you'll <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/avowed-pc-specs" rel="nofollow">probably want a pretty good machine</a>), then there's really no reason not to just pick it up on Steam, and I can't imagine any other use case where someone might find it useful to switch between Battle.net and Xbox.</p>




<p><em>Avowed&nbsp;</em>is the latest game from&nbsp;<em>Pillars of Eternity&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds&nbsp;</em>developer Obsidian. Appropriately enough, it looks rather like a combination of those two games, marrying the first-person action of the latter with the setting of the former.</p>

<p>Initially, it was announced that the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/avowed-30fps-xbox-target" rel="nofollow">would run at 30fps</a> on Xbox Series X|S, but Obsidian has since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/obisidian-confirms-avowed-60fps-mode-on-xbox-series-x-after-previously-saying-you-dont-necessarily-need-it" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">confirmed</a> that it will implement a 60fps mode for the game on consoles.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Avowed&nbsp;</em>when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2457220/Avowed/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/avowed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on February 18th. It'll also be available on Game Pass on day one, assuming you're signed up to the PC or Ultimate tiers.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nighreign-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-nighreign-release-date-revealed-for-may.1106793/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nighreign-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco and FromSoftware have announced the&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>release date, and it's only a few more months before you'll get to play the survival-focused multiplayer spinoff.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1889676062071656525" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X,&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>launches across PC and consoles on May 30th. Pre-orders are, according to Bandai Namco, open now via the game's <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring-nightreign/shop-now" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official website</a>, although I wasn't able to actually pick the game up when I checked, so you may have to wait an hour or two.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, it's a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-2025" rel="nofollow">multiplayer-focused spinoff</a> of the immensely popular 2022 action RPG&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>(although just like its forebear,&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>can also be played solo).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date-witch.jpg?itok=dkB0RnB0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date-witch.jpg?itok=SKViCQdy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>is launching in May.</figcaption></figure><p>The game will take place in the parallel world of Limveld, where you and two other friends (but not one other friend, strangely enough) must battle increasingly tough waves of enemies and bosses over the course of three in-game days and nights.</p>

<p>Rather than creating your own character,&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>will give you the chance to play as one of eight predetermined characters, each with their own backstory and lore to discover, as well as their own skillset to utilize.</p>

<p>FromSoftware has confirmed that you will be facing enemies from both&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-dark-souls-enemies-confirmed" rel="nofollow">the&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls&nbsp;</em>series</a>, and new types of enemies will also be appearing.</p>

<p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>has been designed to offer a standalone experience set in the broader&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>universe, so even if you haven't played the base game or its&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>DLC, you should find something to enjoy here.</p>




<p>Ahead of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>'s launch, a network test is scheduled to take place in February, giving some players the chance to try out the game's online features and spend a little time in its world.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, signups for that test have concluded, but if you were lucky enough to get into the test, you'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>between February 14th and 16th across a number of set time periods.</p>

<p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2622380/ELDEN_RING_NIGHTREIGN/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and Xbox on May 30th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alan-wake-2-profitable-sales-2m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remedy Entertainment has announced that&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</em>is finally profitable, having recouped its development costs and marketing fees by the end of last year.</p>

<p>According to a new financial <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/inderes-widgets-prod-assets/remedy/attachments/6930dba3-2c3f-41a3-a596-8933ce7c454b/remedy-q4-fy-2024-financial-statement-release.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a> covering the full 2024 fiscal year, not only is&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</em>profitable, but it had also exceeded two million sales at the close of 2024, meaning it's picked up <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alan-wake-2-sales-control-2-action-rpg" rel="nofollow">another 200,000 sales or so since November</a>.</p>

<p>Back in April 2024, Remedy reported that&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alan-wake-2-budget-remedy-financials" rel="nofollow">still hadn't earned back its budget</a>, although the studio said it had "recouped a significant part" of its expenses (stopping short of elaborating on exactly how much).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/alan-wake-2-profitable-remedy-combat.jpg?itok=EyzyOjnl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/alan-wake-2-profitable-remedy-combat.jpg?itok=S5a8nJed 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</em>is finally profitable for developer Remedy Entertainment. Hurrah!</figcaption></figure><p>The game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-q3-financials-alan-wake-2" rel="nofollow">inching closer towards profitability</a> as of November, at which point Remedy reported that it had earned back "most" of its development and marketing costs. That leads us to the present moment and&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2</em>'s final crossing of that all-important finish line.</p>

<p>In terms of finances, Remedy says its revenue jumped by 49.3% in 2024 when compared to the previous year, although the company hasn't had a profitable year overall.</p>

<p>That could well be down to the fact that Remedy hasn't released any major games this year (although it did launch two DLC packs for&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2</em>), as well as the company's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-control-franchise-rights" rel="nofollow">acquisition of the rights to&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em>from former owner 505 Games</a> back in February last year.</p>

<p>With regards to the fourth quarter of 2024, Remedy says its revenue increased compared to last year's fourth quarter, although once again, profits are down compared to the same period the year prior.</p>

<p><em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>is still on track to launch this year, while&nbsp;<em>Control 2&nbsp;</em>entered full production earlier this month and the&nbsp;<em>Max Payne&nbsp;</em>remakes are "making steady progress". Neither of the latter two have release dates yet, unfortunately.</p>
