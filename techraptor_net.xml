            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clash-of-clans-tv-show<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Netflix has announced that a&nbsp;<em>Clash of Clans</em> TV&nbsp;show is in the works, so now you have to reckon with that being a thing in the real world as much as I do. Sorry about that.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/netflix/status/1924804801616871741" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Netflix says that the "world" of&nbsp;<em>Clash of Clans&nbsp;</em>is "coming to life as an animated series on Netflix", although the streaming giant doesn't provide any kind of time frame for the series' arrival, nor does it specify what the story will be about.</p>

<p>However, if the mobile game is anything to go by, the series will probably revolve around chiefs trying to defend their village against attacks from other clans. I'd assume there will be a hefty dollop of self-referentiality and pop-culture gags, too, for such is the way these things often go.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/clash-of-clans-netflix-series-characters.jpg?itok=acCTnHEP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/clash-of-clans-netflix-series-characters.jpg?itok=Uq5lMiI4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Clash of Clans&nbsp;</em>is getting a streaming series courtesy of Netflix.</figcaption></figure><p>In the (admittedly rather amusing) trailer announcing the&nbsp;<em>Clash of Clans&nbsp;</em>series on Netflix, Supercell staffers describe how there's at least one comment asking for a&nbsp;<em>Clash of Clans&nbsp;</em>show under every video made about the game by the studio "since 2012".</p>

<p>The video's description merely promises that the&nbsp;<em>Clash of Clans&nbsp;</em>show will star "your favorite moustachioed Barbarian and his high-pitched, hog-riding friends", so I guess if you were worried the show wouldn't be true to the game, you can put those worries to rest.</p>

<p>It sounds like we're going to have to wait quite a while for more information about the&nbsp;<em>Clash of Clans&nbsp;</em>series, so for now, you can content yourself with Supercell's announcement trailer. Even I, swinging brick of a heart and all, can admit it's quite funny.</p>




<p><em>Clash of Clans&nbsp;</em>will follow in the footsteps of other video games to get animated Netflix adaptations, including the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-devil-may-cry-renewed-second-season" rel="nofollow"><em>Devil May Cry</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Castlevania</em>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-edgerunners-is-anime-set-in-cyberpunk-universe" rel="nofollow"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></a>, among others.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what kind of direction Netflix is going in with the show, as well as when we can expect it to launch. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-heart-of-democracy-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Arrowhead Game Studios and Sony have released another new&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>update, and this one is bringing the fight straight into the heart of managed democracy, so prepare to defend your home from filthy alien invaders.</p>

<p>This update comes hot on the heels of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-update-illuminate-weapon-customization" rel="nofollow">another patch last week</a>, which introduced new Illuminate enemies for you to take on, as well as a weapon customization system to give you somewhere to spend your Requisition resource.</p>

<p>In the Heart of Democracy update, however, the Illuminate are taking the fight to Super Earth, so it's up to you to head back to your home planet and defend "the towering skyscrapers and crowded streets" of your home turf.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-heart-of-democracy-update-super-earth.jpg?itok=ivKOdluV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-heart-of-democracy-update-super-earth.jpg?itok=rv-p4q08 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Helldivers 2</em>'s Heart of Democracy update tasks you with battling your enemies on Super Earth.</figcaption></figure><p>You'll be fighting inside the city biomes of Super Earth, battling Illuminate foes as they "rain down destruction all around you". Arrowhead says you'll be tussling with the Illuminate over control of certain areas, "gaining and losing control quickly".</p>

<p>As you fight, you'll meet squads of Super Earth troops, who can either battle Illuminate by themselves or join you to do battle against your alien foes. You can also activate Planetary Defense Cannons to "take down the Illuminate fleet in a grand show of power".</p>

<p>Civilians will also be roaming the streets of Super Earth's cities, and it's up to you to keep them safe. After all, friendly fire is very much not the Super Earth way, nor is it the way of managed democracy.</p>




<p>Elsewhere in<i>&nbsp;Helldivers 2&nbsp;</i>news, the game's new <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-masters-of-ceremony-warbond" rel="nofollow">Masters of Ceremony Warbond</a> went live last week, giving you access to new gear on which to spend your Super Credits.</p>

<p>If you'd like to take the fight away from Super Earth and onto the tabletop, you'll be pleased to know that a board game adaptation of&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/helldivers-2-board-game-fully-funded-in-12-minutes-on-gamefound" rel="nofollow">fully crowdfunded in a staggering 12 minutes</a> last month as well.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/tales-of-seikyu-preview-cute-yokai-farming-fun</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tales-of-seikyu-preview-cute-yokai-farming-fun.1193916/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/tales-of-seikyu-preview-cute-yokai-farming-fun<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the hardest things to nail in games is worldbuilding, especially in a farming sim, and <em>Tales of Seikyu</em> does it so well that the bugs that crop up are hardly noticeable. The Early Access game is full of potential, and the roughly one-month in-game content is as gorgeous and vibrant as developer ACE Entertainment promised.</p>

<p><em>Tales of Seikyu</em> begins with the main character and their sister, Kon, moving to the town of Seikyu. The siblings are fox yokai, and Seikyu was founded by their ancestors to be a haven for yokai of all kinds.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-seikyu-player-and-kon.jpg?itok=aGCgLoAA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tales-of-seikyu-player-and-kon.jpg?itok=ZwDlOWfP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The player and Kon first appear sleeping, which is honestly a vibe.</figcaption></figure><p>However, now the fox clan has almost completely disappeared, including the player and Kon’s parents. The last note they have from their parents is to travel to Seikyu, where they’ll uncover secrets and hopefully find the last of the fox clan.</p>

<p>The Early Access launch of <em>Tales of Seikyu</em> only dives into the game’s first chapter, where Kon and the player learn the very beginning of the story and mingle with the town of Seikyu.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-seikyu-harbor.jpg?itok=AoyoOmDY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tales-of-seikyu-harbor.jpg?itok=I8jlQNWz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Tales of Seikyu&nbsp;</em>welcomes you on its beautiful harbor.</figcaption></figure><h2>Welcome to Seikyu, Home to All Yokai</h2>

<p>Seikyu itself somehow feels natural. Despite being filled with yokai characters, the town feels like a living, breathing town that has its own schedule regardless of the player. This is something that even the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="81cf7c96-4454-465b-950b-1d47c5873d28" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/how-stardew-valley-could-have-impacted-story-of-seasons" rel="nofollow">most popular farming/life sims</a> struggle to do, and <em>Tales of Seikyu</em> nails it from the start.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It also felt relaxing to play. Most games in the genre create a sense of urgency in terms of profit and optimizing how your time is spent, and <em>Tales of Seikyu</em> didn’t create that rushed pace. Instead, I felt no remorse for spending my time however I wanted – there was no rush, a hard thing to manufacture.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-seikyu-main-square.jpg?itok=s3UpPpwo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tales-of-seikyu-main-square.jpg?itok=eSs0Lcrm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Tales of Seikyu&nbsp;</em>conveniently puts all of the shops close together.</figcaption></figure><p>There’s currently about one season’s worth of content to play through, with Spring being the only season with a festival. However, the Carp Festival is incredible, and – dare I say – one of the best festivals I’ve seen in the genre.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Carp Festival has two mini-games for players to enjoy. The first is an egg hunt, which isn’t too special (though it is incredibly well-done). The second is a game where players are flying with carp, collecting different symbols in the air that flow with the beat.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The graphics and music were beautiful, matching the rest of <em>Tales of Seikyu</em>. In general, the game is gorgeous. While there are a few stutters in performance, I was able to play with Medium settings on a ROG Ally X and High settings on my PC. Considering it’s in early access, these types of stutters were expected.</p>

<p>The characters are as gorgeous as they are well-written. The character portraits are gorgeous and fun, and they capture the characters’ personalities well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Getting to know the characters was a pleasant surprise, and spending time with them was more fun than I expected. <em>Tales of Seikyu</em> has a unique system that lets players spend time with characters as they level up their skills.</p>

<p>It combined the two gameplay loops in a way that I haven’t seen in other farming sims, and it was refreshing and made the world feel even more alive.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-seikyu-yoni.jpg?itok=IIvzbKIu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tales-of-seikyu-yoni.jpg?itok=2CR3ZmVK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The characters in&nbsp;<em>Tales of Seikyu</em>&nbsp;have adorable models and portraits.</figcaption></figure><h2>Combat in Tales of Seikyu Is Rewarding</h2>

<p>The combat was also integrated with the other systems in the game. At the Early Access release, there’s one main dungeon where players will fight. These are broken up into 40 different rooms, and players will need to either beat the enemies or solve light puzzles to get through.</p>

<p>There’s a variety of weapons that sort of play differently, though I didn’t notice much of a difference between them. The stats of the weapon determined which I used – the more damage, the better.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additionally, getting closer to one character in particular opens up the ability to buy weapons. This feels rewarding and, again, very natural.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are two main bosses currently in&nbsp;<em>Tales of Seikyu</em>, and both of them were a challenge (though I did get the second boss stuck in a hole and cheesed the fight). Between them and several of the tanky enemies, combat felt pretty rewarding.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-seikyu-boar-farming.jpg?itok=tk3MtxB9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tales-of-seikyu-boar-farming.jpg?itok=jmmICWEl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Farming in&nbsp;<em>Tales of Seikyu&nbsp;</em>is more interesting when you can take on different yokai forms.</figcaption></figure><p>Players also learn about different yokai forms in the dungeon, and these yokai forms are helpful in both combat and farming. For example, who needs a boring watering can when you can transform into a slime and quickly water everything?</p>

<h2>Early Access Bugs</h2>

<p>While there are endless positives, it’s worth noting the bugs. Every time I wanted to buy something from any shop, I had to save and reload the game. This applied to every shop around town, which was frustrating until I realized the quick workaround.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other bugs included falling through the map (though I got lucky and was pulled out by events each time) and clothes not fitting the female main character correctly. Though, to be honest, the skirts that didn't fit just looked like a skirt with slits in it, so it wasn't distracting, either.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-seikyu-yui-bug.jpg?itok=trqxNDLL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tales-of-seikyu-yui-bug.jpg?itok=H3kiUzzz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A common bug in&nbsp;<em>Tales of Seikyu&nbsp;</em>is characters looking the wrong way when talking to you, like here.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Tales of Seikyu</em> is in Early Access. These bugs are expected to an extent, and nothing was so bad that it was unplayable. In fact, some of them were funny. Every time I went to bed, my player jumped at the same time (the A input being both jump and interact). And let’s be honest, who doesn’t like hopping into bed at the end of a long day?</p>

<h2><em>Tales of Seikyu</em> | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Overall, <em>Tales of Seikyu</em> is an enjoyable experience, and one that I can’t wait to explore more as content is released. While there are a few things to iron out in terms of bugs, it manages to do what even the biggest farming sim names can’t with worldbuilding and interconnected gameplay systems.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With games like <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b0667482-769b-4371-a186-298d48873c36" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/fields-of-mistria-review-next-best-cozy-farming-sim" rel="nofollow">Fields of Mistria</a> releasing in the genre as well, it's clear that the genre is making a return to the basics and completely polishing them.</p>

<hr><p><strong><em>Tails of Seikyu</em>&nbsp;</strong><em>was previewed over approximately 9 hours of gameplay with a key provided by the developer. All screenshots were taken during the preview process.</em></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/daggerheart-gm-tools-high-level-play-and-miniature-discussion-with-designers</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/daggerheart-gm-tools-high-level-play-and-miniature-discussion-with-the-designers.1193913/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/daggerheart-gm-tools-high-level-play-and-miniature-discussion-with-designers<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With the release of <em>Daggerheart</em>, many fans are opening up their core rulebooks, learning how to teach their players to roll up characters, and beginning to craft a variety of adventures in the many Campaign Frames. Ahead of the<em> Daggerheart Core Rulebook </em>release, we got to talk with Lead Designers Spenser Starke and Rowan Hall about their ethos behind designing Environments and Adversaries and how they hope to support high-level play.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you want to learn more about <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="599a4c8d-e714-4b90-8aba-04105d1db5b5" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/daggerheart-environments-seek-to-supply-gms-with-easy-to-insert-challenges-and" rel="nofollow">Environments in </a><em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="599a4c8d-e714-4b90-8aba-04105d1db5b5" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/daggerheart-environments-seek-to-supply-gms-with-easy-to-insert-challenges-and" rel="nofollow">Daggerheart</a> </em>be sure to check out our exclusive reveal of some Environments and conversation about how to implement them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Daggerheart </em>has free-flowing combat, character builds with player-created experiences, and an emphasis on the adventure and narrative while trying to make sure mechanics don't get in the way. For a game that seems to lean into roleplay, I was intrigued to learn more about the tools that DMs would be offered.</p>

<h2>How <em>Daggerheart </em>Helps You Build Adversaries And Encounters</h2>

<p>"One of my favorite sections in the book is where we go through how we build different adversary types and why we make the choices that we do," Hall explained "Hopefully, it feels like a conversation with the designers. The goal there was to make it as approachable as possible with as many examples as possible so people can refer to it almost like a recipe book."</p>

<p>While the design of an Environment or Adversary can begin with the prompts and discussions with the designers, there's also careful math behind the balance of the game. Starke walked me through the process.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/daggerheart-tier-1-adversary.jpg?itok=Qa1SALf9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/daggerheart-tier-1-adversary.jpg?itok=QtsokSSQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In this example, Starke discussed building a Brawler adversary type and the questions that would prompt "Why do we want a Brawler? What's the whole reason why we're making the Brawler? Why wouldn't I want a Minion here?" It's those kinds of questions that help solidify the idea of the creature in your mind. Then the GM can use the Battle Point system, like ordering off a menu, to pick what Adversaries should be present.</p>

<p>For those who want to make encounters easier or harder for the party, there are also rules for how you should add or remove Battle Points from your 'menu' to ensure the encounter has the level of impact you want it to.</p>

<h2>Teaching A GM High-Level Play</h2>

<p>While we had spoken about building encounters and Adversaries, I wanted to touch on what resources were included specifically for high-level play. This kind of play is what many TTRPG players greatly look forward to, but it's also quite frequently where the game starts to ask you, as the GM, to perform your own heavy lifting.</p>

<p>"There's a section in the book that charts out story structure and the way you might approach it over the course of a campaign. It's a smaller section, but we wrote it in combination with one of our designers who also has a background in novel writing, one of our game designers who has also written on many seasons of Television."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"All of these storytellers put their brains together to figure out 'what is the most basic way we can present story structure so that someone who has never tried it and never thought about it can approach it'"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hall described a table that GMs will be able to use that should take the mystery out of creating a story from level 1 to level 10 without being intimidated by it.</p>

<p>For <em>Daggerheart </em>the level cap is 10, what the game calls Tier 4 play. There's also tips for GMs to explain what a Tier 4 Adversary would look like, what power do they have, etc. Starke explained that a lot of the feedback they got on Tier 4 play was that it was slower.</p>

<p>"When that armor score goes up to 14 or 17, now I'm having to do that math every time I'm getting hit. That became really crunchy and the game slowed down. [...] Armor changed that it now lowers a threshold and doesn't rely on doing heavy math in the moment and that was really core to make a game that focuses on storytelling."</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/daggerheart-ancestry-and-community.jpg?itok=1Hihp-hT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/daggerheart-ancestry-and-community.jpg?itok=L1lMQJXO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Advice For New Players Getting Used To Roleplaying</h2>

<p>It's no secret that there is a heavy emphasis on roleplay and story-telling in <em>Daggerheart</em>, this isn't just intrinsic of the format but it's something that Hall explained was at the core of designing <em>Daggerheart</em>.</p>

<p>"One of the things that we do when designing - whether we're looking at a class, an ancestry, an adversary - is to say 'what story are we trying to tell by presenting it as an offering'" Past that Hall described that their goal was also to make those options as open ended as possible.</p>

<p>If you want to play to the tropes of high-fantasy, grimdark, etc then it's easy to find those ways to play but if you're also interested in creating a character that goes against or subverts those tropes they didn't want the system to hold back that creativity.</p>

<p>Another way that <em>Daggerheart </em>welcomes new players into roleplay is with Connection Questions. "When people are making their characters in the character guide, there's a selection of background questions and a selection of connection questions. The background questions are designed to help the player create their character, but most importantly, to let the GM know what the player wants. It prompts the players to give the villain from the backstory, their hometown, and the thing that they're seeking."</p>

<p>Starke joked that it's a way for a GM to know "who do you care about the most?" while slyly miming writing down notes.</p>

<p>"For the player-to-player side, by making connections from Session Zero, saying 'I am connected to you because…', now the players also have those same tags in those notes. They can plot ways to bring it out or support the stories that each other wants to tell."</p>

<h2>Manage Your Resources</h2>

<p>In reviewing how the game had evolved as the open beta period had continued, I was interested in just how much there is for a player to keep track of. They have their health and abilities, but also armor that can degrade, stress that can build up, and Hope to earn.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/daggerheart-character-sheet-and-sidecar.jpg?itok=CJwA4OGI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/daggerheart-character-sheet-and-sidecar.jpg?itok=H6_78uSj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>At a lot of junctions in the game, you'll be presented with choices: do I take some extra damage or use my armor to protect myself? Should I risk more stress to unleash a powerful attack if it leaves me vulnerable?</p>

<p>For lack of a better term I wanted to understand what led them to decisions to include resource management that could feel so 'crunchy' and how that affected the game mechanically as well as through story.</p>

<p>"One of the big reasons why is that we wanted it to feel different when you were blocking with a shield versus dodging out of the way of an attack," Starke explained. "We wanted to create some flow from mechanics to narrative."</p>

<p>"There's a little bit more mechanically, and resources to use," referencing Hope specifically as a resource that you gain almost every roll of the dice. "All of those contribute to the genre that we're playing with here in <em>Daggerheart </em>which is the Heroic Fantasy genre"</p>

<p>Hall added "we want all of that resource management, all of that math and the dice rolling, to also feel like it's narratively aligned." Pulling from a previous session that they had been playing in Hall explained that none of their rolls were earning them Hope. "That told me the place that my character was in, I was looking more towards my abilities that require me to spend stress."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Stress is one of my favorite mechanics because, to me, it feels like how actual stress works. You can spend your own stress to do cool things, you can decide to do things that will stress you out, and the world can inflict stress upon you."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Talking about this experience Hall not only discussed how it gave them totally different gameplay options, but also how it worked to inform the narrative of their character and how they were feeling in the moment.</p>

<h2><em>Daggerheart's </em>Beta and Live Stream Success</h2>

<p><em>Daggerheart </em>may just be releasing but it's been in the publics eye for some time, in the form of a public beta as well as being featured in multiple Critical Role mini-series and live shows. I asked Starke and Hall if they remember when during this period they really felt like <em>Daggerheart </em>was going to be something big.</p>

<p>"[Matthew] Mercer was so wonderful with us, learning mechanics as we were building them" Hall began</p>

<p>"He was on it, rolled with the punches of us being like 'Ok Matt, I know you're playing a game today but these things have changes'"</p>

<p>Recalling watching the first Menagerie stream with the development team Starke recounts, "It's live, we were all sitting there with bated breath [...] I remember the magic of watching them play and seeing them have a blast. We knew they were having fun when we were doing internal playtests but to have the relief of them on-stream just having the best time we thought 'We did it!'"</p>

<p>"TTRPGs at their core are about having fun with your friends and seeing people that we care so much about having fun with the game, it meant so much to us," Hall added "seeing people who were actively playing the beta also commenting on the stream and commenting on things going on at their own table was the peak version of 'your friends having fun.'"</p>

<h2><em>Daggerheart </em>Miniatures</h2>

<p>Knowing my own table's enjoyment from seeing the game brought to life with miniatures, I did try to get some information about when we might be able to get our hands on <em>Daggerheart </em>Miniatures? Unfortunately Starke's response was "We don't know, but in success anything could happen"</p>

<p>While we didn't get to learn about any plans that didn't stop Starke from highlighting how in design he wanted a game that was narratively focused, but was also intriguing in a way that players would want to purchase or create miniatures.</p>

<p>Talking about miniature wishlists, Hall began casually by stating, "I really want to see the Oracle of Doom as a miniature, it's one of the Adversaries that I just think is so terrifying"</p>

The Campaign Frame, that Matt wrote for <em>Daggerheart</em>, will be the setting for an 8-part mini-series with the cast of Critical Role beginning on May 29th.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"It's the stuff of nightmares (Affectionate)" - Rowan Hall on Age of Umbra</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Starke was able to share that the inspiration to have Age of Umbra written comes from a homegame that Starke and Mercer are in with fellow TTRPG performers, Erika Ishii, Aabria Iyengar, and Brennan Lee Mulligan, where they play Kingdom Death Monster together. When the idea of creating Campaign Frames came up Starke approached Matt to ask "Can we do a Soulsborne-inspire/Kingdom Death Monster inspired Campaign Frame for this?" and he said he was so in…</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/daggerheart-review-narrative-forward-yes-and-ttrpg-that-is-force-to-be-reckoned<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It was big news when <em>Daggerheart </em>was announced from Darrington Press, the tabletop publishing arm of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="taxonomy_term" data-entity-uuid="3f8817f0-9357-4cd7-a8da-195b567fe5e2" href="https://techraptor.net/topic/critical-role" rel="nofollow">Critical Role</a>. The company, built on <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons </em>Actual Plays, steps into the high-fantasy TTRPG space, and what they've come out with is a blast. Plenty of Character Options and DM tools are included, but I have a feeling I know just who this all won't click with.</p>

<h2>What Comes With <em>Daggerheart</em>?</h2>

<p>For the core set of <em>Daggerheart </em>you'll be receiving a 360+ page Core Rulebook. This includes everything you need to play the game from building a Player Character and how to interact with the world, to a list of different Adversaries a party might fight and information about the Campaign Frames to set your adventures within.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To learn more about what went into the creation of Daggerheart and how designers, Spenser Starke and Rowan Hall, look to support DMs <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ec6ba1b0-bff9-42b1-a2d3-fccbe606c822" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/daggerheart-gm-tools-high-level-play-and-miniature-discussion-with-designers" rel="nofollow">check out our pre-release interview.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In addition to the physical book there is also a folder of cards, these cards include information about each of the different sub-classes (two sub-classes for each of the nine classes), Ancestry information, Community information, and a deck of cards for all of the abilities for each of the Domains (think of these like spell and ability lists)</p>

<p>When building a character out you can put it all into your character sheet, or you can juggle between the abilities and weapons that you might keep on your character sheet and the physical cards for quick referencing your abilities.</p>

<p>There's a lot of TTRPG where you'll hear people say "building a character is very fast" but <em>Daggerheart </em>is one where I would agree. With the cards laid out in front of you you get to pick a sub-class (that comes with the Class and it's Class features), Ancestry (species), Community (what type of upbringing your character has), starting equipment, and input basic stats.</p>

<p>You'll know as soon as you have picked your Sorcerer sub-class that you'll want to pick a Instinct weapon, then it's just a matter of picking two abilities for your domains.</p>

<p>Stats are based on a standard array (+2, +1, +1, 0, 0, -1) and other characteristics like your starting evasion, hit points are all based on your class.</p>

<p>You'll end up with a completely filled-out character sheet and five playing cards, and you're ready to go.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/daggerheart-character-cards.jpg?itok=6ar31RmD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/daggerheart-character-cards.jpg?itok=cMmPDqQS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Quick reference cards offer a nice change from the character sheet, but more places to look</figcaption></figure><p>I loved the character creation process. While it did feel like there were less options being presented to me the walls that each of those options presented were far more spaced out. An example might be the Sorcerer's Minor Illusion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Make a Spellcast Roll (10). On a success, you create a minor visual illusion no larger than yourself within Close range. This illusion is convincing to anyone at Close range or farther out."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's a simple roll and then the world is your oyster. Whether you use this for flavor, to try to fool an adversary, or include it as part of a performance. There's no nitty gritty about inspections, whether it can or can't make a sound, etc. This kind of prioritization for creativity is seen in a lot of the abilities.</p>

<h2>Character Growth</h2>

<p>Leveling up in <em>Daggerheart </em>offers characters a variety of options depending on what level they've reached (where the max is 10). These are things like gaining an additional Hit Point, Stress Slot, upgrading your experiences, or more.</p>

<p>Each level up has six or more possibilities for you to choose two from, letting you prioritize what you're most interested in and begin to create further diversification with your character.</p>

<p>This is also where the Tiers come into play. A level 1 character is Tier 1, but a Level 5-7 character is in Tier 3. Each of these Tiers is a good indicator for the GM, but also the players what kinds of experiences they should be having at the table. Each time you ascend a Tier you know that you've graduated to a new level of adventuring.</p>

<p>When first opening up all of the cards and reviewing the character sheets it seemed like there would be cards for abilities, whether those abilities be tied to what kind of creature you were playing or what they specialized in, and that the player sheet would be for tracking weapons, inventory, and stats/resources.</p>

<p>I was mistaken, realizing that class features instead go on your character sheet. It felt like an arbitrary line had been drawn between what would get it's own card and what would be on the character sheet and the most basic Class features didn't make the cut.</p>

<h2>Tools For A GM</h2>

<p>When playing <em>Daggerheart </em>at no point did I not feel supported by the Core Rulebook. This thing is absolutely packed with not just all of the rules that you'll need to manage the game, but also to make it your own.</p>

<p>A large number of rule explanations, like how to craft encounters, create new adversaries, and to deal with the results of player rolls don't just tell you what to do, but extrapolate on the different ways that you can handle these events, and even how the designers would approach these situations.</p>

<p>There's a lot of effort put into reassuring the GM that there's no one 'correct' way to play the game, and that in situations that call for it you can definitely fudge or ignore certain aspects of a stat block or rule.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/daggerheart-dm-assistance.jpg?itok=o63JZ1Rq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/daggerheart-dm-assistance.jpg?itok=TEmcFOdJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Hope and Fear Always Progressing The Story</h2>

<p>The most unique aspect for me in <em>Daggerheart </em>is that all skill checks are performed with two D12, one for Hope and one for Fear, as opposed to a D20 or a group of D6. You'll always add the numbers together, but whether the higher number was Hope or Fear will have different effects.</p>

<p>Succeeding your skill check with a 5 on the Fear die and a 9 on the Hope die will give you a total of 14 and you'll earn Hope for your character, if those numbers were reversed you may still pass your skill check, but the GM obtains a fear point and while there is a success there might be a consequence.</p>

<p>It's an easy method to create varying levels of success and when Hope is capped at six per player and Fear for the DM stops at Twelve. This resource will continue to gather for the player or DM with every single check or attack allowing you to be spending and receiving them freely. Your access to this resource will also let you pull off bigger and badder abilities.</p>

It's a way to promote even the most basic of gameplay and mean that even if you fail a skill check there's a chance for you to gain at least something. There's no wasted action and it also allows for the DM to prompt for more actions knowing that they too can obtain more resources from it.</p>

<h2>Combat Is Freeform</h2>

<p>Combat is where I believe players will either really enjoy it, or really not like it. Combat in <em>Daggerheart </em>is freeform, letting the players make moves in whatever order they want until the GM decides to cut in, spending one or multiple Fear to activate an Adversary dealing some damage.</p>

<p>This style of combat creates a scenario of requiring patience and planning, knowing when you'd like to jump in, but it also requires you to maintain attention on the battlefield. You'll never know if the enemy you're next to is about to take multiple swings at you, or when a party member is going to invite you to participate in a combo attack.</p>

<p>Running <em>Daggerheart,&nbsp;</em>I personally enjoyed goading players into more attacks, seeing them roll with Fear to work my way towards consecutive attacks to push back on the party. It felt like there was more of an ebb and flow between what I was doing and getting to respond to them in the moment.</p>

<p>What I saw at my table from my players was really interesting compared to our standard game of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3579fb91-ffa9-4c99-a750-de9f92ba642f" href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow"><em>D&amp;D</em></a>. I have multiple players who tend to disengage when it's not their turn while playing <em>D&amp;D</em> and return to focus when they're up, for <em>Daggerheart </em>through I got mixed responses.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/daggerheart-tier-1-adversary_0.jpg?itok=-SwoLkeJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/daggerheart-tier-1-adversary_0.jpg?itok=OotmcvCm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>One of my normally disengaged players ended up being the most engaged at the table, wanting to throw additional dagger slices into the fray any chance they got (that also meant they were the one potentially feeding me the most Fear) while the other player remained disengaged, hopping in when they wanted to.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A line to take turns can allow space for disengagement, but everyone understands a line. Not everyone understands sharing the spotlight, or has the drive to take that spotlight if there are louder voices present</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There will be players who prefer an initiative, taking a turn to perform their action so everyone gets one turn per round, and there will be players that enjoy the freeform style of gameplay. This is likely something that is going to be very hard to determine for a player until they're put in the situation to try it out.</p>

<p>Without putting limitations on actions this kind of combat play style can also lead to introverted players not hopping in. The <em>Daggerheart Core Rulebook</em> does offer some suggestions to make sure that the spotlight is shared including adding a number of actions that each character can perform before everyone's actions are refreshed.</p>

<p>While there are no trial adventures for a GM to kick off with, there are a number of different Campaign Frames that are offered. While I had originally believed these to just be thematic settings, these are so much more.</p>

<p>Each Campaign Frame comes with a pitch to gauge player interest, a list of tones, themes, and inspirational touchstones, and pages of information detailing starting points for stories, Session Zero questions, Campaign Frame-specific mechanics and more.</p>

<p>Fans of <em>Princess Mononoke</em> or <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> can hop into a fantastical world at risk of corruption in the Witherwild Campaign Frame, Delicious in Dungeon fans can explore Beast Feast where the benefits of a short or long rest are replaced with mechanics for how to restore yourself by eating meals made of cooked monsters, and if you're a fan of Wild Wild West or Shadow of the Colossus you can be a cowboy scaling gargantuan beasts in Colossus of the Drylands.</p>

<p>One Campaign Frame has even included a completely made-up language that my mind went wild wondering how to slowly drip-feed that information to my players.</p>

<p>While I can't imagine some of the gimmicks of these Campaign Frames working for a multi-year campaign, I'm definitely excited to run short adventures of hungry adventurers or dungeon diving where the dungeon itself is a monster.</p>

<p>Having been a fan in the original beta period and getting to return I have been blown away by the level of polish that <em>Daggerheart </em>has received and by the amount of clear and concise information that has been provided to the players and GM alike.</p>

<p>I do still wish that there was additional Class cards for the Class abilities to create a separation between the kind of info on the Character Sheet and what's on the cards, but I suppose the easy workaround for this would be to keep the ability information on the sheets to.</p>

<p>I imagine the hardest part of deciding how to run this is the extra coordination required when reaching combat, making sure as the DM you're aware of all of the pieces on the board and how they can all act at any time, but also to make sure none of your players are getting left out of the fray. This will be the piece that is most hit or miss with players.</p>

<p>Overall, <em>Daggerheart </em>promotes strong narrative gameplay that is propped up by mechanics. It's not just schoolyard posturing, but you can have a unique experience that then lets you show off your prowess. It's supporting of the player and it's supporting of the GM which leads to a very happy table.</p>
