  </picture><p>This new campaign tasks Explorers with investigating the mysteries of Ship City and traveling along the Hammurabi Arm. This story begins with the death of an old ruin delver and the disappearance of a mysterious stone tablet. This kicks off a series of strange events within Ship City. What follows is the players navigating the various factions and internal politics of Ship City, and exploring ancient ruins on distant moons.</p><p>The summary of <em>The Flowers of Algorab</em> is in keeping with the appeal of <em>Coriolis: The Great Dark</em>. This new edition of Free League's spacefaring TTRPG shifts its focus away from spacefaring exploration in the vein of Traveller and more towards archeological digs into ancient ruins on alien worlds. The new book features rules dedicated to these expeditions, including rules for a mysterious, deadly plague called The Blight.</p><p>A copy of <em>The Flowers of Algorab</em> contains the following:</p><ul><li data-list-item-id="ecbdc4f4649417329959a08ae1ddc4300">A Campaign book containing new locations, characters, and key plots</li><li data-list-item-id="e04494d24cce154ffbeba8e24fa96d987">An Expedition booklet, containing player information about new Greatships and systems in the Hammurabi Arm</li><li data-list-item-id="e51823dba3c2028ed41eeee12360b66be">Full-Color maps of Ship City, the Charted Sphere, and the Lost Horizon</li><li data-list-item-id="e7a54b189d04e70fcfdcf752d6c569b7f">Delve maps and handouts</li><li data-list-item-id="ed282c87f413b6a4692c04567de2a7312">Blueprints of new vehicles, including Greatships Akhander and Rigel, the Grasshopper shuttle, and the Rhino rover</li></ul><p>If you missed out on its offering during the 2024 Kickstarter campaign, <em>The Flowers of Algorab</em> expansion for <em>Coriolis: The Great Dark</em> is available for pre-order now on Free League's web store. If you pre-order a physical copy before the official release date of February 3, you will receive a PDF at no additional cost.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
