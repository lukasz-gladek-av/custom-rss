This expansion, <em>The One Ring Realms of the Three Rings</em>, focuses on the elves of Tolkien's fantasy world, letting players explore and embody them at the table.</p>



<p>In an official press release, <em>The One Ring Realms of the Three Rings</em> will provide players with lore, rules, and artwork featuring the three realms of the West-elves —three realms for the Three Rings of power wielded by the kings of old.</p>

	<li>Details on twelve new locations of interest. These locations include ones mentioned in Lord of the Rings and others created for this game.</li>
	<li>A brand new Appendix that contains guidelines for creating and playing as elves. The rules include playing as High Elves of Rivendell, Elves of&nbsp;Lórien, and powerful Elf-lords suited for solo play.</li>

<p><em>The One Ring Realms of the Three Rings</em> is the fourth major expansion for the award-winning Middle-earth TTRPG. It joins the dwarf-oriented <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/one-ring-moria-through-doors-of-durin-fully-funded-in-4-minutes" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Moria – Through The Doors of Durin</em></a><em>, </em>the campaign <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/tales-from-lone-lands-announced-for-one-ring" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Tales of the Lone Lands</em></a>, and <em>Ruins of the Lost Realm </em>which focuses on the land that was Eriador.</p>
