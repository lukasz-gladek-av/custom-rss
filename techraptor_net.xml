<p>In case you need a reminder, Xbox's <em>Perfect Dark </em>reboot was canceled earlier this year, and its developer The Initiative <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="df7c528b-daa2-4f58-9ed5-674add97b2fd" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">was shut down into the bargain</a>.</p><p>The game's cancellation and the studio's shutdown were part of a larger wave of layoffs at Microsoft, with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="56028754-47c9-4b65-ac22-8847d892a2d8" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">around 9,000 employees</a> losing their jobs, including staffers at subsidiaries like <em>Candy Crush Saga</em>'s King and Bethesda's parent ZeniMax.</p><p>Legendary studio Rare was also among the companies hit by the wave of layoffs, and the long-in-development <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e65a86bf-038b-44cc-a270-514b2c2e9af9" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Everwild </em>was canceled</a> as well, seemingly leaving Rare with no games currently in the works (although the studio is still supporting multiplayer pirate adventure <em>Sea of Thieves</em>).</p><p>Of course, the sweeping wave of Microsoft layoffs didn't stop Xbox <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-revenue-up-microsoft-2025" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3b9a1ab8-8bd4-4fa7-ad54-c26181c6b9bc" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">reporting a revenue increase</a> back in late July, and it also doesn't appear to have stopped the company seemingly expecting its studios to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-xbox-profit-margins-30-percent-report" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="45823056-a08c-4c3f-9861-36a87b007045" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">hit ridiculously high profit margins</a> (which might explain some of the staff cuts).</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Schreier <a href="https://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-02/-perfect-dark-developer-lays-off-staff-after-funding-deal-falls-through" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">reported</a> that Take-Two was close to saving <em>Perfect Dark </em>from its ignominious demise, but that the deal fell through; Gallagher and Horton's new studio under 2K makes a lot of sense when examined through that lens.</p><p>We'll have to wait and see what the two are cooking up with their new studio, and whether it'll bear any resemblance to <em>Perfect Dark </em>at all. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
