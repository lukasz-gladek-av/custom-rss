True to form, that's exactly what we got today, and here's everything that was announced during said showcase!</p>

<hr><h2>New episodes of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Concierge&nbsp;</em>are on the way</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-concierge-new-episodes-pokemon-presents-february-2025.jpg?itok=UJGGkGeW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-concierge-new-episodes-pokemon-presents-february-2025.jpg?itok=AngXE7QU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>New&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Concierge&nbsp;</em>episodes are coming in September.</figcaption></figure><p>To kick the show off, The Pokemon Company announced new episodes of the charming stop-motion animation&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Concierge</em>. They're set to air via Netflix in September, and you can watch the first four episodes of the show for free via YouTube from now until March 9th.</p>

<h2><em>Pokemon Go&nbsp;</em>Tour: Unova - Global coming this weekend</h2>

<p>Next up, we got a look at the next&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Go&nbsp;</em>Tour, which is happening this weekend. It'll see Black Kyurem and White Kyurem appearing in Raid Battles, and you'll also get the chance to get your hands on Victini and a shiny Meloetta.</p>

<h2>Mobile-focused&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>announcements are go</h2>

<p>Three mobile-focused&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>titles got updates next, namely&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Masters EX</em>,&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Cafe ReMix</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Sleep</em>.</p>

<p>In the former, Champion May and her shiny Primal Kyogre, as well as Champion Brendan and his shiny Primal Groudon, will be making an appearance.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Pokemon Cafe ReMix&nbsp;</em>is getting a new apple-themed menu item along with appearances from Flapple and Appletun, while a new Cresselia versus Darkrai event is coming to&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Sleep</em>.</p>

<h2>New&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Unite&nbsp;</em>fighters announced</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-unite-new-fighters-pokemon-presents-february-2025.jpg?itok=2Lo2DDvE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-unite-new-fighters-pokemon-presents-february-2025.jpg?itok=OrhC4s9w 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Three new fighters have been revealed for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Unite</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Three new Pokemon were announced for the MOBA&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Unite</em>. Suicune is coming to the game on March 1st, followed by Alolan Raichu in April and Alcremie later in the year.</p>

<p>What's more, the game will also see the return of the Remoat Stadium map, as well as a brand new mode called First to 500, which will reward you with unique battle effects when reaching certain point thresholds.</p>

<h2><em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>'s Triumphant Light set revealed</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-triumphant-light-pokemon-presents.jpg?itok=TO6J_eU9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-triumphant-light-pokemon-presents.jpg?itok=g_fQUaSE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A new set is coming to&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>tomorrow.</figcaption></figure><p>The next major expansion set for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>has been revealed in the form of Triumphant Light, and this one looks like it's themed around the deific Pokemon Arceus, which makes sense given that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-update-new-expansion-release-date" rel="nofollow">previous expansion Space-Time Smackdown</a> was built around Dialga and Palkia.</p>

<p>Cards include new Eevee, Magnemite, and Golbat variations, as well as a rather pretty Arceus ex card, a full-art Shaymin, and a pretty sweet-looking shiny Raichu. The set launches tomorrow.</p>

<h2><em>Pokemon TCG&nbsp;</em>is getting Mega Evolutions</h2>

<p>Mega Evolved Pokemon are coming to&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG</em>&nbsp;this year! The trailer showed off some snazzy-looking ex cards for Mega Lucario and Mega Gardevoir, but it didn't reveal a release date for the new feature.</p>

<h2><em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>is getting some fun stuff</h2>

<p>If you're still playing&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet</em>, you'll be pleased to know that you can grab yourself a nifty-looking Rotom Phone cover for each game. Simply input SB00KC0VER for&nbsp;<em>Scarlet&nbsp;</em>and VB00KC0VER for&nbsp;<em>Violet&nbsp;</em>(those are zeroes, not Os).</p>

<p>New Tera Raid Battles for Meowscarada, Skeledirge, and Quaquaval are also coming on February 28th, March 7th, and March 14th, respectively, with more (including Metagross, Garchomp, and Dragapult) on the way in the future.</p>

<h2><em>Pokemon Champions&nbsp;</em>brings battling to Switch and mobiles</h2>




<p>Next up, The Pokemon Company announced a new game called&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Champions</em>, a&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Stadium</em>-style game with an emphasis on battling.</p>

<p>The game will connect to&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Home</em>, allowing you to use 'mons you've teamed up with in your games to battle trainers around the world. This one's coming to Switch and mobile devices, although we don't know when yet.</p>

<h2><em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>coming "late 2025", new gameplay revealed</h2>




<p>Finally, we got to see some new info about&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-a-announced" rel="nofollow"><em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em></a>, and we now know roughly when to expect the game as well, although certain details still seem conspicuous by their absence.</p>

<p>The game will take place in a Lumiose City currently undergoing a "high-tech urban redevelopment plan" in order to "turn it into a city that people and Pokemon truly share".</p>

<p>It looks like the game will largely take place within the confines of the city, and you'll find Wild Zones inside Lumiose where Pokemon live. That's where you'll be doing the majority of your catching and battling, too.</p>

<p>During the trailer, The Pokemon Company introduced some of the fun characters you'll meet in&nbsp;<em>Legends: Z-A</em>, including two new friendly rivals, Urbain or Taunie, one of whom you'll meet (seemingly based on the gender you pick).</p>

<p>We also got a new look at combat in&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>, and it comes with a brand new feature in the form of areas of effect for moves; Rollout, for instance, hits in a straight line, while Rock Slide hits across a wide area. You'll have to dodge alongside your Pokemon to keep up.</p>

<p><em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>launches in late 2025 for Switch, but we didn't get a specific release date, nor did we learn whether the game will be coming to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">recently-revealed Nintendo Switch 2</a>. Ho hum.</p>

<hr><p>That's everything revealed during today's Pokemon Presents showcase! Stay tuned for more on all other things&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>-related.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Special Suikoden Program Set to Air Next Week, Konami Announces]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suikoden-program-march-3rd-announced</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/special-suikoden-program-set-to-air-next-week-konami-announces.1120335/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suikoden-program-march-3rd-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Konami has announced that a special&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>broadcast is set to air next week, bringing more news about the cult JRPG franchise.</p>

<p>In a rather brief <a href="https://x.com/Konami/status/1894938037122957766" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Konami says that the broadcast, which will air on March 3rd at 3pm Pacific (that's 6pm Eastern), will bring you "all the latest news on&nbsp;<em>Suikoden</em>".</p>

<p>That's a particularly interesting way of wording it, because we already know the release date for the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Suikoden II&nbsp;</em>remasters, so presumably, the broadcast will contain some new information about the future of the series.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/suikoden-special-program-remaster.jpg?itok=pZdUOGOa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/suikoden-special-program-remaster.jpg?itok=q7rTwVNf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>More&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>news could be on the way.</figcaption></figure><p>If Konami does have more to reveal about the&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>franchise, I'd put my money on potential remasters for the third, fourth, and fifth games in the series.&nbsp;<em>Suikoden V</em>, in particular, is well-liked by many fans, although the other two were perhaps a little more cautiously received.</p>

<p>I think more remasters are significantly more likely than a brand new game in the franchise, although Konami must be pretty confident in&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>if it's doing more than just the upcoming remasters of the first two games.</p>

<p>News of the&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>broadcast comes as Konami revisits some of its biggest franchises in the form of remasters and remakes. Last year, for instance, the company worked with Bloober Team for the&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake, which has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">amassed more than two million sales</a> around the world so far.</p>

<p>The studio is also gearing up for the release of&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em>, a remake of the 2004 stealth-action classic, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-release-date-leak-playstation" rel="nofollow">in August</a>. The game will feature a visual overhaul thanks to the magic of Unreal Engine 5, as well as updated gameplay mechanics.</p>




<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>itself, the snappily-titled&nbsp;<em>Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars&nbsp;</em>collection is due to launch next week.</p>

<p>As the name suggests, the collection remasters the first two games in the&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>series, which are connected by a number of recurring characters and narrative elements. The remasters will feature updated visuals, new animations, and extra quality-of-life improvements.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out the&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>remasters when they land on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1932640/Suikoden_III_HD_Remaster_Gate_Rune_and_Dunan_Unification_Wars/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10004292" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/suikoden-iii-hd-remaster-gate-rune-and-dunan-unification-wars-pre-order-bonus/9P9FM62WZXR2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/suikoden-i-and-ii-hd-remaster-gate-rune-and-dunan-unification-wars-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> on March 6th.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>broadcast, meanwhile, is set for March 3rd, and you can watch it via Konami's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KONAMI573ch" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>. The link in Konami's post on X leads to the Japanese channel, but the post itself is in English, so it's not clear whether the show will air in English or just in Japanese.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Warner Bros. Gaming Division Reports "Disappointing" 2024 as Revenue Falls]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warner-bros-financials-2024-revenue-falls</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warner-bros-gaming-division-reports-disappointing-2024-as-revenue-falls.1120332/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warner-bros-financials-2024-revenue-falls<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Warner Bros. has released its financial summary for both the fourth quarter of 2024 and the year as a whole, and it probably won't surprise you to learn that it's been a pretty bad year for the media giant's gaming wing.</p>

<p>In its earnings <a href="https://s201.q4cdn.com/336605034/files/doc_earnings/2024/q4/earnings-result/WBD-4Q24-Earnings-Release.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">release</a>, Warner Bros. says its gaming division's revenue dropped by 29% in Q4 when compared to the previous year's quarter, which the studio puts down to the "better performance" of big sellers&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-sales-30m" rel="nofollow">Hogwarts Legacy</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortal-kombat-1-sales" rel="nofollow">Mortal Kombat 1</a>&nbsp;</em>last year.</p>

<p>This is likely at least one of the figures that caused Warner Bros. to&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monolith-productions-and-more-reportedly-closed-by-wb-games" rel="nofollow">close three of its studios recently</a>, namely Monolith Productions, Player First Games, and WB San Diego. They're not mentioned in the financial report, but that could just be because the report covers the period ending December 31st last year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warner-bros-financials-2024-monolith.jpg?itok=b5odTwrZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warner-bros-financials-2024-monolith.jpg?itok=rIJTz3Ba 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Warner Bros. recently closed&nbsp;<em>Middle-earth: Shadow of War&nbsp;</em>developer Monolith, as well as two other studios.</figcaption></figure><p>The weak performance of two major Warner Bros. games last year, namely superhero live-service looter-shooter&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-kill-justice-leagues-sales-disappointed-hogwarts-legacy-is-big-win" rel="nofollow">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a>&nbsp;</em>and crossover fighter&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-flop-warner-bros-100m" rel="nofollow"><em>MultiVersus</em></a>, both contributed to WB Games' weak year.</p>

<p>Both games performed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rocksteady-layoffs-end-of-2024" rel="nofollow">so poorly</a> that they were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-updates-ending-season-5-offline" rel="nofollow">shut down</a> before being on general release for a year (although&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus&nbsp;</em>technically spent some time in a sort of beta-Early Access limbo between mid-2022 and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-open-beta-will-close-in-june-full-release-coming-in-early-2024" rel="nofollow">spring 2023</a>).</p>

<p>Back in January, it was revealed that Warner Bros. gaming head David Haddad <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warner-bros-games-david-haddad-stepping-down" rel="nofollow">would step down</a> after over a decade with the company. The reason for his departure wasn't officially announced, but I can't imagine&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus</em>' failures had nothing to do with it.</p>

<p>As for what the future holds for Warner Bros., the company says it's planning to refocus on "proven IP" like&nbsp;<em>Harry Potter</em>,&nbsp;<em>Game of Thrones</em>,&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat</em>, and the wider DC universe, including "top tier characters like&nbsp;<em>Batman</em>".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warner-bros-financials-2024-batman.jpg?itok=64LAPPnr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warner-bros-financials-2024-batman.jpg?itok=wkA8H8fr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Warner Bros. says it wants to refocus its efforts on proven IP like&nbsp;<em>Batman</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>To that end, it was recently revealed that DC Studios boss James Gunn <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dc-boss-in-talks-with-rocksteady-and-netherrealm-to-develop-dc-universe-games" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">has been talking</a> to Warner Bros. studios Rocksteady and NetherRealm to develop DC games, although it's not clear which games those might be.</p>

<p>Given that the closure of Monolith also includes the cancellation of that studio's&nbsp;<em>Wonder Woman&nbsp;</em>game, though, I wouldn't hold your breath for anything but a new game starring Batman or one of his extended family. Stay tuned for more.</p>
