            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fragpunk-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bad Guitar Studio has announced the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S release date for&nbsp;<em>FragPunk</em>, and the console versions of the game are not too far away at all.</p>

<p>As revealed in an official announcement on the&nbsp;<em>FragPunk&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.fragpunk.com/news/official/20250410/40587_1226546.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, the free-to-play 5v5 hero shooter will be coming to current-gen machines on April 29th. Unfortunately, it's not hitting last-gen consoles, nor has a Switch 2 version of the game been announced at time of writing.</p>

<p><em>FragPunk&nbsp;</em>launched on Steam on March 6th as planned, but just a day or so before the game's planned console launch, it was <a href="https://x.com/PlayFragPunk/status/1897074010997035438" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">delayed</a>, with Bad Guitar citing "unexpected technical challenges in optimization and adaptation".</p>

<p>That's slightly confusingly worded, but it sounds as though all console players will be receiving those gifts without having to do anything, which is nice. Additionally, if you bought the Pioneer Bundle on consoles, you'll get "additional gifts".</p>

<p>In case you're wondering,&nbsp;<em>FragPunk&nbsp;</em>will also support crossplay between PC and consoles, and cross-progression will also be supported, so you can take your&nbsp;<em>FragPunk&nbsp;</em>stuff from PC and enjoy it on PS5 or Xbox Series X|S if you like.</p>

<p>Bad Guitar is also promising a "smooth gameplay experience" on consoles, including aim assist for those on controllers, which is designed to "minimize the disparity between controller and keyboard/mouse input".</p>




<p>In case you're wondering what&nbsp;<em>FragPunk&nbsp;</em>is, it's a 5v5 hero shooter with a unique selling point in the form of its Shard Cards, which can be deployed to add effects like buff shots for your teammates, healing, and plenty of other extras.</p>

<p>The game is going up against the likes of Blizzard's&nbsp;<em>Overwatch 2&nbsp;</em>and NetEase's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-40m" rel="nofollow">hugely popular&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em></a>, and it remains to be seen whether it's got the staying power of those games or whether it'll go the way <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/2k-project-ethos-studio-head-fired-report" rel="nofollow">2K's&nbsp;<em>Project Ethos&nbsp;</em>seems to be going</a>.</p>

<p>You can play&nbsp;<em>FragPunk&nbsp;</em>for free right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2943650/FragPunk/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, and it's coming to <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012871" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/fragpunk/9mw715j1p29d" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on April 29th.</p>
