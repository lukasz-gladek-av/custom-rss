            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Deep in an abandoned mine shaft, the still, musty air is filled with the moans of ghosts, clacking of skeletons, and glop-glopping of slime creatures. They’ve been shambling around, unseen, for who knows how long. And quite frankly, it gets boring down there! Do you have what it takes to help them turn eternity into something a little more exciting? That’s the question at the heart of <em>Ghosts Galore</em>, a new board game by Michael Luu! Asmodee USA sent along a copy for me to check out, so ride along for my <em>Ghosts Galore</em> review!</p><h2><strong>What Is </strong><em><strong>Ghosts Galore</strong></em><strong>?</strong></h2><picture>

  </picture><p><em>Ghosts Galore </em>is a tile-laying board game for two to five players, with an estimated run-time of about twenty minutes. In our play testing, some games (between two players) went even faster than that!</p><p>In <em>Ghosts Galore</em>, you’re here to help those ghosts have a less-boring afterlife, by laying down mine cart track tiles filled with gems and various ghosts. Each type of ghost scores differently, and you’ll want to make clever connections on your tracks to rack up points.</p><p>Comprised of two-sided player boards, a stack of track tiles, a score pad, and mine cart tokens, it’s a quick little game that doesn’t take up much shelf space at all.</p><h2><strong>How Do You Play </strong><em><strong>Ghosts Galore</strong></em><strong>?</strong></h2><p>After creating piles of track tiles, you’ll begin each round by drawing a token and either claiming it for your board or sending it to the general supply. Once there’s only one player left who hasn’t claimed a tile, all of the tiles in the stack are revealed and that player has their choice of the leftovers.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>Points are awarded for completing tracks (the entire edge of the board is filled with mine shaft doors), with two special doors granting extra points for connecting them.</p><p>But the real point-scoring shindig happens with all the different ghosts on your board. The term “ghost” is a little fluid here, as you’ll find tiles with floating ghosts, werewolves, dragons, bats, and more. Maybe it should have been called Monsters Galore, but points for the <em>Ghosts Galore</em> alliteration.</p><p>These scoring mechanisms all interact with each other in interesting ways, and scores are tallied at the end of the game on a handy score sheet. The skeletons score based on the number of diamonds on your board, each bat scores 5 points if its tile is adjacent to at least one tile with another bat, and dragons score based on the number of dragons on your board (but you get -5 points if you don’t have any dragons).</p><picture>

  </picture><p>This creates an in-depth, interlocking scoring mechanism that encourages thoughtful tile placement and leads to the game feeling deeper than it should for its short run-time.</p><h2><strong>How Does The Gameplay Feel In </strong><em><strong>Ghosts Galore</strong></em><strong>?</strong></h2><p>One of the things I think is most intriguing about the game is that tile selection mechanic I’ve mentioned above in the How to Play section. You can either snatch up that one key piece you need, or hold out to see if something better comes along. This creates a nice little tension you don’t normally see in a game like this.</p><p>One note I have, however, is that - at least in our initial plays, keeping track of how all of the different ghosts scored was a little overwhelming. It ended up being more of a case of us saying “Ehhh… let’s just try to connect tracks, and then see how we score our ghosts afterwards.”</p><picture>

  </picture><p>This is in no way an overly complicated game, mind you, but for those first few plays discerning the scoring of nine different monsters was daunting - just because of how much referencing back to the rules was needed. I’m happy to report, however, that after two or three plays, we had a good sense of what most ghosts did, and gameplay flowed even quicker.</p><h2><em><strong>Ghosts Galore - </strong></em><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2><p>Gameplay-wise, <em>Ghosts Galore</em> is a fun, think-y little tile laying game that plays fast once you know what you’re looking for on your tile track. As mentioned above, the complexity of placing the perfect ghosts on your board for the kind of scoring you’re going for could leave players with a bit of analysis paralysis, but I’ve found in our playing of the game that it’s more fun to go with the flow.</p><p>Art-wise, the style in <em>Ghosts Galore</em> may not be everyone’s cup of tea, as it leans into a cutesy, almost chibi-like character design for the ghosts. For players looking for something a little more down to earth (even though we <em>are</em> talking about fantastical creatures here), this design might not quite hit what they’re looking for.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>All in all, if you’re looking for a fun, fast game that encourages thoughtful tile-placement without being too in-the-weeds (especially once you understand how all the ghosts score), <em>Ghosts Galore</em> is definitely worth checking out.</p><hr><p><em>The copy of </em>Ghosts Galore<em> used in the creation of this review was provided by Asmodee USA.</em></p></div><div><p><span><div>
