The toy and tabletop company behind <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> and Dungeons &amp; Dragons has announced Playing to Win, a strategy that will focus more on play-fueled franchises and ongoing partnerships.</p>

<h2>The Hasbro Playing to Win Strategy Announcement</h2>

<p>Hasbro's Playing to Win strategy was announced alongside their <a href="https://investor.hasbro.com/static-files/32a267bf-241b-4541-91ab-7745ed17693d" rel="nofollow">Q4 and Full Year 2024 Financial Report</a>. In that report, Hasbro CEO, and AI advocate, Chris Cocks discussed areas of growth, revenue, and decline for the various IPs and studios under Hasbro's umbrella.</p>

Both WOTC and Digital games were up 4% YoY courtesy of <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>, <em>Monopoly Go, </em>and strong ongoing sales of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/baldurs-gate-3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cocks even stated that <em>Magic's</em> ecosystem remains "as healthy and engaged" as it has ever been thanks to strong set sales and Secret Lairs.</p>

<p><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> also showed ongoing growth. The new 2024 <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-player-handbook-review-mixed-messaging-around-strong" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Player's Handbook</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-dungeon-masters-guide-review-true-dms-best-friend" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em></a>, and brand-new <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/2024-monster-manual-review-we-take-look-at-some-of-dds-most-well-known-monsters" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Monster Manual</em></a> have been breaking sales records for the best-selling D&amp;D books ever as well as increased digital revenue through the D&amp;D Beyond marketplace.</p>

<p>Notably, while analog sales of Wizards products were down by 16%, digital sales were up 3% and digital licensing was up 7%. This does align with the rise of online TTRPG play over physical book purchases and WOTC's own investment in their own D&amp;D-focused virtual tabletop, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dd-direct-2024-highlights-future-of-dd-and-showcases-project-sigil" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Sigil</a>.</p>

<p>Within this financial report, Cocks discussed Hasbro's Playing to Win business strategy. Simply put, the plan involves Hasbro investing hard on their play-first franchises and partnerships, increasing play and appeal to older fans, expanding reach to emerging markets, and building more videogames with their IP.</p>

<p>The first part of this strategy is self-evident in Hasbro's toylines. Their toy robot franchise, <em>Transformers</em>, continues to sell to its target demographic of children, bolstered by the recent <em>Transformers One</em> feature film.</p>

In addition to the recent <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/final-fantasy-magic-gathering-crossover-brings-classic-art-and-new-mechanics" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">crossover with <em>Final Fantasy</em></a>, the popular card game will be crossing over with Marvel's Spider-Man in 2025 alongside a third unannounced Universes Beyond set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Expanding their reach to emerging markets are covered with the recently announced <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> movie coming courtesy of Legendary Pictures and a new <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> TV show by Netflix and executive producer Shawn Levy.</p>

<p>Finally, building new videogames based on Hasbro's IP aligns with the announcement that <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/space-marine-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine 2</em></a> developer Saber Interactive is working on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-marine-2-devs-hasbro-tentpole-ip" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">new AAA game</a> based on a Hasbro franchise. Given Space Marine 2's gameplay is full of high-octane action, there's a strong chance this game will align with Hasbro's appeal to older fans.</p>

<p>In short, the Playing to Win strategy seems to be the company leaning more into digital sales, leveraging partnerships with other studios for multimedia projects, and investing in their bestselling franchises.</p>
