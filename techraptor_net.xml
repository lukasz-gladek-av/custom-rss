            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-christopher-barrett-lawsuit-evidence<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has responded to a lawsuit brought against it by ex-Bungie employee Christopher Barrett, whose employment was terminated by the&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2&nbsp;</em>developer last year following allegations of misconduct.</p>

<p>Barrett brought the suit against Sony in December, alleging that the company, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-is-acquiring-destiny-2-developer-bungie" rel="nofollow">is Bungie's parent</a>, engaged in a "sham" investigation in order to support its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marathon-director-fired-report-bungie" rel="nofollow">termination of his contract</a>.</p>

<p>However, as spotted by Stephen Totilo of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/sony-bungie-christopher-barrett-lawsuit-response" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Game File</a>, Sony has now filed a response, and the 128-page document contains evidence that Sony says reveals Barrett's "pattern of misconduct" with regard to his communications with female employees.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/christopher-barrett-destiny-2-sony-lawsuit.jpg?itok=HzhTMBAC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/christopher-barrett-destiny-2-sony-lawsuit.jpg?itok=uuMNcmc8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ex-Bungie employee Christopher Barrett is suing Sony, but Sony has a thing or two to say about that.</figcaption></figure><p>As you can probably imagine, the document is extremely extensive and exhaustive. It contains answers to many of Barrett's claims in his own suit, but most explosively, it includes several exchanges Sony says are evidence of Barrett's attitude towards female employees.</p>

<p>The exchanges include Barrett allegedly telling a female employee she was "hot" and asking her what she thought her best and worst physical features were, as well as telling another employee he would "hit on [her]" if she wasn't being treated well by her boyfriend.</p>

<p>He asked the same employee what "the steps one would have to take" to date her were, asking "what's the strategy guide". To another victim, he said he didn't want her boyfriend to "get the right idea" about the messages he was sending her.</p>

<p>There are several more text exchanges like these, and if they are indeed legitimate, then I think they're pretty damning with regards to Sony's motive for firing Barrett.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/christopher-barrett-sony-lawsuit-halo-3.jpg?itok=l_rlxe0h 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/christopher-barrett-sony-lawsuit-halo-3.jpg?itok=5lJq3S9J 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Christopher Barrett has also worked on Bungie games like&nbsp;<em>Halo 3</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Sony goes on to say that Barrett's "predatory behavior" caused his victims to "seek guidance" from other employees on how to manage his "constant boundary-pushing".</p>

<p>Victims reported to HR that they were "afraid for their jobs during" the encounters with Barrett, but Sony says these employees were "placed...in a vulnerable position" in which they "felt compelled to engage with" Barrett in order to maintain "good standing".</p>

<p>In Barrett's original suit, he says he was a "scapegoat" for Sony and Bungie and that he was "falsely" accused of sexual misconduct, which Sony says is "outrageous considering the evidence". The company says the evidence provided in the document "will demonstrate his termination...was justified".</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see where this lawsuit goes next; none of this represents a definitive conclusion, of course, and Barrett will doubtless have responses prepared for Sony in due course. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassins-creed-shadows-shrine-portrayal-prompts-officials-to-take-action.1114296/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-shrine-controversy<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The portrayal of a real-life religious shrine in&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>has prompted officials at the shrine's real-world counterpart to take "action", according to a new report.</p>

<p>Per Japanese platform <a href="https://www.sankei.com/article/20250220-PF3AE6LOHRA6DGWT3APVNP6GLI/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Sankei News</a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/assassins-creed-shadows-real-life-japanese-shrine-officials-are-taking-action-over-ubisofts-portrayal-of-religious-site/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Automaton Media</a>), officials at the Itate Hyozu Shrine, which is located in the Hyogo Prefecture and which can be visited in&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>' historical representation of Japan, are taking "appropriate action" over the shrine's depiction in the game.</p>

<p>Specifically, the officials appear to be taking umbrage at the fact that it's possible not only to visit the shrine in&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>, but also to destroy parts of said shrine, "including its altar and sacred objects" (as Automaton puts it).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-shrine-portrayal-naoe.jpg?itok=WNKK05DQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-shrine-portrayal-naoe.jpg?itok=1HC68NHq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>has angered officials at a real-life Japanese shrine.</figcaption></figure><p>As Automaton points out, the shrine's destruction isn't part of the game's main quest, and it also hasn't been used for&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>' promotional cycle, but that hasn't stopped some calling the very ability to destroy the shrine disrespectful.</p>

<p>Sankei News reports that shrine officials said they "would have refused" if Ubisoft had contacted them for official approval to include the shrine in the game, but that they were not approached by the studio.</p>

<p>It's not exactly clear what the Itate Hyozu shrine officials mean by "appropriate action"; that phrase is ambiguous, and it could mean anything from legal action through to simply requesting the shrine be removed from the game and anything in between.</p>

<p>In any case, it's far from the first time&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>has gotten into trouble regarding its historical accuracy or reverence for Japan. Back in July, the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-concept-art-apology" rel="nofollow">apologized after including a Japanese re-enactment group's flag</a> in a book of concept art without the group's permission.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-shrine-portrayal-combat.jpg?itok=3sFrmaN0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-shrine-portrayal-combat.jpg?itok=Hj1_taXh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This isn't the first time&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>has found itself at the center of a controversy.</figcaption></figure><p>There's also an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-assassins-creed-shadows-controversy" rel="nofollow">ongoing controversy surrounding protagonist Yasuke</a>, who's depicted in the game as a samurai, a classification that some folks are disputing from a historical perspective (although I rather suspect there's an unpleasant <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-apology-yasuke-racist-trolls" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ulterior motive</a> to that argument in many cases).</p>

<p>Figurine company PureArts also issued an apology in October after pulling an "insensitive" figurine from sale. The figurine in question depicted a one-pillared Torii gate, a symbol that can famously be found at the Nagasaki Sanno shrine, which stands as a memorial to the devastation caused by the atomic bomb.</p>

<p>Ubisoft will be banking on&nbsp;the success of&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>after what has been a rough year for the company. Flops like&nbsp;<em>Skull and Bones&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-february" rel="nofollow"><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></a>, as well as repeated <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-march" rel="nofollow">delays</a> to&nbsp;<em>Shadows&nbsp;</em>itself, mean the game is carrying rather a lot on its back.</p>

<p>If Ubisoft itself is to be believed, however, pre-orders for the game are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-pre-orders-solid-in-line-with-series-second-biggest-launch" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">"solid"</a>, so the company may well have another big hit on its hands come March, when&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>is due to launch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3159330/Assassins_Creed_Shadows/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/assassins-creed-shadows/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/assassins-creed-shadows" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[Pokemon Presents February 2025 Officially Revealed for Next Week]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-presents-february-2025-announced</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pokemon-presents-february-2025-officially-revealed-for-next-week.1114269/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-presents-february-2025-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has officially announced a Pokemon Presents presentation for next week, and as you've probably come to expect by now, it's set to air on Pokemon Day.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://x.com/pokemon/status/1759850669333160265" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the Pokemon X account, the latest Pokemon Presents showcase is set for February 27th at 6am Pacific. That's around 9am Eastern and about 2pm GMT, in case you're wondering.</p>

<p>We don't yet know how long the showcase will be, but previous Pokemon Presents videos have been anywhere from around 10 minutes long to about 25 minutes, so expect something that's somewhere in that time range.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-presents-february-2025-announced-legends-z-a.jpg?itok=7PfFw3mp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-presents-february-2025-announced-legends-z-a.jpg?itok=L2p6k6D_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Could we finally be about to get more&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>info?</figcaption></figure><p>If past form is anything to go by, we can probably expect some updates for currently-running&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games, including the likes of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Masters EX</em>,&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Cafe Remix</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Go&nbsp;</em>(whose developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-go-niantic-saudi-rumor" rel="nofollow">might be about to sell up to Saudi Arabia's PIF</a>).</p>

<p>We can potentially also expect a new announcement or two, so this showcase might give us our first glimpse of the next major generation of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games.</p>

<p>The timing would track; the mainline games have been launching roughly every three years for the past few generations, and&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>launched in 2022, so this year feels like the perfect time to announce whatever the next games will be.</p>

<p>Of course, there's also&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>, which is the Copperajah in the room at this point. We haven't heard much more about the game since <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-a-announced" rel="nofollow">its announcement during last year's Pokemon Presents show</a>, so hopefully, we'll get more info about it next week.</p>




<p>The timing of next week's Pokemon Presents might be slightly inconvenient for Nintendo given that the recently-revealed Switch 2 is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">due to get its own Direct showcase in April</a>.</p>

<p>If Nintendo reveals any&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games coming to Switch 2, it might be jumping the gun on the console's launch lineup announcement (which will presumably come in April), but only covering games coming to the original Switch feels a touch odd in the shadow of the new console as well.</p>

<p>In any case, the next Pokemon Presents is due to air on February 27th at 6am Pacific. You can watch it over on the official&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>YouTube channel.</p>
