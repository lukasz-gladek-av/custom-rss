      <div><p>Steamforged Games recently launched their crowdfunding campaign for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hearts-of-iron-board-game-brings-complex-ww2-grand-strategy-to-tables" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Hearts of Iron</em> board game</a> Gamefound. The tabletop adaptation of Paradox Interactive's beloved military strategy game has completely overtaken its funding goal, reaching it 13 minutes after going live.</p>

<h2>The Hearts of Iron Board Game Gamefound Campaign</h2>

<p>As the <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/projects/steamforged-games/hearts-of-iron-board-game?refcode=v1JUB3G5fUmqA6iMaMS28g#/section/project-story" rel="nofollow">campaign page</a> states, the <em>Hearts of Iron</em> board game allows players to re-enact major events during World War II. Two to five players can take on the role of the Allies or Axis powers. Players must manage resources, make political alliances, and keep their nation stable while maintaining political and military strength.</p>
