  </picture><p>Doug Bowser <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-of-america-doug-bowser-retiring" rel="nofollow">officially retired</a> from his position as President and COO of Nintendo of America on December 31, 2025, replaced by marketing executive VP Devon Pritchard.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to having a delightful connection to the fire-breathing koopa king from S<em>uper Mario</em>, Bowser has overseen several of the gaming giant's recent successes since his time as president starting in 2019. The biggest one by far is the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2, which has currently sold over 10 million units.</p><blockquote><p>"We are delighted to have Doug and Carla join our seasoned and dynamic Board of Directors," said Rich Stoddart, Chair of Hasbro's Board of Directors. "Doug and Carla bring extensive leadership experience across consumer brands and franchise management. Their expertise and guidance will be invaluable as Hasbro continues to execute its long-term innovation and growth strategy."</p></blockquote><p>Doug Bowser's addition to the board adds invaluable insight to Hasbro. The company is a staple of both toys and tabletop entertainment. The company produces enduring toy lines like <em>Transformers</em> and <em>My Little Pony</em>, and iconic franchises like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>.</p><p>It is also telling that both Magic and D&amp;D have only continued to grow in popularity. The iconic card game has been expanding thanks to recent crossover sets with Final Fantasy and Spider-Man. Whereas D&amp;D has gone mainstream thanks to Netflix's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dd-stranger-things-welcome-to-hellfire-club-review-starter-set-to-remember-eddie" rel="nofollow"><em>Stranger Things</em></a> and Larian Studio's critical masterpiece, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/baldurs-gate-3-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a>.</p><p>Given Bowser's work guiding and managing household names like Mario, Pokemon and Zelda, his skillset will come in handy for Hasbro's future.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
