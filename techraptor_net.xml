            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/morsels-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's been quite a while since I've played a roguelite where things just click immediately.&nbsp;<em>Morsels</em>&nbsp;is quick, intuitive, and delightful to play, which is a breath of fresh air in a genre that's become a bit too saturated for my liking.&nbsp;<em>Morsels</em>&nbsp;might just become my new addiction.</p>

<p>We played the upcoming roguelite&nbsp;<em>Morsels</em>&nbsp;at Summer Game Fest 2025. Developed by Furcula and published by Annapurna Interactive, this crunchy, grimy game has incredible potential to be the next big roguelite.</p>



<h2>Gotta Collect 'Em All --&nbsp;<em>Morsels</em>!</h2>

<p><em>Morsels</em>&nbsp;harnesses the simplicity of&nbsp;<em>Nuclear Throne</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="78d18a36-8b0c-42c8-989d-e750814ff1f1" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/enter-gungeon-review-dawn-of-gundead" rel="nofollow">Enter the Gungeon</a>&nbsp;</em>to create a palatable, easily understood gameplay loop that'll have you vying for more. The cornerstone to&nbsp;<em>Morsels</em>' gameplay are the eponymous Morsels, these "mystical cards sent from another galaxy."</p>

<p>To put it succinctly, think of Morsels as&nbsp;<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="08100bb4-1bd2-48c8-b59b-deb62c955038" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/how-to-understand-pokemon-card-rarity" rel="nofollow"><em>Pokemon</em>&nbsp;cards</a>. The player character, a little mouse, uses these cards to escape a sewer full of cats and other dangerous monsters. The cards are actually the characters you control here, and you're given a choice to pick one right from the start.</p>

<p>That's your starter Morsel, and from there, you can accumulate experience by defeating foes. Eventually, these Morsels evolve and become more powerful versions of themselves. This is a great way to incentivize players to engage with enemies and fight them, rather than avoid encounters and rush to the end of the level.</p>



<p>You're able to gain other upgrades by finding them naturally as you navigate the sewers, so you have that very basic increase in power that roguelite players are familiar with. Eventually, you'll find more Morsels too, so your roster grows as you progress.</p>

<p>There are slots for three Morsels total, and you can swap those on the fly. If you're running low on health with one, switch to another until you can find health to health the other. It's an intuitive system that means every Morsel has a chance to shine on the battlefield.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Ticket to Winning It</h2>

<p>The way in which Morsels attack are a bit unorthodox, too. Most in the demo attack via directional inputs on the face buttons of a controller. The control scheme feels a little weird at first, but I took to it quickly. Morsels also have a special ability and dodge. Of course, Morsels are visually distinct from one another and it so are all of their attacks.</p>

<p><em>Morsels</em>&nbsp;throws a few challenges in to spice up the run and reward players. For instance, I find a ticket on one level of the sewers and need to bring it to the bus on the next. I didn't find out what giving the bus a ticket would do, but the developer watching me assured me it would be worthwhile.</p>



<p>The thing is, you can't attack while holding the ticket, so bringing it all the way to the end of a level past obstacles and enemies is no easy task. There are a few holes you might find in walls you can go into, and these start little minigames that also give players rewards to benefit you during the run.</p>

<p>I'm certain there's more depth to&nbsp;<em>Morsels</em>&nbsp;than what meets the eye; most definitely, we'll be able to play as more Morsels cards in the final product and devise a playstyle based on my preferred cards. I'm sure difficulty will only increase as time goes on, too.</p>



<h2><em>Morsels&nbsp;</em>Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Really, I'm just enamored with the simplicity and quality&nbsp;of&nbsp;<em>Morsels</em>. Outside of its super tight gameplay, the visuals ooze with personality. The filthiness of the sewers with the crunchy, heavy CRT filter on the pixel visuals have me hungry for more.</p>

<p>At the time of publication, a demo for&nbsp;<em>Morsels</em>&nbsp;is available to the public, so do check it out if this sounds like your kind of thing. I'll be eagerly anticipated this one ahead of its launch sometime later this year.&nbsp;</p>
