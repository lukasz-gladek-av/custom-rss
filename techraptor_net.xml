            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloodborne-60fps-patch-dmca<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has issued a DMCA takedown against a fan-made patch that allowed 2015 action RPG&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>to run at 60FPS, sparking fresh speculation that a remaster of the game could be in the works.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/manfightdragon.bsky.social/post/3lh2cipa4rk2v" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">modder Lance McDonald</a>, who's also one of the most prominent members of the&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>community, Sony asked him to "remove links to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloodborne-60fps-patch-dropping-this-month" rel="nofollow">the patch</a> [he] posted on the internet" via DMCA notice, which means it's no longer available for download.</p>

<p>In the replies, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/powerful.crabf.art/post/3lh2eegkh4c2x" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">users</a> are <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/turbohotdog.bsky.social/post/3lh2eg7nc3s2e" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">speculating</a> that Sony's sudden flurry of activity aimed at the patch could mean that the company is working on its own version of&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>that runs at 60FPS.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bloodborne-60fps-patch-dmca-old-hunters.jpg?itok=Q6hcoT7F 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bloodborne-60fps-patch-dmca-old-hunters.jpg?itok=n1bloLO- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sony has DMCA'd a 60FPS&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>patch, but does that mean anything?</figcaption></figure><p>There is precedent for this standpoint. Back in 2022, Konami <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-leak-dmcad-by-konami" rel="nofollow">issued a DMCA notice</a> against a leak for a then-upcoming&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>game, and that game subsequently turned out to be&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill: The Short Message</em>, so that DMCA was issued in order for Konami to get ahead of the leaks.</p>

<p>Of course, the obvious (and unfortunate) fallacy in the argument is that companies don't always issue DMCA takedowns because they're planning on creating something similar to what's been taken down.</p>

<p>Studios like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-2-dmcas-gta-mods-save-file" rel="nofollow">Take-Two</a> are extremely <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-issues-another-wave-of-dmcas-for-gta-mods" rel="nofollow">au fait</a> with DMCA takedown notices, and often, those takedowns are issued simply because the company is protective of its IP and doesn't want anyone else coming within sniffing distance of making money from that IP.</p>

<p>It's entirely possible that Sony has only just become aware of the&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>60FPS patch and that it has no intention of doing anything with the IP; it just doesn't want anyone else doing anything with it either.</p>




<p>It's a shame if the DMCA is purely for IP protection reasons, because&nbsp;a&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>remaster is frequently requested by fans thanks to the game's popularity (as well as its relatively shoddy performance in its current state).</p>

<p>Sony <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-state-of-play-february-2023-here-are-all-news-announcements" rel="nofollow">has been known</a> to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-state-of-play-january-2024-recap-heck-out-all-news-trailers-and-reveals" rel="nofollow">hold State of Play presentations</a> around this time of year, though, so with all that said, it is possible we could be about to learn that a&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>remaster is indeed in the works.</p>

<p>For now, you'll have to content yourself with <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/bloodborne/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">picking up the original on PS4</a>. It's also playable on PS5 via backwards compatibility, of course.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/spider-man-2-pc-port-bad-reviews<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Marvel's Spider-Man 2&nbsp;</em>has officially hit PC, and fans are flocking to Steam to express their dissatisfaction with what they see as an unsatisfactory port, citing extensive technical issues.</p>

<p>The game landed on Steam yesterday, and a quick look at its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2651280/Marvels_SpiderMan_2/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reviews on the platform</a> shows a Mixed rating across almost 2,000 reviews (at time of writing), which isn't a great look for a first-party Sony game that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-sales-pass-548-milion-units-marvels-spider-man-2-has-sold-10-million-copies" rel="nofollow">sold gangbusters</a> on PlayStation and serves as one of the company's flagship titles.</p>

<p>Common themes have emerged across the negative reviews, too. One user <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198047951793/recommended/2651280/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">says</a> that calling the port "rough" would be "an understatement", pointing to improperly-loaded features like lighting, extra-slow framerates, and regular freezes and stutters, which <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/RootyBlues/recommended/2651280/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">other users</a> have also <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199237301221/recommended/2651280/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">complained about</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvels-spider-man-2-pc-port-negative-reviews-city.jpg?itok=342RL_r5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvels-spider-man-2-pc-port-negative-reviews-city.jpg?itok=qq17ncnN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Marvel's Spider-Man 2&nbsp;</em>is picking up some bad reviews on PC.</figcaption></figure><p>For what it's worth, some reviewers are <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198276342581/recommended/2651280/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">saying</a> that they've been able to get the game running with relatively <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/GeneralKamo/recommended/2651280/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">few problems</a>, so it seems the crashes and bugs aren't affecting all players equally.</p>

<p>Still, though, enough players are complaining about technical issues with&nbsp;<em>Spider-Man 2</em>'s PC port that I'd imagine Sony will issue an emergency patch in the next few days to address some of the more common problems.</p>

<p>The timing of this issue is particularly unfortunate for Sony. Just a couple of days ago, the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-psn-account-requirement-incentives" rel="nofollow">walked back its PSN requirement</a> for certain PC single-player games, including&nbsp;<em>Spider-Man 2</em>, promising incentives for those games if you linked a PSN account.</p>

<p>It's a move that's bound to garner goodwill from the PC gaming community given just how <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-pc-playstation-backtrack" rel="nofollow">unpopular mandatory PSN accounts are</a> with those folks, but low-quality PC ports like this one apparently is will probably do a lot to erase that goodwill.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[MultiVersus Updates Will End After Season 5, Offline Mode Being Added]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-updates-ending-season-5-offline</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/multiversus-updates-will-end-after-season-5-offline-mode-being-added.1096983/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-updates-ending-season-5-offline<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Player First Games and Warner Bros. have announced that their crossover platform fighter&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus&nbsp;</em>won't be getting any more updates after its next season, and that an offline mode will be added as well.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://multiversus.com/en/news/multiversus-update" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the game's official website, Season 5 of&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus</em>, which begins on February 4th and runs until May 30th, will be the game's last. Following that, the two studios have <a href="https://x.com/multiversus/status/1885327981758865568" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">promised</a> that you'll be able to enjoy the game offline "for the foreseeable future".</p>

<p>Two new playable characters, Aquaman and Lola Bunny, will be added to&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus</em>' roster as part of Season 5, and Player First says you'll be able to obtain both characters "through gameplay", with Aquaman coming as part of the battle pass' first tear and Lola Bunny being offered as the game's daily login reward.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/multiversus-updates-ending-season-5-fight.jpg?itok=suYIAw3w 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/multiversus-updates-ending-season-5-fight.jpg?itok=4BXqARRH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Warner Bros.' platform fighter&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus&nbsp;</em>won't be getting any more updates after May.</figcaption></figure><p>As of today, you also can't buy anything in&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus&nbsp;</em>with real money, but you can still use any of the premium currency you've accumulated until the end of Season 5.</p>

<p>If you haven't played&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus&nbsp;</em>before, you won't be able to download it after Season 5, although you'll still be able to reinstall the game if you've played it and deleted it. Make sure that you check this one out before May 30th if you've got any interest in it whatsoever.</p>

<p>In an accompanying <a href="https://multiversus.com/en-gb/faq" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">FAQ</a>,&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus&nbsp;</em>developer Player First somewhat bafflingly dodges its own question regarding why the game's updates are ending, but a quick look at its Steam <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1818750/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">numbers</a> suggests that it's probably unsustainable to continue development with such a low player count.</p>

<p>This is a situation that will probably feel hauntingly familiar if you've been keeping up with Warner Bros.' other high-profile flop <i>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</i>. Just like&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus</em>, that game's updates <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-seasons-ending-in-january-offline-mode" rel="nofollow">also ended following its last season</a>, and an offline mode was added in that case as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warner-bros-suicide-squad-updates-ending-multiversus.jpg?itok=p4lbnaTi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warner-bros-suicide-squad-updates-ending-multiversus.jpg?itok=QV-dIR3m 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Warner Bros.' game&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&nbsp;</em>suffered a similar fate to&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Both&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad&nbsp;</em>were major failures for Warner Bros., with the former <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-flop-warner-bros-100m" rel="nofollow">costing the company $100 million</a> and the latter's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-kill-justice-leagues-sales-disappointed-hogwarts-legacy-is-big-win" rel="nofollow">disappointing sales</a> contributing to a $200 million writedown.</p>

<p>Warner Bros. Games also recently announced that its boss David Haddad, who's been with the company for over a decade, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warner-bros-games-david-haddad-stepping-down" rel="nofollow">will step down</a>. The aforementioned games' failures weren't given as a reason (and Haddad did also oversee a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-sales-30m" rel="nofollow">major success in&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-sales-30m" rel="nofollow">Hogwarts Legacy</a>&nbsp;</em>recently), but they certainly won't have helped his case.</p>

<p>You can still download&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus&nbsp;</em>on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1818750/MultiVersus/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/multiversus/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/multiversus/9ndkxxbl90gf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, so make sure to do so before May 30th if you want to play it offline in future.</p>
