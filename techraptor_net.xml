            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hello-neighbor-3-revealed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>tinyBuild has officially announced&nbsp;<em>Hello Neighbor 3</em>, a third mainline entry in the cult classic horror series, and what's more, it boasts the involvement of the franchise's original creator.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Hello Neighbor 3</em>&nbsp;is officially in development, and franchise creator Nikita Kolesnikov is heading up "a small team of developers" to help bring to life what tinyBuild calls a game full of "systems-based exploration".</p>

<p>You'll explore the town of Raven Brooks as an outsider, enjoying a "cozy yet eerie adventure" as you get to know the locals and their "distinct personalities, circumstances, and desires". It sort of sounds like the original&nbsp;<em>Hello Neighbor&nbsp;</em>meets&nbsp;<em>Pathologic</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hello-neighbor-3-announced-yard.jpg?itok=ipNR9EN1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hello-neighbor-3-announced-yard.jpg?itok=gXxd6hRw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hello Neighbor 3</em>'s development process apparently closely mirrors that of the first game.</figcaption></figure><p>The publisher promises that you'll be able to "stick to the shadows in a full simulation" in which you can make decisions, and making said decisions can "potentially unleash catastrophic consequences" upon the inhabitants of Raven Brooks.</p>

<p>In the screenshots tinyBuild has released so far, the art style of&nbsp;<em>Hello Neighbor&nbsp;</em>looks like something of a departure from its predecessors, utilizing moodier and more muddy colors, although it's still got the strange, spindly art style you know (and potentially love).</p>

<p>Kolesnikov says he's hoping that early alphas of&nbsp;<em>Hello Neighbor 3&nbsp;</em>will be available to try out soon, and that he's excited to "keep the development of&nbsp;<em>Hello Neighbor 3&nbsp;</em>in an open format", so presumably, we'll be hearing more about how the project is coming along soon.</p>

<p>After the first game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hello-neighbor-delayed-to-december-8" rel="nofollow">fully released in late 2017</a>, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hello-neighbor-card-game-lets-you-betray-your-friends" rel="nofollow">number</a> of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hello-engineer-releases-first-on-stadia" rel="nofollow">spinoffs</a> ensued, as well as a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hello-neighbor-2-announced" rel="nofollow">full-blooded sequel</a> in the form of&nbsp;<em>Hello Neighbor 2&nbsp;</em>(which began life in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tinybuild-announces-hello-neighbor-spinoff-hello-guest-and-not-e3-event" rel="nofollow">pre-alpha form as&nbsp;<em>Hello Guest</em></a>).</p>

<p><em>Hello Neighbor 3&nbsp;</em>will be released for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2789680/Hello_Neighbor_3/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, although we don't have a release date for it yet, nor do we know whether it's coming to consoles as well.
