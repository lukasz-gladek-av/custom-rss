            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/smite-2-beta-preview-new-gods-new-modes-same-moba<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s been a minute since we last caught up with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/smite-2-preview-next-generation-of-moba" rel="nofollow"><em>Smite 2</em></a>. Announced a year ago, the MOBA sequel has seen its alpha test take flight during 2024 and is now nearing a beta period along with a wealth of new information. We had the chance to sit in on a presentation with all the details on what’s to come during Smite 2’s beta, including the scoop on a massive update.</p>

<p><em>Smite 2</em> is being primed to add five new gods as one of the biggest pieces of this update – including Aladdin, Geb, Ullr, Agni, and Mulan, along with three new modes including Joust, Duel, and Assault (which were popular modes in the original <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/smite-celebrates-hitting-20-million-players-milestone" rel="nofollow"><em>Smite</em></a>). The team at Titan Forge will also be overhauling the core of Conquest mode, and adding 20 new aspects, which are game-changing play style twists for 20 gods.</p>

<p>There will also be several new items, performance optimizations, text chat, and more.</p>

<p>As mentioned before, <em>Smite 2</em>’s alpha test began eight months ago with only 14 gods available, with one mode, rough performance, and many systems lacking in depth. Since then, the development team has worked together with the community to improve the game by adding 45 gods, six modes, which lead to increased reviews and additional player feedback.</p>


<h2>How <em>Smite 2</em> Evolves The Original's Formula</h2>

<p>For those who aren’t familiar with <em>Smite 2</em>, the core starting goals shared by the team include capturing the magic of the original <em>Smite</em> and its third-person MOBA formula. They also include making targeted improvements to refine a decade-old game for a new generation of gamers, and to respect and honor the community in the process.</p>

<p>In honoring the community, that meant having to over-deliver following the alpha testing weekends. What that means is that fixes were being shipped frequently to keep progress flowing, and focusing on favorite gods to add into <em>Smite 2</em>.</p>

<p>This also included three weekly live streams dedicated to covering player questions and providing a look behind the scenes.</p>

<p>This has culminated in several milestones for <em>Smite 2</em>. The game has 45 gods, increased from the original 14, six modes instead of one, a complete art overhaul, core combat improvements and FX readability improvements, a new HUD, a new conquest map layout, big changes to monetization, collaborations such as Lord of the Rings, and much more.</p>

<p>As <em>Smite 2</em> moves into its beta phase, there’s a lot to cover in terms of what is next. One of the biggest additions will be with the new god, Aladdin, who will arrive on January 14 as part of the new pantheon Tales of Arabia.</p>

<p>Aladdin, The Sultan, is a Magical Assassin who can use the ability Three Wishes – each with powerful effects but can only be used once for came. These include coming back to life instantly, earn bonus Gold, or resetting all cooldowns. Aladdin can also run on walls, which is a new piece of tech for Smite 2. His Ultimate can trap enemies in his magic lamp to fight them, and anyone can join, which allows Aladdin to split up a fight in his own unique way.</p>

For example, Ullr’s stance swapping is further enhanced, while Mulan can plant a Consumable banner that increases XP and grants allies Movement Speed.</p>

<p>New modes will be available including Joust, which is a 3v3 match including one lane and jungle camps. Teleporters have been added for easier traversal, and stealth grass for surprise engagements. The same map is available for the new 1v1 Duel mode.</p>

<p>The Conquest mode is also being updated, which is the premiere mode for <em>Smite</em>’s esports scene. There’s some layout changes (different pathing), new jungle camps, new vision-focused camps, new jungle boss pickups like the Obsidian Dagger (which deals 500 true damage to the user but grants 20% more damage and attack speed for six seconds) from the Fire Giant, and breakables like Healing Wisps in the jungle.</p>

<p>The Aspects mode will offer a new playable twist for gods in <em>Smite 2</em>. In the lobby, players will be able to play the god normally or Aspect enabled. With 20 of the 45 available gods enabled, more will be added over time. An example of this mode is with Athena, who can no longer teleport to allies, but instead to enemies and weaken them. So those types of trade-offs are in play.</p>

There’s also updates to auto builds, role guides for all roles, role filters in the item shop, UI features like PC text chat, balance passes to improve STR and Active items, ranked reset and matchmaking improvements, as well as performance optimizations and more.</p>

<p>As for when players will be able to get their hands on <em>Smite 2</em>’s beta – starting January 7 most of the content described in this article (aside from Aladdin on January 14) will be available, alongside a developer live stream, which will also discuss everything further detail and how 2025 will certainly be a major year for the game and its evolving community.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rocksteady-layoffs-end-of-2024</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/suicide-squad-studio-rocksteady-reportedly-hit-by-more-layoffs.1076295/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rocksteady-layoffs-end-of-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Batman: Arkham&nbsp;</em>developer Rocksteady Studios was apparently hit by yet more layoffs at the close of last year, according to a new report.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-developer-rocksteady-hit-by-end-of-year-layoffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>, which cites "half a dozen staff impacted by the redundancies", several Rocksteady staff lost their jobs at the end of 2024, although the report doesn't state exactly how many employees were let go.</p>

<p>According to the report, Rocksteady's "programming and artist teams" were affected by the layoffs, and yet more QA staff also lost their jobs after a round of layoffs <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rocksteady-layoffs-suicide-squad" rel="nofollow">hit that very same department back in September</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rocksteady-layoffs-2024-harley-quinn.jpg?itok=izD__q8B 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rocksteady-layoffs-2024-harley-quinn.jpg?itok=T-w-2p5E 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&nbsp;</em>developer Rocksteady has been hit by yet more layoffs.</figcaption></figure><p>Eurogamer says it contacted Warner Bros. for a response but didn't receive one, which probably shouldn't come as a surprise; neither this round of layoffs nor the previous round in September were officially announced by the company.</p>

<p>Sadly, these layoffs also probably shouldn't be a shock, sad as they are. Back in December, Rocksteady <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-seasons-ending-in-january-offline-mode" rel="nofollow">announced that it would end content updates</a> for&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em>&nbsp;following the game's fourth season and that it would implement the offline mode it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-kill-justice-league-offline" rel="nofollow">promised in December 2023</a>.</p>

<p>That news came after Warner Bros. declared&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-kill-justice-leagues-sales-disappointed-hogwarts-legacy-is-big-win" rel="nofollow">to be a financial disappointment</a> in February last year, with the game representing an embarrassing $200 million loss for the company's gaming division. There's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-sales-30m" rel="nofollow">only so much&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>can do</a> to offset a loss like that.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-directors-cut-report" rel="nofollow">a report in June</a>, Rocksteady employees are helping to develop a Director's Cut version of that very same wizarding RPG, although no such project has been officially announced by Warner Bros (are you sensing a theme emerging here?).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hogwarts-legacy-rocksteady-wand.jpg?itok=aJMqi2vz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hogwarts-legacy-rocksteady-wand.jpg?itok=a_uyAz-j 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Rocksteady is reportedly working on a Director's Cut for&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>That same report also claimed that Rocksteady is preparing to pitch a single-player game that would be closer to its&nbsp;<em>Batman: Arkham&nbsp;</em>roots than the live-service experiment of&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em>.</p>

<p>It isn't clear whether these recent layoffs will affect the studio's ability to successfully make that pitch, but I can't imagine it's easy being at Rocksteady right now. Stay tuned for more on this.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-annapurna-staff-private-division-ips</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ex-annapurna-staff-reportedly-form-new-company-to-inherit-private-division-ips.1076256/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-annapurna-staff-private-division-ips<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report claims that an as-yet unnamed company comprising former Annapurna Interactive employees is set to take over publishing duties for franchises that would have been overseen by ex-Take-Two indie label Private Division.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-07/ex-annapurna-video-game-staff-to-absorb-former-take-two-label-private-division" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a> by Bloomberg's Jason Schreier, ex-Annapurna Interactive staffers have formed a new company following their <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/annapurna-interactive-staff-resign-after-company-spin-off-talks-fail" rel="nofollow">abrupt resignation in September</a>, which resulted from the failure of talks to spin the division off into its own entity.</p>

<p>The new company will, according to Schreier, "inherit the games and franchises of Private Division", which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-private-division-sale" rel="nofollow">sold off by former parent company Take-Two in November</a> to an unknown buyer. The report, citing "people familiar with the deal", names that buyer as the Texas-based Haveli Investments.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-the-shire-private-division-annapurna.jpg?itok=erjunmst 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tales-of-the-shire-private-division-annapurna.jpg?itok=Je0mFceJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Private Division's games and franchises include the likes of&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Supposedly, Haveli will fund the new company and "place them in charge of distributing the former Private Division titles", which will include the likes of cozy hobbit life sim&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/intercept-games-shut-down-kerbal-space-program-2" rel="nofollow">beleaguered</a> space sandbox&nbsp;<em>Kerbal Space Program</em>.</p>

<p>According to Schreier, "an unannounced title" by&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>developer Game Freak will also be included in the deal. That game is almost certainly the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/private-division-pokemon-developer-game-freak-reveal-new-action-adventure-ip-project" rel="nofollow">previously-revealed&nbsp;<em>Project Bloom</em></a>, which doesn't have an official name yet, so hopefully we'll get to see a new reveal for it soon.</p>

<p>Schreier's report says that some of Private Division's 20 employees "will be laid off as part of the new arrangement", although we don't yet know which employees or in what departments those layoffs will be focused.</p>

<p>The writing was arguably on the wall for Private Division as early as April last year, when Take-Two <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-interactive-layoffs" rel="nofollow">laid off 5% of its workforce</a> and scrapped a number of projects. Following that, Private Division and Bloober Team <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloober-team-private-division-end-partnership" rel="nofollow">ended</a> a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloober-teams-up-with-private-division-for-new-horror-game" rel="nofollow">previously-announced partnership</a> for a new horror IP in May.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kerbal-space-program-annapurna-private-division.jpg?itok=Kq0gJ_-b 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kerbal-space-program-annapurna-private-division.jpg?itok=TR-Hiz2F 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Kerbal Space Program&nbsp;</em>IP is now with the unnamed ex-Annapurna-staffed company.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that the new company hasn't officially been announced yet, so we don't know what it'll be called or what its plans are for the IPs now apparently under its stewardship. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-generative-ai-characters-pubg-inzoi</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/krafton-burning-money-to-add-generative-ai-players-to-pubg-inzoi-and-more.1076157/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-generative-ai-characters-pubg-inzoi<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Krafton has announced a partnership with Nvidia to introduce new companions called "Co-Playable Characters" to Krafton's games, and yes, they're powered by generative AI, because of course they are.</p>

<p>In a press release, the two companies say that Co-Playable Characters, or CPCs, are "powered by on-device Small Language Models" and that they have the potential to "interact with players in deeper ways than traditional NPCs".</p>

<p>This is because CPCs are apparently "equipped with the ability to understand and cooperate with users"; according to Krafton and Nvidia, CPCs will "understand and respond to game situations in a human-like manner", although given what I've seen of the&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>player base, I'm not sure I want that.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pubg-krafton-ai-characters-door.jpg?itok=kLSKyQC2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pubg-krafton-ai-characters-door.jpg?itok=_B5Ll4Eq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Krafton will soon introduce AI-powered companions to&nbsp;<em>PUBG</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>It's not just&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>itself that's getting these AI-powered characters, either. According to the press release, Krafton intends to introduce CPCs "across its gaming portfolio", so you can expect to see these characters in&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>spinoffs too, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/inzoi-release-date-delayed" rel="nofollow">upcoming life sim&nbsp;<em>inZoi</em></a>.</p>

<p>Only&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>inZoi&nbsp;</em>are mentioned, so we don't know if Krafton is also planning to introduce CPCs to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hi-fi-rush-2-krafton-ceo" rel="nofollow">the likes of&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush 2</em></a>&nbsp;or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/subnautica-2-early-access-2025-co-op" rel="nofollow"><em>Subnautica 2</em></a>, but I can't possibly imagine how having an AI inanely yammering away to me while I'm rhythmically smashing goons to pieces could help.</p>

<p>Krafton CEO Changhan Kim says that Nvidia's AI technology, which will power CPCs, is "poised to redefine the future of gaming", while Nvidia developer relations VP Keita Iida says Krafton's CPCs will bring "new, unique experiences" to games. Hmm.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/krafton-ai-characters-inzoi.jpg?itok=CB6fpefb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/krafton-ai-characters-inzoi.jpg?itok=pCzDb0ww 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Krafton's life sim&nbsp;<em>inZoi&nbsp;</em>will also include AI-powered "Co-Playable Characters".</figcaption></figure><p>Krafton might be wholeheartedly embracing AI - and it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-working-hard-on-using-ai-to-make-npc-and-worlds-more-alive-reactive-and" rel="nofollow">far from the only company</a> in gaming <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-hopes-to-use-generative-ai-to-drive-more-monetization-and-make-development-30-more" rel="nofollow">to be doing so</a> - but the technology isn't impressing everyone.</p>

<p>Last month, for instance,&nbsp;<em>BioShock&nbsp;</em>creator Ken Levine <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioshock-creator-ken-levine-generative-ai" rel="nofollow">said he wasn't "overly impressed"</a> by generative AI, suggesting that while it could certainly perform mundane tasks related to coding and other technical aspects of game development, it wasn't suitable to be used for creative purposes.</p>

<p>Similarly, gaming giant Nintendo declared last year that it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-generative-ai-no-plans" rel="nofollow">currently has no plans</a> to use generative AI to develop its games, citing issues with intellectual property rights infringement as well as a desire to deliver "value that is unique to [Nintendo]".</p>
