            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Team Ninja and Xbox have announced the PS5 release date for&nbsp;<em>Senua's Saga: Hellblade II</em>, as well as the new enhancements current owners on Xbox and PC can expect.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/06/25/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-enhanced-update/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Xbox Wire, the followup to 2017's&nbsp;<em>Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice&nbsp;</em>will <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-ps5" rel="nofollow">arrive on PS5</a> on August 12th. This won't be the first time the franchise has appeared on PlayStation, of course;&nbsp;<em>Senua's Sacrifice&nbsp;</em>got itself a PS4 release, after all.</p>

<p>Still, the game's release on PS5 marks an increasingly friendly approach to PlayStation on Xbox's part. Many of the studio's games are making their way to PlayStation now, including upcoming titles like&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gears-of-war-reloaded-announced" rel="nofollow"><em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em></a>.</p>

<p>Those include a new Performance Mode, which will allow you to play at 60fps on PS5 and Xbox Series X (but not S, unfortunately). The PC version will also include a new Very High graphics preset, allowing you to push more powerful rigs to their limit.</p>

<p>Additionally, Xbox and Team Ninja say that when the enhanced version of&nbsp;<em>Senua's Saga&nbsp;</em>launches, it'll be Steam Deck Verified, so you'll be able to enjoy it on your handheld PC as well.</p>

<p>A new Dark Rot mode, which makes its return from the first game, will also be added to the sequel. Every time you fail, the Dark Rot will advance, and when it reaches Senua's head, you'll fail your run and all of your progress will be lost.</p>




<p>If you pick up the Deluxe Edition of&nbsp;<em>Hellblade II</em>&nbsp;on PS5, you'll also get a version of&nbsp;<em>Senua's Sacrifice&nbsp;</em>enhanced for the PS5, so if you haven't played that game yet, now's your chance.</p>

<p><em>Senua's Saga: Hellblade II&nbsp;</em>is, believe it or not, the sequel to 2017's&nbsp;<em>Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice</em>. It once again follows Senua, who's on a quest to rescue her countrymen from the Northmen.</p>

<p>You can pick the game up right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2461850/Senuas_Saga_Hellblade_II/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/senuas-saga-hellblade-II" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and it's coming to <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012536" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a> on August 12th.</p>
