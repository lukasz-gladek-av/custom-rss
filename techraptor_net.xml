            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse must be intent on dominating all of my free time, what with my crippling <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/zenless-zone-zero" rel="nofollow"><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em></a> addiction having no end in sight. Add one more game of theirs into my daily schedule with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hoyoverse-petit-planet-cozy-life-sim" rel="nofollow"><em>Petit Planet</em></a>, a life simulator in the style of&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing</em>. If you know anything about me, it's that I have a&nbsp;<em>long</em>&nbsp;history with&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons" rel="nofollow"><em>Animal Crossing</em></a>, so you&nbsp;know&nbsp;I had to check this one out.</p>

<p>Indeed,&nbsp;while it&nbsp;shares many similarities with Nintendo's&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow"><em>Animal Crossing</em></a>, I soon discovered that&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet</em>, via its Closed Beta, has its own unique DNA to help stand out among its competitors. With a beautiful, celestial, space-themed aesthetic and HoYoverse's consistent live service model, I think we might have a hit on our hands.</p>

<p>As a HoYoverse game,&nbsp;it's fair to have some expectations when it comes to&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet:&nbsp;</em>Namely, gacha as an element. While I can't say for certain whether gacha comes into play later or not (this was a Closed Beta, non-monetized), it doesn't seem to follow the same formula as the company's flagships, such as&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/what-is-genshin-impact" rel="nofollow">Genshin Impact</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/honkai-star-rail" rel="nofollow">Honkai: Star Rail</a>.</em></p>

<p>Instead,&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet&nbsp;</em>is a more relaxed, straightforward experience focusing on chill gameplay. I love me a good story, but sometimes I'm not in the mood to get engrossed in&nbsp;a deep narrative.&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet</em>&nbsp;is succinct and to the point, without sacrificing its identity or charm.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bugs-petit-planet.jpg?itok=Tf10KLOi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bugs-petit-planet.jpg?itok=oYk-WfPa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Dripped out and ready to catch some bugs!</figcaption></figure><p>But first, we make our character. The character creator is limited for now, but I imagine more options will be available in the 1.0 launch; alternatively, you're able to unlock more stuff like hairstyles and such later on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Shortly thereafter, we're introduced to a group of helpful individuals who will serve as your guides for the time being. Mobai is a tea-loving dog that helps us get our first town up and running, along with a rabbit named Esassani and Glenn. Their personalities are individualized and quirky in a way that you'd expect from HoYoverse games, but they're all very likable.</p>

<p>It's time to move on to our first planet<em>,&nbsp;</em>which serves as the basis for our nice little community we'll eventually make. We get a choice of two planets to start, and I was pleased to find that biomes can actually differ. Like&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing</em>, no two planets should be the same, even if they share similar characteristics.</p>

<p>I went for a straightforward, grassy terrain for my planet with some hills and nice open areas. After a gorgeous cutscene involving an RV trip through space, traversing across fire and ice planets, and some water-based ones too, we arrive. Later on, too, I believe we'll be able to explore new galaxies such as this.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/petit-planet-terrain.jpg?itok=hrLjBQol 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/petit-planet-terrain.jpg?itok=PjcSqltf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Terrain ripe and ready for you to make your own!</figcaption></figure><p>It's essentially a blank slate once we land, as Mobai assigns tasks. We're given a bunch of different tools to use and test out as we go through this sort of tutorial, chopping trees, mining rocks, and gathering other resources.</p>

<p>Of course, there's fishing, bug catching, and even shellfish tongs for crustaceans, shrimp, and the like. All of these activities concerning gathering have an energy limit, and that can only be replenished by eating. There seems to be enough fruit on the island, and other food besides, to keep that energy up, but the energy limits helped me remember that this is indeed a live service title.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fishing-petit-planet1.png?itok=Xyj0tiBV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/png"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fishing-petit-planet1.png?itok=aZgbKFQw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/png"></picture><figcaption>Gonna grab ya!</figcaption></figure><p>Fishing is simple, following the same principle of throwing your bobber near a fish and waiting for them to bite. For bug catching, slowly walk over to the insect, hold your net, and release to capture it. There are a plethora of species to catch, be it fish, insects, and others, though I wish a few had more of a distinct visual identity -- for now, many creatures looked too similar.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All of these animals you catch, by the way, can be thrown into a museum called the Omni-Gallery, which starts out humble but eventually becomes its own large building with a shockingly good layout for its aquarium. I have yet to see the insect area, but I'm sure it's just as impressive.</p>

<p>Speaking of buildings, you'll eventually unlock a store much like Tom Nook's, which sells different furniture and clothing daily. Beyond that, we have neighbors' houses and who knows what else, but I'm excited to see what HoYoverse has planned.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/petit-planet-neighbors1.jpg?itok=r8UKAq3D 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/petit-planet-neighbors1.jpg?itok=eRvQH7gB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's always good to be neighborly!&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><h2>Being Neighborly in&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet</em></h2>

<p>Unlike&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing,&nbsp;</em><em>Petit Planet</em>&nbsp;is opting for what seems like a smaller pool of possible neighbors, but ones that have more personality and actual stories. That was one complaint many folks had about&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing --&nbsp;</em>everyone follows one of a few cookie-cutter templates -- but that doesn't seem to be the case here.</p>

<p>So far, I've met a few neighbors, all of whom seem to be a part of the tutorial. I assume we'll have an influx of neighbors arrive in due time, and likely enough that each town will feel unique from one another. For now, I got to see Yunguo and Isaki.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-voyage-petit-planet.jpg?itok=tESuEBHu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-voyage-petit-planet.jpg?itok=3v-jGYid 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Who knows what you'll find on your voyages?</figcaption></figure><p>Yunguo and Isaki move in soon after your own arrival on the planet. You're able to pick out their house locations and all that, which is great. Soon, I had my own little community going, with Yunguo and Isaki wandering around the island and giving me various tasks.</p>

<p>Yunguo, for instance, is a farmer and helped me get acquainted with farming mechanics. You're able to grow your own food and such, which is another chill task to keep you occupied. Isaki is a cute little fox with a bit of a beetle obsession. Regardless, both have their own storylines, plus you can give them gifts or just chit-chat with them.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dorjelang.jpg?itok=kn--7xKd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dorjelang.jpg?itok=l2IclvHw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Looks like Dorjelang wants to mooove in, get it?</figcaption></figure><p>One other villager I met, Dorjelang, I was able to recruit later on via a Star Voyage, which allowed me to explore a sea of stars. Here, we can find different islands with valuable resources and even find new neighbors. Dorjelang was one such neighbor, and after a bit of talking, I got him to visit town.</p>

<p>A bit more talking with Dorjelang, and I find he's a hatmaker. Sure, let's add him to the town. So eventually he moves in, and now my planet is feeling even more lively!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/petit-planet-mushroom-furniture1.jpg?itok=hgRpg0VX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/petit-planet-mushroom-furniture1.jpg?itok=7GavlmCw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I'm digging this mushroom aesthetic.</figcaption></figure><h2>Quality of Life Features in&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet</em></h2>

<p><em>Petit Planet</em>&nbsp;brings forth a lot of quality-of-life improvements to the&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing&nbsp;</em>formula. UI is snappy and quick to use, so if you're looking for an item, inventory management isn't a hassle. The inventory seems bottomless, but if you're looking for something specific, there's a sort function to find things more easily.</p>

<p>Rearranging buildings, like neighbors' houses or the Omni-Gallery, is also a speedy process. Using the Planet Maker app on the in-game phone gives us a grid layout of our planet, and from there, I was able to rearrange buildings to my heart's content. This also allows us to place items on the ground just as easily, so the process really couldn't be any simpler.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I haven't gotten to the point of terraforming my planet, but I assume that's a feature that'll be unlocked in the future. For the time being, I swiftly unlocked the ability to paint pathways and such with a paint roller item, so I suspect it's only a matter of time until I can alter my coastline, make elevated areas, and the like.</p>

<p>The celestial theme of&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet</em>&nbsp;really helps it stand out. Seeing the stars in the sky on your cute, round little planet creates such a cozy atmosphere. Through the use of a resource called Luca, we can continually upgrade our planet and allow it to evolve, so I was able to gain constellations for my sky and cute star patterns on the grass.</p>

<p>There's also a heavy emphasis on the communal aspect of&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet</em>. There's a giant social hub called the Galactic Bazaar where players can meet and interact. The process to make new friends seems quite easy, and having them visit your planet should be a cinch. The Bazaar looks like a lot of fun, too, but due to the nature of the Closed Beta, I didn't have a chance to see it bustling with players.</p>

<p>So far, I'm very impressed with&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet</em>. It gives me the same warm and fuzzy feelings that&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing&nbsp;</em>does, without feeling like a total imitation. One thing about HoYoverse I've learned is, they're very good at adding an impressive amount of content and updates over time. With more of said updates, events, and the like, a year from launch I predict&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet</em>&nbsp;has amazing potential to be even greater than its inspiration.&nbsp;</p>
