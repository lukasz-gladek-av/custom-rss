            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/dragon-quest-1-2-hd-2d-remake-preview-pax-east-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At PAX East 2025, we had the opportunity to sit down and go hands-on with <em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em>, a continuation of the Erdrick Trilogy, which chronologically begins with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-review-all-that-glitters-are-pixels" rel="nofollow"><em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em></a>, released last year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Though released decades ago on aged hardware, the <em>Dragon Quest </em>legacy is one that JRPG fans have followed very closely, with a huge amount of excitement for these remakes to come to modern consoles. From my hands-on <em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em> preview experience, there's plenty to look forward to.</p>



<h2><em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em> Is a Streamlined JRPG&nbsp;</h2>

<p>When people think of JRPGs and turn-based combat systems, it's easy to picture a slower-paced and methodical battle system. What I found great about <em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em> is that you can speed up the battle animations to your preference, with Ultra-Fast allowing you to speed through combat encounters extremely quickly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is perfect for those looking to grind out experience in the overworld or who want to spend more time exploring the lush and beautiful open world. These two games were built from the ground-up for the modern era, and playing a sample of both games on a PS5 proved how optimized these builds are.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not only does the HD-2D art style bring the world into brilliantly sharp focus with vivid and colorful landscapes, but it also runs extremely smoothly – no frame drops noticed.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em> is an excellent follow-up to <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake </em>for those who might want to dive into <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/history-dragon-quest" rel="nofollow"><em>Dragon Quest</em></a> for the first time. And if you're a fan of the original classics, quality-of-life adjustments and modern mechanics make these stories a joy to experience all over again.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em>:<em> </em>Two Amazing Games in One&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Though there are some who wish the Erdrick trilogy had been bundled together from the start, getting&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake&nbsp;</em>is a huge win for JRPG fans. Each story provides a huge amount of lore, gameplay, and fun for&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest&nbsp;</em>fans. This dual pack is an excellent option for anyone itching to sink into a beautiful JRPG.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The remakes are already slated for the Nintendo Switch and Steam, and for avid Nintendo fans, they'll be pleased to know that they'll also be able to play&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake&nbsp;</em>on the Switch 2.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For a stunning reimaging of a classic RPG that is counting its age in decades, these remakes bring&nbsp;a fresh perspective to both titles, making this a phenomenal experience for fans to look forward to.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em>&nbsp;Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Whether you want to take your time exploring the world and the towns and caves within or jump right into combat to test your skills against stronger and stronger enemies, <em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em> delivers on all fronts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I loved wandering the world with my team, trying out new attacks, and marveling at just how quickly battles can take place with the ultra-fast options turned on. It optimizes&nbsp;a genre that, in the past, may have been challenging for newcomers to get familiar with.&nbsp;</p>

<p>By bringing these games into the modern era and rebuilding them from the ground up, Square Enix succeeds at revitalizing a beloved series and giving players an excellent reason to revisit Erdrick's story.</p>

<hr><p><em>The <strong>Dragon Quest 1 &amp; 2 HD-2D Remake</strong> release date is October 30, 2025, and it was previewed on a PlayStation 5 at PAX East 2025.&nbsp;</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-switch-2-500k-sales<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Level-5 has announced that the hit "slow life" RPG&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em>will be getting a Switch 2 Edition version complete with enhancements specific to Nintendo's new machine.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.fantasylife.jp/fli/en/topics/250527/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the game's official website, the developer says the Switch 2 Edition version of&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</em>will be launching on June 5th, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">alongside the console itself</a>. It'll cost you just $2.59 to upgrade, which isn't bad at all.</p>

<p>According to Level-5, the Switch 2 version of&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life&nbsp;</em><em>i&nbsp;</em>will take "full advantage of the hardware's capabilities" to offer "significant improvements", just like other Switch 2 Edition releases.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fantasy-life-i-switch-2-500k-horse.jpg?itok=pgSObRnz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fantasy-life-i-switch-2-500k-horse.jpg?itok=uKyXMj2- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</em>will be available on the Switch 2 at launch.</figcaption></figure><p>Improvements include faster load times and scene transitions, as well as "more beautiful" visuals and "more fluid" animations on the Switch 2. In short, it's exactly the kind of enhancement you'd expect from a jump to a new console.</p>

<p>Obviously, if you have the Switch 2 Edition version of the game but you play it on a regular Switch, you can expect "features and performance" to be "in line with the Nintendo Switch version", as Level-5 says.</p>

<h2><em>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</em>has also passed a pretty big sales milestone</h2>

<p>In addition to announcing the Switch 2 version of&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i</em>, Level-5 also revealed over the weekend that its latest game has already passed a pretty big sales milestone.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://x.com/FANTASYLIFE_EN/status/1926223393059172648" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X,&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</em>has sold 500,000 copies since launching last week (although players who pre-ordered the game enjoyed a three-day advanced access period, so that ought to be factored in as well).</p>




<p>To celebrate the achievement, Level-5 is <a href="https://x.com/FANTASYLIFE_EN/status/1926889367961784354" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">giving away</a> a number of free gifts to all players, so make sure to hop into the game and claim those if you're playing through it right now.</p>

<p><em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2993780/FANTASY_LIFE_i_The_Girl_Who_Steals_Time/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/product/JP0720-PPSA27625_00-FANTASYLIFEIGAME" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time/9pp7tdrdzghd" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-switch/" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch</a>.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nacon-wrc-games-2027-2032</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nacon-wrc-games-2027-2032<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nacon has announced that it will take over WRC video game duties from EA and Codemasters, having signed an agreement with WRC Promoter to create new FIA World Rally Championship games for the next few years.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/05/26/3088220/0/en/PRESS-RELEASE-NACON-ANNOUNCES-AGREEMENT-WITH-WRC-PROMOTER-FOR-THE-PUBLISHING-OF-THE-OFFICIAL-GAMES-OF-THE-FIA-WORLD-RALLY-CHAMPIONSHIP-FROM-2027-TO-2032.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a>, Nacon says that it will publish official FIA WRC games between 2027 and 2032, and that it has "exclusive rights" to do so on PC and consoles "for six seasons".</p>

<p>Lest you think Nacon is just going to continue EA and Codemasters' work on the&nbsp;<em>WRC&nbsp;</em>series, however, think again. The French publisher says it will be creating "a complete reboot of the franchise, based on an entirely fresh vision".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nacon-wrc-games-ea-sports-wrc.jpg?itok=Pe60rPB3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nacon-wrc-games-ea-sports-wrc.jpg?itok=KusZXlK4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nacon is taking over WRC gaming duties from EA and Codemasters.</figcaption></figure><p>In the aforementioned press release, Nacon promises to "deliver an immersive experience that faithfully reflects the quality of the championship and meets the expectations of both rally enthusiasts and new players".</p>

<p>The publisher says that all of the official teams, rallies, vehicles, and drivers from the FIA WRC will be featured in its games, as will sponsor brands. In short, it sounds like this will be every bit as faithful to the event as EA's series was.</p>

<p>This is, of course, not Nacon's first rodeo (or perhaps that should be rally) when it comes to WRC games. Between 2015 and 2020, the&nbsp;<em>WRC&nbsp;</em>franchise was under Nacon's stewardship, with racing stalwart Codemasters subsequently snapping it up.</p>

<p>Following that, Codemasters found itself subject to something of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-interactive-targeting-purchase-of-codemasters" rel="nofollow">bidding war</a> between <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-to-purchase-codemasters-instead-of-take-two" rel="nofollow">Take-Two and EA</a>, with the latter eventually purchasing the studio. The partnership produced only one rally racer, that being <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-sports-wrc-announced-promising-most-authentic-awe-inspiring-off-road-experience" rel="nofollow">2023's&nbsp;<em>EA Sports WRC</em></a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nacon-wrc-games-wrc-9.jpg?itok=WDTB-IcO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nacon-wrc-games-wrc-9.jpg?itok=JlAz1VzX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This won't be Nacon's first foray into the rally racing genre.</figcaption></figure><p>Earlier this month, EA <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-rally-games-pausing-codemasters" rel="nofollow">announced it would be "pausing" development</a> on future rally racing games, and the X account of developer Codemasters was also scrubbed, leading to fears that the developer had been shut down.</p>

<p>It was subsequently <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/codemasters-confirms-layoffs-as-ea-owned-studio-shifts-focus-away-from-beloved-rally-games/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">confirmed</a> that Codemasters had been hit by layoffs, and that some of its staff had been moved away from the studio to work on other in-development EA titles.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what Nacon's plans for its WRC games are; we don't yet know who's developing the new rally racers, but it sounds like we'll have to wait until at least 2027 to get our hands on the first post-EA Nacon WRC game.</p>
