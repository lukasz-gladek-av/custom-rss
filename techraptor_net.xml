            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has announced that it has acquired a 2.5% stake in Bandai Namco, with a view to "expanding the fan community for IP such as anime and manga around the world".</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/News/Press/202507/25-0724E/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a>, Sony says the goal with regards to acquiring this stake in the&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Tekken&nbsp;</em>studio is "strengthening engagement, particularly in the anime field", an area in which Sony expects "rapid market growth".</p>

<p>Sony acknowledges its previous collaborations with Bandai Namco, but the company says it wants to expand these efforts beyond "games, anime, and music" into a "broader range of areas", including merchandising, "experiential entertainment", and more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-bandai-namco-sony.jpg?itok=QC0DJ8qA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-bandai-namco-sony.jpg?itok=TNjrlYyq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bandai Namco is perhaps best-known as the publisher of smash hit action RPG&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that this isn't specifically a gaming-related investment; this is the wider Sony corporation investing in Bandai Namco Holdings rather than Bandai Namco Entertainment, so it doesn't just pertain to the latter's video game output.</p>

<p>However, since Sony and Bandai Namco seem focused on the anime and manga part of this partnership, it's entirely possible we'll see some new anime or manga adaptations of Bandai Namco's best-known works.</p>

<p>One particularly obvious addition to that catalog would seem to be&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>, which is arguably crying out for an anime adaptation; I'm not a huge fan of the idea of any visual reimagining of FromSoftware's work, but it makes a lot more sense than the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-movie" rel="nofollow">recently-revealed live-action movie</a>.</p>

<p>Other Bandai Namco properties, like&nbsp;<em>Tekken</em>, the&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>series, and perhaps even&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares&nbsp;</em>could be prime candidates for anime and manga adaptation, but of course, we'll have to wait and see what comes of this partnership to find out whether any of those are on the cards.</p>

That success likely comes as a result of the strong performance of 2024 releases like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-sales" rel="nofollow">Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-sales-5m" rel="nofollow"><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has revealed&nbsp;<em>Wisdom of Sea and Sky</em>, the next major expansion for digital trading card game&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>, and it's coming to Android and iOS next week.</p>

<p>As revealed in a new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Wisdom of Sea and Sky&nbsp;</em>will arrive on July 29th. This looks to be a full expansion along the lines of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-celestial-guardians-set" rel="nofollow">Celestial Guardians</a>&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-update-new-expansion-release-date" rel="nofollow"><em>Space-Time Smackdown</em></a>, rather than a themed booster pack like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-extradimensional-crisis" rel="nofollow"><em>Extradimensional Crisis</em></a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-eevee-grove" rel="nofollow"><em>Eevee Grove</em></a>.</p>

<p>As you've probably guessed, the expansion is based around the Generation 2 legendaries Ho-Oh and Lugia, who will be making their debut in&nbsp;<em>Wisdom of Sea and Sky</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-wisdom-of-sea-and-sky-ho-oh-lugia.jpg?itok=euI8PCH9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-wisdom-of-sea-and-sky-ho-oh-lugia.jpg?itok=vWoWbzGZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ho-Oh and Lugia will make their debut in next week's&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>expansion&nbsp;<em>Wisdom of Sea and Sky</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>They'll be joined by the three Gen 2 starters Chikorita, Cyndaquil, and Totodile, who are all represented by frankly adorable artwork. If you're a fan of the Gen 2 starters and want to see Chikorita and Totodile ahead of their&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-release-date-pokemon-presents" rel="nofollow">appearance in October</a>, this one's for you (sorry, Cyndaquil fans).</p>

<p>You can also look forward to the likes of a full art Pichu card, as well as new cards for Gen 2 stalwarts like Cleffa, the infamous red Gyarados that plays a key role in Gen 2's storyline, and more.</p>

<p>Eeveelutions Umbreon and Espeon will be getting new ex cards, and, of course, new Trainer cards will be making an appearance, including Supporters Lyra and Silver, as well as the new Rescue Scarf and Elemental Switch items.</p>

<p>If you want to get a sense for <em>Wisdom of Sea and Sky</em>'s theming and check out some of its new card art, you can do so right here via the expansion's trailer. I'm warning you, though: those starters really are dangerously cute.</p>




<p><em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>is available to download and play for free right now on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.pokemon.pokemontcgp&amp;hl=en_GB" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pok%C3%A9mon-tcg-pocket/id6479970832" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">iOS</a>.&nbsp;<em>Wisdom of Sea and Sky&nbsp;</em>arrives across both systems on July 29th.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/painkiller-preview-classic-fps-back-from-purgatory</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/painkiller-preview-a-classic-fps-back-from-purgatory.1252044/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Outside of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/doom-dark-ages-review" rel="nofollow">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>,&nbsp;</em>it has been a fairly sparse year as far as <a href="https://techraptor.net/genre/first-person-shooter" rel="nofollow">first-person shooters</a> go, but&nbsp;an upcoming title hopes to change that by rebooting yet another classic series.&nbsp;<em>Painkiller</em>&nbsp;is back from the dead, and this time you'll want to take a few friends along for the ride.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That's right; differing from the original&nbsp;<em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>from 2004, this is a&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/genre/cooperative/games" rel="nofollow">cooperative</a> take on the franchise, which is a bold new direction for the series. With customizable weapon configurations, you'll fight your way through various levels of Purgatory while contending with demonic hordes of foes.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/painkiller-environments.jpg?itok=Wxdhmhb- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/painkiller-environments.jpg?itok=rlBSq-bX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Environments look quite beautiful, I must say.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Painkiller</em>, Back From the Dead</h2>

<p>The basic gist of&nbsp;<em>Painkiller</em>'s gameplay is that it's a cooperative shooter supporting up to three players. You and a group of friends tackle linear, but "dynamic" levels with objectives along the way, eventually leading to an ending sequence that might put you against hordes of enemies or even a fearsome boss.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our preview for&nbsp;<em>Painkiller</em>&nbsp;comprises two levels as well as access to every weapon and character. First things first, though, a tutorial/prologue session. This tutorial immediately establishes a tone for&nbsp;<em>Painkiller.&nbsp;</em>One could mistake&nbsp;<em>Painkiller</em>&nbsp;as a&nbsp;<em>Doom&nbsp;</em>game at first glance, but it sets itself apart by offering comedic quips and humorous writing.</p>

<p><em>Painkiller's&nbsp;</em>lighthearted tone and humorous dialogue clash with its grimdark, Gothic setting of Purgatory, but it's a tone I don't mind at all. Silly&nbsp;dialogue from characters like angel Metatron helps set it apart from other FPS titles with a similar aesthetic. I even found myself chuckling at a few lines of dialogue, and nothing was enough for me to roll my eyes.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/painkiller-shotgun_0.jpg?itok=MK9cq-X0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/painkiller-shotgun_0.jpg?itok=SBXQKGZg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A shotgun to the face is always devastating.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><h2>Purgatory's Arsenal&nbsp;</h2>

<p>The tutorial goes over the basic elements of&nbsp;<em>Painkiller</em>, as any good intro sequence should. Making a return is the eponymous Painkiller weapon, this sort of handheld propeller from Hell. It slices and dices through groups of weak enemies like a hot knife through butter.</p>

<p>Eventually, we're granted two starting weapons: One is the Stakegun, which, true to its name, shoots out giant stakes. The other is the Electrodriver, which rapidly shoots out shurikens and slices through hordes of enemies with ease. At the end of the tutorial, these are your only two weapons players have access to, but you'll unlock more as you complete levels and purchase them.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/painkiller-weapon.jpg?itok=1uZn_YUe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/painkiller-weapon.jpg?itok=52xXzDpZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Here's the eponymous Painkiller.</figcaption></figure><p>Weapons are a huge emphasis here, as they should be -- it's an FPS, after all. With only six weapons at our disposal, it's slim pickings. We can only equip two weapons each run, too. There's no way to change your loadout mid-level, which is a shame since gameplay can start to feel repetitive.</p>

<p>Despite some repetition in the gunplay, it does feel satisfying to mow through hordes of smaller enemies and, even with the larger and more powerful foes, your weapons seem to pack a punch. I wish gore was a bit more visible just to see the impact of your weapons, but shotgunning a group of zombies in the face is never boring.</p>

<p>There's also weapon progression, so as you play, you can upgrade and tweak the way your guns behave after each run. Guns have their own skill tree, essentially, and choosing a path will further upgrade a gun's functionality and make it more powerful.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/painkiller-upgrades.jpg?itok=Qfa58DfU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/painkiller-upgrades.jpg?itok=pUyoyrW3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The shotgun and its tree of upgrades.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><h2>Guns, Tarot Cards, and You</h2>

<p>These upgrades have an effect on your primary fire's behavior, but each gun also comes with a secondary fire, of which there are several to choose from. The shotgun, for instance, can repulse enemies with kinetic force and send them flying off cliffs. Another choice for the secondary is the Freezer attachment, which freezes enemies in a wide area.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then come core fire upgrades, so you can have it so that the shotgun shoots slugs, or, for another choice, have it shoot in a wider radius. Each weapon has both these core upgrades and enhancements to secondary fire, so variation is actually quite large. They also come with visual upgrades, which is a neat touch.</p>

<p>These upgrades do come pretty fast, so I worry about how exciting gunplay will feel in the long run, especially when you're stuck with your loadout between each run. Nonetheless, experimenting with different weapon builds is what drove me to continue playing.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tarot-cards-painkiller.jpg?itok=aGGygW2l 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tarot-cards-painkiller.jpg?itok=14G_2M3M 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A bit like gacha, you get what you get and you don't throw a fit.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Another part of your toolkit is tarot cards, which sound exciting on paper, but didn't do much to impress me. You can spend in-game money to roll for new tarot cards to add you your deck, and you can equip two of these. Some of these add base stat increases like more health or damage, while others seem to be very situational.</p>

<p>For instance, one card, Frost Fall, has the effect "Landing from height freezes nearby enemies." Another, called Profane Blessing, grants your weapon 30 percent more damage. Some cards are way more useful than others, as you can see, usually the more powerful ones are also the most mundane.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/painkiller-smg.jpg?itok=8yW19NHP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/painkiller-smg.jpg?itok=HqM0gdnx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>And here's a look at the SMG.</figcaption></figure><h2>Tearing Through the Grounds of Purgatory</h2>

<p><em>Painkiller</em>&nbsp;touts dynamic levels, so in theory, no run is the same. The two levels available in the demo were, by and large, 99 percent the same. The same exact layout, just with some treasure chests or gold hidden in different areas. I really&nbsp;<em>wish</em>&nbsp;there were more variance to&nbsp;<em>Painkiller</em>'s levels, because I have a feeling this might get old real quick.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Levels are pretty fast, after all, and take around 30 minutes to complete. During this half hour, you'll be running through the level, slaughtering a bunch of weaker enemies, and taking on the occasional powerful foe.</p>

<p>Levels typically have a few objectives you'll need to complete along the way. These instances take place within some well-crafted combat arenas. These arenas take advantage of<em>&nbsp;Painkiller</em>'s run-and-gun. The developer knows how to craft an exciting environment to rip and tear through, I'll give them that.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/painkiller-level-layout.jpg?itok=Pd-7MFXR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/painkiller-level-layout.jpg?itok=wU-fx_rg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Combat arenas look pretty cool! There's a good mix of hazards and platforms to make battle a bit more interesting.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Admittedly, levels are well-made, but feel old upon repetition. I'm not sure if&nbsp;<em>Painkiller</em>&nbsp;is meant to be played as a one-and-done sort of deal, but the way the gameplay systems are designed leads me to believe multiple runs to upgrade your weapons is the way to go.</p>

<p>If that's the case, I hope Anshar Studios has more than a handful of levels for us to explore, otherwise, I can see&nbsp;<em>Painkiller</em>'s online population dropping off quite quickly after finishing their initial run through the campaign. As a game that requires a healthy player base to survive, I'm a bit worried based on what I've played.</p>

<p>You can play with bots, but that's not quite the same experience as playing with humans. Bots are competent enough, but did have trouble following my order to stand on a certain switch or target specific enemies. I also had one instance where a bot died on a spike trap, so another bot went over to try to revive it. They both got stuck and died until their lives ran out.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/painkiller-blood-tank.jpg?itok=ibVkOWq- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/painkiller-blood-tank.jpg?itok=5nY0ad0P 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Fillin' up on blood.</figcaption></figure><p>Bots are even more of a nuisance when it comes to completing one certain objective. Your progress will halt when you reach certain checkpoints in the map, so you might have to survive a few hordes of enemies, and then you can move on. Others require you to fill tanks of blood by killing enemies in their proximity, which is simply not fun.</p>

<p>You, as the player, can carry these blood tanks, while the bots can't. Stopping your shooting to reposition these tanks with janky physics is a nuisance, and for some reason, there are quite a few of these objectives within the maps. I'm sure it's less painful to play with actual players, at least.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But still,&nbsp;<em>Painkiller</em> desperately needs more variety in the different types of tasks players. Most of the gameplay comprises surviving said hordes of enemies, or filling these blood tanks. That's all. Give us more objectives to do, and make it dynamic. Things get stale pretty fast otherwise.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/painkiller-boss.jpg?itok=YHX_wulD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/painkiller-boss.jpg?itok=BSvZDUuw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The run ends before we can fight this boss, but I am very interested to see how the fight pans out.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Painkiller </em>Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>There is merit to cooperative titles with hordes of enemies. Look at the success of games like&nbsp;<em>Left 4 Dead</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40,000: Darktide</em>. The difference, though, is that levels are longer and more grander in scope, and enemies are more diverse and complex.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is also elements of unpredictability in those types of games, which&nbsp;<em>Painkiller</em>&nbsp;lacks. The core gameplay of&nbsp;<em>Painkiller</em>&nbsp;is solid, and levels are decent enough the first time around, but consecutive runs? I'm not so sure.</p>

<p>I desperately wish for&nbsp;<em>Painkiller</em>'s success. Levels are richly detailed. Each weapon has more than a few unique quirks about them. Combat areas are vertical, visceral, and well-crafted. But to truly garner attention, I hope for a greater degree of randomization between each run, as well as a stronger progression system. Time will tell when it launches this October.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dead Take</em> is a horror game by actors, about actors, and for fans of video games and horror alike, as you step into the aftermath of a glitzy Hollywood Hills party in search of your friend.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ahead of the game's July 31 release, I had a chance to converse with Abubakar Salim, the Creative Director of <em>Dead Take</em> and the founder of Surgent Studios, about <em>Dead Take's</em> main characters, unique gameplay elements, and the potentially risky story to tell.</p>


<h2>Actors Playing Actors Auditioning For A Role</h2>

<p><em>Dead Take</em> will follow the journey of two actors: Chase, played by Neil Newbon, and Vinny, played by Ben Starr.</p>

<p>"You'll play as Chase. The game begins as you arrive at the mansion in search of Vinny after a glitzy party, and the story will unfold as you solve puzzles and splice live-action videos together to get deeper inside," Salim said.</p>

<p>While it isn't 100% clear the full nature of the relationship between Chase and Vinny, Salim did expand that "<em>Dead Take</em> is about two actors going for the same role." The announcement of Newbon and Starr as cast in <em>Dead Take</em> introduced them not only as playing their own characters, but that both play the role of Willie.</p>

<p>In the universe of <em>Dead Take</em> it seems that Chase and Vinny are both trying to book the role of Willie.</p>

<p>"It’s been fascinating to have actors playing actors, because so many things in the game hit so close to home for them," Salim said.</p>

<p>As you progress through the game, you'll get to see these characters showing different approaches to a single role.</p>

<p>Drawing on their own experience, Salim was complimentary of Newbon and Starr not just in their performances but "also when sharing their own experiences in the industry." This involvement throughout the development process helped "shape the narrative in a big way."</p>

<p>There is a dark twist to the performances that we'll see, too. Knowing that the game would be told from the point of view of one actor and we'd get to see multiple live-action performances, I questioned how reliable will what we're seeing as the players be if it's just from Chase's perspective or the perspective of a camera.</p>

"So much of what unfolds in <em>Dead Take</em> is about those grand narratives, picking them apart to see the awful truth underneath."</p>

<h2>Telling a Dark Hollywood Tale</h2>

<p>Knowing just how specific a story this is, one of "a side of the entertainment industry only discussed in whispers," as the Steam store page cites, I was interested to hear where this idea originated from and what it was like to develop.</p>

<p>"It felt a bit dangerous to me, and once I’d had the idea, it wouldn’t go away. When I told people about it, their reactions were either 'You have to do this,' or 'Ditch this idea, you’re gonna get blacklisted,'" Salim said. "But for me, the most important thing was to acknowledge the elephant in the room. Not everyone with power uses it responsibly, and there’s something about being an artist that makes it doubly insidious."</p>

<p>Knowing that Salim has credits as an actor, director, and producer across live-action, animated, and actual-play content, I was interested to hear what led him to pursue this story in the medium of video games. He explained that he was looking to create a deeper connection to the player.</p>

Not wanting to tell the players how they should feel or interact with the world, but instead to experience the narrative from his view and to then draw their own conclusions.</p>

<p>"It feels more collaborative to me, and I like the feeling of connecting to players in that way."</p>

<h2>Mansion Exploration</h2>

<p>Seeing snippets of walking through creepy, darkened hallways and reassembling a trident to open a path forward, I immediately thought of games like <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="33eaca7a-990f-42da-a131-81cbcae617b8" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/resident-evil-9-requiem-closed-door-presentation-shows-classic-re-puzzles-and" rel="nofollow">Resident Evil</a> or newer <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e1e84774-c3b4-4fe9-aa03-b12cca7e88b8" href="https://techraptor.net/games/five-nights-at-freddys" rel="nofollow"><em>FNAF </em></a>games, putting players in a tense situation with puzzles to solve.</p>

"Although there are plenty of puzzles that play on the bizarre mix of items you find in a movie mogul’s house, we also wanted to tap into the reality of being an actor trying to score a role," Salim said.</p>

<p>Referencing the different live-action footage filmed of actors, players will be "finding and splicing together live-action videos." You'll not only be able to solve the mechanical puzzles of the game, but also learn more about who the actors are that you're playing as or trying to find.</p>

<p>"We wanted to tap into the reality of being an actor trying to score a role. For a lot of us, how well you’re doing can be measured by what you’re actually filming: audition tapes? Screen tests? Interviews? There’s something about behind-the-scenes content, showing actors slip in and out of character like it’s nothing, that is so creepy and unsettling, so we wanted to play with that in a puzzle," Salim said.</p>

<p><em>Dead Take</em> releases on July 31 for Steam. Joining Newbon and Starr, other familiar faces that you might see include Jane Perry and Alanah Pearce, as well as Matt Mercer, Laura Bailey, and Travis Willingham.</p>
