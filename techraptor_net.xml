<p>As part of the LinkedIn post, Sperry includes a sizzle reel of "features, updates, and creative ideas" that Three Fields was planning to bring to <em>Wreckreation </em>in the future.</p><p>She says she hopes that the reel might provide an "opportunity" in the form of another publisher who sees the "potential" of what the team was trying to build with the racing sandbox, but that even if this doesn't happen, the video will "stand as a testament" to Three Fields' "vision".</p><p>Although <em>Wreckreation </em>likely won't receive any further updates in future, there is one more planned before Christmas which will bring crossplay to the game, ensuring that you can play it alongside your friends on other platforms.</p><p>Three Fields is just one of a number of indie teams struggling with an increasingly difficult industry. Other studios, like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hyper-light-breaker-development-ending-layoffs" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="52ab77a2-436b-4612-9359-a78aaa4748d6" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Hyper Light Breaker </em>developer Heart Machine</a> and <em>Metal: Hellsinger </em>studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-hellsinger-the-outsiders-shut-down-funcom" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7586356a-08b1-450a-a88c-9b10c217225a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">The Outsiders</a>, have been hit by layoffs or closures as well, and it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crystal-dynamics-layoffs-november-2025" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9d6386f8-4642-4532-8c75-667f88869d6e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">not just indie outfits either</a>.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see whether Three Fields' work gets picked up by another publisher, but for now, unfortunately, it looks like the team won't get the chance to bring their vision for <em>Wreckreation </em>to fruition.</p><p>If you do want to check the game out, you can pick it up now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1594040/Wreckreation/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4389-PPSA09823_00-WRECKCREATION000" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/wreckreation/9n0llb6pg0r4" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
