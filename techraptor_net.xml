<h2>Fifth Place -&nbsp;<b>Kill Team 3rd Edition</b></h2>

<p>The latest version of the Warhammer 40K skirmish wargame streamlined a lot of rules (and got rid of the crazy shapes for measuring), and while the 2nd edition was great, this edition feels more polished and I love the addition of the free faction rules online, letting you build your force out of your existing models without any other purchase. It also introduced a great cooperative/solo mode (at the cost of the narrative campaign play, which we hope they bring back).</p>

<h2><b>Fourth Place - The Magnus Archives Roleplaying Game</b></h2>



<p><em>Written by Tyler Chancey</em></p>

<p>This year, Monte Cook Games managed two impressive tasks. Adapting the cult horror podcast series The Magnus Archives into a fun, atmospheric TTRPG. Second, through that adaptation introduce a compelling mental Stress system and with it a layer of cosmic horror into the award-winning Cypher System. Truly a wonder to behold.</p>



<h2><b>Third Place - The Lord of the Rings: Duel for Middle-earth</b></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tabletop-game-of-the-year-lord-of-the-rings-duel.jpg?itok=pNlkit7Z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tabletop-game-of-the-year-lord-of-the-rings-duel.jpg?itok=MI9Mg8Ca 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>Written by Giaco Furino</em></p>

<p>When you give the elevator pitch of this game (a LOTR reskinning of <i>7 Wonders: Duel</i>, which is itself a 2-player version of&nbsp;<em>7 Wonders</em>) you'd be excused for thinking this is just a cash grab using a strong IP. But you'd be more wrong than Boromir suggesting one cannot simply walk into Mordor! With a tense back and forth, fun mechanics built around building a card tableau, and multiple routes to victory (including map control, points, and more),&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings: Duel for Middle-earth</em>&nbsp;was one of the most surprising gaming experiences we've had this year!</p>

<h2><b>Second Place - HeroQuest First Light</b></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tabletop-game-of-the-year-heroquest-first-light.jpeg?itok=nW8P3jKt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tabletop-game-of-the-year-heroquest-first-light.jpeg?itok=xtO-3CEZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>Written by Andrew Stretch</em></p>

<p>For families wanting to begin to broach more complicated TTRPGs with young family members HeroQuest First Light is an all-in-one box that will have them dungeon diving in no time. With a versatile game board that can be explored nearly infinite ways, and quick to grasp but satisfying combat, it becomes a bridge between a traditional board game and a pen and paper RPG. An added benefit is the GM Companion App that will allow for a party of four to explore without needing a GM lowering the barrier to entry even further.</p>

<h2><b>First Place - Wyrmspan</b></h2>

<p><em>Wyrmspan</em>&nbsp;is a game that takes something incredible and perfects upon it further, pushing the design right up to the limits to create a bold, inviting, and strategically rewarding experience. I think&nbsp;<em>Wyrmspan&nbsp;</em>may be one of the most engrossing gaming experiences I've had this year, and fans of the original&nbsp;<em>Wingspan</em>&nbsp;absolutely need to check this game out as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Even if the birding aspect is what initially drew you into&nbsp;<em>Wingspan</em>, rest assured that this game - full of its own swath of gorgeous illustrations - will completely sink its talons into you and your gaming group!</p>
