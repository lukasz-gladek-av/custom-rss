            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-4-remake-domain-registration<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>An eagle-eyed social media user has spotted the registration of a brand new web domain that could point towards the existence (and possible imminent reveal) of a&nbsp;<em>Persona 4&nbsp;</em>remake.</p>

<p>As spotted by YouTuber Faz <a href="https://x.com/ScrambledFaz/status/1902715312379752726" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on X</a>, the domain "p4re.jp" was registered earlier today. The registrant is listed as "not displayed by registrant's request", which could well be an attempt on publisher Atlus' part to obfuscate the&nbsp;<em>Persona 4&nbsp;</em>remake until it's time for the game to be revealed.</p>

<p>Faz points out that two years ago, the domain "p3re.jp" was registered in a similar fashion, and three months after that domain was registered,&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-3-reload-persona-5-tactica-leaked-by-atlus-itself" rel="nofollow">was officially revealed</a>. We could well be about to see a repeat of that particular pattern.</p>

<p>Still, the fact that&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload&nbsp;</em>was preceded by a similar registration perhaps makes this more compelling evidence than the usual rumor mill. I, for one, am hoping against hope that we are indeed about to get&nbsp;<em>Persona 4 Reload</em>.</p>

<p>If it is happening, then we may well get a reveal during one of the upcoming Summer Games Fest showcases;&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload&nbsp;</em>was, after all, announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-games-showcase-2023-find-all-announcements-trailers-reveals-here" rel="nofollow">during 2023's Xbox summer show</a>.</p>

<p>Another reveal during an Xbox show could also mean that&nbsp;<em>Persona 4 Reload</em>&nbsp;lands on Game Pass on day one, which would be another blessing for subscribers. Of course, all of this is speculation at the moment.</p>
