            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/fractured-blooms-makes-me-feel-uncomfortable-and-i-dont-even-know-what-its-about<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A chilling surprise from the Summer Game Fest showcase last week was the reveal of Serenity Forge's new game, <a href="https://serenityforge.com/games/fractured-blooms" rel="nofollow"><em>Fractured Blooms</em></a>. Inspired by a true story, the trailer opens on a cosy cottage, before layered whispering and warping of the music begins to give away a more… horrific nature to this story.</p>

<p>At Summer Game Fest, I got to play a demo of <em>Fractured Blooms</em> at an event called The MIX, where indie developers from all over were able to showcase what they were working on.</p>

<p><em>Fractured Blooms</em> markets itself as a psychological life sim where you "Play as Angie, a girl who finds herself stuck in a time loop and a world that is soft and still."</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fractured-blooms-sgf-2025-gardening.jpg?itok=F8Tgdr5F 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fractured-blooms-sgf-2025-gardening.jpg?itok=qprpqrqF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>A Farming Simulation?</h2>

<p>Beginning the game, I walked up a path to a pretty house, with an even prettier garden. As you walk, Angie begins to narrate. She talks of the importance of raising the crops, and each step along the way, her narration lends itself to what you should do next.</p>

<p>Visit the garden, pluck a Tomato, place the Tomato in a basket, sow some beet seeds, water them, and then make your way inside to cook dinner.</p>

<p>All the while, you're completing simple tasks, and your stamina in the lower left of the screen slowly ticks away. The narration is simple enough, but as you'd expect from the voice of any little girl whispering in your ear, it's a little unsettling.</p>

<p>Cooking is when things began to go awry. Making sure to chop up the tomato, grab some herbs and meat, put it in a pot and let it cook for 30 seconds was slow and eerie enough, but when strange things began to happen like odd noises from the radio I was on edge.</p>

<p>Heading upstairs, a timer appeared on the screen for Angie to go to sleep, but first, I needed to gather the dirty laundry from the various rooms on the top floor. I would like to say that I was excellent at this, identifying all of the laundry and getting it in the machine well before the timer hit zero, but that just wasn't the case.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fractured-blooms-sgf-2025-timer.jpg?itok=sjfj6tAP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fractured-blooms-sgf-2025-timer.jpg?itok=ry9E4EAr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Deeper Secrets Of The House And It's Inhabitants</h2>

<p>Each of the rooms lent to a larger story, coded as if a boy or girl might be living there, and in the main bedroom, there was what I can only describe as the breakdown of reality glowing red and pixelated in the corner. For a house that only Angie is currently living in… there's far more to this story.</p>

<p>Going to bed, well after the timer had hit zero, Angie woke up the next morning, pulling apart reality and starting from the bottom of the hill as I had initially started the demo. This time, as I approached the house, it was far less cute…</p>

<p>A number of changes had taken place. Sinister red plants were growing all over, the sky was darker, and for failing to put away my laundry in time and getting to bed I was starting the day with one less stamina.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fractured-blooms-sgf-2025-04.jpg?itok=Zcf5lkxH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fractured-blooms-sgf-2025-04.jpg?itok=YkKyKq8j 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Repeating the tasks from the day everything got that much more sinister. While watering the plants they grew in disfiguring ways, while cooking the TV turned on to static and the remote had been thrown half-way across the room, when I walked upstairs I was prepared to load the laundry as soon as possible. <em>Fractured Blooms</em> had other intentions though as it forced me to hide from… something, or hallways became impassable as red roots grew out of the walls.</p>

<p>I didn't load the laundry in time… I went to sleep tired again, fearing the effect on the next day, and almost thankfully, the demo ended.</p>

<p>I stepped away from <em>Fractured Blooms,</em> perplexed. I'm normally quite quick to pick up on a game, and have at least some idea of a direction it's heading. Impressively, all I came away from <em>Fractured Blooms</em> with was doubts and questions.</p>

<p>I wanted to know what could have been different if I had been more successful on the first day? What happened if I planted flowers instead of beets like the narration requested? Where was everyone else from the house, and if what Angie was seeing was real (including the warping portal in her bedroom) then what was the cause of it?</p>

<p>It also didn't help that I was greeted at the end of the demo by Z, the founder of Serenity Forge, who was interested to learn what I thought the game was about. I tried my best to piece together initial thoughts that it was a game about a warring childlike psyche and the negative impacts of the world around it, but that I didn't even have initial guesses about what the story of the house and it's inhabitants were.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fractured-blooms-sgf-2025-gun.jpg?itok=bOMm4Qfk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fractured-blooms-sgf-2025-gun.jpg?itok=XCklIV9m 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The very fact that you get a gun at some point just reinforces that I am not aware of what's going on here...</figcaption></figure><p>The amount of time spent in the demo was just enough to pique my interest and now I want to go back in and explore every depth of the full game. Maybe it's just me feeling bitter that I was so confidant about planning a laundry route on the second go around and the game humbled me so intensely?</p>

<h2><em>Fractured Blooms</em> Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><em>Fractured Blooms</em> has all of the makings to be an incredible hit. A relatively smaller scoped world, jam packed with iteration changes, and a deeper story to learn about Angie and her view of the world.</p>

<p>Mechanics are simple enough for anyone to approach, but in order to best manage your resources and the punches that the world is going to throw at you it will demand quick thinking.</p>

<p>I look forward to learning not just how much deeper the story goes, but also the mechanics of growing crops in your garden, gathering them, and preparing meals for yourself, and I truly feel for whoever's story this is inspired by…</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/ronin-rpg-review-honor-and-chaos<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Welcome to the eternal twilight. Death and horror can be found here in abundance, and you won't have to look far. But there's something different about you. The darkness doesn't like you, or what you represent. A small speck of light. A shred of honor. You won't last long. They never do.</em></p>

<p>The <em>Ronin</em> tabletop RPG by Slightly Reckless Games is set on the fictional island of Kage No Shima, in a feudal Japanese setting. The world is under a never-ending eclipse, and the terrors of the night, drawn from myths and legends, have come to take hold. <em>Ronin</em> uses the <em>Mork Borg</em> third-party license and&nbsp;was a successful Kickstarter back in 2023. SRG's latest Kickstarter,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/slightlyreckless/ronin-densetsu" rel="nofollow">Rōnin: Densetsu</a><em>,</em> has just funded successfully, adding new accessories and supplements to the game, and for those that missed it, the pledge manager&nbsp;is planned to open on June 13.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ronin-rpg-2.jpg?itok=WigAfNtf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ronin-rpg-2.jpg?itok=JtEhjuf2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Ronin</em> is full of art, and each page blends the artwork into the rules or background it presents [Credit - <em>Ronin</em> Rulebook, Slightly Reckless Games].</figcaption></figure><h2>Honor In The Darkness</h2>

<p><em>Ronin</em> uses the <em>Mork Borg</em> third-party license for its rules, which means that the rules for playing are similar, so anyone who's played <em>Mork Borg</em> will pick this up quickly. However, it is also its own entire game, so anyone who hasn't played <em>Mork Borg</em>&nbsp;will still find everything they need here to play. The&nbsp;<em>Ronin</em>&nbsp;rulebook is also as dark and beautifully chaotic as <em>Mork Borg</em>. A never-ending eclipse has darkened the world, bringing madness and terrors with it, and the chaos of the book layout reflects that.</p>

<p>This chaotic layout doesn't reflect the efficiency of how it gets the information across, quite the opposite. The punchy digest-sized <em>Ronin</em> hardcover (or 128-page PDF if you're digitally inclined) delivers the background lore of the setting, details the island of Kage No Shima and its locations, and the main factions that inhabit it, in its punchy first few pages.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ronin-rpg-6.jpg?itok=Wv9UODyc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ronin-rpg-6.jpg?itok=68N43SQy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Character death is a part of <em>Ronin</em>, and blends seamlessly into the setting and mechanics&nbsp;[Credit - <a href="https://slightlyrecklessgames.com/pages/free-stuff-ronin" rel="nofollow">Slightly Reckless Games website</a>].</figcaption></figure><h2>Way Of The Sword</h2>

<p>The <em>Ronin</em> rules are as light as the background, even for a rules-lite system. There's a single page on tests, essentially just a paragraph saying roll a D20 and add your stat vs the difficulty rating. A couple of pages cover combat, which is also kept super punchy, with the players making a roll for defense when they're attacked, no roll from the GM required. On their turn, there are a couple of attack options, a once-per-combat parry option, and details for fumbles and critical hits.</p>

<p>This simplicity transfers across to enemy details, which has stats for their attacks, armor/hit points, and any special rules they have, and to player characters, who are made up of 5 stats, swiftness, spirit, vigor, resilience and honor, along with their hit points, special rules and equipment.</p>

<p>Most of the stats are used for tests, but the honor stat plays a huge part in <em>Ronin</em>, beyond working out how others interact with you. If your character dies with less than 10 honor, you get a negative modifier to your next character's stats, and with honor 10 or more, a positive modifier. If you commit a dishonorable act, you can commit seppuku, or ritual suicide, by passing a spirit and then a resilience test to regain some honor.</p>

<p>If your character dies, all is not lost, you get 1 chance to win against a powerful demon, being resurrected in success, or dying as normal in defeat. The quickness of character creation should be an indication of how long your characters should expected to survive, and if it's not that obvious, the very first page of the rules is a woe table, where each day, the GM randomly determines a woe that affects the land, and there's only ever 7 rolls.</p>

<p><em>Ronin</em> has 10 different character classes, some drawn from history, others from popular culture. Character creation, and the options including equipment, take up a full quarter of the rulebook, and is by far the lengthiest section. The character class options are:</p>

<ul><li>Forgotten Ronin - The masterless&nbsp;samurai from history</li>
	<li>Eurdite Samurai - A scholarly samurai</li>
	<li>Drunken Monk - A zen master of the drunken kung-fu style</li>
	<li>Corrupted Shinobi - The elite warriors of the night, the ninja</li>
	<li>Onmyoji - Powerful magic users who harness the spirits</li>
	<li>Bakuto - Gambling tricksters</li>
	<li>Yamabushi - Spiritual hermit monks</li>
	<li>Wild Dancer - A katana and revolver-wielding warrior</li>
	<li>Reckless Sumo - The huge and powerful wrestling martial artists</li>
	<li>Sword Saint - A samurai master duelist</li>
</ul><p>Each character class has some modifications to the 4 stats, special abilities that can be chosen or randomly determined, and starting equipment. You can also opt to not use a class and roll up a character yourself using a slightly different set of rules.</p>

<p>The <em>Ronin</em> core rulebook ends with details of some common types of enemies and the Blood Rains over the Crimson Jungle introductory adventure, but also currently available are two short Zines. The first, Frozen Tears of the Lady of the Snow, is another adventure for <em>Ronin</em>, and Tales of the Masterless, which contains tables and details for running a game of <em>Ronin</em> solo.</p>

<p>As explained above, because combat (and tests in general) are so simple and don't require rolls from the GM, <em>Ronin</em> plays extremely well solo, and the Tales of the Masterless zine simply gives you the tools to create scenarios quickly. It also provides the tools for the GM to roll up a scenario or dungeon effortlessly to keep the game flowing, and is a fantastic little supplement for both uses.</p>

<p><em>Ronin</em> is a rules-lite, incredibly thematic, samurai-themed apocalyptic RPG. Players should go into this not getting too attached to their characters, but the speed of character creation and play offset the length of character use. The honor system, resurrection, and subsequent character creation rules play very well into the system, and despite its small size, the book is full of details. It's gloriously chaotic, brutal, and a lot of fun.</p>

<p>Because of how lite the system is, it might not be ideal for first-time GMs introducing first-time players to roleplaying. That's not to say it can't be done, and fans of the setting, or related anime, manga, and video games, will make it work with knowledge of the background. The rules-lite nature does make running games very easy (especially if combined with Tales of the Masterless), but some knowledge of roleplaying games and feudal Japan will make it a lot more enjoyable for your players.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/mighty-boards-announces-art-society-deluxe-edition-kickstarter-alongside-new-board<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Art Society Deluxe Edition</em> is coming to Kickstarter. The tabletop publisher Mighty Boards is introducing a new and improved version of one of 2024's biggest games, along with a new board game project, at Spiel 2025 and Pax Unplugged.</p>

<h2>The <em>Art Society Deluxe Edition</em> Kickstarter Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, <em>Art Society Deluxe Edition</em> is a revised version of the beloved board game. This edition will feature shinier paintings, wooden gavels, a redesigned storage solution, and a limited-edition game box.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/art-society-board-game-game-pieces.jpg?itok=AEYEQ1_a 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/art-society-board-game-game-pieces.jpg?itok=6haKfJ2c 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The original version of <em>Art Society</em> was designed by Mitch Wallace and featured artwork by Veronica Grassi and Max Kosek. The game has 2-4 players act as art connoisseurs. You would take turns buying art pieces at auctions, then arranging those pieces into a curated gallery. Whoever has the best gallery at the end wins. Easier said than done since no one can predict what art styles will be fashionable in the future.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, details on the <em>Art Society Deluxe Edition</em> are scarce. It is unclear if the campaign will include substantive stretch goals or campaign-exclusive expansion packs. But given the popularity and success of the original game, it is a strong foundation to build upon.</p>

<p>In the same press release, Mighty Boards announced that their newest project, <em>Red North</em>. The game, designed by James Dickinson, is the latest edition of Saer, a Viking-themed strategic card game.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/red-north-box-artwork.jpg?itok=2ItBSiyM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/red-north-box-artwork.jpg?itok=3nYZqpNI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Players compete through hidden hands of different warrior factions to conquer enemy outposts. But resources are scarce, so players will need to balance their deployed warriors and their reserves for the final round. That final round, called Ragnarok, is the final battle for all of the marbles. A battle so epic that even the Norse Gods are involved on the battlefield.</p>

<p><em>Red North</em> is available for pre-order now at an MSRP of $25. If you are attending either Spiel 2025 or Pax Unplugged, you can pick up your ordered copy at that event at no additional charge.</p>
