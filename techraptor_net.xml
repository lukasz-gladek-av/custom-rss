            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>developer and publisher Funcom has announced that the game has reached a major sales milestone since its release earlier this month, and the studio has also shared some fun stats to commemorate said milestone.</p>

<p>According to a press release,&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening</em>&nbsp;has sold a million copies since <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-delayed-june" rel="nofollow">its launch on June 10th</a>. This figure also makes the game the fastest-selling Funcom title; as the studio points out, it took&nbsp;<em>Conan Exiles</em>, which is&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening</em>'s spiritual predecessor, around a year to reach the same figure.</p>

<p>Additionally,&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening</em>'s peak player count of <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1172710/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">189,333</a> on Steam has easily outstripped&nbsp;<em>Conan Exiles</em>' <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/440900/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">53,402</a>, and&nbsp;the newer game also has a 24-hour player peak of 174,003, so there are still plenty of people interested in it almost two weeks after launch.</p>

Next time, you'll know to pack a sturdier umbrella.</p>

<p>Players have crafted 517,585 ornithopters between them, and over 6 billion grams of spice have been consumed across&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening</em>'s player base as well, proving the franchise's age-old adage true.</p>

<p>It's worth checking out the full infographic to see some other fun&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>numbers, so here it is in all its glory!</p>



<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>is, it's a survival game set on the desert planet of Arrakis, which is central to the plot and setting of Frank Herbert's influential&nbsp;<em>Dune&nbsp;</em>series (as well as director Denis Villeneuve's movies, of course).</p>

<p>The game takes place in an alternate timeline in which messiah figure Paul Atreides was never born and in which a civil war between the Atreides and Harkonnen factions rages. You play as a Bene Gesserit agent searching for the nomadic Fremen, who have disappeared in this timeline.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172710/Dune_Awakening/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>. The game is also due to come to consoles at some point in the future, although we don't know exactly when just yet.</p>
