            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tango-gameworks-unique-games-krafton<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Hi-Fi Rush&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Ghostwire: Tokyo&nbsp;</em>developer Tango Gameworks has revealed that it's still looking to make "unique and interesting" games following its acquisition by&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>publisher Krafton earlier this year.</p>

<p>In an interview with Japanese news platform <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/681/G068145/20241212042/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">4Gamer</a> (with additional reporting and translation by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/tango-gameworks-will-continue-to-make-unique-games-after-acquisition-by-krafton-lead-devs-confirm/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Automaton Media</a>), Tango Gameworks execs Colin Mack, John Johanas, and Kazuaki Egashira discuss their studio's future and its approach to creativity.</p>

<p>As a reminder, Microsoft <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown" rel="nofollow">washed its hands</a> of Tango (alongside&nbsp;<em>Redfall&nbsp;</em>developer Arkane Austin) earlier this year, leading many to believe that the studio's days were done. However, Krafton then <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-acquires-tango-gameworks-and-hi-fi-rush-ip-with-plans-for-future-expansion" rel="nofollow">swept in</a> to purchase Tango Gameworks, as well as the <i>Hi-Fi Rush&nbsp;</i>IP.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hi-fi-rush-tango-gameworks-chai.jpg?itok=8ePluDFi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hi-fi-rush-tango-gameworks-chai.jpg?itok=lOX1yOyG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Tango Gameworks still wants to make "unique" games after its acquisition by Krafton.</figcaption></figure><p>In the interview, Egashira confirms that Tango Gameworks' overall goal is "still IP creation", and that rather than making creative decisions, Krafton's part in things is to help Tango "expand".</p>

<p>That appears to be a sentiment echoed by Krafton itself, incidentally. Back in September, CEO Changhan Kim said he didn't think&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hi-fi-rush-2-krafton-ceo" rel="nofollow">would be a profitable endeavor</a>, but that his company wants to "try something new" and take risks, which is a rather refreshing outlook.</p>

<p>Johanas chips in by saying that he wants Tango to be somewhere people think of games as "their baby" rather than as "some task to be done", and Mack says Tango's goal is to continue to create "unique and interesting games" for the studio's fans.</p>

<p>In short, if you were worried that Krafton would transform Tango into a sequel mill or a DLC producer for&nbsp;<em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em>, then it looks like you needn't worry; the goal at the moment appears to be to let the studio retain its unique identity.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-evil-within-2-tango-gameworks.jpg?itok=_OhRTwgG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-evil-within-2-tango-gameworks.jpg?itok=inBCNRJo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Tango Gameworks also developed both&nbsp;<em>The Evil Within&nbsp;</em>and its sequel, although the studio doesn't own the IP.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, the interview stops short of Tango announcing exactly what it's working on next, although we do know that there are plans to expand&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>, so we may well get a sequel announcement in the next couple of years.</p>

<p>For now, though, rest assured that whatever Tango does next, it's likely to come out of leftfield in a similar way to their previous projects. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-update-1-1-a-life</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stalker-2-update-1-1-arrives-with-over-1800-fixes-including-a-life-changes-and-more.1065288/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-update-1-1-a-life<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GSC Game World has released&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>update 1.1, and it comes with an absolutely astonishing number of fixes for over 1500 of the game's bugs, including changes to the controversial A-Life system and more.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, GSC Game World <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-a-life-20-gsc-game-world" rel="nofollow">explained</a> that much like the rest of&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>, the game's A-Life AI system (that's AI in the trad sense, not the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/at-least-1000-steam-games-using-generative-ai-per-new-report" rel="nofollow">generative sense</a>) is riddled with bugs, but some of those bugs have been addressed in today's update.</p>

<p>You should now encounter more roaming NPCs in the Zone, and NPCs should no longer spawn behind your back. Additionally, A-Life NPCs should now be visible at greater distances, and groups exploring the Zone should be "more diverse regarding possible factions and group sizes".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stalker-2-update-1.1-bunker.jpg?itok=E23MqMgA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stalker-2-update-1.1-bunker.jpg?itok=ae7TUqKM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>update 1.1 is chock-full of bug fixes.</figcaption></figure><p>It's not just A-Life, either. Other changes have also been implemented, like a reduction in number for Pseudodog clones, which could threaten to overwhelm you in certain circumstances.</p>

<p>Rewards for "several missions" have been increased, and "multiple improvements" have been made to characters' facial animations and voice work in "several cutscenes".</p>

<p>You can also look forward (or perhaps that's the wrong phrase) to&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>'s infinite money glitch being gone from the game. No more can you exploit the Zone's weird logic to make yourself rich. You'll just have to do it the old-fashioned way.</p>

<p>Since there are almost 2000 fixes in this update, there are far too many for me to list here. Be sure to check out the full&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>update 1.1 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/525329871842312365" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">patch notes</a> if you want to see everything that's changed.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>, it's the sequel to 2007's influential cult classic&nbsp;<em>Stalker: Shadow of Chernobyl&nbsp;</em>(which was the spelling being used at the time, and it hasn't been retroactively changed at time of writing).</p>

<p>The game was in development for some time; originally announced in 2010, it went through a lengthy development cycle and at least one development reboot before being <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-heart-of-chernobyl-release-date-announced" rel="nofollow">fully re-revealed in 2021</a>.</p>

<p>Following that, the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 led to many development setbacks for Ukrainian studio GSC Game World, causing the game to be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/post-apocalyptic-shooter-stalker-2-delayed-until-december" rel="nofollow">delayed</a> numerous <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-delayed-once-again-november" rel="nofollow">times</a> before its eventual release earlier this year.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/stalker-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and it's also on Game Pass (for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-price-hike-new-tier" rel="nofollow">certain tiers</a>, anyway). Make sure to take a look at <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/stalker-2-review" rel="nofollow">our very own Robert N. Adams' review here</a> to find out how things have changed in the Zone over the last 17 years or so.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/trails-in-sky-1st-chapter-simultaneous-global-release-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-will-get-a-simultaneous-worldwide-release-in-2025.1065285/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/trails-in-sky-1st-chapter-simultaneous-global-release-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nihon Falcom and GungHo Entertainment have announced that&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</em>, an upcoming remake of 2004 JRPG&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky</em>, will be getting a worldwide release next year.</p>

<p>In a new trailer, the two studios confirm that&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter&nbsp;</em>will arrive across the world in fall next year, and that it'll also be coming to PC and PlayStation 5 alongside its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-august-2024-recap" rel="nofollow">previously-announced Nintendo Switch release</a>.</p>

<p>At that point, it was named&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky the 1st</em>, presumably in keeping with the naming convention used by <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/436670/The_Legend_of_Heroes_Trails_in_the_Sky_the_3rd/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">third instalment&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky the 3rd</em></a>. It looks like Nihon Falcom has abandoned that particular approach, though.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-estelle-combat.jpg?itok=3i5GUBww 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-estelle-combat.jpg?itok=jmK-eThI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter&nbsp;</em>is getting a simultaneous global release.</figcaption></figure><p>Nihon Falcom and GungHo are promising that&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter&nbsp;</em>will serve as a "full 3D remake" of the original game, complete with "brand-new localizations, enhanced visuals, and refined gameplay mechanics".</p>

<p>Although it'll have a fresh coat of paint and more,&nbsp;<em>1st Chapter&nbsp;</em>will still tell the same story as the original game, in which protagonists Estelle and Joshua set out to become Bracers (essentially a sort of peacekeeping force).</p>

<p>Along the way, they're caught up in a wider conspiracy that comes with all the usual JRPG trappings; world-saving drama, twists and turns, and plenty of character moments to get you attached to your party.</p>

<p>You can check out the first major trailer for&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter&nbsp;</em>right here. It should give you a sense of what's changed in the kingdom of Liberl since last you visited (or introduce you to it if this is your first time).</p>




<p><em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter&nbsp;</em>arrives on PC via Steam, as well as PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch, in fall 2025. We don't have a more specific release date than that yet, so stay tuned for more.</p>
