To that end, you will explore ever-shifting magical locations, seek and collect magical components, and try to stay one step ahead of rivals attempting to sabotage you. Those rivals will set traps, call your bluff, and attempt to ruin any strategies you implement. Thankfully, you can utilize your own wits and magical spells to vex them as well.</p><p><em>A Familiar Find</em> is designed for up to four players. Each copy of the game contains a rulebook, over 84 Arcane Cards, 13 Location Cards which contain various game-changing effects, and ten playable familiars complete with their own unique character boards. The first player to either collect a full set of ingredients or three Astral Essence cards is declared the winner.</p><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/critical-role-campaign-4-episode-1-review-fascinating-narrative-frame-glorious" rel="nofollow">Critical Role</a> fans may recognize a few of the playable options.
