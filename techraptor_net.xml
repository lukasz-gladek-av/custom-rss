            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sales analysis firm Circana has released its US gaming industry sales data for June, and it looks like FromSoftware and Bandai Namco can continue their celebrations from last month.</p>

<p>In May, multiplayer spinoff experiment&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/may-gaming-sales-data-elden-ring-nightreign" rel="nofollow">topped the charts</a>, and despite the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">release of the Nintendo Switch 2 in June</a>, it hit the number one spot on the all-format chart for last month as well, according to the ever-reliable <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lun37lnhg22k" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Mat Piscatella</a>.</p>

<p>The Switch 2's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">flagship launch title&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">Mario Kart World</a>&nbsp;</em>didn't manage to scrape second place, either; that honor went to&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em>, a particularly impressive achievement given that Hideo Kojima's latest is only available on PS5.&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart&nbsp;</em>did come in third, though.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/death-stranding-2-us-gaming-sales-data-june.jpg?itok=fl97ed_3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/death-stranding-2-us-gaming-sales-data-june.jpg?itok=o153mxfh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach&nbsp;</em>outsold&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>in June.</figcaption></figure><p>With regards to the year-to-date best-selling chart, no game has yet to unseat&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, which, despite <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">recent negative feedback</a> from players, has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-10m" rel="nofollow">proven a runaway success</a> for developer and publisher Capcom.</p>

<p>Second place still goes to <i>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</i>, and&nbsp;Ubisoft's&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>brings up third, which may come as something of a balm to the studio following its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-creative-houses-q1-financials" rel="nofollow">disappointing Q1 financial results</a>.</p>

<p>In hardware terms, June 2025 set a new record for hardware spending by Circana's reckoning, beating out previous record-holder 2008. Spending hit $978m in June, bolstered by the release of the Switch 2.</p>

<p>The console managed to sell 1.6 million units in June in the US, breaking records for launch month unit sales and shattering the previous record set by Sony's PlayStation 4, which hit 1.1 million units in November 2013.</p>

Standalone digital sales weren't counted as part of Circana's data.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-ios-uk-cma</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite-ios-return-in-uk-uncertain-thanks-to-cma-decisions-epic-says.1250982/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic Games has revealed that it doesn't know whether&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>will be returning to the iOS platform in the UK, following the release of two CMA (Competition &amp; Markets Authority) roadmaps regarding Google and Apple's mobile platforms.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/the-cma-s-roadmap-doesn-t-open-the-mobile-app-ecosystem-to-competition-in-the-uk" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on its website, Epic says that&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s "return to iOS in the UK is now uncertain" thanks to the CMA's decisions, and that it "can't bring the Epic Games Store to iOS in the UK this year (if ever)".</p>

<p>For context, the CMA laid out roadmaps for market status investigations into&nbsp;<a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/687f8ab528f29c99778a7455/Roadmap__Google_.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Google</a> and <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/687f893cf2ecaeb756d0e1e6/Roadmap__Apple_.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Apple</a> respectively today, and in both cases, requiring the two companies to allow developers to point users to other app stores and payment methods falls under measures the authority "will consider from the first half of 2026".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fortnite-uk-ios-uncertain-superman.jpg?itok=y8MSz1g- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fortnite-uk-ios-uncertain-superman.jpg?itok=znU19HRh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fortnite</em>'s UK iOS return is now "uncertain", according to Epic.</figcaption></figure><p>Epic calls this a "missed opportunity to introduce competition into a currently-monopolized market". It's a decision that's contradictory to one <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-apple-500-million-euro-fine" rel="nofollow">recently made by the European Commission</a>, which saw Apple slapped with a&nbsp;€500 million fine and forced to&nbsp;"inform customers, free of charge, of alternative offers outside the App Store".</p>

<p>According to Epic, Apple and Google must be "completely blocked from imposing fees and discriminating against apps using out-of-app payment" if "years of malicious compliance...and no genuine restoration of market competition" are to be avoided.</p>

<p>All of this is to say that if you've been hoping to play&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>on your iPhone or iPad in the UK, then it looks like you're going to have a long while to wait; the earliest you can likely expect to play the game on your device is 2026, but it could take even longer than that.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fortnite-uk-ios-future-uncertain-squid-game.jpg?itok=-iSH76Ef 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fortnite-uk-ios-future-uncertain-squid-game.jpg?itok=LorB1MCg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Epic has some strong words for the UK's CMA today.</figcaption></figure><p>For years now, Epic has been embroiled in legal battles with both Apple and Google over allowing alternate payment systems and storefronts on the two companies' Android and iOS operating systems.</p>

<p>The fight began back in 2020, when Epic <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-slashes-up-to-20-off-purchases-on-all-platforms" rel="nofollow">launched a sale</a>&nbsp;that promised discounts if players used the&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>studio's proprietary payment system.&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>was removed from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-sues-google-over-fortnites-removal-from-play-store" rel="nofollow">Android</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-apple-store-version-removed-for-violating-app-store-guidelines" rel="nofollow">iOS</a> as a result, and Epic sued both companies, kicking off the ongoing legal struggle.</p>

<p>Of course, if you're not in the UK, your iOS&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>prospects might be a bit rosier; in May, the game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-ios-app-store-returns" rel="nofollow">restored to the US App Store</a>, and of course, <em>Fortnite</em> is also available on Android via the Epic Games Store. If you're in the UK, though, you'll just have to wait for more on this.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-update-161</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gran-turismo-7-update-brings-ridiculously-rare-car-and-more.1250979/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and Polyphony Digital have announced a new&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>update, and this one's giving you the chance to drive a ridiculously rare car, plus two other gorgeous vehicles.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://www.gran-turismo.com/gb/news/00_5317833.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo&nbsp;</em>website, update 1.61 will either land today or tomorrow depending on where you are. It's set to arrive tonight at 10pm Pacific, so that's 1am Eastern or 6am GMT tomorrow.</p>

<p>Just like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-update-157" rel="nofollow">previous</a>&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-update-156" rel="nofollow">updates</a>, the game's latest patch will be bringing three cars for you to drive, but there's a special addition in update 1.61 in the form of the '05 NISMO R34 GT-R Z-tune. If you're a rare car aficionado, you'll probably know what that means.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gran-turismo-update-1.61-z-tune.jpg?itok=SjBHE0wW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gran-turismo-update-1.61-z-tune.jpg?itok=BdAsE9FZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Gran Turismo 7</em>'s latest update adds a legendary car.</figcaption></figure><p>The story behind this one is pretty special. You can see a full breakdown in <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/23/gran-turismo-7-update-1-61-available-today/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">this PlayStation Blog post</a>, but essentially, only 19 Z-tunes were made, and they're all constructed from stripped-down used cars with high-spec part replacements.</p>

<p>As well as the Z-tune, you can also expect to drive the '22 Honda N-ONE RS, a kei passenger car with front-wheel drive and a 6-speed manual transmission. It's a light, breezy vehicle with plenty of modern accouterments to keep you happy.</p>

<p>Finally in this update, the '22 Nissan Qashqai Tekna 190 2wd e-Power is a hybrid machine that features a revolutionary (no pun intended) electric-generating engine. The aim was to improve on previous models' emissions, a goal Nissan clearly reckons it's achieved.</p>

<p>You can see these cars in action right here in the&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>Update 1.61 trailer. It's not very long, but it does give a sense of what these beasts are like on the track.</p>




<p><em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>Update 1.61 is due to land today at 10pm Pacific, or tomorrow at 1am Eastern/6am GMT. You can grab&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/gran-turismo-7/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5 and PS4</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft to Reorganize Into "Creative Houses" as Q1 Financials Disappoint]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-creative-houses-q1-financials</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-to-reorganize-into-creative-houses-as-q1-financials-disappoint.1250928/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has revealed that it intends to undergo a major internal restructuring into new units called "Creative Houses", following disappointing first-quarter financial results for the company.</p>

<p>As part of its latest <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/5wMXD5U7aP5imdxB186rmg/d3ffd32ed3c2821d7e89d3c48d0ade35/Ubisoft_FY26_Q1_Sales_EN_vf.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">financial statement</a>, Ubisoft says these "Creative Houses" will help to "enhance quality, focus, autonomy, and accountability" across the company. The new entity Ubisoft <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft--report-new-gaming-entity-core-ip" rel="nofollow">created earlier this year</a> to shepherd its core IP will serve as the first Creative House, but we don't know what the others will be yet.</p>

<p>In terms of financials, Ubisoft reported a 3.9% drop in sales when compared to the previous year, as well as a 2.9% drop in net bookings. The studio blames "a lower-than-expected performance for&nbsp;<em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>", as well as "a partnership that is now expected to materialize in Q2".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rainbow-six-siege-ubisoft-financials-reorganization.jpg?itok=Ac_wXmMA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rainbow-six-siege-ubisoft-financials-reorganization.jpg?itok=lAS_EreS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ubisoft blames&nbsp;<em>Rainbow Six Siege&nbsp;</em>for its poor first-quarter results.</figcaption></figure><p>Despite these underwhelming figures, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot reveals that recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-circana-march-2025-sales" rel="nofollow">tentpole release</a>&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>now has "more than 5 million unique players". Presumably, that translates to sales as well, given that the game isn't available on subscription services.</p>

<p>This performance, Ubisoft says, is "in line with expectations", so while the game hasn't been disappointing, it also hasn't exceeded Ubisoft's predictions. The studio also looks forward to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-release-date-dlc-2" rel="nofollow">release of&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>on Switch 2</a>, which it expects will help the game "reach a broader audience".</p>

<p>It hasn't been the best couple of years for Ubisoft. In May, the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-financials-layoffs-possible" rel="nofollow">released its summary</a> for the preceding fiscal year, which showed that both sales and profits were down compared to the previous year despite the release of&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>.</p>

<p>Prior to that, in December last year, Ubisoft announced it would&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing" rel="nofollow">shut down the live-service shooter&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing" rel="nofollow">XDefiant</a>&nbsp;</em>and close two of its studios, with the French gaming outfit going on to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-layoffs-leamington-closure" rel="nofollow">close another location in January</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutdown-reorganization.jpg?itok=m-k6Xl8D 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutdown-reorganization.jpg?itok=QY_pKjgK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ubisoft shut down its live-service shooter&nbsp;<em>XDefiant&nbsp;</em>in February.</figcaption></figure><p>Aside from the aforementioned Switch 2 release of&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, it must be said that Ubisoft's release slate is looking a little barren for the next few months, so I wouldn't be surprised if the studio registers another drop in the second quarter. We'll have to wait and see what happens.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splitgate-2-beta-layoffs</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/splitgate-2-to-go-back-to-beta-as-layoffs-loom.1250925/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>developer and publisher 1047 Games has announced that the portal-based first-person shooter will be going back into beta, and that several staff members will be losing their jobs as a result.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Splitgate/status/1947717804364353641" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on social media, 1047 acknowledges that&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splitgate-2-1-0-release-date" rel="nofollow">"launched too early"</a>, and that in releasing the game, the studio "bit off more than [it] could chew", making <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splitgate-2-director-refuses-to-apologize-for-make-fps-great-again-hat-then-apologizes-anyway" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">"boneheaded mistakes"</a> along the way.</p>

<p>As a result,&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>will be "going back to beta", 1047 says, which means that "major parts" of the shooter will be rebuilt "to capture the spirit of what made&nbsp;<em>Splitgate&nbsp;</em>special".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/splitgate-2-beta-layoffs-rework.jpg?itok=rQ5j7Fn6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/splitgate-2-beta-layoffs-rework.jpg?itok=TnZ4toCq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>is going back to the beta drawing board, so to speak.</figcaption></figure><p>While in its new beta period,&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2</em>'s progression will be reworked, more portals will be added to its maps, and monetization will be simplified, according to 1047 Games. Not only that, but the studio will be "refocusing on classic game modes" the community has "been asking for".</p>

<p>As part of "rebuilding the core experience" of&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2</em>, which 1047 Games says is not a "quick fix", the studio says it'll be laying off employees to "shift [its] resources to focus" on the rework. 1047 Games doesn't state how many employees will be losing their jobs.</p>

<p>The studio does, however, say that it intends to "retain as many team members as possible", and that as a result of doing so, the servers for the original&nbsp;<em>Splitgate&nbsp;</em>will be shut down next month. As a reminder, updates for that game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splitgate-updates-ending-as-1047-focuses-on-new-project" rel="nofollow">ended back in September 2022</a>.</p>

<p>If you're an avid&nbsp;<em>Splitgate&nbsp;</em>player, however, you'll be pleased to know 1047 says it's "exploring the possibility of supporting offline or peer-to-peer matches", so while nothing has been decided yet, it's not necessarily over for&nbsp;<em>Splitgate</em>.</p>




<p>Despite dropping back into beta,&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>isn't going away; it'll still be available to play, and Chapter 3 will be released as planned. However, it sounds like more big updates won't be released until&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>is ready for release (again).</p>
