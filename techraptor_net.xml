            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crowbar-collective-rogue-point<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Black Mesa&nbsp;</em>developer Crowbar Collective has announced&nbsp;<em>Rogue Point</em>, a co-operative multiplayer roguelite shooter that the studio says will offer "hundreds of ways to play". It'll be published by British veteran studio Team17.</p>

<p>According to a press release,&nbsp;<em>Rogue Point&nbsp;</em>takes place in a world where the mysteriously-named "CEO", the richest man in the game's world, has died. Using an app called MERX, corporations are attempting to carve up his empire by hiring mercenary teams to fight one another.</p>

<p>Contrary to what you might believe, it doesn't seem like you're playing as one of these armies. Rather, you'll play as members of the titular Rogue Point, an "elite, independent vigilante squad" aiming to put an end to MERX and save the day.</p>

<p>As you play, you'll unlock gameplay modifiers and gear that will help you create "loadouts specific to the needs of the mission", and you'll also come up against MERX classes which will "challenge you in new and surprising ways".</p>

<p>The two studios are also talking up what they call the "Parametric Design System", which they say contributes to "new strategies and challenges with every play" across four "diverse" locations.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Rogue Point</em>, which shows off some of the tactical gameplay you can expect from the co-op shooter, right here.</p>




<p><em>Rogue Point&nbsp;</em>will serve as developer Crowbar Collective's second game, following on from&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/black-mesa" rel="nofollow"><em>Half-Life&nbsp;</em>remake&nbsp;<em>Black Mesa</em></a>, which was finally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-mesa-release-date-finally-set-for-march-2020" rel="nofollow">released back in 2020</a> after enjoying a rather <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-mesa-finally-adds-xen-levels-roadmap-to-10" rel="nofollow">protracted development cycle</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, unlike&nbsp;<em>Black Mesa</em>,&nbsp;<em>Rogue Point&nbsp;</em>isn't a remake, so it'll be interesting to see how Crowbar Collective handles its first original IP. There's no release date yet, but&nbsp;<em>Rogue Point&nbsp;</em>is set to arrive on PC via Steam when it does launch.</p>
