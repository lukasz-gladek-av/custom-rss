            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/spine-preview-gun-fu-more-like-fun-fu</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/spine-preview-gun-fu-more-like-fun-fu.1216521/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/spine-preview-gun-fu-more-like-fun-fu<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Spine&nbsp;</em>is a gun fu-style action game developed by Nekki, known for the <em>Shadow Fight</em>&nbsp;series. Nekki, a team composed of animation fans, wanted to push its games to the next level by going hard on animations. Deeply inspired by creators like John Woo and films such as&nbsp;<em>John Wick, Spine</em>&nbsp;is an exhilarating one-stop shop for all things action.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We were able to get some hands-on time with&nbsp;<em>Spine&nbsp;</em>during Summer Game Fest 2025. With a developer sitting by my side during the duration, I learned&nbsp;enough about&nbsp;<em>Spine&nbsp;</em>to have me eagerly anticipating its eventual release.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>A Strong Backbone&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Described as a "rollercoaster of gun-fu,"&nbsp;<em>Spine</em>&nbsp;is an adrenaline junky's dream. While much of its inspiration comes from the aforementioned film and filmmakers, the gameplay takes notes from the highly coveted&nbsp;<em>Batman: Arkham</em>&nbsp;series.</p>

<p>Nekki is succeeding creating fluid combat that made&nbsp;<em>Batman: Arkham</em>&nbsp;such a hit. Non-stop, weighty but smooth fighting against seemingly insurmountable odds.&nbsp;<em>Spine</em>'s badass heroine takes on dozens of armed thugs without flinching, fulfilling the power fantasy that lingers in all of us.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The demo essentially guides us through a series of enemy encounters. In a tense cutscene taking place within a bar, shit goes down and heroine Redline jumps into the fray. Armed thugs try to surround her, but her reflexes are superhuman with her "Spine" implant. Like&nbsp;<em>Batman: Arkham</em>, there's a notification when you're about to get hit, giving you time to act.</p>



<p>Though,&nbsp;<em>Spine</em>&nbsp;is very proactive in combat rather than reactive. Instead of waiting for the enemy, you need to jump in and take them out. Beat them up enough and you can do a cinematic finisher involving your gun and/or fists. In many of these brutal executions, she takes these goons out with a close-ranged shot to the head.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In combat, you're also able to use your pistol on enemies no matter the range.&nbsp;<em>Spine</em>&nbsp;does ask you to suspend your disbelief a bit -- pistols don't seem to do as much damage as your punches -- but it's fun to string a few shots together while beating down on enemies.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Locked and Loaded</h2>

<p>During one sequence in the demo, the camera perspective changes from typical third-person POV to overhead. Fans of&nbsp;<em>John Wick 4</em>&nbsp;will immediately see the similarities, and it's just an exhilarating sequence as the music ramps up and you utilize a powerful shotgun against your foes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is but one instance where developer Nekki hopes to surprise players by introducing new spectacles. A scene where you control Redline from the perspective of CCTV footage was teased, which sounds like another exciting scene.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Previously I mentioned shotgun, so know that there isn't just a pistol --&nbsp; there are other weapons too.&nbsp;<em>Spine</em>&nbsp;will feature four main styles of gun fu, so depending on your weapon, your moveset changes a bit. Though, in the case of the shotgun, its ammo is limited. The pistol, however, seems to remain with you when you run out of shotgun (or other weapon types') ammo.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Though it doesn't seem like a requirement to do well in combat,&nbsp;<em>Spine&nbsp;</em>also features a parry system. You can parry regular, non-projectile attacks, but for some enemies with guns, you can also counter those. In some instances, you're able to chain together these parries and take out multiple foes in quick succession, which is immensely satisfying.</p>



<h2><em>Spine&nbsp;</em>Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Our demo ends with a boss battle against a spindly agent with night vision goggles akin to spider eyes. The spider theme is fitting here, as while we dodge the boss's sword attacks, spider mines start coming out, which is another element to dodge around and avoid.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's a tough fight, but one Redline is more than equipped to deal with. It's a satisfying conclusion to the relatively quick demo. There isn't a single dull moment in&nbsp;<em>Spine</em>, and I hope the rest of the game is just the same way. The developer is aiming for around 10 hours of play, which sounds like the perfect length for a bombastic game such as this.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizkids-announces-official-dungeons-dragons-potato-head-beholder-miniature-coming-to<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizkids has announced an official <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> Potato Head Beholder miniature. After creating a Potato Head toy based on the iconic monster, the studio is producing a miniature version for gaming tables and selling it exclusively at the Origins Game Fair.</p>



<p>According to an official press release, there will be two versions of the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Potato Head Beholder miniature. The first of these miniatures is an event-exclusive version for those attending Origins Game Fair this year. Origins Game Fair is one of the oldest tabletop conventions in the industry, and it is hosted by one of the biggest tabletop associations, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/gama-expo-will-be-moving-to-baltimore-in-future" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GAMA</a>.</p>

It's a miniature of a Beholder, one of the scariest monsters in the world's most popular TTRPG, reimagined in a fun, more starchy form. Much like the Potato Head toyline, the miniature even includes attachable accessories to make the monster your own.</p>

<p>There's even an air of hilarity with this version of the miniature sporting a wizard's hat. Beholders in the world of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> are terrifying creatures. They are highly intelligent, incredibly vain, and can cast a deadly arsenal of rays from their eye stalks. But the one thing they cannot do, no matter what, is cast magic. Just don't say that to one unless you want to end up a pile of ash.</p>

This version is a more conventional take on the Potato Head monster concept. It includes the more iconic Potato Head accessories like the top hat, moustache, and giant glasses. It also has a set of scary teeth if your DM wants to make it especially mean.</p>

<p>The retail version of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons Potato Head Beholder miniature is available for pre-order now.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/grave-seasons-preview-a-farming-sim-with-killer-vibes.1216458/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/grave-seasons-preview-farming-sim-with-killer-vibes<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>No matter the season, a farming sim is sure to provide some good fun. Though, if I were to play&nbsp;<em>Grave Seasons</em>, October might just be the time to do it. Innocuous at first glance,&nbsp;<em>Grave Seasons</em>&nbsp;has something sinister lurking just below the surface.</p>

<p>At Summer Game Fest 2025, we had the chance to check out&nbsp;<em>Grave Seasons</em>, an upcoming farming sim game from developer Perfect Garbage and publisher Blumhouse Games. If you know what kind of genre Blumhouse is known for, you might see where this one is going.</p>



<h2>Farming in Unfamiliar Territory</h2>

<p>My demo with&nbsp;<em>Grave Seasons&nbsp;</em>starts out simple enough. You've just become the owner of a farm; really, this is the start of your new life in a strange town, filled with individuals you don't yet know. As soon as you leave the farmhouse, you're met with a burly man named Hari who introduces himself.</p>

<p>He's a little strange and has some large scars on his body, but I don't judge. Supposedly, he's a farmer as well. The previous owner of the farm is someone he knew, but no one seems to know what happened to them. Either way, Hari lets us be and we get a lay of the land.</p>



<p>Our new farm is quite large and already has a bunch of crops growing. There are various sheds and other farming-related equipment in various states of disrepair, so one can assume that, as time goes on, you'll be able to renovate and utilize these. The main purpose of the farm, at least on a surface level, is to make money.</p>

<p>And so, my first day was spent getting familiar with the surrounding lands and doing a bit of cleanup. If you're familiar with games such as&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>Harvest Moon</em>, it's a game that should click with you pretty quickly.</p>

<p>You have a handy radial menu to utilize various tools like a watering can, axe, and others, so switching equipment is super simple. I went around and harvested whatever crops were already growing, and even found a few seeds to plant. It ain't much, but it's honest work. And I'm going to just ignore the fact that I dug up a severed hand.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>A Dark Turn</h2>

<p>A bit later on in the day, another neighbor introduces themselves. This is Pilar, and she has an interesting sense of fashion, but seems friendly enough. She invites me to scrounge around in the forest later that evening, so I make a mental note and continue on until it's time.</p>

<p>After mulling around for a bit, doing more cleanup and cutting down some trees, I arrive at the forest at around 10 p.m., only for our reunion to be cut short by a sight of absolute horror. From the dark shadows of the forest come a beast with vivid white fangs and eyes.</p>

<p>It absolutely tears Pilar apart, spreading a trail of carnage in its wake. Blood and guts are everywhere. The once charming pixel art turns into something shockingly gory. The beast, though it's gone, left plenty of evidence in its wake. We need to investigate what happened, because Pilar just got eviscerated before our very eyes.</p>



<p>Clearly, the town in&nbsp;<em>Grave Seasons</em>&nbsp;holds dark secrets. There's a killer about, and some supernatural seems to be at play. That's the big twist in&nbsp;<em>Grave Seasons</em>: There's a killer that you need to catch. On top of farming, you're investigating the killer in an effort to save the town.</p>

<p>Presumably save the town, anyways, as there's a large emphasis on narrative choice. Pilar, who died? She was predetermined to die in our demo, but in a normal playthrough, I'm told you can prevent her murder. Who lives and who dies is determined by the player's actions, meaning there's a great degree of narrative variance. Heck, you can also romance the murderer.</p>

<p>The killer also changes from playthrough to playthrough, so you can never be too sure who to trust.&nbsp;<em>Grave Seasons</em>&nbsp;seems to be a game that encourages multiple runs, then, as I'm certainly keen on seeing why certain killers are motivated to do what they do.</p>



<h2><em>Grave Seasons</em> Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>I'm also told that breaking and entering into villager's homes plays a big part in&nbsp;<em>Grave Seasons</em>. Unlike, say,&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley</em>&nbsp;where you can mosey on into a home,&nbsp;<em>Grave Seasons</em>' villagers have secrets to hide.</p>

<p>Gaining clues from their homes will help you pin down the killer and, apparently, the interiors of houses can change season by season. Your curiosity might be a little dangerous, but who can resist?</p>

<p><em>Grave Seasons</em>&nbsp;seems like a breath of fresh air for the farming sim genre. Turning a normally "chill" type of game into something a bit more complex has me intrigued, and I'm dying to see the true breadth of&nbsp;<em>Grave Seasons</em>' narrative. We'll find out when it launches at some point in the future!</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/AkihiroHino/status/1933052974169010308" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X (for which we're using machine translation), Level-5 CEO Akihiko Hino says the game has reached a million copies sold. That figure counts across all platforms, and it accounts for physical and digital sales as well.</p>

<p>The sales figure will doubtless be exciting for Level-5; earlier this month, the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-sales-800k" rel="nofollow">said</a>&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</em>sales "might even hit a million copies by the end of June", and the game has reached that milestone with time to spare.</p>

Updates for Nintendo's platforms and for all other platforms are slightly different, frustratingly enough.</p>

<p>In version 1.3.1 for PC and non-Nintendo consoles, new features include an adjusted lock-on that allows you to automatically select targets, as well as an expansion for the camera's range in certain areas, allowing you to see further into the distance.</p>

<p>Other changes include the ability to listen to Life Songs whenever you like, as well as changes to farming actions and more. You can read the <a href="https://www.fantasylife.jp/fli/en/patchnote/ver_1_3_1/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">full patch notes here</a>.</p>

<p>When it comes to the Switch versions of the update, some things are the same, but features like the aforementioned camera range expansion and the ability to listen to Life Songs again will instead arrive as part of version 1.4.0 at some point in the future.</p>




<p><em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em>is available now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2993780/FANTASY_LIFE_i_The_Girl_Who_Steals_Time/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time/9pp7tdrdzghd" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and both <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/FANTASY-LIFE-i-The-Girl-Who-Steals-Time-2339978.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> and Switch 2.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/interview-with-ndreams-and-shuhei-yoshida-about-reach-vr-and-what-indies-can-do-to<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of my big personal blind spots in gaming is VR. With new titles always on the horizon like nDreams' Action-Adventure title <em>Reach </em>always coming out I see continued evidence or rapid development, features to allow for more comfortable gameplay, and experiences that you just wouldn't be able to replicate on a 2D screen.</p>

<p>At this years' Summer Game Fest I not only got to play through a demo of the first level of <em>Reach</em>, but then got to talk with the development team and Shuhei Yoshida, their games' ambassador, about creating <em>Reach </em>as an experience for all to enjoy, how Yoshida became involved, how VR titles all lift each other up, and how the indie VR scene is a good place to be.</p>

<h2>Experiencing <em>Reach </em>Firsthand</h2>

<p>As my appointment began, I got strapped into the Quest 3 headset that was connected to a nearby computer. Having been asked if I'd worn a VR headset before, luckily, I was able to reference my early VR experience with a DK2 and original Vive, as well as my experience playing <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d21d65a5-4b5d-4746-8132-7a248cc992b2" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/deadpool-vr-pushes-vr-automotion-while-creating-fun-and-frantic-experience" rel="nofollow"><em>Deadpool VR</em></a> just the day earlier.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/reach-sgf-2025-opening-door.jpg?itok=BoRCMC4V 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/reach-sgf-2025-opening-door.jpg?itok=5Om32LCC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>From the getgo of the demo, I was impressed, after receiving options to play standing or sitting down I appeared at a terminal with a wide variety of visual and locomotion options. Did you want a quick pivot when turning, or a smooth glide? Would you like added effects over your view to help with motion sickness? Etc</p>

<p>Incredible care had gone into making sure no matter how new or old you were to VR there was a way to make the experience most comfortable to you, something we discussed further after the demo.</p>

<p>Once I was through the settings screen and into the game, I hit the ground with a running start. Starting in a warehouse, <em>Reach </em>began by teaching me the basics of movement, navigating between boxes, and climbing, at first with ladders before progressing to boxes and rivets, before I graduated to bricks jutting out of walls.</p>

<p>Something that was incredible during my experience was just how intuitive everything was. At first I was noticing the obvious 'climb up this' style objects, but it wasn't long that I was clambering all over the place for fun, then on a whim I tried to fling myself up with both hands… and it worked.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/reach-sgf-2025-climbing.jpg?itok=qKjRMlXR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/reach-sgf-2025-climbing.jpg?itok=jptPcbwY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The mobility is Reach is going to make it very interesting to watch (or attempt) speedruns</figcaption></figure><h2>VR That Makes You Want To Push Yourself</h2>

<p>Every time I thought to myself 'this is probably possible', I would attempt it and it would work. Whether it was the movement, interacting with random world objects, or creeping around corners to get the drop on guards everything was as I might expect from a gamified version of the real world. Honestly, the only thing holding me back from going full Star Wars kid in there was the fear of punching the TV I was positioned next to, or a nearby developer.</p>

<p>After locomotion was locked down I got to experience combat. The first item you obtain is a magical bow that crackles with energy as you draw back the string. Doing some experimentation, I found out arrows embed themselves in certain rock walls (that I assume you encounter more of in the full game), trying to pull the arrows out I instead learned that I could climb on them.</p>

<p>Firearms are also present in <em>Reach</em>, but nDreams developers liken it more to the firearms of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="101b22f0-d591-4997-8ea7-836f16709d24" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/mirrors-edge-catalyst-review-conflicting-ideas" rel="nofollow">Mirror's Edge</a>, they're a bit of a power up but very limited in their use so don't get too used to them.</p>

<p>The demo ended with a long chase sequence that had me dodging falling buildings amid explosions, flinging myself around obstacles, and leaping across massive gaps before sliding into a large blue crash pad.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/reach-sgf-2025-bow.jpg?itok=Lxxv7lTI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/reach-sgf-2025-bow.jpg?itok=geIMg38w 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2><em>Reach </em>Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Coming out of <em>Reach</em>, I had a blast playing, could immediately see the potential in the movement and combat, and watching the trailer for the full game and what it incorporated, I just wanted to hop right back in.</p>

<p>An Action-Adventure in PC/PS5 powered VR was fun, smooth, and functioned just as I'd expect a video game world to perform.</p>

<p>This is definitely going to be a reason for me to borrow, if not purchase a VR headset to be able to get the full experience.</p>

<h2>Yoshida Has Watched <em>Reach </em>From The Start</h2>

<p>Having completed my demo, standing around and talking with the developers at nDream and Shuhei Yoshida, I was interested to learn how he'd come on as an ambassador for the project.</p>

<p>Yoshida began by explaining that Synapse, nDream's 2023 VR title, was one of his favorite VR games. When the team began working on <em>Reach </em>three years ago, he had already seen samples of it while working as the Head of PlayStation Indies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"If [Yoshida] is excited then we know we're onto something"</p>

<p>When he retired, nDreams reached out to him to see if they'd be interested in continuing to work together and he agreed.</p>

He explained to me that he knew when trying out the movement that it was going to be something that people enjoyed. "It was clear they're trying to do what no one has done before, I really want them to be successful."</p>

<p>With a history of working with a variety of indie developers, and with the indie scene becoming more and more competitive as the number of games that release on digital platforms like Steam continue to ballon year after year I asked what indie developers could do to increase discoverability in a competitive scene.</p>

<p>Keeping the conversation close to <em>Reach </em>Yoshida highlighted that "for VR, unides are a huge part of the scene. nDreams started working on<em> The Assembly</em> on Oculus Rift and that for people who really want to make VR games, it's a passion."</p>

<p>Referencing popular VR titles and developers like <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3eee44f9-cebd-4ac0-9341-842a86cd69d4" href="https://techraptor.net/games/superhot-vr" rel="nofollow"><em>Super Hot</em></a> and Owlchemy Labs, Yoshida highlighted that "each of these games generated so much noise and experience." He also pointed out that as VR headsets increase in power and fidelity that "in the indie space, if you're passionate about VR there's less competition."</p>

<p>At that time nDreams developers lent their voice to the discussion explaining how "when a great game comes out it helps everyone out." explaining how things like locomotion controls improving over the years from the simple teleport to full action is a direct response to VR developers trying out other game's movements and taking what works to uplift them all.</p>

<p>Returning to watching the <em>Reach </em>trailer at the booth, I asked how long a player might expect the experience to take. I was told that it would be a "double-digit campaign," referencing how there's a linear story, but for those who want to challenge themselves with advanced platforming or combat, there will be all kinds of alternate paths.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Will be a double digit hour campaign [...] completionists could be several more hours"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the story segment I played I got a light tease of the story, learning that after establishing yourself as a well known stunt actress there would be an event that would cause multiple realities to merge. From there you get the strange mix of ancient and modern day architecture that you can see in the trailer.</p>

<p>Not much else was spoiled about the story, but they would be focusing on revealing more about it this Summer ahead of it's launch later this year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/alters-review-narrative-driven-survival<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ac4be3c6-fcbb-4f7e-b561-de64225371b0" href="https://techraptor.net/games/alters" rel="nofollow"><em>The Alters</em></a>&nbsp;is a story driven, survival game where the main character, Jan Dolski, is stranded on an unhospitable planet alone during Project Dolly. Looking for a way to survive, he ends up using the ship's quantum computer to produce alternate versions of himself. These Alters are clones, yet not quite. They made a different decision that led them down a completely new life path from Jan, gaining the skills he needs in the harsh environment.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><em>The Alters</em>&nbsp;Review | Surviving in Space</h2>

<p>Taking a look at the survival aspect of&nbsp;<em>The Alters</em>, you have to mine resources from the planet either by hand or using a mining station. These mining stations, the main resource collectors, are connected by pylons to your moving base and unlock fast travel points around the map. The other resources are grown, crafted, or refined in the base itself. Once you have Alters, you'll assign them to specific rooms, referred to as modules, and give them tasks to complete. When finished, they'll ask to jump to another location that has something queued.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-alters-mobile-base-management.jpg?itok=G1vhTwae 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-alters-mobile-base-management.jpg?itok=p1NMyTCn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>The Alters</em> is much closer to a colony or resource management game than a full-blown survival title. You can mine resources, refine ores, and grow food, but that's about it. There are items to craft, but most of them just improve your ability to explore the different areas the base stops at, as well as the efficiency of your resources. You can automate most of these processes and be completely hands-off on resource gathering by the endgame and even the midgame, depending on how you unlock research.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These are fairly basic mechanics when it comes to surviving. There are three different mining stations, only five resources to mine, and one resource to grow. You'll get reminders when levels of certain things, like storage or food, are low, but you can typically restock your reserves quickly. Throughout my initial playthrough, I never felt like I was in danger of losing due to a lack of resources. The typical pressure of a survival game just wasn't present for me as I played.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-alters-mining-organics-outpost.jpg?itok=2-mWZWLt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-alters-mining-organics-outpost.jpg?itok=G_W7FGK6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>On top of the basic mechanics, you only have a certain number of days in each location. Changing locations isn't voluntary, but forced. If you stay until Sunrise, everyone is charred to a crisp, and the game ends.&nbsp;The moving base can be continuously changed, expanded multiple times, and have new modules added, but you cannot make any exterior location your permanent home.</p>

<p>Additionally, there is a definitive end to the title.&nbsp;This is quite different than the majority of games in the survival genre. While the story will have an ending, you're able to keep exploring, building your base, and crafting new items. That isn't the case in&nbsp;<em>The Alters</em>. When the story ends, so does the game.</p>

<p>You can go back an infinite number of times to replay days, change your dialogue choices, or use different Alters, but the game will always end. Being able to redo days increases the replayability. It's also necessary to do at least a second playthrough to select different Alters to create or pick a different major decision. This will reveal new endings, new lessons, and new cutscenes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even with the replayability aspect, there's only a certain number of times you can adventure with Jan and his Alters before exhausting all new content. A definitive end, combined with limited time in each region, cuts down on the investment I have in the game. If there were more areas where you could farm without having to move locations, that would vastly increase my interest in&nbsp;<em>The Alters</em>&nbsp;as a survival title. At this moment, I view it as a well-written complex narrative adventure that merely uses the basics of survival to move the story along when there's no dialogue to delve into.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Morality and Ethics in&nbsp;<em>The Alters</em></h2>

<p>Where&nbsp;<em>The Alters</em>&nbsp;really shines is in the way it presents morality in life-threatening survival situations. The narrative journey you experience is well written, emotionally evocative, and showcases the consequences of difficult choices, especially when both options are less than ideal. I wasn't ready for all the thinking I ended up doing. It compelled me to think over the different aspects of surviving, how those decisions could effect the crew, and what I was willing to do as the leader to ensure survival for as many people as possible.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-alters-technician-birth-womb.jpg?itok=UHZKjSHd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-alters-technician-birth-womb.jpg?itok=7EOBysxA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The story is incredibly profound, but it's not laid on you all at once. It's crafted in a way that you build up to the moral dilemmas. The story has joy and fun woven with the larger complexities, so it doesn't end up bogged down by the choices you face. The complexity of the situation and the drama that accompany it are balanced with breaks to play beer pong or watch movies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Morality is an angle not often explored in the survival genre. In games that I've played, you kill anyone who stands in your way, take resources no matter what, and do whatever it takes to stay alive. Having a character take the time to cognizantly mull over the potential consequences of his actions is a really unique take on the genre.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This struggle over the morality of key decisions to ensure survival is what sets&nbsp;<em>The Alters</em>&nbsp;apart from other titles. The narrative is the best part of the game, hands down. It is what you'll recall when thinking about the title and what will draw you back to playing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While most of the game works extremely well, there are some aspects that detract from the experience. Being unable to skip certain cutscenes or dialogues is one of the design choices I don't personally agree with. Even though the scene in question is a key one, it doesn't dramatically change when going through a second playthrough or replaying the day. Having to sit through it can be frustrating, especially if you're rewatching it multiple times back to back.</p>

<p>Acts 1 and 2 were relatively bug-free, with the major issue involving Jan getting stuck on terrain elements. The frequency of this increased in Act 3, along with issues seeing Interal Veins. The veins were missing or the core was missing in multiple instances of the mechanic. This also affected the Interal animations added to other locations outside of the veins. I ended up wandering around and almost blacking out from Radiation due to not being able to find the core.&nbsp;</p>

Sometimes they rolled into the environment, or became stuck between items that made them inaccessible.&nbsp;Though these were relatively small in number of occurrences, they still negatively impacted gameplay.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><em>The Alters&nbsp;</em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><em>The Alters</em>&nbsp;is a solid narrative entry wrapped in basic survival mechanics. The focus of the game, and the highlighting feature, is the storyline. It has some replayability, but comes with a definitive ending and some restrictive base building that brings it closer to a colony management title than a true survival game. A single playthrough can take anywhere between 12-30 hours, depending on how often you redo days. If you're like me and played until the end without going back in time, you can finish the game in a single weekend.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With few bugs to get in the way of your experience,&nbsp;<em>The Alters</em>&nbsp;is a well executed meshing of survival and story. Though the forced base movement and definitive ending make it less of a survival game, the narrative makes up for those shortcomings.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sag-aftra-video-game-strike-suspended<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Media union SAG-AFTRA has announced that it's suspending its video game-focused strike after almost a year thanks to a "tentative agreement" being reached with signatories of the union's Interactive Media Agreement (IMA).</p>

<p>Suspension of the strike comes just a few days after SAG-AFTRA <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-and-video-game-employers-reach-tentative-agreement-interactive-media-contract-national" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">revealed</a> said "tentative agreement". In a new <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-video-game-strike-suspended-noon-pt-today" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, SAG-AFTRA says its members should "return to work on productions under the IMA, including work promoting or publicizing projects produced under the IMA".</p>

<p>It's worth noting that the "tentative agreement" reached today hasn't been finalized yet. The union says it intends to "meet in special session" later today in order to consider the agreement, so it hasn't yet been approved.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sag-aftra-gaming-strike-suspended-picket-line.jpg?itok=sANpqXj9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sag-aftra-gaming-strike-suspended-picket-line.jpg?itok=lJYZDLtk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The SAG-AFTRA strike began last year when negotiations over the Interactive Media Agreement broke down.</figcaption></figure><p>SAG-AFTRA members <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sag-aftra-members-who-work-on-video-games-to-begin-strike-at-midnight" rel="nofollow">elected to strike in July last year</a>, after over eighteen months of negotiation between the union and the companies who signed the Interactive Media Agreement failed to produce a satisfactory deal.</p>

<p>Companies included in the agreement include Activision, Insomniac Games, and EA, and SAG-AFTRA's original statement on the commencement of the strike claims that these employers refused to "plainly affirm, in clear and enforceable language" that actors would be protected from AI-related abuse of their work or image.</p>

<p>We don't yet know what the new "tentative agreement" contains, but I think it's safe to assume the companies have given at least some ground when it comes to AI, since this was referred to as the "sticking point" by SAG-AFTRA last July.</p>

<p>The union will release details of the agreement on its approval, and at that time, the agreement will also be "sent out for ratification by the union's membership in accordance with established policy".</p>

<p>Companies like&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>publisher <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-generative-ai-characters-pubg-inzoi" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Krafton</a>, as well as industry giants&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-partners-with-generative-ai-company-to-enable-dynamically-generated-stories-quests" rel="nofollow">Microsoft</a>&nbsp;and the aforementioned <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-hopes-to-use-generative-ai-to-drive-more-monetization-and-make-development-30-more" rel="nofollow">EA</a>, have expressed enthusiasm about generative AI, despite lingering issues regarding <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jun/11/disney-universal-ai-lawsuit" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">copyright infringement</a> and <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2025/explained-generative-ai-environmental-impact-0117" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">environmental impact</a>.</p>

<p>In particular, though, SAG-AFTRA's concerns appear to revolve around the use of actors' likenesses, whether that be appearance or voice, to "hire" them without actually paying them, as well as other potential AI abuses of their work.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see whether the new agreement contains satisfactory protections for union members. Stay tuned for more on this.</p>
