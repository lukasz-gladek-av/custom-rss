            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-transmission-announced-silent-hill-f<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Konami has announced a brand new&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>Transmission showcase for this week, and it sounds like the show will focus pretty much exclusively on the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f</em>.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/SilentHill/status/1899218771375481118" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Konami reveals that the stream will air on March 13th at 3pm Pacific, which is around 6pm Eastern and about 10pm GMT. It's going to be a fairly late one if you're in the UK or Europe.</p>

<p>According to the post, the stream will "uncover&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f</em>", so presumably, we'll get a full reveal for the game. I'm not sure you should hold your breath for a release date, but at the very least we should get a full story reveal and perhaps some gameplay as well.</p>

<p>The trailer featured some pretty creepy imagery, including a Japanese-style doll and a girl covered in some kind of strange floral growth, but it's not clear yet how those things will fit into&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f</em>'s story.</p>

<p>In the interim, however, Konami didn't forget about&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill</em>; the&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake was released late last year, going on to sell <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">over two million copies</a> at last count. It seems the game performed well enough to prompt Konami to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloober-team-konami-new-game-ip" rel="nofollow">work with Bloober on another game</a> based on one of the publisher's IPs, too.</p>

<p>You can rewatch the&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f&nbsp;</em>teaser trailer (or perhaps even watch it for the first time, if you missed it back in 2022) right here.</p>




<p>The next&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>Transmission will air on March 13th (that's this Thursday!) at 3pm Pacific. It's worth noting that Konami hasn't ruled out other franchise news, so we could well learn more about what's in store for&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>on Thursday as well.</p>
