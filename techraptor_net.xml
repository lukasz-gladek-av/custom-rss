            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-update-boss-rush<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GameScience has announced a brand new&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>update, and it's introducing a boss rush mode into the game, as well as a new Journeyer's Chart feature and more.</p>

<p>Two different challenge modes have been introduced in this update: Return of Rivals and Gauntlet of Legends. The former allows you to take on previously-fought bosses in single combat and features "three levels of difficulty", but if you haven't fought that boss in the main game, you won't be able to take it on here.</p>

<p>Gauntlet of Legends, meanwhile, is a boss rush mode in which you can fight "multiple opponents in succession" with different modifiers to make things more interesting. Some bosses will also sport new moves, so you'll need to be on your guard.</p>

<p>As well as these new combat challenges, the latest&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>update is also adding a Journeyer's Chart feature to the game, which allows you to chart areas "for guidance and marking". You'll need to reach the Black Wind Mountain area and meet the Keeper to unlock this feature.</p>

<p>To celebrate the Chinese New Year (early, of course), GameScience has also gifted all&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>players with a special set of armor, which you can redeem through the Trailblazer's Gift feature at Keeper's Shrines.</p>

<p>You can read the full list of changes in this update <a href="https://www.heishenhua.com/news/detail?id=149" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>. It's been released on the Epic Games Store first, and other platforms will follow "gradually".</p>




<p><em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>is a Soulslike action RPG developed by Chinese studio GameScience. It follows the Destined One, a simian warrior who seeks to follow in the footsteps of the great fallen trickster king Sun Wukong.</p>

<p>The game was hugely popular upon its release back in August, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-24-hour-player-count" rel="nofollow">topping the Steam charts</a> within a handful of hours and reaching 18 million sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-expansion-sales-18m" rel="nofollow">within two weeks</a>.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2358720/Black_Myth_Wukong/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/black-myth-wukong/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>.
