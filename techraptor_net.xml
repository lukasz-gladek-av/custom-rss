            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shotgun-cop-man-my-friend-pedro-creator<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Devolver Digital (because of course) and developer DeadToast Entertainment have announced&nbsp;<em>Shotgun Cop Man</em>, the studio's next freewheeling shooter after its debut title&nbsp;<em>My Friend Pedro</em>.</p>

<p>Described by the two studios as a "devilishly fun ballistic platformer",&nbsp;<em>Shotgun Cop Man&nbsp;</em>sees the titular shotgun cop man descending into the depths of hell in order to arrest Satan. Yes, you read that right.</p>

<p>If you've played&nbsp;<em>My Friend Pedro</em>, then you can probably guess that this game likely won't be too heavy on the story. After all, in&nbsp;<em>Shotgun Cop Man</em>'s debut trailer, our hero yells at Satan to freeze, upon which he says "fuck you, Shotgun Cop Man" and flees. It's that sort of soiree.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shotgun-cop-man-gameplay.jpg?itok=xw9FIaSV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shotgun-cop-man-gameplay.jpg?itok=ga44pLn8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Shotgun Cop Man&nbsp;</em>eschews&nbsp;<em>My Friend Pedro</em>'s 2.5D look for a pure 2D aesthetic.</figcaption></figure><p>Gameplay-wise,&nbsp;<em>Shotgun Cop Man&nbsp;</em>promises to continue&nbsp;<em>My Friend Pedro</em>'s frenetic dual-wielding shooter gameplay, albeit with a much more pleasing to the eye (for me, at least) 2D visual style.</p>

<p>You'll go in armed with Shotgun Cop Man's signature boomstick and pistol, but you'll also be able to acquire other weapons on-site. You won't just be using the guns to shoot bad guys, either; you'll also be using them to traverse the world, propelling yourself through hell by the power of bullets.</p>

<p>Devolver and DeadToast are promising a "hand-crafted campaign" to enjoy, as well as extra No Damage and Speedrun modes if you really want to test your skills against the hordes of hell.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Shotgun Cop Man&nbsp;</em>right here.</p>




<p>As well as the aforementioned modes,&nbsp;<em>Shotgun Cop Man&nbsp;</em>will also let you create your own levels, and others can play them for "endless replayability". After all, Shotgun Cop Man is going to need a pretty convincing excuse to hang around hell after Satan has been arrested.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Shotgun Cop Man&nbsp;</em>on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2966850/Shotgun_Cop_Man/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and Switch when it launches later this year, and a PC demo is available to try out right now.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-blitz-crackdown</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-rivals-cracks-down-on-blitz-tool-but-promises-amnesty-for-users.1115559/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-blitz-crackdown<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>developer NetEase has announced a crackdown on popular third-party app Blitz, which players have been using to track damage statistics, ban certain heroes, and more.</p>

<p>In a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2767030/view/509572974349647985" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, NetEase says that Blitz "injects itself" into the game's process, allowing users to view "confidential information like damage and healing statistics". Not only that, but the tool also allows players to predict enemy ultimate cooldowns and "selectively ban heroes", which NetEase says "severely undermin[es]" fairness.</p>

<p>As such, NetEase says it's officially deemed Blitz to be "cheating software", and so using it in the game is no longer allowed. If you've got Blitz installed and you're using it for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>, it's probably best to uninstall it, and if you aren't using it yet, I wouldn't recommend starting.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-rivals-blitz-crackdown-magik-black-panther.jpg?itok=vFZbDV8M 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-rivals-blitz-crackdown-magik-black-panther.jpg?itok=sMYnfYxc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Using Blitz in&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>is now tantamount to cheating, NetEase says.</figcaption></figure><p>However, if you have used the tool in the past, NetEase says that you "will not face any penalties, as long as you refrain from using it in future games".</p>

<p>The developer closes by imploring players not to use any third-party plugins in order to "uphold justice in our gaming universe and protect the integrity of your account", so it sounds like you'll face a ban if you are caught using Blitz.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with Blitz, it's a tool that provides overlays for multiplayer games like <i>League of Legends</i>,&nbsp;<em>Valorant</em>, and indeed&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>&nbsp;until today.</p>

<p>Its use is tolerated by other game companies; in fact, according to Blitz itself, the tool is <a href="https://support.blitz.gg/hc/en-us/articles/4415398467737-Can-I-get-banned-for-using-Blitz" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">officially recognized by Riot</a>, so&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' stance is perhaps a little unusual among games for which players use the tool.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/league-of-legends-viktor-singed-blitz.jpg?itok=DqOueOYQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/league-of-legends-viktor-singed-blitz.jpg?itok=msI5W1sD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Blitz's use in&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>is all but endorsed by Riot.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>, it's a third-person hero shooter that's essentially&nbsp;<em>Overwatch&nbsp;</em>with Marvel characters. Heroes like Iron Man, Venom, and Storm do battle across a variety of maps, completing objectives like protecting certain areas or escorting moving objects to their destination.</p>

<p>The game recently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-40m" rel="nofollow">hit 40 million registered players</a>, according to developer NetEase, but that didn't stop the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-studio-shockingly-closed-by-netease-laying-off-everyone" rel="nofollow">closing down the Seattle studio</a> responsible for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em> and laying off all of its employees.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>right now for free on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2767030/Marvel_Rivals/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/marvel-rivals/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/marvel-rivals/9n8pmw7qmd3d" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. Just don't use Blitz while you're doing so, eh?</p>
