            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The long-awaited live-action&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>series is finally moving forward at Netflix, if a new report is to be believed.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/assassins-creed-live-action-series-netflix-1236463572/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Variety</a>, the series, which will be helmed by showrunners and co-creators Roberto Patino and David Wiener, has been given the green light, although there's no word of a release date or even a release window yet.</p>

<p>Patino says the goal with the&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>series is to create "something undeniable for fans all over the planet", promising to highlight the franchise's focus on "people searching for purpose, struggling with questions of identity and destiny and faith" underneath the "scope, the spectacle, the parkour, and the thrills".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-live-action-series-ezio.jpg?itok=BwAgjaLi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-live-action-series-ezio.jpg?itok=So66-Csq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>We don't yet know who the&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>live-action series will focus on, but my money's on Ezio.</figcaption></figure><p>Netflix scripted series VP Peter Friedlander, meanwhile, says the&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>series is an "epic adventure" that will honor the franchise's legacy while also inviting "longtime fans and newcomers alike to experience the thrill of the Brotherhood as never before".</p>

<p>It isn't yet clear which of&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed</em>'s many time periods the show will focus on. According to its official logline, the show "follows its characters across pivotal historical events as they battle to shape humanity's destiny", so it's very possible we'll be seeing multiple historical periods, which would be interesting.</p>

<p>If the&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>series focuses on just one period, though, my money's on Renaissance-era Italy and the story of Ezio, since he's probably the franchise's most popular protagonist.</p>

<p>Of course, given that&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-steam-player-count" rel="nofollow">set a new Steam record for the franchise</a>&nbsp;and that sales for the modern action-RPG titles are strong across the board, we could well see&nbsp;<em>Shadows</em>, or perhaps&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/assassins-creed-origins" rel="nofollow"><em>Origins</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/assassins-creed-odyssey" rel="nofollow"><em>Odyssey</em></a>, or&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/assassins-creed-valhalla" rel="nofollow">Valhalla</a></em>,&nbsp;adapted instead.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-live-action-series-valhalla.jpg?itok=g5ER1Gok 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-live-action-series-valhalla.jpg?itok=Fv7O9PNs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Could&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Valhalla&nbsp;</em>serve as the basis for the upcoming live-action series?</figcaption></figure><p>The&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>Netflix series was first revealed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-netflix-series-in-development" rel="nofollow">all the way back in 2020</a>, so presumably, it's essentially been stuck in something akin to development hell since then, although the series has obviously clawed its way out of that blighted land now.</p>

<p>It will find a landscape newly receptive towards streaming adaptations of gaming properties, with shows based on the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/hbos-last-of-us-season-2-review-skeleton-of-story-no-heart" rel="nofollow"><em>The Last of Us</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/fallout-tv-show-proves-last-of-us-wasnt-fluke" rel="nofollow"><em>Fallout</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/secret-level-brings-videogame-anthology-to-prime-video" rel="nofollow">various other properties</a>&nbsp;making their way to streaming services in recent years.</p>

<p>Whether the series turns out better than the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/assassins-creed/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">somewhat ambivalently-received</a> movie remains to be seen, and since we don't know when the&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>Netflix show will air, it might be a while before we find out.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wartales-roadmap-late-2025</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Shiro Games has released a brand new&nbsp;<em>Wartales&nbsp;</em>roadmap covering the rest of 2025, and there's plenty on the way this year, including DLC that will let you build and manage your very own fiefdom.</p>

<p>Back in February, Shiro revealed its roadmap for&nbsp;<em>Wartales&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wartales-roadmap-2025" rel="nofollow">for the first half of the year</a>, and now, it's time to discover what lies in wait throughout the remainder of 2025, starting with a major community update this very month.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1527950/view/537733876590575648" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on Steam, the update, which is set to arrive at the end of July, will bring new Tier 5 armor and weaponry, as well as a new notification log, 20 new traits, and 40 new confessions, some of which are "unique confessions" that have been "written specifically for unique characters you may recruit".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wartales-roadmap-2025-battle.jpg?itok=HciknQD_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wartales-roadmap-2025-battle.jpg?itok=IaTQxBdk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Wartales&nbsp;</em>is getting plenty of new stuff throughout the rest of 2025.</figcaption></figure><p>Following that update, a major new DLC pack is arriving in September, and as Shiro says, it's "time to claim your own fief". You'll be able to build and expand said fief, rule over your subjects, and construct districts, all while tending to the needs of your population.</p>

<p>Doing so will involve not only making decisions about the lives of your subjects, but also producing and procuring resources for the healthy maintenance of your lands, all of which will shape the "identity of your fief", as Shiro puts it.</p>

<p>In future, two different kinds of DLC will be produced by Shiro, namely Expansions and Contracts. The former are large-scale additions that bring new regions, storylines, or factions to the game, while the latter are slightly smaller addons with new systems or "modular content that enhances replayability".</p>

<p>To that end, at some point in the fourth quarter of the year, a new&nbsp;<em>Wartales&nbsp;</em>DLC pack will arrive that adds a new region and a new storyline, so under the new system, that'll be an Expansion rather than a Contract.</p>




<p>You can grab&nbsp;<em>Wartales&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1527950/Wartales/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/wartales/9nwq686jb33g" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/wartales-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>
