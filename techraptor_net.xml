            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The ongoing Xbox layoff and cancellation wave continues, and this time, it's developer The Initiative and its long-awaited&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</em>reboot in the crosshairs, it seems.</p>

<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-is-closing-down-xbox-studio-the-initiative" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Windows Central</a>, an internal email sent to Xbox employees by studio head Matt Booty confirms the cancellation not only of&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark</em>, but also of Rare's&nbsp;<em>Everwild</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">reported yesterday</a>&nbsp;as part of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" rel="nofollow">massive wave of Microsoft layoffs</a>.</p>

<p>Booty's email also confirms the closure of The Initiative, which, along with the project cancellations, is intended to "reflect a broader effort to adjust priorities and focus resources to set up our teams for greater success within a changing industry landscape". Yep, it's that kind of phrasing again.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/perfect-dark-canceled-the-initiative-closed-sliding.jpg?itok=sDMS2Wbs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/perfect-dark-canceled-the-initiative-closed-sliding.jpg?itok=DuyfHD_e 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Perfect Dark</em>, along with its developer The Initiative, is no more.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Windows Central, "everything shown in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">recent Xbox showcase from June</a>" is safe from cancellation, including games like inXile's&nbsp;<em>Clockwork Revolution&nbsp;</em>and Double Fine's&nbsp;<em>Keeper</em>, among others.</p>

<p>However, it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/696676/microsoft-forza-motorsport-turn-10-studios-layoffs-xbox-cuts" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">does appear</a> that&nbsp;<em>Forza Motorsport&nbsp;</em>developer Turn 10 Studios was hit by this sweeping Microsoft layoff wave, with over 70 employees at the studio reportedly being let go.</p>

<p>As a reminder, Turn 10 is responsible for&nbsp;<em>Forza Motorsport</em>, but not for&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon</em>; that honor goes to Playground Games, which is, as far as we know, safe from these layoffs, as is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fable-reboot-delayed-2026" rel="nofollow">next year's&nbsp;<em>Fable&nbsp;</em>reboot</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, these things can change on a dime;&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</em>got itself a gameplay reveal during last year's summer showcase period, and a little over a year later, the project is no more. Let's hope&nbsp;<em>Fable&nbsp;</em>and other upcoming Xbox games, as well as their developers, can escape further cuts.</p>




<p><em>Perfect Dark</em>'s development appears to have been difficult, to say the least. Back in 2021, Crystal Dynamics joined the project as a co-developer, and the following March, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/report-indicates-perfect-dark-studio-initiative-hemorrhaging-staff" rel="nofollow">it was revealed</a> that The Initiative was hemorrhaging staff, with many blaming slow progress on the game and a lack of creative freedom for their departure.</p>

<p>However, thanks to the gameplay footage released last year, the reboot appeared to be back on track, which makes this decision's timing even more baffling.</p>

<p>Completely unrelatedly, back in April, Microsoft <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/fy-2025-q3/press-release-webcast" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> a 13% jump in Q3 revenue over the same period the previous year, with net income also up by 18%. Dire figures like that really show the necessity of laying off thousands of employees and closing studios, I'm sure you'll agree.</p>
