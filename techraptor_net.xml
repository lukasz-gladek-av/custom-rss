            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-rest-for-wicked-review-bomb-shut-down-thomas-mahler<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Thomas Mahler, the head of&nbsp;<em>Ori and the Blind Forest&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>No Rest for the Wicked&nbsp;</em>developer Moon Studios, has claimed that the latter being "review bombed" could mean his studio will "have to shut down".</p>

<p>Speaking on the official&nbsp;<em>No Rest for the Wicked&nbsp;</em>Discord (via <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/ori-and-the-blind-forest-studio-head-says-they-might-shut-down" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Windows Central</a>), Mahler says that players who are enjoying the game should leave a positive review, because if they don't, a "review bomb" could lead "to people not buying the game", which in turn would mean Moon Studios is "not making any money".</p>

<p>The review bomb in question appears to refer to negative reviews on&nbsp;<em>No Rest for the Wicked</em>'s Steam page, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/Abo-Ibrahim/recommended/1371980/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">some of which</a> point to the developer's <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198020099492/recommended/1371980" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">anti-"woke" political positions</a>. Mahler says that if players want to see&nbsp;<em>No Rest for the Wicked&nbsp;</em>finished, it's "detrimental" (sic; I assume he means "essential") that the review score be improved.</p>

Perhaps ironically, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/the_geoff/recommended/1371980" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">some</a> negative <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/ARC_Paramore/recommended/1371980" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reviews</a> even mention Mahler's desire for positive reviews as motivating factors without mentioning anything political.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/thomasmahler/status/1921646282726138116" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">response</a>, Mahler says that in fact, "pretty much everyone" who's played&nbsp;<em>No Rest for the Wicked&nbsp;</em>following recent hotfix patches was "extremely positive", and that the Discord post containing his comments was left up "to push back against some of the bullshit reviews".</p>

<p>Mahler goes on to say that while Moon Studios is "not in immediate financial danger", he should be "allowed to speak up" about issues within the industry that he finds "unbecoming", referring to apparent calls to review bomb&nbsp;<em>No Rest for the Wicked&nbsp;</em>because "according to those folks, [Mahler is] a Nazi".</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Almost 200 Overwatch Developers Form New Union With CWA]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-overwatch-union</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/almost-200-overwatch-developers-form-new-union-with-cwa.1186803/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-overwatch-union<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Over 200 staffers on Blizzard's&nbsp;<em>Overwatch&nbsp;</em>franchise have formed a new wall-to-wall union under the banner of the Communications Workers of America, becoming the latest Blizzard outfit to do so.</p>

<p>Per an official <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/overwatch-game-developers-secure-union-recognition-communications-workers-america" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on the CWA website, the&nbsp;<em>Overwatch&nbsp;</em>Gamemakers Guild (OWGG) includes "game developers across all disciplines, including design, production, engineering, art, sound, and quality assurance".</p>

<p>It's the latest union to be formed as part of the wider Activision Blizzard organization. Others include a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/world-of-warcraft-blizzard-union" rel="nofollow">union of&nbsp;<em>World of Warcraft&nbsp;</em>developers</a>, which was Blizzard's first of its kind, and a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/raven-software-activision-microsoft-labor-complaint" rel="nofollow">unionized group of employees</a> at&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>developer (and Activision subsidiary) Raven Software.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/overwatch-2-union-blizzard-owgg.jpg?itok=IGYcDeMA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/overwatch-2-union-blizzard-owgg.jpg?itok=BWUS5tHg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A group of&nbsp;<em>Overwatch&nbsp;</em>developers have unionized, becoming the latest Blizzard staffers to do so.</figcaption></figure><p>In the announcement, OWGG organizer and&nbsp;<em>Overwatch&nbsp;</em>VFX artist Frank Le Cocq says the "<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/respawn-layoffs-ea-cuts-titanfall-game" rel="nofollow">massive layoffs</a> in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-layoffs-january-2025" rel="nofollow">video game industry</a>" prompted him to "learn about how to organize to create a healthier workplace for everyone".</p>

<p>He goes on to say that the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>World of Warcraft&nbsp;</em>union's formation was "heartening" for the then-nascent OWGG. Fellow&nbsp;<em>Overwatch&nbsp;</em>staffer and OWGG organizer Foster Elmendorf says the effort to "organize [the gaming] industry for the better" is "long overdue".</p>

<p>The new union's formation is part of a wider movement across the industry, which has seen thousands of workers unionize at their various companies. Other unions formed across the industry include folks at <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenimax-qa-union-strike" rel="nofollow">Bethesda parent ZeniMax</a>,&nbsp;<em>Evil West&nbsp;</em>outfit <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/flying-wild-hog-unionizes" rel="nofollow">Flying Wild Hog</a>, and staffers at&nbsp;<em>Just Cause&nbsp;</em>dev <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/over-100-avalanche-studios-developers-have-joined-union" rel="nofollow">Avalanche Studios</a>.</p>

<p>It's not limited to individual studios, either. Back in March, the US' first industry-wide union, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/united-videogame-workers-union-formed" rel="nofollow">United Videogame Workers Union</a>, was formed, and it's open for any industry employee to join.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/overwatch-2-union-blizzard-zenimax.jpg?itok=34RwQPB2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/overwatch-2-union-blizzard-zenimax.jpg?itok=h9omCjHF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Workers across the industry, including those at&nbsp;<em>Oblivion Remastered</em>&nbsp;studio Bethesda, have been unionizing in the last few years.</figcaption></figure><p>Shockingly enough, Blizzard hasn't exactly been the most helpful company in the world when it comes to acknowledging and assisting its employees' unionization.</p>

<p>When workers at Blizzard's Albany QA division <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activision-blizzard-albany-union-vote-approved-by-nlrb" rel="nofollow">voted to unionize</a>&nbsp;back in 2022, Activision Blizzard was accused of attempting to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activision-blizzard-accused-of-trying-to-stifle-albany-union" rel="nofollow">stifle the union's formation</a>, with the company subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activision-blizzard-fights-to-delay-union-vote-tabulation" rel="nofollow">battling to delay the vote tabulation</a> for said union.</p>

<p>Activision Blizzard has also been subject to a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/union-files-nlrb-complaint-against-activision-blizzard-over-labor-law" rel="nofollow">National Labor Relations Board complaint</a>&nbsp;filed on behalf of the CWA back in 2021, with the complaint alleging violations of federal labor law on the company's part.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see whether this new&nbsp;<em>Overwatch&nbsp;</em>union proceeds smoothly or whether Blizzard decides it wants to try and stand in the way. Stay tuned for more.</p>
