            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pacific-drive-endless-expeditions-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Ironwood Studios and publisher Kepler Interactive have released a new&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>update, and this one's ideal if you thought the base game wasn't quite roguelite enough.</p>

<p>The Endless Expeditions update is the latest in a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pacific-drive-update-customization" rel="nofollow">string</a> of post-launch&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pacific-drive-sales-update" rel="nofollow">updates</a>, and its main feature is its namesake, the Expeditions mode, which Ironwood describes as offering "roguelite-style trips with unique routes and restrictions".</p>

<p>You'll start out from your garage "with an ever-changing set of challenges and restrictions", so if you feel like you've already seen everything&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>has to offer, this update may give you pause for thought on that front.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pacific-drive-endless-expeditions-update-map.jpg?itok=OqAkxLnn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pacific-drive-endless-expeditions-update-map.jpg?itok=ZQGC8PdZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pacific Drive</em>'s Endless Expeditions update should give you a few new challenges if you're a roguelite fan.</figcaption></figure><p>This update also introduces the ability to suspend your game no matter where you are, so you can suspend an in-progress run if you've got something else more urgent to do.</p>

<p>Additionally, you can look forward to "over an hour" of new radio music spread across 21 songs, created by "new and returning artists", as well as upgrades to the Plasma Scrapper and Thermal Vacuum tools to make them more efficient.</p>

<p>The new Ida's Exchange vendor will let you purchase new unique parts and resources for your car, as well as cosmetics to make it look a little nicer, and the route planning UI has been refreshed "for better readability" too.</p>

<p>If you want to know more about the Expeditions mode, be sure to keep an eye on Ironwood's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ironwoodstudios/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>, where the developer will be releasing an in-depth look at the mode in the coming days.</p>




<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive</em>, it's a survival-based driving game in which you must uncover the mysteries of a&nbsp;<em>Stalker</em>-style exclusion zone racked with anomalies and other dangers.</p>

<p>The game is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1458140/Pacific_Drive/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/pacific-drive/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, as is the Endless Expeditions update.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/assassins-creed-shadows-actress-masumi-on-naoe-challenges-of-acting-in-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-story-attempting-to-hit-word-limit" rel="nofollow"><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em></a> often feels like two games in one. If you play as Yasuke, you'll mow down enemies like an indestructible tank. If you play as Naoe, you'll dance in the shadows, elegantly carving a path toward your goal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They're opposites in so many ways. Yasuke is a gentle giant with strong convictions, while Naoe's petite stature contains a wealth of rage and fury. Over time, she hones this storm of emotions into a sharp blade, focused squarely on restoring freedom to Japan.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The actress behind this performance? Masumi, a Japanese American who previously starred in Netflix's <em>Yakuza Princess</em>. We interviewed her about her first major role in a AAA video game, where we learned about all the skills she brought to <em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>.</p>



<h2>A Deep Dive Into Naoe's Traumas</h2>

<p>Players who have seen the moment where Naoe and Yasuke meet know about her initial character arc. She goes from grief to greatness, and in Masumi's words, Naoe finds her "true power in her own shadows."&nbsp;</p>

<p>"All of the knowledge, skills, and wisdom that are passed down to her becomes almost like a curse because she doesn't know how to control her shadows made of trauma, anger, and pain," she said. "This story is about Naoe overcoming her inner demons and harnessing the true power of the shadows."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Naoe and Yasuke initially meet in an awkward position, but as Masumi puts it, they go from "enemies to lifelong friends." At first, they rely on each other because of their different talents, but throughout the game, you see more tender moments between them. These moments are courtesy of the acting work of Masumi and Tongayi Chirisa, who plays Yasuke.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Working with him was a treat! It didn't feel like work because we had so much fun working together," Masumi said about her fellow protagonist. "I respect him so much as an actor and a senpai as well, so I got to learn a lot from working with him."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Personally, I found that Yasuke brings out the best in Naoe, breaking down her trauma-built barriers with kindness. It adds emotional complexity to her character, which Masumi really related to.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I love how she takes in the moments of beauty when she notices them and lets the moments of sadness sink in when they come," she said. "She can be cool and calm like a ninja, or rage fiercely like a warrior! All while being the petite size that she is."</p>



<h2>The Hard Parts of Acting in a Video Game</h2>

<p>Masumi's previous experience on <em>Yakuza Princess</em> prepared her well for <em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>. She had training in Japanese sword fighting with actor Masa Kanome in LA because of the movie, and it came in handy for her role as Naoe.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We practice coming up with a fight choreography within 5 minutes at the end of every class. We have to quickly memorize all the choreography parts and tape it," she said. "So that skill definitely helped me book the job and also add some movements to Naoe in the game."&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em> presented Masumi with her first opportunities at motion capture and performance capture, both of which are common ways to record human movement and acting for games. In fact, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/obstacles-animal-motion-capture-video-game-development" rel="nofollow">these techniques can be used for animals</a>, too!&nbsp;</p>

<p>You've probably seen behind-the-scenes videos of people doing this in skin-tight body suits, often with markings for the cameras to track them. Needless to say, it's not the most immersive setting for an actor to perform in.</p>

<p>"You really have to tap into your imagination and trust your body to bring the character to life," Masumi said about the challenges of motion capture. "I also needed to ask questions about the weight or texture of the 'door' that I might be opening in a scene, to make it real for myself!"</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"As challenging as it was, it was also a rewarding experience. I learned so much." —Masumi, actress</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nonetheless, motion capture still lets a person act with their entire body. With voiceovers though, all the perceived "output" comes through only in voice.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"You have to convey everything through tone, breath, and energy. And because it’s a game, you’re not always recording in sequence, which means finding the right emotional beats without the full context," she said. "I have such renewed respect for VO actors after being on this project!"&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, this wasn't an easy experience, especially with the volume of work that goes into acting in a video game. Story aside, actors have to record a lot of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/interview/video-game-grunts-groans-and-screams-j-b-blanc-sheds-light-on-voice-acting" rel="nofollow">yelps and hints, along with combat grunts</a> and side quest musings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It was a 'marathon' as [creative director] Jonathan Dumont advised me in the beginning. I've learned a lot about advocating for recovery time and taking care of myself," she said. "But honestly, as challenging as it was, it was also a rewarding experience. I learned so much."</p>



<h2>A Sense of Pride</h2>

<p>Masumi herself doesn't play too many video games, but she did check out some of <em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em> recently—I mean, why wouldn't she, after all that hard work?&nbsp;</p>

<p>"While it was beautiful and super exciting to watch Naoe and Yasuke's story, the fight scenes were a bit too violent for me to get through," she said with a laugh. "I can't watch bloody horror movies either, so I would just have to enjoy walking through the town with <em>Shadows</em>."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Still, there's a lot she should be proud of. <em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em> is arguably one of the best in the franchise, with a healthy player base that has grown a lot since release. Additionally, it adds an extra sense of weight and honor to Masumi, being part of a game that showcases parts of Japanese history and culture.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I feel so honored and grateful that people are interested in our culture," she said. "I hope this will entice people to come to Japan and explore the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/real-wabi-sabi-in-assassins-creed-shadows-open-world" rel="nofollow">beautiful cities and countrysides in Japan</a>!"&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/inzoi-sales-1m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Krafton's&nbsp;<em>Sims</em>-style life sim&nbsp;<em>inZoi&nbsp;</em>has reached a major sales milestone just a week after its initial launch in Early Access.</p>

<p><em>inZoi&nbsp;</em>was released last Friday, having been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/inzoi-release-date-delayed" rel="nofollow">delayed out of 2024 back in November</a>, and according to a <a href="https://x.com/PlayinZOI/status/1908082411906449478" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the game's official X account, it's already surpassed a million sales, a number Krafton says "feels unreal".</p>

<p>The developer thanks players who've bought the game so far, praising their "excitement", their fan creations, and the feedback they've provided so far, as well as the support they've given to <i>inZoi</i>. Krafton says it's "deeply grateful" for fans' "passion and love".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/inzoi-sales-1m-crowd.jpg?itok=wsCHYmbr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/inzoi-sales-1m-crowd.jpg?itok=h21Jwf4j 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Krafton's&nbsp;<em>inZoi&nbsp;</em>has already reached a million sales.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>inZoi</em>, it's a life sim in the vein of games like EA's&nbsp;<em>The Sims</em>&nbsp;and...well...just&nbsp;<em>The Sims</em>, really. EA's franchise hasn't had much competition of late, and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/life-by-you-paradoxs-sims-competitor-has-been-cancelled" rel="nofollow">cancellation of Paradox's&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/life-by-you-paradoxs-sims-competitor-has-been-cancelled" rel="nofollow">Life by You</a>&nbsp;</em>didn't help on that front.</p>

<p>Krafton describes&nbsp;<em>inZoi&nbsp;</em>as "a fully functional community simulation experience" in which your role is to "shap[e] the world as [you] envision and [witness] the various stories that unfold".</p>

<p><em>inZoi</em>'s characters, known as Zois, will go about their lives according to their own whims, but you can shape their experience by altering their environment, and, of course, by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sims-like-inzoi-character-creator-tool" rel="nofollow">customizing them</a> to your heart's content as well.</p>

<p>Today's sales milestone arguably shows not only that there's a real appetite for&nbsp;<em>Sims</em>-style experiences outside of EA's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-no-plans-the-sims-5" rel="nofollow">rather restrictive playpen</a>, but also that the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-generative-ai-characters-pubg-inzoi" rel="nofollow">presence of generative AI</a>, which Krafton has been talking up in&nbsp;<em>inZoi&nbsp;</em>for a while, hasn't hindered the game's popularity.</p>




<p>Unlike&nbsp;<em>The Sims</em>,&nbsp;<em>inZoi&nbsp;</em>is currently in Early Access, and Krafton <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2456740/view/512953841353754380" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">says</a> it has plans to introduce major updates for the game around every two months, although more pressing issues will be fixed on a more immediate basis "during April".</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>inZoi&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2456740/inZOI/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>.</p>
