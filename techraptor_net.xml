            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-kadokawa-purchase-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report claims that Sony is in talks to buy FromSoftware parent company and media giant Kadokawa, with a deal potentially just weeks away.</p>

<p>The report comes from <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/sony-talks-buy-media-powerhouse-behind-elden-ring-sources-say-2024-11-19/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Reuters</a>, which, in turn, cites the age-old "sources familiar with the matter". As ever, take that with as big a pinch of salt as you like.</p>

<p>According to Reuters' report, talks between Sony and Kadokawa are ongoing, and if the talks are successful, then "a deal could be signed in the coming weeks", so it may not be very long before Kadokawa - and, by extension, FromSoftware - officially belongs to Sony.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dark-souls-3-sony-kadokawa-talks.jpg?itok=fJI5fqBp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dark-souls-3-sony-kadokawa-talks.jpg?itok=FDtKn41p 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Kadokawa subsidiary FromSoftware is best known for the&nbsp;<em>Souls&nbsp;</em>series, as well as offshoots like&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>In light of the apparent talks, Kadokawa's shares rocketed up 23%, and Sony's closed 0.6% higher than before the report emerged. Naturally, both Sony and Kadokawa declined to comment when asked to do so by Reuters.</p>

<p>Sony already owns a stake in Kadokawa, having purchased shares <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tencent-and-sony-buy-over-30-shares-in-from-software" rel="nofollow">back in August 2022</a> (alongside Chinese gaming giant Tencent). It's possible Sony wants to make a move before Tencent does, but of course, that's pure speculation.</p>

<p>In gaming terms, Kadokawa is perhaps best known as the parent company of&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>developer FromSoftware, although that's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kadokawa-acquire-purchase" rel="nofollow">not the only studio it owns</a>, and as a media conglomerate, the company has its fingers in plenty of other pies as well.</p>

<p>If the report turns out to be true, then Sony's desire to acquire Kadokawa makes perfect sense; FromSoftware's most recent release&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-25-million" rel="nofollow">clocked 25 million sales</a> at last count, while DLC expansion&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>racked up <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-sales" rel="nofollow">five million sales in under a week</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-sony-kadokawa.jpg?itok=KsGJZSFX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-sony-kadokawa.jpg?itok=l3QH3BS8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>is just one of FromSoftware's many successes.</figcaption></figure><p>Sony could probably do with the kind of boost that purchasing Kadokawa would likely provide right now.</p>

<p>Recently, the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-shuts-down-two-studios-including-concord-creator" rel="nofollow">shut down two of its studios</a>, including&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>developer Firewalk, and earlier this year, the Sony Interactive department <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-layoffs" rel="nofollow">laid off almost a thousand employees</a> around the world.</p>

<p>Subsidiaries like Bungie also arguably <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-layoffs-200-employees" rel="nofollow">aren't in a good place</a> right now, so if Sony could snap up the parent company of not only FromSoftware but also the likes of Spike Chunsoft and&nbsp;<em>Octopath&nbsp;</em>developer Acquire, then things may well improve. We'll have to wait and see what happens next.</p>
