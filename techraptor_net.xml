            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has revealed what you can expect from the first season of free-to-play skateboarding sim&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>when it arrives next week, and there are a ton of new cosmetics up for grabs, plus more.</p>

<p>As detailed in <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/skate/news/skate-season-1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on the game's official blog, the first season of&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>will bring two seasonal events with it, as well as "a little makeover" for San Vansterdam, lots of new challenges and objectives for you to pursue, and, of course, a brand new battle pass.</p>

<p>First up, it's the first of two seasonal events, Skate-o-Ween. It's San Vansterdam's annual Halloween celebration, but EA says it's "less focused on the spookiness" and "more about getting a chuckle out of someone". It runs from October 21st to November 11th.</p>

Both events will feature updated community parks, plus new themed cosmetics you can grab either via in-game challenges or by visiting the Extravert Shop.</p>

<p>Completing seasonal events will earn you event currency, and you can then use that currency to grab special cosmetic items. EA says it'll have more info about both events before they go live in&nbsp;<em>Skate</em>.</p>

<p>Season 1 will also bring new general cosmetics for you to earn outside of the specific seasonal events, but of course, the battle pass will have both a free and a premium track, and you'll have to cough up some cash if you want to get premium items.</p>

<p>It's not all about spending money, though; several new music tracks are also being added for Season 1, including the likes of Bad Religion's "Against the Grain", Jane's Addiction's "Stop!", and Gang Starr's "Full Clip", among others.</p>
