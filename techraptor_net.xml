            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Greek mythology is endlessly fascinating and has incredible depth, so it was a given that I was going to play&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest 2</em>'s Early Access release. A world where mythology is reality, and where gods walk among mortals, is a sure way to get me hooked.&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest 2</em>&nbsp;has mythology in spades, but it's also shaping up to be a damn fine <a href="https://techraptor.net/genre/action-rpg" rel="nofollow">ARPG</a> as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As an ARPG in the same vein as&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/diablo-iv" rel="nofollow">Diablo</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/path-of-exile" rel="nofollow"><em>Path of Exile</em></a>, there's a heavy focus on loot and taking out packs of monsters with your increasingly powerful character. This is the type of genre I lean on when I just want to turn my brain off, watch a video on the second monitor, or listen to a podcast. When it's all said and done,&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest 2</em>&nbsp;is perfect for that purpose.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/titan-quest-2-character.jpg?itok=1kmVagrF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/titan-quest-2-character.jpg?itok=KlSvGZHf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Character creation is supposed to come in a later update; for now, we can settle with some pre-made characters.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Titan Quest 2:&nbsp;</em>An ARPG for Everyone</h2>

<p>Here's the thing: ARPGs are simple in concept and don't require a lot of brainpower to play (unless you're Elon Musk, who can't complete even the most basic tasks in <em>Path of Exile 2</em>), but actually creating a build is where I find a lot of friction.</p>

<p><em>Titan Quest 2</em>&nbsp;eliminates said friction by creating a streamlined, easy-to-understand experience when it comes to actually building your character, and&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;is very refreshing to see. Rather than being bombarded with a million abilities or a sprawling tree of skills, you're able to choose two masteries.</p>

<p>So in&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest 2</em>, you don't start out with a class. You're given a blank slate, but very soon into the prologue, you'll be able to pick your mastery. These are powers granted by the divine, and so far, there are four to choose from: Earth, Rogue, Storm, and Warfare.</p>



<h2>Be Who You Want to Be</h2>

<p>Picking a mastery grants players a new set of skills to allocate points into. Whatever you pick, this will define your class for the rest of the game. I went with Rogue and Warfare on my first playthrough, creating a capable archer with an emphasis on weapon damage and critical hits.</p>

<p>Of course, you could pick Earth and Rogue, or Storm and Warfare -- really, whatever combination works. This flexibility is nice to see, even if I do suffer from a bit of choice paralysis. The only caveat is that you're supposed to pick these very early on, and thus far, I haven't seen a way to respec masteries.</p>

<p>You can, however, reallocate points into skills and attributes, so even if you mess up a build, there's a chance to remedy that mistake. The process is just easy, and you're not losing a bunch of progress if you change your mind of what skills you want to use.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/titan-quest-2-spells.jpg?itok=mfGd4fLZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/titan-quest-2-spells.jpg?itok=rJCWrQfA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Wanna sling spells? Go for it.</figcaption></figure><p>In many ways,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/diablo-iv-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Diablo 4</em></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-changes-grinding-gear" rel="nofollow">Path of Exile 2</a>&nbsp;</em>feel punishing when you want to make changes, either costing a huge amount of gold to respec&nbsp;or even needing to farm new materials. Going from those games to&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest 2</em>&nbsp;is a breath of fresh air.</p>

<p>The point I want to make is,&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest 2</em>&nbsp;seems to focus on accessibility. There is some depth to builds if you want to optimize your damage, but it's not quite as deep as other ARPGs; at least, not in its current state. That's just fine with me, since I'm all in it to just enjoy slaying enemies and getting better gear.</p>

<p>And yes, there's plenty of fighting and loot in&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest 2</em>. So far, we're early on in its Early Access, so I'm not super impressed by the breadth of loot just yet. I haven't found anything super rare or something that alters the way I play, but I still get a little dopamine hit when I find a bow better than my last one.</p>

<p>Enemy variety could also be better, since you're mostly fighting crabs, Icthians (fish men, basically), and bandits. It's Early Access, so I'm sure we'll see more and more as time goes on. This first act mixes things up with several bosses with unique abilities, which can break up the monotony a bit.</p>

<p>For example, I fought a challenging Hippocampus -- and no, I'm not talking about that part of the brain. It's a horse with wings and a fish-like body, often depicted in Greek mythology. This hellion really gave me a run for my money, closing the gap between me and it with its kicks and water attacks.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fates-titan-quest-2.jpg?itok=56BEQsqU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fates-titan-quest-2.jpg?itok=BGIoC6NE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Who knows what fate has in store?</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Titan Quest 2</em> Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>The Hippocampus is just one of several bosses you can stumble across. Act 1's map is quite large, and there are a lot of different side areas. There are more than a few optional quests that had me captivated due to their heavy use of mythology, so I was sure to go over every corner of this beautiful landscape.</p>

<p>In one instance, I came across a group of goats by a stream. Walking further past these goats, I was transformed into one as well. Thankfully, I had a moly root, which could turn me back into my humanoid form. A naiad -- essentially a water spirit -- was the cause. I helped her with a request so the goats could be turned back into humans.</p>

<p>It's not a quest with a ton of story, but it reminds me of the time Odysseus and his crew were turned into pigs by Circe. I mean, humans turning into animals is plenty common in Greek mythology. It made me feel like I was on my own little odyssey, much like Odysseus, and if that feeling can continue throughout the rest of&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest 2</em>, I'm very excited to see what comes next.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-5-price-hike-us</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has announced a price hike for PlayStation 5 hardware in the US, with all three major models of the PS5 getting price increases starting from tomorrow.</p>

<p>In a PlayStation Blog <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/20/playstation-5-price-changes-in-the-u-s/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, Sony says that due to a "challenging economic environment" (which the company says that "many global businesses" are also navigating), the recommended retail price for PS5 hardware will be increasing from August 21st.</p>

<p>The base PlayStation 5 model will be going up to $549.99, the PS5 Digital Edition (which, as a reminder, doesn't come with a disc drive) will cost you $499.99, and the PS5 Pro will jump to a fairly eye-watering $749.99. Again, as a reminder, the Pro doesn't come with a disc drive either.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/playstation-5-price-hike-us-models.jpg?itok=nDxwzatd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/playstation-5-price-hike-us-models.jpg?itok=4US4gvOx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The PS5's base models will be getting a price hike, as will the PS5 Pro.</figcaption></figure><p>While the PS5 hardware itself will be getting price rises, the console's accessories will remain at their current recommended price, and there are "no other price changes to announce for additional markets", Sony says.</p>

<p>This move is in line with a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-prices-raised-hardware-software" rel="nofollow">similar decision made by Microsoft</a> back in May, with the tech giant blaming "market conditions" for putting up the prices of its Xbox Series X|S consoles, as well as certain games in the holiday season.</p>

<p>However, Microsoft subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-outer-worlds-2-70-dollars-xbox" rel="nofollow">walked back its decision</a> to charge $80 for certain major releases (including&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>), although there's every chance prices will rise in future.</p>

<p>For what it's worth, Sony hasn't committed to charging $80 for its games either, with holiday releases like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ghost-of-yotei-release-date" rel="nofollow">the upcoming&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ghost-of-yotei-release-date" rel="nofollow">Ghost of Yōtei</a>&nbsp;</em>costing $70 as usual. Other publishers, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-6-no-80-pricing" rel="nofollow">like EA</a>, also won't be raising their game prices for the foreseeable future.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-playstation-5-price-hike.jpg?itok=-1TusAgq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-playstation-5-price-hike.jpg?itok=Q0Wbocng 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sony won't be hiking its game prices any time soon.</figcaption></figure><p>The market conditions that have necessitated this PS5 price hike are also likely what's stopping Microsoft from announcing pricing for its ROG Xbox Ally handhelds, which are <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rog-xbox-ally-release-date" rel="nofollow">due to launch in October</a>.</p>

<p>It's likely said market conditions are referring to the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cg7jjkvzmkxo" rel="nofollow">tariffs</a> imposed on many countries around the world by President Donald Trump, with components and manufacturing processes becoming exponentially more expensive for many hardware manufacturers as a result.</p>
