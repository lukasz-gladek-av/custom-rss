            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nine-sols-sales-800k<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Red Candle Games has revealed that Metroidvania action platformer&nbsp;<em>Nine Sols&nbsp;</em>has reached a big sales milestone, with the game also celebrating its first anniversary.</p>

<p>Released on May 29th last year,&nbsp;<em>Nine Sols&nbsp;</em>has, according to a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1809540/view/544484746860692250" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, reached 800,000 copies since its launch. That number counts across all platforms, too, so it includes not only the game's initial PC release, but also November's console ports.</p>

<p>Red Candle also includes a timeline of&nbsp;<em>Nine Sols</em>' achievements in the post, revealing that by the six-week mark, the game had reached 6,000 Steam reviews and earned itself an Overwhelmingly Positive rating (which, across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1809540/Nine_Sols/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">all reviews</a>, it still holds at time of writing).</p>

<p>The game revolves around Yi, who must seek out the titular nine Sols in order to take their Sol Seals. His true motivations are unclear at the outset of the game, but become clearer as the plot progresses.</p>

<p>Yi also befriends a young human child by the name of Shuanshuan at the start of&nbsp;<em>Nine Sols</em>, and it's his relationship with Shuanshuan that informs his character development and reveals more about the world in which the game takes place.</p>

<p>While&nbsp;<em>Nine Sols&nbsp;</em>is a Metroidvania, that might not be the best attitude with which to approach it; you can think of it more as a semi-linear platformer that takes influence from&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/sekiro-shadows-die-twice" rel="nofollow">Sekiro</a>&nbsp;</em>than as a&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hollow-knight" rel="nofollow"><em>Hollow Knight</em></a>-style sprawling and interconnected experience.</p>
