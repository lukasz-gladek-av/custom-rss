      <div><p>The <em>Cyberpunk Legends</em> Kickstarter campaign is live now. This official card game set in the dystopian metropolis of Night City, developed by Night Crew Games, is packed with cards and characters that fans know and love. So much so, the project was funded in under an hour.</p>

<h2>The <em>Cyberpunk Legends</em> Kickstarter Campaign</h2>

<p>The official <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cyberpunklegends/cyberpunk-legends-into-the-night/description" rel="nofollow">campaign page</a> for the <em>Cyberpunk Legends</em> Kickstarter is light on text, but packed with detail. As mentioned before, during its initial <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/talsorian-games-announces-cyberpunk-legends-rpg-lite-card-game-set-in-night-city" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement in June</a>, the game is a co-op experience for 1-4 players. Each player chooses one of four roles: Netrunner, Solo, Nomad, or Rocker, and works together doing jobs, getting paid, chippin' in with cyberware, and improving themselves via RPG-lite mechanics.</p>

The game will allow players to live out history in this dark sci-fi future. A history that leads to the Time of the Red in the TTRPG <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/cyberpunk-red-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Cyberpunk Red</em></a>, followed by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-edgerunners-2-officially-confirmed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Cyberpunk Edgerunners</em></a> anime and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/cyberpunk-2077" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></a> video game.</p>

<p>Because of this potent setting, the <em>Cyberpunk Legends</em> Kickstarter is packed with campaign-exclusive add-ons and stretch goals. These include story cards featuring the Bozos Gang, card sleeves, themed deck boxes, and playable versions of Night City legends before they became legends like Santiago and Kerry Eurodyne.</p>

<p>In addition, certain add-ons will let you create your own scenarios and custom character art. If you have especially deep pockets, you can even immortalize your own <em>Cyberpunk</em> character by having a drink at the Kernal Bar named after them.</p>

<p>The different pledge tiers of the <em>Cyberpunk Legends</em> Kickstarter are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Base Runner for $50:</strong> The base version of the game with all unlocked physical stretch goals</li>
	<li><strong>Legendary Edition for $130:</strong> The Legendary Edition of the game (which includes all add-on cards and playable Santiago, Bartmoss, Santiago, and Blackhand character decks) and all physical stretch goals</li>
	<li><strong>Guns and Clowns for $75:</strong> The base game and the Weapons, Bozos, and Cyberware card add-ons</li>
	<li><strong>Silverhand Special for $210:</strong> Everything in the Legendary Edition tier, the Hard Mon add-on, four sets of card sleeves, two deck boxes, and a play mat</li>
	<li><strong>Fixer's Edition for $350:</strong> Everything in the Silverhand Special tier, and the ability to play the first scenario of the game with the design team through Tabletop Simulator.</li>
	<li><strong>Burning Chrome for $500:</strong> Everything from the Silverhand Special tier, plus all cards in the game get a foil treatment</li>
</ul><p>At the time of writing, the <em>Cyberpunk Legends</em> Kickstarter has raised&nbsp;<span><span>$201,420, which is almost three times its initial funding goal of $75,000. The campaign concludes on October 23.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft and developer Massive Entertainment have announced&nbsp;<em>From the Ashes</em>, a brand new story expansion for&nbsp;<em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora&nbsp;</em>that's set to launch alongside the third movie this December.</p>

<p>As revealed <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-from-the-ashes-dlc-announced-release-timed-with-fire-and-ash-movie" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">by IGN</a>, the new DLC will arrive on December 19th, which is the same day on which James Cameron's&nbsp;<em>Avatar: Fire and Ash&nbsp;</em>arrives in cinemas. Presumably, it will once again sell absolutely shedloads of tickets, although I cannot for the life of me fathom why.</p>

<p><em>From the Ashes&nbsp;</em>will, according to creative director Omar Bouali, take place "a few weeks" after the events of&nbsp;<em>Fire and Ash</em>, and around six months after the events of&nbsp;<em>Frontiers of Pandora&nbsp;</em>and its existing story packs.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-from-the-ashes-dlc-base-game-bow.jpg?itok=j6eQ9psr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-from-the-ashes-dlc-base-game-bow.jpg?itok=Lhw5Hxon 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora&nbsp;</em>is getting another big story DLC pack.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Bouali, the new&nbsp;<em>From the Ashes&nbsp;</em>expansion will be set in "a ravaged and occupied version of the Kinglor Forest", and it'll give you a new sub-region to explore in the form of The Ravines.</p>

<p>Watching&nbsp;<em>Fire and Ash&nbsp;</em>may well give you a better experience in&nbsp;<em>From the Ashes</em>, too; while Bouali says the two "are set in different reigons of Pandora", there's still some "shared DNA" between the two, with Ubisoft working alongside Cameron's Lightstorm Entertainment to make both stories "complimentary".</p>

<p>It's likely that we'll learn more about&nbsp;<em>Fire and Ash&nbsp;</em>over the next few months, but you can at least expect to encounter the Ash Clan that partially lend their name to the DLC, as well as "one very special creature", about which Ubisoft is remaining tight-lipped for now.</p>

<p><em>From the Ashes&nbsp;</em>will arrive in the same month as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-update-new-game-plus" rel="nofollow">a major update</a> for&nbsp;<em>Frontiers of Pandora</em>, which is scheduled to add a New Game Plus mode to the&nbsp;<em>Far Cry</em>-esque FPS, as well as a third-person view mode and more.</p>
