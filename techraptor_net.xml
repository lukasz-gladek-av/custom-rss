            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-roadmap-legends-of-zone-next-gen-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>developer GSC Game World has revealed that it will release the game's content roadmap at the beginning of next year, and there's good news if you've been waiting for a certain next-gen patch as well.</p>

<p>In its <a href="https://x.com/stalker_thegame/status/1870106910751703303" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">end-of-year message</a> on social media platform X, GSC Game World pledges to continue updating&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>throughout next year. As a reminder, the company recently released a major patch for the game that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-update-1-1-a-life" rel="nofollow">features over 1800 fixes</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, the studio promises to share the&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>roadmap at the start of 2025, although it doesn't commit to a specific date. It's likely we'll get to see what GSC Game World has planned for its latest game sometime in January or February at the very latest.</p>

Though the update was promised for Xbox Series X|S, it seems to be coming to PS5 as well, if GSC Game World's message is anything to go by.</p>

<p>In the post, GSC Game World says the next-gen patch for "the console versions" of&nbsp;<em>Legends of the Zone Trilogy&nbsp;</em>will arrive next year, and the PC versions of the games will also bring the enhancements introduced by said patch.</p>

<p>They'll include "additional graphical enhancements and other features", as well as mod support, although the latter may be a while away yet.</p>

We'll just have to wait and see.</p>

<p>In the meantime,&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/stalker-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and the&nbsp;<em>Legends of the Zone Trilogy&nbsp;</em>can be found on <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UB0046-CUSA43979_00-0336574734560734" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/stalker-legends-of-the-zone-trilogy/9n4gffdg41jr" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/s-t-a-l-k-e-r-legends-of-the-zone-trilogy-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> (although you'll technically be playing the last-gen ports on PlayStation and Xbox until the next-gen version arrives).</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pathologic-3-quarantine-2025-prelude-demo</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pathologic-3-quarantine-coming-in-2025-not-quite-a-demo.1066311/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pathologic-3-quarantine-2025-prelude-demo<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Ice-Pick Lodge and publisher HypeTrain Digital have announced&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3: Quarantine</em>, a sort of prologue episode for the main game that you'll be able to play for free next year.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3199650/view/515196772511908425" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an announcement post</a>, Ice-Pick Lodge describes&nbsp;<em>Quarantine&nbsp;</em>as a "free prelude" that's "not quite" a demo, although it has similarities to a demo. The studio compares&nbsp;<em>Quarantine&nbsp;</em>to&nbsp;<em>The Marble Nest</em>, a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/505230/view/5156014950378312752" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">teaser</a> released prior to&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 2&nbsp;</em>that Ice-Pick described as a "mood piece".</p>

<p>Despite the similarities,&nbsp;<em>Quarantine&nbsp;</em>won't function in quite the same way as&nbsp;<em>The Marble Nest</em>; rather than being a self-contained story, it'll "showcase fragments of gameplay mechanics, set the stage for the story, and pull back the curtain a bit" with regards to&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3</em>'s world.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pathologic-3-quarantine-announced-street.jpg?itok=swgWRvEi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pathologic-3-quarantine-announced-street.jpg?itok=XCjK9Yqw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pathologic 3: Quarantine&nbsp;</em>is designed to set up the main&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3&nbsp;</em>experience.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Quarantine&nbsp;</em>will, according to Ice-Pick, tie into the events of the main game, and it'll "partially overlap" with&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3</em>'s intro, but it'll also give you the chance to see unique scenes you won't see in the main game.</p>

<p>You'll also get the chance to get your first glimpse of the Capital, where the Bachelor's lab is located, and you'll get to discover what drove the Bachelor to leave his lab. Along the way, you'll be diagnosing patients and trying to figure out their secrets as you go.</p>

<p>We don't have a release date or even a more specific release window for&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3: Quarantine&nbsp;</em>yet, but it goes without saying that you can almost certainly expect this free teaser to arrive sometime before the game itself does.</p>




<p><em>Pathologic 3&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pathologic-3-announced-2025" rel="nofollow">announced back in October</a>, although technically speaking, it was actually <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pathologic-2-bachelors-scenario-announced" rel="nofollow">revealed in July 2020</a> as an expansion to&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 2&nbsp;</em>(which is itself both a remake of and sequel of sorts to the original&nbsp;<em>Pathologic</em>).</p>

<p>As such, in&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3</em>, you'll play as&nbsp;Daniil Dankovsky, also known as the Bachelor. You arrive in a small town beset by the plague, and it's up to you to discover said plague's mysterious origins and see if you can put a stop to it.</p>

<p><em>Pathologic 3&nbsp;</em>is due to land on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3199650/Pathologic_3/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> sometime next year. You can also wishlist the standalone prelude&nbsp;<em>Quarantine&nbsp;</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3199650/Pathologic_3/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">via Steam</a> if you want to.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/genshin-impact-version-5-3-brings-new-5-star-characters-and-more-in-january.1066206/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-5-3-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has announced the release date for <i>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</i>Version 5.3, so if you're looking for a way to ring in the new year, then you're in luck.</p>

<p>Following hot on the heels of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-52-release-date" rel="nofollow">November's Version 5.2</a>&nbsp;and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-51-release-date" rel="nofollow">previous month's Version 5.1</a>, Version 5.3 will arrive on January 1st. That's right: New Year's Day itself. It'll continue the storyline of Natlan's Archon Quest, in which the Traveler is about to awaken their Pyro power and the six heroes of Natlan have united.</p>

<p>Of course, it wouldn't be much of a HoYoverse game update without some new characters to enjoy, and Version 5.3 is bringing not one, but two 5-star characters for you to add to your roster.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/genshin-impact-version-5.3-new-characters.jpg?itok=2NDpnDAb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/genshin-impact-version-5.3-new-characters.jpg?itok=WJRn_3vL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.3 brings two new 5-star characters for your roster.</figcaption></figure><p>Your first new 5-star character is the Pyro claymore user Mavuika, who comes with two distinct fighting styles. She can either take enemies on with the aforementioned claymore or use her Flamestrider to crush enemies. Said Flamestrider can also be used to traverse the world.</p>

<p>The second 5-star character joining&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>in Version 5.3 is Citlali, also known as Granny Itztli. She's a Cryo-using catalyst wielder who can deploy shields and deal powerful area-of-effect damage. Both characters are joined by the intriguing-sounding multi-elemental Liyue fighter Lan Yan, who debuts in the second half of the update.</p>

<p>Of course, you can also expect reruns of existing characters in case you missed the chance to add them to your team. Characters returning as part of this update include Arlecchino, Clorinde, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/genshin-impact-ganyu-guide-builds-skills" rel="nofollow">Ganyu</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/genshin-impact-shenhe-build-guide" rel="nofollow">Shenhe</a>.</p>




<p>Plenty of other goodies are coming as part of Version 5.3 as well, including the return of the Lantern Rite event, the popular rhythm minigame becoming a permanent fixture, and optimizations to the character level up screen to make it a little easier to understand and parse.</p>

<p>As per usual, HoYoverse is also giving away some&nbsp;<em>Genshin&nbsp;</em>goodies for those who are looking to build their roster. Here are this update's codes!</p>

<ul><li>UAMPGJASECZH: 100 Primogems, 10 Mystic Enhancement Ore</li>
	<li>LT5NH2TTXUHM: 100 Primogems, 5 Hero's Wit</li>
	<li>4SLPH3BSFVH9: 100 Primogems, 50,000 Mora</li>
</ul><p><em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>is available to play right now for free on <a href="https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation, Xbox Series X|S, and mobile devices</a>.</p>
