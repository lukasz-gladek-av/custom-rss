  </picture><h2>Third Place - Elden Ring Nightreign: The Forsaken Hollows</h2><p>Developer: FromSoftware | Release Date: December 3rd, 2025</p><p>Written by Joe Allen</p><p><em>Forsaken Hollows</em> offers more of what made<em> Elden Ring Nightreign</em> so strangely compelling, which is to say more opportunities to fail.</p><p>The expansion’s new map (which is technically a Shifting Earth condition, yes, but it’s pretty transformative) is a labyrinthine maze of crystals, chasms, and vertiginous falls, and new bosses like the Lord of Blood and the Demon Prince give no quarter.</p><p>Two new classes slot nicely into proceedings as well, especially the Scholar, which plays a support role you won’t find anywhere else in <em>Nightreign</em>’s already-diverse cast of playables.</p><p>All of this gloriously difficult adventuring culminates in two new Nightlords, both of whom provide a different challenge for you and your two buddies (or randoms), necessitating that special mixture of forward planning and seat-of-your-pants, howling improvisation that <em>Nightreign </em>excels at.</p><p>In short, if you liked <em>Nightreign</em>, you’ll almost certainly like<em> Forsaken Hollows</em>, and hey, more of the same ain’t no bad thing in this case.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Second Place - No Man's Sky: Voyagers</h2><p>Developer: Hello Games | Release Date: August 27th, 2025</p><p>Written by Andrew Otton</p><p><em>No Man's Sky</em> has been a consistent nominee and sometimes winner in both this category and Best Evolving Game since 2018. In 2025, <em>Voyagers </em>released, which was a massive update to the game. Truly amazing just how much this continues to evolve over the years.</p><p>The biggest part of this update brought fully customizable ships to the game. You probably saw some of the meme ships people created posted somewhere on social media, as we now have the tools to make pretty much whatever we want. That includes the interior of the ship as well, which you can walk around after stylizing it however you want.</p><p>Beyond just the look, there's a lot of utility you can put in your ship as well, and can even fly around with your friends on missions or just exploring. All in all, <em>Voyagers </em>was a huge update that brought a lot of life to <em>No Man's Sky</em>.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Winner - Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: The Order of Giants</h2><p>Developer: MachineGames | Release Date: September 4th, 2025</p><p>Written by Andrew Stretch</p><p>It was great to break out the hat and whip again in <em>The Order of the Giants</em> DLC for <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>. This DLC returned Indy to the Vatican with a smaller side-adventure to take on.</p><p>While the DLC didn't have as much chance to explore an open hub area, what it did have was the kind of historical intrigue and tomb delving that best suits the third act in most Indy adventures. Platform through tunnels, clobber those trying to stop you, and navigate through a series of puzzles to learn a bit more about the mysterious Nephilim.</p><p>Above all is Machina Games' ability to make incredible set pieces to explore, and hearing Troy Baker's fantastic Harrison Ford impersonation.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
       
    <p>There's no I in TEAM!! We're all on the case, and this is how you know it :)</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Lilien Games and publisher WhisperGames have announced the release date for whodunit adventure <em>The Real Face of a VTuber</em>, a self-confessedly <em>Ace Attorney</em>-inspired murder mystery that asks you to solve a killing at a VTuber studio.</p><p>As revealed in a press release, <em>The Real Face of a VTuber </em>is launching on January 13th, and since said press release is peppered with <em>Ace Attorney </em>puns, it's safe to say this one is for fans of Capcom's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/great-ace-attorney-chronicles-sales-hit-over-500000-worldwide" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="303a1134-df98-4e4e-8764-eb68a7e5796c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">cult sleuthing series</a>.</p><p>In <em>The Real Face of a VTuber</em>, you play as the wonderfully-named Justin Truth (which rather gives the game away), a prosecutor who must investigate a VTuber studio where someone has been murdered during a stream by the popular VTuber Kuriba.</p><figure role="group">

<p>Lilien and WhisperGames are promising "realistic courtroom mechanics where you must follow proper procedure" in <em>The Real Face of a VTuber</em>, so that's where it and <em>Ace Attorney </em>diverge, apparently. I love <em>Ace Attorney</em>, but it's never been within "Objection!"-shouting distance of a real courtroom.</p><p>Additionally, where <em>Ace Attorney </em>tells a linear story peppered with opportunities to present evidence and interrogate witnesses, <em>The Real Face of a VTuber </em>will feature "nonlinear storytelling" and a host of endings based on who you accuse of the crime.</p><p>In fact, according to the two studios, "only 1.6% of the players testing the game uncovered the real culprit", so this is very much a "hardcore whodunit", they say, despite the game's "cute aesthetic".</p><p>If that sounds intimidating, though, don't worry; you can switch on optional hints from your clerk if you want to proceed through <em>The Real Face of a VTuber</em>'s story more smoothly. Naturally, those hints are optional, so more independent sleuths can turn them off.</p>
<p><em>The Real Face of a VTuber </em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2871140/The_Real_Face_of_a_VTuber/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">PC via Steam</a> on January 13th.
