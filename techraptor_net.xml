<p>As revealed in a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2246340/view/534345486851637348" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> earlier today, Capcom will unveil Title Update 1, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-1-april-announced" rel="nofollow">due to arrive sometime in April</a>, on March 25th. You can catch it at around 7am Pacific (that's about 10am Eastern and around 2pm GMT).</p>

<p>The showcase will see&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>producer Ryozo Tsujimoto revealing more about what's coming as part of Title Update 1, including returning monster Mizutsune, as well as "a host of other new additions", according to Capcom.</p>

<p>Just in case you're not familiar with it,&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>is the latest game in Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>series of action RPGs. The game features a more direct narrative focus than its predecessors, but at its core, it's still built around slaying monsters and using their parts to upgrade your gear.</p>

<p>The game has proven phenomenally popular since launch, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-8m" rel="nofollow">racking up eight million sales</a> in its first three days and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-steam-player-record" rel="nofollow">breaking records</a> for both the series and Capcom as a whole on Steam.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that it was released on the very last day of February,&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>instantly topped the month's chart for best-selling games <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/circana-us-sales-data-february-2025-monster-hunter-wilds" rel="nofollow">according to analyst firm Circana</a>, so it's safe to say Capcom has a hit on its hands (talons?) with this one.</p>
