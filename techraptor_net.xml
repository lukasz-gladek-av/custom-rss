It is a place where the souls of the dead are cursed to return in twisted, nightmarish forms. Alongside these horrors are the Umbra, an ethereal force that corrupts all it touches. The only ways people survive in this land are from Sacred Pyres staving off corruption, and tightly knit cooperation. But there are whispers of ancient secrets and power to be found by the brave few.</p>
