            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Steamforged Games has a new set of Epic Encounters boxes for pre-order. The new <em>Epic Encounters</em> Steelborn sets provide a prebuilt, ready-to-play <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> encounter themed around steel constructs and clockwork automata for sci-fi inclined DMs.</p>

<h2>The <em>Epic Encounters Steelborn</em> Set Pre-Order Announcement</h2>

<p>According to its official <a href="https://steamforged.com/products/epic-encounters-sanctuary-of-the-steelborn" rel="nofollow">store page</a>, the <em>Epic Encounters Steelborn</em> set comprises two boxes. The first, <em>Epic Encounters: Sanctuary of the Steelborn</em>, is the minion encounter box. It contains 20 miniatures, an encounter booklet, and a double-sided encounter map designed for thematic, dynamic battles.</p>

It contains a single large boss miniature with a 120 mm base. An encounter booklet providing boss behaviors and abilities, several difficulty tiers, a set of tokens to represent minions, and a double-sided battle map as well.</p>

<p>The introduction of the Steelborn to <em>Epic Encounters</em> may be contentious on the surface. The central idea of Steamforged's product line is to provide challenging, exciting, fantasy battles based around iconic monster archetypes. Their line has ranged from undead skeletons to <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/epic-encounters-camp-of-bandit-twins-and-cave-of-manticore-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">bandits</a> to <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/epic-encounters-island-of-crab-archon-and-cove-of-dragon-turtle-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">crab monsters</a>, to dragons, to <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/epic-encounters-palace-of-drow-queen-and-lair-of-drider-review-new-shade-of" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">drow and driders</a>.</p>

<p>At first glance, the <em>Epic Encounters</em> Steelborn sets appear to be at odds with high fantasy. But, for more seasoned members of the community, their inclusion is natural. Metal golems have been staples in various fantasy settings like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>The Elder Scrolls</em></a>. Critical Role's Exandria setting features sophisticated automata. An entire <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> setting, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dungeons-dragons-eberron-forge-of-artificer-delayed-due-to-production-issues" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eberron</a>, is built around magic artificers and warforged.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Epic Encounters</em> is but one product line in Steamforged Games' catalog. The tabletop developer is known for high-quality bespoke licensed board games based on <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/runescape-kingdoms-shadow-of-elvarg-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Runescape</em></a>, <em>Resident Evil</em>, and <em>Sea of Thieves,&nbsp;</em>and ongoing support of the miniature game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/warmachine-frozen-and-forgotten-starter-set-brings-icy-vengeance" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warmachine</em></a>. They even launched an Epic Encounter spin-off line, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/epic-encounters-local-legends-review-legendary-bar-stories" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Local Legends</em></a>, which focuses more on engaging taverns and venues for players to enjoy.</p>

<p>Both boxes in the <em>Epic Encounters</em> Steelborn set are available for pre-order now at an MSRP of $54.99 each. These pre-orders will be available until October 7.</p>
