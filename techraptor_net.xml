            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/theres-a-simpsons-hit-run-futurama-mod-and-you-can-play-a-demo-right-now.1329601/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A team of modders calling itself Slurm Team has created a mod for the classic 2003 open-world game&nbsp;<em>The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run&nbsp;</em>based on&nbsp;<em>Futurama</em>, and you can check out a demo right now.</p>

<p>As spotted by the good folks at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-simpsons-hit-run-modders-have-made-their-own-futurama-total-conversion-with-future-and-ramas" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Rock Paper Shotgun</a>,&nbsp;<em>Futurama: Hit &amp; Run</em>'s demo is available to <a href="https://modbakery.donutteam.com/projects/view/48" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">download now</a> from Mod Bakery, and it's got a pretty significant slice of the final mod for you to take a look at as well.</p>

<p>The aptly-named&nbsp;<em>Futurama: Hit &amp; Run&nbsp;</em>requires you to have a copy of the original game on PC, and you'll also need the Lucas'&nbsp;<em>Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run&nbsp;</em>Mod Launcher program, which, as the name suggests, allows you to launch mods for the game (as well as adding various other improvements).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/futurama-hit-run-mod-fry-bender.jpg?itok=-t_qDKBU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/futurama-hit-run-mod-fry-bender.jpg?itok=qrOBjT7V 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Futurama: Hit &amp; Run&nbsp;</em>has a demo for you to check out right now.</figcaption></figure><p>The demo comes complete with four story missions and a bonus mission, as well as a wager race and three street races by way of side activities. It's also got four costumes and six vehicles for you to drive.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to nine "gags" and one "secret gag", as well as 25 wasps that serve as the mod's collectibles.&nbsp;<em>Futurama: Hit &amp; Run&nbsp;</em>even comes with a custom version of&nbsp;<em>The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run</em>'s map based on New New York, as well as custom music.</p>

<p>There is one caveat, though. Slurm Team says&nbsp;<em>Futurama: Hit &amp; Run&nbsp;</em>comes with generative AI-based voice acting for now; the team already has "professional voice artists" lined up for the full mod release, but for now, you'll hear AI voices. If that's a deal-breaker, you may want to wait for the mod's full release.</p>




<p>This is probably the closest thing you're going to get to an actual&nbsp;<em>Futurama&nbsp;</em>video game in the near future (assuming you're not content with&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-futurama-crossover" rel="nofollow"><em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>skins</a>, that is), so if you're a fan of the futuristic animated comedy series, I'd recommend giving the mod a look.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Sims Mobile to Shut Down in January]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sims-mobile-shutdown-january</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-sims-mobile-to-shut-down-in-january.1329598/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has announced that&nbsp;<em>The Sims Mobile&nbsp;</em>will be shutting down early next year, and that the update being made available today will serve as the game's final patch before shutdown.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-mobile/news/final-update" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>The Sims Mobile&nbsp;</em>website, EA says the game's servers will be closing down on January 20th next year. Since this is an online-only game, that means you won't be able to play it anymore, and it doesn't sound like there will be any kind of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-offline-december" rel="nofollow"><em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp</em>-style offline version</a> either.</p>

<p><em>The Sims Mobile</em>'s final update will offer the chance to experience several seasonal events between now and January, including today's Eerie Autumn event, Season's Greetings in December, and the New Year's Dock and Roll treasure hunt towards the end of the year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-sims-mobile-shutdown-house.jpg?itok=OhGJm3Rr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-sims-mobile-shutdown-house.jpg?itok=efPDojjC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Sims Mobile&nbsp;</em>isn't sticking around for much longer.</figcaption></figure><p>Today's update also marks the end of the ability to purchase in-game currency for real cash in&nbsp;<em>The Sims Online</em>. Any SimCash, Simoleons, or Tickets you still have in the game can be used until the date of the game's shutdown.</p>

<p>Additionally, EA is awarding all players unlimited energy to "complete projects and enjoy the last few months of play", and on January 6th, all of&nbsp;<em>The Sims Mobile</em>'s in-game content will unlock for all players, which EA says will help you to "experience everything&nbsp;<em>The Sims Mobile&nbsp;</em>has to offer" before it disappears.</p>

<p>If you've already downloaded&nbsp;<em>The Sims Mobile&nbsp;</em>but you've deleted it from your device, you can download and play it again until January 20th, but after that date, both the game and any save data you might have will be deleted for good.</p>

<p>EA doesn't clarify a reason for&nbsp;<em>The Sims Mobile&nbsp;</em>being delisted, but it's pretty easy to guess that the game isn't pulling the kind of player numbers the publisher wants in order to keep the experience alive.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-sims-mobile-shutdown-public.jpg?itok=PQNSkaLN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-sims-mobile-shutdown-public.jpg?itok=WV_rMlZ8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>In January, all of&nbsp;<em>The Sims Mobile</em>'s content will be unlocked for everyone, so that's your chance to try it out.</figcaption></figure><p>If you still want to, you can check out&nbsp;<em>The Sims Mobile&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ea.gp.simsmobile&amp;hl=en_GB" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tsm-game/id1144258115" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">iOS</a>. The game will be delisted from those storefronts tomorrow, so you've got until then to download it.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New MindsEye Report Alleges "No Coherent Direction" and Heavy Crunch During Development]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mindseye-failure-new-report</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-mindseye-report-alleges-no-coherent-direction-and-heavy-crunch-during-development.1329595/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report has emerged which may shed some light on why ill-fated third-person shooter&nbsp;<em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>flopped so disastrously when it launched earlier this year, and the reasons are probably going to sound pretty familiar to you.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gzn34gwvwo" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">article</a> for the BBC, reporter Tom Richardson spoke to former staff who worked for developer Build a Rocket Boy (which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mindseye-build-a-rocket-boy-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">underwent a hefty round of layoffs</a> earlier this year following&nbsp;<em>MindsEye</em>'s release).</p>

<p>An ex-developer known as "Jamie" (which isn't their real name) told Richardson that <i>Everywhere</i>, the user-generated content sandbox which was BARB's initial focus, was "quite special", but that once the studio's focus shifted to&nbsp;<em>MindsEye</em>, boss Leslie Benzies "never decided what game he wanted to make".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/build-a-rocket-boy-everywhere-mindseye.jpg?itok=CVb_3x0x 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/build-a-rocket-boy-everywhere-mindseye.jpg?itok=uUDg0txO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A former Build a Rocket Boy developer described sandbox project&nbsp;<em>Everywhere&nbsp;</em>as "quite special".</figcaption></figure><p>Jamie says there was "no coherent direction" on&nbsp;<em>MindsEye</em>'s development, and that Benzies would routinely request huge changes to features or missions in the game. Jamie says the team referred to these bug and feature requests as "Leslies", and that they "had to be taken care of" immediately.</p>

<p>Additionally, former staff at Build a Rocket Boy allege that&nbsp;<em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>was developed under crunch conditions, with staff routinely working additional unpaid overtime hours during the week in order to finish the game.</p>

<p>Former employee Margherita Peloso, known as Marg, says they attempted to raise concerns regarding the state of&nbsp;<em>MindsEye</em>, but that they were "laughed at" by management. Marg says staff felt they were "commanded to give a lot to the company without too much in return".</p>

<p>According to Richardson, ex-Build a Rocket Boy workers are "pessimistic" about whether&nbsp;<em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>can be turned around, despite assurances from BARB that this is the studio's intention.</p>




<p>If you need a reminder,&nbsp;<em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>launched earlier this year to a decidedly negative reception from both players and critics alike (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/mindseye-review-mideye" rel="nofollow">ourselves very much included</a>).</p>

<p>The <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mindseye-launch-messy" rel="nofollow">game's launch</a> resulted in players requesting refunds over what they perceived to be unacceptable bugs and performance issues, as well as a sponsorship for streamer CohhCarnage being pulled at the last minute as reports of&nbsp;<em>MindsEye</em>'s many problems poured in.</p>

<p><em>MindsEye</em>'s launch was so bad, in fact, that it appears to have prompted publisher IO Interactive to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/io-interactive-mindseye-third-party-publishing" rel="nofollow">reconsider its entire relationship</a> with third-party publishing, although that didn't stop UKIE boss Nick Poole from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ukie-nick-poole-mindseye-scottish-gaming" rel="nofollow">seemingly citing the game</a> as an example of the strength of the Scottish gaming industry.</p>

<p>I'm not entirely sure why you'd want to, but if you're so inclined, you can check out&nbsp;<em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3265250/MindsEye/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/mindseye/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/mindseye/9PJ9WXK3V9FN" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Anjali Bhimani Talks Puppy Role 2, New and Returning Characters, And How To DM D&D As A Dog]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/anjali-bhimani-talks-puppy-role-2-new-and-returning-characters-and-how-to-dm-dd</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anjali-bhimani-talks-puppy-role-2-new-and-returning-characters-and-how-to-dm-d-d-as-a-dog.1329565/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Forming the perfect mix of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, puppies, and supporting a worthy cause, we got to sit down this week to discuss Puppy Roll 2, an upcoming charity livestream being hosted by Anjali Bhimani with special guests that fans of the actual play world will be more than familiar with.</p>

<p>"The Puppy Roll is a livestream charity that I started last year along with the good folks at Petco Love," Bhimani launched into an explanation of the event, "This charity is all about helping other animal shelters and adoption initiatives across the country."</p>
<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed//JcU7yj99uxY"></iframe></p>

<h2>Players And Their Pets</h2>

<p>"The conceit of the event itself is that you will see familiar faces from your screen, whether that be TV and film, or the TTRPG Actual Play spaces playing D&amp;D as our pets. It is delightful chaos, I will be the DM - the Doggie Master - and I can't wait to do it again.</p>

<p>The full cast of The Puppy Roll is as follows:</p>

<ul><li aria-level="1">Anjali Bhimani &amp; Charley as The DM</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Matthew Mercer &amp; Omar</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Aabria Iyengar &amp; Suvi</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Ashley Johnson &amp; Sully</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Maggie Robertson &amp; Cricket</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Jonathan Graziano &amp; MIlton</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Ginny Di &amp; Pablo</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Emily Axford &amp; Bruce</li>
</ul><p>Hearing that Axford would be joining the table I did want to see how Bhimani was feeling knowing that who that AP scene has coined as a chaotic player would be at her table. "The thing that I find remarkable about her, and remarkable about so many players is that despite the fact that what we see as viewers is chaos there is also this virtuosic ability to understand that what the story might need at that moment"</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-puppy-roll-ii-some-players.jpg?itok=6hmK62DO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-puppy-roll-ii-some-players.jpg?itok=ZCxs_vcr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Bhimani complimented the ability that a lot of the players at this table have to funnel the chaos not to be disruptive but that it supports it. "I never feel like Emily is taking out DM in the wrong direction, it might surprise your DM and any time she can surprise Brennan Lee Mulligan I support it because that's one of the smartest men aline, I don't even know how you can surprise him."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"They may seem like they're taking crazy choices, but they're choices that are supporting the story"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Speaking to the mention of cats in this year's title there are cats getting brought into the picture. Ginny Di and Emily Axford will be joining the table of dogs as their pet cats.</p>

<p>Focusing on the idea of the Puppy Roll starting as dogs, before expanding Bhimani spoke a bit about the relationship she had with her own dog Charley. "I had such an incredible relationship with our dog Charley, he was so much of who I am and many of the parts of myself that I like came from loving him and learning how to love him better."</p>

<p>"That connection that we have with animals, whether they're our animals or other people's animals, but there are so many relationships that are extraordinary between humans and animals"</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"They give us so much healing so with them giving us so much it means so much to be able to return that to them."</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Em-BARK-ing On An Adventure</h2>

<p>The Puppy Roll is going to be a direct sequel to the original adventure, picking up with the same heroes as they continue to adventure. Talking more about the plotline Bhimani explained "We will be in the land of Doggo and some of the locations within Doggo, but we will also be exploring outside of Doggo." That's where Bhimani cut me off for fear of spoilers…</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-puppy-roll-ii-dm-anjali.jpg?itok=mLKfZ1e9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-puppy-roll-ii-dm-anjali.jpg?itok=V86oFLka 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>To create an adventure of dogs means that the world also has to be filled with dogs. Discussing the ways roleplaying people and pooches differ Bhimani was able to shed some light on the situation "It's so much fun, the Puppy Roll last year was the second time I've DM'd and I think there's some freedom to 'I don't know what I don't know'." One thing that she did want to make clear was that these dogs aren't anthropomorphic dogs, but instead the pets as they are in real life.</p>

<p>Bhimani shared a fascinating anecdote about sitting on a plane shifting between writing her published adventure, The Malady of Minarrh, while also working off the different Dungeons &amp; Dragons source books to find what spells and magical items would fit into a world of puppy puns.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I had two windows and one of them was like demon possession, and the other one was about puppy puns and I was like 'this is the extraordinary thing that is my life'"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Continuing to discuss the idea of translating your own pet into a D&amp;D character Bhimani was firm on the idea of creating characters that were accurate to the real life counterparts. "Cricket, the cleric, worships Maggie Robinson, that is her deity. What these players have been able to do is think 'if I'm still here what is it about my pet that makes them a particular class.'"</p>

<p>Honing in on one example she talked about Omar, Matthew Mercer and Marisha Ray's corgi. "He's such a perfect Paladin/Barbarian. He is so noble, he is such a protector, he also kinda has this crazy energy. When you see Matt playing it you totally will understand it."</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-puppy-roll-ii-petco-love.jpg?itok=l_tgq8hN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-puppy-roll-ii-petco-love.jpg?itok=VBjtc-li 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>If you're planning on watching the stream then you can also donate to a good cause not just to change the lives of animals with the support of PetCo Love, but also alter moments in the game. There are donation incentives and wars that will allow you to gift the players or DM ins-paw-ation or advantage.</p>

<p>For those who aren't able to catch the stream live there will be additional waves of giveaways and chances to donate too. Bhimani jokes that the only reason they even took down the tiltify for last year's Puppy Roll is because they wanted to put up the one from this year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can check out The Puppy Roll II live on October 20, 2025, at 6 pm PST on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAgOvCVQ5U3nNeoka-GroeQ" rel="nofollow">Anjali Bhimani's YouTube channel</a> where the VOD will stay available to watch at any time. You can <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/www.thepuppyroll.com" rel="nofollow">check out the full site for more information</a>, or the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/bit.ly/thepuppyroll2" rel="nofollow">Tiltify campaign to see how your donations can affect the game</a>.</p>
