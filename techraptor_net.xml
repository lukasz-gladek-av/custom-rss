            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You've just woken up in a grimy, dark warehouse. There's a throbbing in your head. The voice on the radio says he just implanted a bomb in your brain. Do what you're asked, or it's lights out. Forever.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Pigface</em>&nbsp;makes a strong first impression. I came in expecting more of a horror slant, as it publisher <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/dread-xp" rel="nofollow">DreadXP's</a> specialty, but was met with something more akin to an <a href="https://techraptor.net/genre/immersive-sim" rel="nofollow">immersive sim</a>&nbsp;combined with&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/genre/first-person-shooter/games" rel="nofollow">retro shooter elements</a>. This Early Access build of&nbsp;<em>Pigface</em>&nbsp;offers a brief, but thrilling look at what we can expect in its full release, and now I'm chomping at the bit to see what's next.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pigface-gunplay.jpg?itok=5lgN0AH9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pigface-gunplay.jpg?itok=b1G5XmNf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Spray and pray.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><h2>Contract Killing in&nbsp;<em>Pigface</em></h2>

<p>In&nbsp;<em>Pigface,&nbsp;</em>you're tasked with taking on various hits. You're essentially a cleaner, a professional at killing. Boot up your old, early 2000s laptop in the rundown apartment you live in and get to work. The first job is a farmhouse; apparently, some folks called "The Smilers" need killing. While you're at it, you'll need to grab a sample of their drugs and folders with info on their other hideouts.</p>

<p>With the money that you earn on jobs, you're able to purchase new equipment. This mostly comes in the form of guns, and as you progress, players can buy even better firearms and attachments for them. There are also melee weapons, body armor, morphine, and tools like landmines. Whatever you need to get the job done.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pigface-gameplay-farmhouse.jpg?itok=lOgdaQLQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pigface-gameplay-farmhouse.jpg?itok=jrN5Cg5a 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I can here them walkin' around up there...</figcaption></figure><p>So for this first job, you're short on cash and it's actually pretty tricky with few tools at your disposal. The farm is inhabited by over 20 armed thugs, and you're given, essentially, nothing but the most basic items. The good news is, you can approach&nbsp;<em>Pigface</em>'s levels in many different ways, which makes it feel quite a bit like an immersive sim.</p>

<p>Since I was surrounded by all sides by goons armed to the teeth, sneaking around was key. I didn't hit the farmhouse first since it was chock full of The Smilers, so I went to the barn and took out some thugs in a frantic firefight.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Eventually, I make my way to the house on the property. It's a mini fortress, with sentries up high and patrols all around. Thankfully, I've got more ammo for a TEC-9 I scavenged.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pigface-gun.jpg?itok=sa_efju9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pigface-gun.jpg?itok=LISkHjZl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The dreaded silenced .357.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Pigface</em>'s Tools of the Trade</h2>

<p>Scavenging seems like a key component to&nbsp;<em>Pigface</em>, too, since ammo is a finite resource. You're not running around, picking up floating ammo refills. You'll have to make do with the guns of your enemies once you run out of your main weapon's ammo. If all else fails, use a melee weapon like a hammer, but that makes you extremely vulnerable. Use of cover and not rushing in head-on seems crucial.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You're pretty susceptible to gunfire in&nbsp;<em>Pigface</em>, but enemies are equally so. Unlike, say, a boomer shooter, enemies drop down a bit quicker. A headshot is immediately lethal, but depending on the weapon, even a shot to the body may drop them for good.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pigface-shotgun.jpg?itok=piP08M5l 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pigface-shotgun.jpg?itok=X7NhqAUm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>He won't see this coming.</figcaption></figure><p>While at first you feel at a disadvantage with the number of enemies, later missions start to feel easier. Levels grow in both size and complexity, but the weapons and tools available to you level the playing field. I appreciate the flexibility players are given with their build, especially with weapon variety.</p>

<p>There are pistols, rifles, and machine guns, all of which behave different. Some of them have optional scope or silencer attachments, while others don't. Gunplay feels more realistic than your usual shooter. There isn't a reticle, so you're reliant on iron sights, though some guns don't even have that.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pigface-sniper.jpg?itok=CWbRcN6h 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pigface-sniper.jpg?itok=Euj3Daz4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Like fish in a barrel, really.</figcaption></figure><h2>Death From Afar</h2>

<p>Some weapons could use some balancing, though, as they make&nbsp;<em>Pigface'</em>s missions far too trivial. I equipped myself with a scoped .357 magnum and sniped enemies from afar. They weren't able to tell where my bullets came from, so it was just a matter of picking everyone off one by one.</p>

<p>This was without a silencer attached to the magnum, by the way. Using a silencer would have made things even&nbsp;<em>easier</em>&nbsp;since enemies can detect noise, so my choice in not using one was to add just a little bit of a challenge. Hopefully, in later builds, highly accurate, long-range weapons have a trade-off, so it's not so easy to abuse this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I hope the core gameplay loop of&nbsp;<em>Pigface</em>&nbsp;stays true to how it is currently. Completing objectives like eliminating certain targets or destroying drug-making materials in any manner I see fit is simple but enjoyable. The gunplay ticks all the right boxes, even if it doesn't feel like a traditional shooter, and if I can get even more fun guns to play with, all the better.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pigface-humor.jpg?itok=Y7-mRYpO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pigface-humor.jpg?itok=_aAmU8Rz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I'm coming on Friday!</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Pigface </em>Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>The aesthetic for&nbsp;<em>Pigface</em>&nbsp;is not necessarily completely original, but I enjoy look it's going for. The low-poly graphics and the piss-colored filter gives off a certain dark, brooding, edgy feel. It's an uncompromising, dirty, and extremely violent shooter involving some dirty work, so it all fits thematically.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Whether you're trudging through the sewers of a dilapidated suburb or shooting your way through a rinky-dink motel full of drugs and thugs, the Early Access for&nbsp;<em>Pigface</em>&nbsp;is a promising first look. Who knows, there might even be a few surprises waiting for players in the future. I can't wait to see for myself!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Bokura and publisher A Plus have announced the release date for upcoming MMORPG&nbsp;<em>Blue Protocol: Star Resonance</em>, and it won't be long before you get to play this one on either mobile or PC.</p>

<p>As revealed in a press release,&nbsp;<em>Blue Protocol: Star Resonance&nbsp;</em>will be launching on October 9th, following a closed beta period during which "over 29,000 players" made their way into the game's world of Regnus.</p>

<p>The game will be available across PC, iOS, and Android, and the developers confirm that it will support cross-platform play, meaning you can pick up where you left off on PC or mobile. Bokura and A Plus have also confirmed that you'll be able to play alongside your friends on other platforms.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/blue-protocol-star-resonance-release-date-combat.jpg?itok=Vvz_2Gj9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/blue-protocol-star-resonance-release-date-combat.jpg?itok=Iw_M4-10 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Blue Protocol: Star Resonance&nbsp;</em>is launching in October.</figcaption></figure><p>Just in case you're wondering,&nbsp;<em>Blue Protocol: Star Resonance&nbsp;</em>isn't just a re-release of the original&nbsp;<em>Blue Protocol</em>, which had its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/blue-protocol-canceled-west-japan-service-ending" rel="nofollow">Western launch canceled last year</a>.</p>

<p>Instead, according to the game's <a href="https://star-resonance.com/faqs/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official FAQ</a>, it tells a "completely new story with original characters", alongside "significant changes" to the original game's maps. You can also expect all-new classes, new guild halls and activities, and new "life skills" like botany and fishing.</p>

<p>If you decide to head into this one (and it is, as you've probably guessed, entirely free to play), then you'll be able to choose whether you want to take part in epic raids, kick back with some fishing, or just chill out in one of Regnus' more populated areas.</p>

<p>Should you decide to take the fight to&nbsp;<em>Blue Protocol: Star Resonance</em>'s many monsters, you'll find a flexible class system that lets you swap styles "anytime", as well as bosses that "demand teamwork".</p>




<p>If you happen to have a Crunchyroll membership, then you can link it up with&nbsp;<em>Blue Protocol: Star Resonance&nbsp;</em>for some extra goodies as well, including "avatar frames, mount skins, and more". We'll get more info about this feature soon, according to Bokura and A Plus.</p>

<p><em>Blue Protocol: Star Resonance&nbsp;</em>is due to launch for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3681810/Blue_Protocol_Star_Resonance/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and mobile devices on October 9th. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Quite a few survival crafting games take place in a tropical setting, and they each have their own spin on the formula — whether it's aiming for realism or leaning more toward a fantasy adventure. In this&nbsp;<em>Voyagers of Nera</em>&nbsp;preview, I'll go over the good (and the bad) of this latest survival crafting experience from Treehouse Games.</p>

<p><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="733ce2a9-3d2e-4af6-88be-c6f61d51c3a1" href="https://techraptor.net/games/voyagers-of-nera" rel="nofollow"><em>Voyagers of Nera</em></a>&nbsp;is the first title from Treehouse Games, a remote-first game developer. Players take on the role of an "Echo," a long-dormant guardian who has awoken to a world in chaos. Now, it's up to you and your friends to rescue lost spirits and defeat monstrous creatures of all sizes across the land.</p>

<p><em>Voyagers of Nera</em>&nbsp;is fairly light on story, at least in its Early Access launch version. You've been hibernating for a long time, and the world has gone to hell in a handbasket in your absence; now it's up to you to rescue lost <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="534397b6-4f38-40c6-ae79-440c3d125e7c" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/voyagers-of-nera-spirits-guide-locations-and-unlocks" rel="nofollow">"Guide Spirits"</a> and set things right.</p>

<p>The first hour or so of&nbsp;<em>Voyagers of Nera</em>&nbsp;is standard fare for a survival crafting game tutorial; you learn basic movement and combat as you rescue a Guide Spirit from enemies. Once that's done, you emerge from the temple to find yourself on a beach with a massive stone arm lying in the distance — welcome to The Embrace.</p>

<p>Your first step is to <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="56fa317b-b55f-42a0-9cbf-d09be5ab7c39" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/voyagers-of-nera-crafting-guide" rel="nofollow">craft</a> some basic tools and build a <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="be6a37b3-059c-47bf-8104-2c8465fec5ab" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/voyagers-of-nera-spirit-anchor-guide" rel="nofollow">Spirit Anchor</a>. The Spirit Anchor is a massive stone monument that protects the area around <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3851694e-9f68-40f0-81ae-37d0afb04802" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/voyagers-of-nera-building-guide" rel="nofollow">your base</a> and gives rescued Guide Spirits a safe haven from the forces of darkness.

<p>The Early Access launch version of&nbsp;<em>Voyagers of Nera</em>&nbsp;has <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="695708b2-0456-4bfc-aca7-983b8bff8b6b" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/voyagers-of-nera-map-and-locations-guide" rel="nofollow">a map</a> that is split into three distinctive regions: The Embrace, The Reef, and The Greatwood. These areas are separated by masses of rocks known as "The Deep," filled with a corrupting aura and stalked by a massive sea monster that can tear you to pieces.</p>

<p>You can travel from island to island within a region by running, swimming, or using a <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="02803ce6-aafd-4617-8ce2-79760299d79c" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/how-to-get-skimmer-in-voyagers-of-nera" rel="nofollow">Skimmer</a>&nbsp;(which is essentially a magical surfboard), but you'll almost certainly need a proper boat to travel between the major regions.</p>

<p>Both of the available <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fe7167a1-adba-4d35-bc38-08e684a14e7e" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/how-to-get-boat-in-voyagers-of-nera" rel="nofollow">boats</a> are fairly large, and it can be difficult to navigate some of the tighter waterways. It's especially challenging to use a boat as a solo player since you'll need to raise the sail to gain speed and then move to the rudder to steer it. It appears that the bigger boats are intended to be piloted by a crew of two people.</p>

<p>Fortunately, you only really <em>need</em>&nbsp;boats for traveling between regions or moving large amounts of cargo; you can get by traveling within a region using your Skimmer and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6e1baf40-feae-4feb-a2a1-0a7c3829dbba" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/how-to-get-glider-in-voyagers-of-nera" rel="nofollow">glider</a>. Still, it would have been nice to have a larger boat with some cargo space that could be piloted by a solo player more easily.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/voyagers-of-nera-preview-fighting-a-construct-in-ruins-in-voyagers-of-nera.jpg?itok=_YVXYzdw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/voyagers-of-nera-preview-fighting-a-construct-in-ruins-in-voyagers-of-nera.jpg?itok=E1jmxzW8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Each region has 3 ruins that must explore to free a fragment of an Elder Spirit, usually by defeating a "Construct" in combat.</figcaption></figure><h2>Swimming in Circles</h2>

<p>However you travel, your ultimate goal is to rescue the Guide Spirits of the world one by one. Each rescued Guide Spirit powers up your base just a little more, allowing you to use new crafting stations to better equip you for the more difficult zones.</p>

<p>You can explore the world to find Guide Spirits on your own. You'll get a warning message that a nearby spirit is in danger when you're close, but it can be difficult to find them sometimes. Fortunately, the Spirit Anchor can be used to point you to a Guide Spirit in the region that you have not yet rescued.</p>

<p>Regrettably, it appears that the Spirit Anchor can only point you to one unrescued Guide Spirit at a time, and that results in a somewhat predictable gameplay loop: find a Guide Spirit, rescue it, return home, and use the Spirit Anchor to find the location of the next Guide Spirit to rescue.</p>

<p>Your quest to rescue the Guide Spirits is dragged out by a lack of useful fast travel. You can build an <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="35964fa7-4053-43a1-87dc-1661b562379a" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/voyagers-of-nera-ancients-gate-guide" rel="nofollow">Ancient's Gate</a> to easily travel between two bases, but you can only have a handful of bases total. As far as I can tell, there is no item to quickly teleport you back to your base in the game yet, either.</p>

<p>There isn't much preventing you from building a boat and sailing all the way to the last region, although that's ill-advised; as you might expect, enemies get progressively tougher as you move to each subsequent region. You can't rescue most Guide Spirits if you're not equipped to kill the enemies holding them hostage.</p>

<p>You're also limited to only one base until you level up your Spirit Anchor. Currently, you're limited to a maximum of four Spirit Anchors; that's just enough for one base in each region, plus a spare. You can build wherever you like, but the functionality of a base is hamstrung without the multitude of buffs a Spirit Anchor provides.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Although Voyagers of Nera's world is fairly wide, it feels seomwhat shallow with a lack of side activities for you to take on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The meat of the game is rescuing Guide Spirits, leveling up your Knowledge Tree to craft more gear, and eventually progressing to more difficult regions. Each region introduces new enemies and new obstacles for you to face, so there's a serviceable amount of variety in the combat challenges you'll encounter.</p>

<p>That said, there isn't much beyond the core gameplay loop of alternating between rescuing Guide Spirits and crafting better gear. Although <i>Voyagers of Nera's</i>&nbsp;world is fairly wide, it feels somewhat shallow with a lack of side activities for you to take on.</p>

<p>I enjoyed my time exploring the world of&nbsp;<em>Voyagers of Nera</em>. I had fun exploring the islands and rescuing Guide Spirits, but the lack of things to do between those core gameplay objectives made it feel a little light on meaningful, engaging content.</p>

<p><em>Voyagers of Nera</em>&nbsp;could be a great survival game once it has matured a bit, expanded on its features, and added a little more variety in its gameplay. Unless you're dead set on playing it, it's probably best to hold off on playing this game&nbsp;until it has a couple of major content updates under its belt.</p>

<hr><p><strong>Voyagers of Nera</strong><em>&nbsp;was previewed over approximately 99 hours of gameplay on PC via&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2686630/Voyagers_of_Nera/" rel="nofollow">Steam</a>&nbsp;with a key provided by the publisher. All screenshots were taken during the preview process.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega has released a brand new trailer for&nbsp;<em>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</em>, and it contains some not-so-subtle jabs at racing rival&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>, as well as Sega's general history of rivalry with Nintendo.</p>

<p>In the trailer (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/sega-references-its-past-feud-with-nintendo-in-shady-ad-comparing-sonic-racing-crossworlds-and-mario-kart-world/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Automaton Media</a>), we see a TV, on which a heavily pixelated kart racing game is being played. It's pretty obviously&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>, and the camera quickly pans to a much more sophisticated TV, on which&nbsp;<em>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds&nbsp;</em>appears.</p>

<p>Quickly, the&nbsp;<em>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds&nbsp;</em>TV is attached to a sleek, speedy racing car, while the&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>TV, as seemingly befits its low-tech status, is hitched to a juddering RV. Just in case you needed some extra help, the RV is pictured next to a tortoise.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sonic-racing-crossworlds-ad-rv.jpg?itok=BvrNJDPW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sonic-racing-crossworlds-ad-rv.jpg?itok=haSK0OWi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The new&nbsp;<em>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</em>&nbsp;ad isn't exactly subtle.</figcaption></figure><p>The ad closes with an invitation to players to "come race on our level", and in the trailer's description, Sega recommends players "leave the open road behind", which seems to me to be a pretty obvious jab at&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-nintendo-direct" rel="nofollow">open...well, world</a>.</p>

<p>It seems that Sega is poking fun at the old rivalry between itself and Nintendo, which primarily existed throughout the fourth and fifth console generations (and, partially, the sixth, before the Dreamcast sank without a trace and the PS2 ascended into the heavens).</p>

<p>It's the beef that gave rise to the legendary "Genesis does what Nintendon't" slogan, and while there's nothing quite so direct on offer here, it's fun to see Sega back to its old prickly self, even if it is just for a few moments.</p>

<p>You can check out the playful and fun new&nbsp;<em>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds&nbsp;</em>ad right here. Just don't write any hate mail to Sega about how Nintendo is clearly better (or vice versa) once you're done, OK?</p>




<p><i>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds&nbsp;</i>is due to launch for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2486820/Sonic_Racing_CrossWorlds/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/sonic-racing-crossworlds/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/sonic-racing-crossworlds/9NMR17QTLC33" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/sonic-racing-crossworlds-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> on September 25th, and a release for Switch 2 is also planned for this year. Stay tuned for more.</p>
