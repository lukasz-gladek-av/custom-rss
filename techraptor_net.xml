            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/split-fiction-preview-double-vision<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hazelight Studios has become something of a darling since its inception. With projects like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-e3-2017-hazelight-studios-showcases-way-out" rel="nofollow"><em>A Way Out</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/it-takes-two-sales-stride-across-10-million-barrier" rel="nofollow"><em>It Takes Two</em></a> gathering critical acclaim, the announcement of <em>Split Fiction</em> feels like another step forward for the developer, and a massive one at that.</p>

<p>From the outset, what drew me to the game was its very concept – two characters having to work together, jumping across worlds and even genres in what looked like one of the most creative games I’ve ever seen possible. After getting some time to sit down with <em>Split Fiction</em>, I can safely say that my first impression is not only valid but only scratches the surface of what the team at Hazelight have put together here.</p>

<p>From the several hours I got to play (with a partner of course, since this a cooperative experience), I got to see how <em>Split Fiction</em> opens with a little bit of setup. That setup amounts to a quick introduction to the main characters: two women known as Zoe and Mio, who have been invited to ink their own deal with a company known as Rader Publishing.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/split-fiction-02.jpg?itok=NRF8gC_B 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/split-fiction-02.jpg?itok=8fHQ-B1f 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>We see the pair meet moments before things start to get a little suspicious – it seems this publishing house and its creator have something more off the books planned for the gathered participants. Mio and Zoe are then tasked to suit up, and prepare to enter an experimental machine – one which will effectively bring their stories to life. Mio, however, isn’t buying it, and as she tries to back out, gets thrown into Zoe’s simulation.</p>

<p>It’s there that the pair ends up on a collision course together, and they’ll have to work in tandem to follow through glitches as they swap each other’s stories in order to escape the system and stop their ideas from being stolen.</p>

<p>What this amounts to is a crazy mash-up of science fiction (courtesy of Mio), and fantasy levels (from Zoe’s mind) combined with fast-paced action spread over a multitude of gameplay styles.</p>

<p>One minute they’ll be in a dystopian sci-fi level with plenty of platforming and having to work together to escape. In the next, Mio and Zoe are in a quaint fantasy town being overrun by trolls and they’re forced to run through the level while jumping over and climbing up obstacles.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/split-fiction-01_0.jpg?itok=NtdTrnCI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/split-fiction-01_0.jpg?itok=Qji817tr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Of the different worlds I got to see in the preview, the one that really stood out was a futuristic, sci-fi setting known as Neon Revenge that had Mio and Zoe set up as cyborg ninjas. Not unlike <em>Metal Gear Rising</em>, Mio got to handle a gravity-defying blade, whilst Zoe took control of a whip that could grab items in the environment.</p>

<p>And this wasn’t just a short experience either. This specific story of Mio’s had multiple parts and each one did well to break up the gameplay in fun and interesting ways. In one part, they had to work together to leap across moving vehicles, which lead to a boss fight, which then lead to a racing bike segment, and even that had some wacky gameplay elements like one character needing to solve a CAPCHA on a phone to stop a self-detonation sequence.</p>

<p><em>Split Fiction</em> is just so wild in every way and felt very non-stop from the three hours I got to play of it. That said, there are some quieter moments in things like side stories – one of which had us playing as pigs who needed to grab apples to open doors, and then that lead to a bit of a morbid conclusion.</p>

<p>Then we had a go in a fantasy level that reminded me more of <em>Monster Hunter</em> mixed with <em>How to Train Your Dragon</em>, and this one was a more laid-back, puzzle-based experience with having to work together as a team to move objects around, create platforms, and activate several items around a temple. So there is that sort of variety in <em>Split Fiction</em> that expands just beyond the frenetic style in some of the levels I did see.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/split-fiction-03.jpg?itok=JG33xPCm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/split-fiction-03.jpg?itok=5Lrijqmv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Beyond that, we were shown a snowboarding level evocative of EA’s own SSX series, Mio and Zoe playing as literal pinballs in a machine against a boss, and a classic sidescrolling shooter level not unlike the Contra series.</p>

<p>There’s a lot, and it’s kind of amazing that all of this has been put into <em>Split Fiction</em>, and that it works so seamlessly. Even with all the genre and gameplay swapping, it never felt cumbersome, and getting used to the controls every time felt rather natural because everything is spelled out and kept to a few buttons regardless of the level.</p>

<p>A lot of the intuitive nature of <em>Split Fiction</em> relies on the co-operative gameplay, and having to work together, and get used to working together to solve platforming puzzles, or activate doors, and even get into a gunship and shoot down enemies together.</p>

<p>There’s a sense of competition as well because both Mio and Zoe have different abilities, and there’s a lot of opportunity to lean into each other’s strengths and then perhaps later, the replayability aspect comes into play because they’re both doing different things despite the split screen across the same worlds.</p>

<p>So yes, <em>Split Fiction</em> is every bit as promising as it looked at first sight. And like I said, I only got to play around three hours total, but in that time there was already such a breadth of variety, I can only be left wondering just what else has been jam-packed into this crazy adventure.</p>

<p>If anything, it’s safe to say Hazelight has another sure-fire hit on their hands and I can't wait to see what happens next when <em>Split Fiction</em> launches in just a few short weeks.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-update-12</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stalker-2-update-1-2-brings-over-1700-fixes-including-a-life-improvements.1108563/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-update-12<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GSC Game World has released&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>Update 1.2, a mammoth patch that introduces "over 1700 fixes and improvements to all aspects of the game".</p>

<p>That might sound like a lot of fixes, but it's actually a slightly smaller number than those introduced in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-update-1-1-a-life" rel="nofollow">December's Update 1.1</a>, which boasted more than 1800 improvements and tweaks.</p>

<p>Like that update, though, today's patch brings fixes for the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-a-life-20-gsc-game-world" rel="nofollow">rather controversial A-Life system</a>, introducing more ways in which NPCs can interact with the world around them. You'll also find changes to balance, optimization, story elements, and much, much more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stalker-2-update-1.2-gameplay.jpg?itok=ClJljDbI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stalker-2-update-1.2-gameplay.jpg?itok=Ix-oPoMV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Stalker 2</em>&nbsp;Update 1.2 is here, and it's another big one.</figcaption></figure><p>With regards to A-Life, fixes include NPCs no longer being able to loot corpses' body armor and helmets, as well as characters not healing allies NPCs. A-Life NPCs will also no longer have access to quest locations, and the AI can't spawn corpses near the player anymore.</p>

<p>Amusingly, the stealth AI has been improved so that NPCs can no longer "end up behind the player" following a melee attack. So much for studying the blade, I suppose.</p>

<p>An absolute ton of story bugs have been fixed, including characters not spawning during the "Wishful Thinking" mission, as well as the Three Captains mission auto-completing shortly after being accepted.</p>

<p>It's well worth reading through <a href="https://www.stalker2.com/en/news/patch-1-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the full patch notes</a> for&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>Update 1.2, although you will probably want to grab a hot drink or something, because reading every single fix is going to take you quite a while.</p>




<p><em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>is the latest entry in GSC Game World's ambitious (but frequently janky)&nbsp;<em>Stalker&nbsp;</em>series. It's absolutely not the second entry, either.</p>

<p>The game once again sees you entering the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone in search of loot and fame. You'll meet various factions along the way, each of which has its own agenda, and you'll have to decide how to deal with these factions while also pursuing your own goals.</p>

<p><em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/stalker-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and it's also available on PC Game Pass or Game Pass Ultimate.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/split-fiction-interview-discussing-challenge-of-blending-sci-fi-and-fantasy-in<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Anticipations are running high for Hazelight Studios' next game, <em>Split Fiction</em>. Following the success of <em>It Takes Two</em>, studio creative director Josef Fares has set his sights on their most ambitious game yet – one that weaves a multitude of genres and gameplay in a meshing together of sci-fi and fantasy stories.</p>

<p>We had a chance to sit down with the director and discuss some of his journey as a developer from the success of games like <em>Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons</em> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/go-on-co-op-journey-with-it-takes-two" rel="nofollow"><em>It Takes Two</em></a>, to highlighting the challenges of creating <em>Split Fiction</em> and the importance of aiming to provide a fresh and engaging experience for players.</p>

<p>Hazelight’s previous title, <em>It Takes Two</em>, was highly successful, so it’s a little curious if that was something that was expected given how stacked 2021 was in terms of games and if that has had any impact going into the development of <em>Split Fiction</em>.</p>

<p>“It’s been a crazy journey,” said Fares.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/split-fiction-04.jpg?itok=T8GO8UIA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/split-fiction-04.jpg?itok=ywzQC-LG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>“It’s interesting because I’m a huge gamer myself, it’s kind of a weird feeling but I’m also extremely proud of all that’s happened, and the impact we’ve had in the gaming industry. I strongly believe you do what you believe in, you follow your passion and it’s gonna land good.</p>

<p>“If you’re talking about expectations, it wasn’t really an issue. We know a lot of people love our games, but that can’t be in our heads when we start. You just got to trust your vision and go with it.</p>

<p>“This was definitely the hardest game we have done considering the mechanics and the variety," Fares said. "In [<em>Split Fiction</em>], you need everything to feel crisp and nice and polished. That was super hard.”</p>

<p>So despite the success of <em>It Takes Two</em>, it became more about believing in what you do and going with it. The team never really thought much back on the previous game when starting the process for <em>Split Fiction</em>.</p>

<p>That said, it’s pretty clear Hazelight does favor a particular style and that’s one built around co-operative gameplay. Defining that style, as well as keeping things fresh, however, is a different story and might not always be restricted to that for the studio.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/split-fiction-05.jpg?itok=lFNr5g1N 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/split-fiction-05.jpg?itok=1OPtIq3X 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>“I often feel that some games are too repetitive,” said Fares. “When I was new in the industry, people were questioning it all the time. But now I have my own studio so nobody can question it, so you can do whatever you want.</p>

<p>“And also it started the way all the games we do, it starts from like, I want to play a game like that. So that’s where <em>Brothers</em> started. With that said, Hazelight will always have the co-op DNA in it, but we’ll probably also explore single-player games in the future but with a Hazelight twist.”</p>

<p>In terms of this co-operative core focus for the past 10 years of work, we were curious if Fares had felt there had been a peak to reach, or if there was enough experimentation within that core that sprouts out with each new iteration.</p>

<p>“That would definitely be like, becoming better in designing the co-op games, writing them, production-wise, getting them to a good level of polish,” Fares explained. “We also have something really crazy in this game that’s gonna happen at the end, and I can guarantee you, you’ve never seen it in a video game before. It’s really fucked up."</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/split-fiction-06.jpg?itok=OJP1DhUy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/split-fiction-06.jpg?itok=T4X-V32k 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>“So we have some really crazy stuff, but again there’s so much more to be explored in telling a story like this, and when you practice, there’s no limitation to what you can do. There’s so much different stuff to experiment with, there’s so many ideas you can do.</p>

<p>“But here, this isn’t your typical co-op [mode], this is written and designed from the beginning as co-op which means you have different characters depending on who you play.”</p>

<p>Certainly, Fares believes there’s a lot of stuff they can become better at. Making a game is a lot harder than making movies, after all, so to him it’s about “how do you keep that passion?”</p>

<p>One thing being introduced to<em> Split Fiction</em> is the addition of optional side stories to flesh out the experience.</p>

<p>“We call them Hazelight moments,” said Fares in reference to one <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/split-fiction-preview-double-vision" rel="nofollow">particular grim side story that was shown during the preview</a>. “You can skip them but we’ll make sure you can see them. But we’ve seen that people really want to play them.”</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/split-fiction-07.jpg?itok=oAxPPSEc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/split-fiction-07.jpg?itok=x-onsT1G 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>But as far as the overall aesthetic of <em>Split Fiction</em> goes, it’s curious to note that it relies on a lot of originality and no specific inspiration.</p>

<p>“The whole core of it was like blending sci-fi and fantasy,” Fares explained. “It felt very fresh and unique, and when we started with that, we thought there was going to be a lot of TV and moves that were similar, but we’ve done nothing really like that. You have parallel universes and stuff, but we haven’t had this combination of fantasy and sci-fi.”</p>

<p>One of the unique aspects of <em>Split Fiction</em> is its dual female protagonists – Mio and Zoe, and there is a bit of an inspiration behind this decision.</p>

<p>“Well, the first game, <em>Brothers</em>, was two males,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/way-out-review-cooperative-camp" rel="nofollow"><em>A Way Out</em></a> also had two males, and<em> It Takes Two</em> had one male and one female,” said Fares.</p>

<p>“Now it’s like, come on, let’s do two females. Otherwise, it becomes, just a lot of guys all over. But yeah, it feels natural. And also, my daughters are Mio and Zoe, so it felt like a right time to do a game about two female characters because there were always so much guys in games. It can’t just be boys.”</p>

<p>Indeed, it can’t just be boys. With that approach in hand, we’re left with one final bit of advice for those who are new to Hazelight’s brand of co-op adventures.</p>

<p>“You’re gonna experience something than you’ve never experienced before,” said Fares. “Get ready for a wild ride, and yeah you’re gonna see some crazy stuff for sure.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-sales-75m-best-quarter-ever<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has announced that the PS5 has enjoyed its best quarter yet in terms of sales, bringing total lifetime unit shipments past a major milestone.</p>

<p>In its latest <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/24q3_supplement.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">financial report</a> (which covers the fiscal year's third quarter), Sony reveals that it sold 9.5 million PS5 units during the quarter, bringing the console's total lifetime sales over the 75 million mark.</p>

<p>The quarter stands as the PS5's best yet, beating the same period in 2023 by 1.3 million sales despite the fact that the third quarter of 2023 offered up <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-sales-pass-548-milion-units-marvels-spider-man-2-has-sold-10-million-copies" rel="nofollow">a major hit in the form of&nbsp;<em>Marvel's Spider-Man 2</em></a>.</p>

<p>This means two things. First off, we don't know how well the PS5 Pro has done in isolation; we only know that it's contributed in some way to the 9.5 million number. Second, We don't know what proportion of that 9.5 million consoles represents PS5 Pro sales.</p>

<p>While it's more than likely Sony's hardware business got a boost from the PS5 Pro, the console does boast what is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-pro-announced-november" rel="nofollow">arguably a rather prohibitive price point</a> for a general gaming audience, so whether it's sold the kind of numbers that would significantly boost the console's totals is hard to say.</p>

<p>Still, it'll likely provide a confidence boost for Sony, especially after a year that offered up what is probably one of the company's biggest gaming embarrassments in history in the form of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds" rel="nofollow">launch and swift cancellation</a> of hero shooter&nbsp;<em>Concord</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/days-gone-remastered-sony-ps5.jpg?itok=h6gWhUsA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/days-gone-remastered-sony-ps5.jpg?itok=lv2i9F0E 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sony held a State of Play showcase yesterday, during which we learned what's coming to PS5 soon.</figcaption></figure><p>The company sold 95.9 million software units during the quarter, of which 11.6 million were first-party games, although it doesn't provide a breakdown of which games contributed the most to that total.</p>

<p>Sony also reports an increase in PlayStation Plus users, which will likely come as a relief since subscriber numbers remained static throughout the first two quarters of the year.</p>

<p>As for the future, Sony held a State of Play showcase yesterday during which it showed off upcoming PS5 games like&nbsp;<em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</em>,&nbsp;<em>Sonic Racing CrossWorlds</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Days Gone Remastered</em>.

<p>In its latest financial report (which covers the period between October and December 2024, but also features a look ahead to the next quarter), Embracer reveals that <i>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</i>is "fast approaching" two million sales.</p>

<p>That means the game has picked up another million sales between now and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-1m" rel="nofollow">its first day on release</a>, which would explain why Embracer considers the game to have exceeded its sales estimates. Those are impressive numbers, especially for what is arguably a non-triple-A game.</p>

<p>All in all, Embracer says it expects to enjoy a stronger fourth quarter thanks to both&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>and the impending release of&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/killing-floor-3-release-date" rel="nofollow">set for launch in March</a>.</p>

<p>However, it sounds like Early Access roguelike&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>didn't sell quite as well as Embracer was hoping for, since the company says its Q4 will be "slightly negatively impacted" by the game.</p>

<p>As a reminder,&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>launched into Early Access in January and was quickly met with a negative reception, with players pointing to problems with the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hyper-light-breaker-fixes-coming" rel="nofollow">performance and accessibility features</a>, as well as what some perceive to be odd or poor design decisions.</p>

<p>The company says this number doesn't include anything being released in the current quarter, so it sounds like games like&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</em>aren't part of that figure. The games in question are set to release over the next three fiscal years.</p>

<p>Embracer also points to its "exciting mid-sized releases" schedule, which includes games like the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gothic-1-remake-2025-release-window" rel="nofollow">long-awaited&nbsp;<em>Gothic 1 Remake</em></a>, ARPG&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest 2</em>, and the console release for&nbsp;<em>Satisfactory</em>.</p>
