            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Darrington Press has announced pre-orders for its first official <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/daggerheart-review-narrative-forward-yes-and-ttrpg-that-is-force-to-be-reckoned" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Daggerheart</em></a> expansion. The expansion, Daggerheart: Hope &amp; Fear, will introduce new rules and mechanics for both players and GMs to the bestselling, acclaimed fantasy TTRPG.</p>

<h2>The <em>Daggerheart: Hope &amp; Fear</em> Pre-Order Announcement</h2>

<p>According to the <a href="https://www.daggerheart.com/pre-order/" rel="nofollow">store page</a>, <em>Daggerheart: Hope &amp; Fear</em> will provide new character-building and worldbuilding tools for your gaming table. Much like the core rulebook, this expansion will include a book, cards, and accessories. For GMs, the book will include 130 new adversaries and several new campaign frames.</p>

The Witch is notable since the class originally showed up in The Void as playtest material. This means there is precedent for other material to make the jump to official material such as the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-daggerheart-playtest-material-messes-with-monstrous-transformation" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">monstrous transformations</a> or the <em>Daggerheart</em> <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/darrington-drops-new-daggerheart-blood-hunter-playtest-material" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Blood Hunter</a>, appearing in a more horror-adjacent supplement down the line.</p>

<p><em>Daggerheart: Hope &amp; Fear</em> will be available in two versions. The standard edition is a normal printing of the book. The deluxe edition will sport a variant cover and additional accessories. If you pre-order either version, you will receive a PDF copy two weeks before the book's full release. Both versions of the book are expected to ship Summer 2026.</p>

<p>Daggerheart has had a major impact in the TTRPG space. In addition to strong reviews and sales, the game has garnered a lot of industry talent, including former <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> designers Chris Perkins and Jeremy Crawford, Eberron creator Keith Baker, and <em>Phoenix Dawn Command</em> designer Jenn Ellis.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition, the game's cultural impact has only continued to expand. This can be seen with its recent collaboration with the miniature printing platform, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hero-forge-launches-new-collaborator-collections-series-featuring-daggerheart" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Hero Forge</a>, and the runaway success of the <em>Daggerheart</em> conversion of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dungeons-of-drakkenheim-daggerheart-triumphs-on-kickstarter-hitting-funding-goal-in" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons of Drakkenheim</em></a>.</p>

<p>The standard edition of <em>Daggerheart: Hope &amp; Fear</em> is available at an MSRP of $39.99 not including shipping. The Deluxe Edition, which includes Fear tokens, 10 d12s, a GM screen, and a giant d20, is available for $119.99.</p>
