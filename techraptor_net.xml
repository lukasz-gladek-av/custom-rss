            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>developer HoYoverse has revealed the release date for Version Luna II, the gacha action RPG's next major update, and it's arriving later this month.</p>

<p>Version Luna II continues the new naming conventions established for the game with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-luna-i" rel="nofollow">September's Version Luna I</a>, and it's set to land on October 22nd. You can expect the advent of the new user-generated content system, plus a new character and much more.</p>

<p>As teased during Version Luna I's cycle, the Miliastra Wonderland, which serves as&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact</em>'s UGC hub, will make its debut in this new update. That means "hundreds of Stages that encourage creativity and exploration", according to HoYoverse.</p>

<p>If you're not into the whole user-generated content stuff, though, don't worry; there's still plenty of classic&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>for you to enjoy in Version Luna II, including a new Archon Quest that will see the return of "many old friends".</p>

<p>You can also look forward to a new playable character in the form of Nefer, a Dendro catalyst user who utilizes her diverse toolkit to empower her Charged Attacks and deal extra damage to enemies on the field.</p>

<p>Nefer will appear as part of this update's first half, alongside a rerun of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-furina-gameplay-video" rel="nofollow">Furina</a>, and you can expect repeats of Arlecchino and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zhongli-conducts-in-lovely-genshin-impact-anime-style-trailer-teasing-upcoming-concert" rel="nofollow">Zhongli</a> during Version Luna II's second half, so if you missed them the first time around, now's your chance to re-add them to your team.</p>




<p>News of the latest&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>update comes after the announcement of two brand new HoYoverse games, namely <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hoyoverse-petit-planet-cozy-life-sim" rel="nofollow">cutesy cosmic life sim&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hoyoverse-petit-planet-cozy-life-sim" rel="nofollow">Petit Planet</a>&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hoyoverse-honkai-nexus-anima" rel="nofollow">creature-collecting auto-chess game&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Nexus Anima</em></a>.</p>

<p><em>Genshin Impact</em>'s Version Luna II update launches on October 22nd. The game is available to <a href="https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">play for free</a> right now on PC, PlayStation, Xbox Series X|S, and mobile devices, but bear in mind that support for the PS4 version <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-ps4-support-ending" rel="nofollow">is ending next year</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Greenheart Games has finally announced the&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper&nbsp;</em>Early Access release date, so it looks like the game is about to see the light of day after eleven (!) years of development.</p>

<p>As revealed in a press release,&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper&nbsp;</em>will be launching into Early Access on PC on November 3rd. The game was originally slated to hit Early Access last year, but was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tavern-keeper-delayed-2025" rel="nofollow">delayed to 2025 to iron out bugs</a>.</p>

<p>If you've yet to try out&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper</em>'s demo, you can also take a look at an updated demo right now. It lets you loose on a chunk of the game's "interactive storytelling", according to Greenheart Games, as well as giving you a look at the Item Workshop and Freeplay features.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper</em>, well, it's one of those games for which the name rather says it all. Announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/greenheart-games-announces-tavern-keeper" rel="nofollow">all the way back in 2016</a>, it's a tavern management sim that lets you run your very own inn "in a humorous fantasy world".</p>

<p>You can decide whether you want to delve deep into the game's management systems or "simply relax and decorate" to your heart's content, and you'll also experience a story unfolding within the walls of your tavern.</p>

<p>To commemorate the release date announcement, Greenheart Games has also released a brand new trailer that should give you a sense of what you can expect from&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper</em>. You can check that trailer out right here.</p>






<p><em>Tavern Keeper&nbsp;</em>arrives on PC via Steam Early Access on November 3rd. There's no word on other platforms yet, so stay tuned for more on this and all other things&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper</em>-related.</p>
