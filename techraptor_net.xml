            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-movie-sydney-sweeney<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>movie, for which several studios were apparently engaged in a bidding war last month, has gained a new star and two pretty big-name writers.</p>

<p>According to a new Variety <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/split-fiction-movie-sydney-sweeney-jon-m-chu-video-game-1236377192/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, the movie, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-movie-report" rel="nofollow">first mooted in March</a>, will star <em>Madame Web&nbsp;</em>and <em>Immaculate</em>'s Sydney Sweeney. Variety says which of the two leads Sweeney will be playing is "undecided", although it seems fairly obvious to me that Zoe is the right choice, given Sweeney's resemblance to the character.</p>

<p>Additionally, the movie's script is being written by&nbsp;<em>Deadpool and Wolverine&nbsp;</em>scribes Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, according to Variety. The duo's other credits include the likes of&nbsp;<em>Zombieland&nbsp;</em>and 2023's&nbsp;<em>Ghosted</em>&nbsp;(although let's hope they're using the former rather than the latter as inspiration).</p>

Chu, whose name you might know from movies like&nbsp;<em>Step Up 2: The Streets</em>, Lin-Manuel Miranda's musical&nbsp;<em>In the Heights</em>, and last year's&nbsp;<em>Wicked</em>.</p>

<p>This is the second video game-based movie with which Sydney Sweeney has been associated this week. On Tuesday, it was reported that Sweeney is working alongside Michael Bay on a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/outrun-movie-report" rel="nofollow">movie adaptation of the Sega racing classic&nbsp;<em>OutRun</em></a>.</p>

<p>It's also one of several movies based on video games that are currently in the works, alongside the likes of Dread's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortuary-assistant-movie-announced" rel="nofollow"><em>The Mortuary Assistant</em></a>, Nintendo's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/live-action-zelda-movie-march-2027" rel="nofollow"><em>The Legend of Zelda&nbsp;</em>movie</a>, and a film <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-movie-is-coming-courtesy-of-hasbro-and-legendary-pictures" rel="nofollow">based on popular card game&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a>.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>, it's the latest game from&nbsp;<em>A Way Out&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two&nbsp;</em>developer Hazelight, headed up by Josef Fares. The game stars Mio and Zoe as two writers who must begrudgingly work together to battle a (very literal) corporate machine that plans to steal their ideas.</p>

<p><em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>is out now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2001120/Split_Fiction/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/split-fiction/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/games/store/split-fiction/9n1wxxd1rl8d" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.
