            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-descendant-ps4-xbox-one-ending-june<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>The First Descendant&nbsp;</em>developer and publisher Nexon has announced that it will end support for the game on last-gen consoles later this year.</p>

<p>In a developer livestream held earlier today (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/the-first-descendant-ending-support-for-last-gen-consoles/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">TheGamer</a>), Nexon revealed that the PS4 and Xbox One versions of&nbsp;<em>The First Descendant&nbsp;</em>will be shutting down on June 19th, which, as TheGamer points out, is two weeks before the first anniversary of the game's original release.</p>

<p>Nexon says that because the scale of&nbsp;<em>The First Descendant&nbsp;</em>has "increased" since release, the team is spending "a lot of effort and difficulty" keeping the PS4 and Xbox One versions of the game afloat.</p>

<p>Not only is the game being removed from Sony and Microsoft's last-gen platforms, but you won't be able to continue playing it on those platforms after June 19th, even if you have it downloaded on your system.</p>

<p>However, if you do plan to upgrade to a next-gen console, you'll be pleased to know that&nbsp;<em>The First Descendant&nbsp;</em>supports cross-saves, so you'll be able to pick up where you left off if you play on PS5 or Xbox Series X|S.</p>

<p><em>The First Descendant&nbsp;</em>launched to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2074920/charts/#max" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">extremely strong Steam player numbers</a> back in July, but the player count has significantly dwindled since then, with around 8,000 players checking out the game in the last 24 hours. That's not nothing, of course, but it's a far cry from the 264,860 players the game attracted at its peak.</p>




<p>Since launch,&nbsp;<em>The First Descendant&nbsp;</em>has received a number of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-descendant-update-new-boss-descendants" rel="nofollow">updates</a>, with new bosses, characters, and other goodies being added to the looter-shooter. The latest update adds the valkyrie-esque Serena to the game's roster, as well as new areas, a new weapon, and more.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>The First Descendant&nbsp;</em>right now for free on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2074920/The_First_Descendant/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/the-first-descendant/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/the-first-descendant/9p8fbxkmclwc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>. If you're planning to play on consoles, though, I'd plump for the PS5 or the Xbox Series X|S if I were you.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/core-keeper-bags-and-blasts-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Pugstorm and publisher Fireshine Games have announced the&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper&nbsp;</em>Bags and Blasts update, which will bring a new sub-biome, a new boss, and more next week.</p>

<p>Bags and Blasts will serve as&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper</em>'s first major update since the sandbox survival game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/core-keeper-10-update-patch-notes" rel="nofollow">launched out of Early Access back in August</a>. Its first major addition is the Oasis, a new sub-biome that you'll find within the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/core-keeper-desert-of-beginnings-biome-guide" rel="nofollow">Desert of Beginnings area</a>.</p>

<p>In the Oasis, you'll find the adorable camel-like Drohmble, which you can ranch to "uncover a valuable (but stinky) resource useful for crafting new mid-late game weaponry". That one's only for those with strong stomachs, I suppose.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/core-keeper-bags-and-blasts-update-desert.jpg?itok=m_xQ3L4V 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/core-keeper-bags-and-blasts-update-desert.jpg?itok=5wj3e42f 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll find&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper</em>'s new Oasis area in the Desert of Beginnings.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, it's not just the Drohmble you'll have to look out for. Bags and Blasts will also introduce Nimruza, a giant "super cicada" boss who serves as one of&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper</em>'s "biggest fights yet", according to Pugstorm.</p>

<p>If you're a fan of using explosives in&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper</em>, you'll likely also appreciate the new Explosives skill tree, which comes complete with eight new skills for you to try out. New bomb types will also be added, as well as a new grenade weapon type.</p>

<p>Not only that, but&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper</em>'s Bags and Blasts update also introduces Pouches, a "highly-requested" community feature that allows you to carry various resources in dedicated spaces, making inventory management easier.</p>

<p>You can also take advantage of a new hotbar swapping feature that lets you decide which inventory row you see in your hotbar. All in all, it sounds like Bags and Blasts will be perfect for you if you like to tinker with your items for hours on end.</p>




<p><em>Core Keeper</em>'s Bags and Blasts update launches on March 10th. You can check the game out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1621690/Core_Keeper/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/core-keeper/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/core-keeper/9pkw4gmx4j8k" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/core-keeper-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>, and you can read our Ashley's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/core-keeper-review" rel="nofollow">review of its 1.0 release here</a>.</p>
