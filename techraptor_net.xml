            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft is keen to revive the Halo series for the current generation with an all-new take on the classic <em>Halo: Combat Evolved</em> for Xbox Series X|S, PC, Steam, and PlayStation 5 for the first time. The announcement of <em>Halo: Campaign Evolved</em> marks a faithful and modernized remake of the original story rebuilt on a modern engine with high-definition visuals, updated cinematics and controls, and three brand-new prequel missions starring Master Chief and Sgt. Johnson. This new version of the game will also include a broader cache of weapons, vehicles, enemies, and gameplay-modifying Skulls - operational mods that can alter combat in challenging ways and increase replayability.</p>

<p><em>Halo: Campaign Evolved</em> is exactly what its title suggests - focused on the original Halo campaign. That means on console, 2-player split screen will satisfy the multiplayer requirement, while up to 4 people can play co-op online with full crossplay and cross-progression support enabled.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Halo: Campaign Evolved</em> promises the original missions, but rebuilt with enhanced level design, updated cinematics, and improved wayfinding to keep the pace moving. The soundtrack has also been remastered with sound design updated for better immersion, and new voice performances have been recorded with the main cast.</p>

<p>On the gameplay side of things, <em>Halo: Campaign Evolved</em> has made adjustments to sprint, aiming, and for the first time, the ability to wield nine iconic weapons from across the Halo series including the Energy Sword, Battle Rifle, and Needle Rifle. The new prequel missions also introduce a new gameplay arc with new environments, characters, and enemies.Vehicle gameplay is enhanced too with the ability to hijack enemy rides and pilot a fully controllable Wraith for the first time.</p>

<p>The first look at <em>Halo: Campaign Evolved</em> can be seen in action with the reveal trailer linked below. The current release window is set for sometime in 2026.</p>
