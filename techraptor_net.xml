            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/code-violet-pc-vulgar-mods<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>TeamKill Media, the developer of upcoming dino horror game <i>Code Violet</i>, has revealed that the game won't be coming to PC, and it's all to do with what the studio thinks modders will do with its characters.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/TeamKillMedia/status/1880780993813987541" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, the studio confirms that its game, which looks rather like a mixture of Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Dino Crisis&nbsp;</em>and EA's&nbsp;<em>Dead Space</em>, will remain a console exclusive because it doesn't want modders creating "vulgar versions of the main character" or any other characters.</p>

<p>TeamKill goes on to say it holds its "voice actresses and actors with high regard", as well as its "artistic vision for the game and story", and that modders creating "sexual mods" would make "a joke out of [the studio's] art" and possibly tarnish&nbsp;<em>Code Violet</em>'s actors' "reputation".</p>

<p>The game apparently won't be coming to Xbox because TeamKill doesn't "have the time or expertise" to devote to creating an Xbox port, and that doing so would "need additional manpower".</p>

<p>Given <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-xbox-port-series-s" rel="nofollow">how difficult an Xbox port would apparently have been</a> for&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>, another PlayStation 5 exclusive, perhaps TeamKill is right not to commit to leaving the PS5 exclusivity den anytime soon.</p>

<p>You can take a look at the (rather enigmatic) debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Code Violet</em>&nbsp;right here.</p>




<p>Given that Capcom doesn't seem immediately interested in reviving&nbsp;<em>Dino Crisis&nbsp;</em>(and that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shinji-mikami-dino-crisis-monster-hunter-comments" rel="nofollow">original creator Shinji Mikami certainly isn't</a>),&nbsp;<em>Code Violet&nbsp;</em>might be the best you'll get on that front, so it's a bit of a shame it won't be coming to PC.</p>

<p>At any rate, the game is set to launch for <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012908" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a> sometime in July this year. Stay tuned for more.</p>
