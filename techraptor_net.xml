            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Video Game History Foundation (VGHF) has announced that it's acquired the rights to&nbsp;<em>Computer Entertainer</em>, an influential video game magazine from the 1980s that may well be able to claim a number of firsts.</p>

<p>In a press release, the foundation calls&nbsp;<em>Computer Entertainer&nbsp;</em>"one of the most important video game magazines of the industry's 'golden age'", which is the motivating factor behind the charity's mission to "locate and meticulously digitize" the magazine's "entire eight-year run" between 1982 and 1990.</p>

<p>According to the VGHF,&nbsp;<em>Computer Entertainer&nbsp;</em>is the first female-owned gaming magazine in history; it was owned and operated by sister duo Marylou Badeaux and Celeste Dolan. Not only that, but it was also "the only console-focused magazine" to survive the infamous '80s gaming industry crash.</p>

<p>The library is free for anyone to access, and thanks to its Creative Commons 4.0 license, you can even use it commercially if you wish. Since the VGHF is a nonprofit, though, a <a href="https://gamehistory.org/donate/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">donation or two</a> might not go amiss if you're intending to do so, eh?</p>

<p><em>Computer Entertainer</em>'s firsts go beyond its origins and its longevity; it may, according to VGHF, have been the only English-language gaming magazine to cover the original&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Bros.&nbsp;</em>at launch, and it was also one of the first publications to review games like&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Metroid</em>.</p>

<p>You can check out a video detailing the Video Game History Foundation's acquisition of&nbsp;<em>Computer Entertainer</em>, as well as a history of the magazine and its importance in the industry, right here.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>THQ Nordic and developer Grimlore Games have announced that their action RPG&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest II&nbsp;</em>has hit a big sales milestone just three days out from its release.</p>

<p>Speaking on <a href="https://x.com/TitanQuestGame/status/1952717544046915624" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">social media</a>, the two studios confirmed that&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest II</em>, which was released in Early Access on PC via Steam on August 1st, managed to hit 300,000 sales just under 72 hours after its launch.</p>

<p>The game has already managed to reach number 17 on Steam's top sellers list at time of writing, beating out longtime stalwarts like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/sims-4" rel="nofollow"><em>The Sims 4</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/rimworld" rel="nofollow"><em>RimWorld</em></a>, and Valve's own&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/team-fortress-2" rel="nofollow"><em>Team Fortress 2</em></a>&nbsp;(two of which are, admittedly, free-to-play, but microtransactions are a big business, after all).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/titan-quest-ii-sales-300k-72-hours-combat.jpg?itok=B4QWuFGx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/titan-quest-ii-sales-300k-72-hours-combat.jpg?itok=b0dMkBX_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Titan Quest II&nbsp;</em>has hit 300,000 sales in just 72 hours.</figcaption></figure><p>On Steam's weekly top sellers list, meanwhile,&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest II&nbsp;</em>is sitting at number six, putting it ahead of hits like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/peak-2m-sales" rel="nofollow">indie smash&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/peak-2m-sales" rel="nofollow">Peak</a>&nbsp;</em>and NetEase's free-to-play comic book hero shooter extravaganza&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/marvel-rivals" rel="nofollow"><em>Marvel Rivals</em></a>.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest II&nbsp;</em>is, it's the sequel to the 2006 action RPG&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest</em>, which was developed by the Massachusetts-based studio Iron Lore.</p>

<p>Sadly, following the release of the original&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest</em>, Iron Lore folded, but former members of the studio would go on to found Crate Entertainment, whose name you might recognize from action RPG (and unofficial&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest&nbsp;</em>spiritual successor)&nbsp;<em>Grim Dawn</em>.</p>

<p>The new game, meanwhile, is being helmed by German outfit Grimlore Games, the studio responsible for fantasy RTS&nbsp;<em>SpellForce 3&nbsp;</em>(but not for 2023's spinoff&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/spellforce-conquest-of-eo" rel="nofollow"><em>SpellForce: Conquest of Eo</em></a>, if you're still following me).</p>




<p><em>Titan Quest II&nbsp;</em>pits you against Nemesis, the Goddess of Retribution, who is "corrupting the Threads of Fate and condemning all who oppose her to Eternal Punishment". You'll be battling creatures from Greek mythology in&nbsp;<em>Diablo</em>-style action RPG combat to put a stop to her schemes.</p>

<p>You can grab&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest II&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1154030/Titan_Quest_II/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>, where it'll set you back $23.99 (at time of writing; it's available at a 20% discount right now).</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Genshin Impact PS4 Support Ending Next Year]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-ps4-support-ending</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/genshin-impact-ps4-support-ending-next-year.1263222/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has announced that&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>PS4 support will be ending next year, and that various functions relating to the game's PS4 version will be winding down over the next few months as well.</p>

<p>As revealed in an <a href="https://www.hoyolab.com/article/40408849" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">article</a> on the HoYoverse website, support for&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>on PS4 will end on April 10th next year, at which point you'll no longer be able to log into the game on Sony's last-gen machine.</p>

<p>Additionally, from September 10th this year, if you've never downloaded&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>on PS4 before, you'll no longer be able to do so. If, however, you have downloaded the game on your PS4 prior to that date, you'll still be able to download it again if you wish (until April, anyway).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/genshin-impact-ps4-support-ending-characters.jpg?itok=d6YKi40B 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/genshin-impact-ps4-support-ending-characters.jpg?itok=x-84fIr6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Genshin Impact</em>'s PS4 support is ending next year.</figcaption></figure><p>Following the PS4 version's delisting in September, in-game purchases will be removed from this version of&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>on February 25th next year, but if you've bought anything and have yet to claim it, you can do so until April.</p>

<p>Naturally, this delisting won't affect the PS5 version of&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact</em>, nor will it have any impact (ahem) on other platforms like PC or mobile, so you'll still be able to play it everywhere else it's currently available.</p>

<p>As for why the game is being removed from PS4, HoYoverse says it's "due to limitations related to hardware performance and platform application size".</p>

<p>On what is almost certainly a related note, the studio also <a href="https://x.com/GenshinImpact/status/1952942713046774172" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">revealed earlier today</a> that device specs for other versions of&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>will be raised following the next version update (which doesn't have a release date yet). It's likely the PS4 wouldn't be able to handle what HoYoverse has planned for the game in future.</p>




<p>This news follows the release of&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-58-july" rel="nofollow">Version 5.8 last month</a>, which is likely to be the last 5.x update before Version 6.0, as well as the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-us-age-verification-to-kick-in-later-this-month" rel="nofollow">introduction of age verification</a> for players in the US earlier this year.</p>

<p>For the time being,&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>is still available on PS4, and you can also download and play it for free across PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PC, and mobile devices. Stay tuned for more.</p>
