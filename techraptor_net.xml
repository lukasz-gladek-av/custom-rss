            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Maelstrom is a part of the <em>40K</em> universe where real space meets the madness of the Warp. The area is in constant flux, which makes it the perfect hiding place for xenos, heretics, traitors, and the various pirate raiders that call it home. Following on from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-40k-500-worlds-titus-review-titus-and-friends" rel="nofollow">500 Worlds Titus</a> books, The Maelstrom Lair of the Tyrant brings a new campaign, new enemies, and pushes the narrative one step closer to something huge for <em>Warhammer 40K</em>. In this article, we check out the new <em>Warhammer 40K</em> The Maelstrom Lair of the Tyrant campaign books, and the new pirate forces of the Red Corairs and Eldritch Raiders.</p><p>We've been covering <em>Warhammer 40K</em> for a while on the site, and you can check out our full <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/warhammer-40k-guide" rel="nofollow">Warhammer 40K Guide</a>, our preview for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/warhammer-40k-leviathan-first-look" rel="nofollow">Leviathan box</a> that launched the latest edition of the rules, or the most recent wave of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/crux-terminatus-battleforce-marneus-calgar-and-friends-review-codex-compliant" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Ultramarines and Space Marine reinforcements</a>.</p>
<p>The Maelstrom is a large region of space that several factions share. The largest force of inhabitants is the Red Corsairs under Huron Blackheart. Huron was once a loyal Space Marine of the Emperor, now a traitor, and commander of his own vast legion of ships that he uses to plunder the Imperium, the xenos, and even other Chaos Space Marine factions.&nbsp;</p><p>Huron suffers others to share the Maelstrom, simply because he either hasn't gotten around to eliminating them yet, they're proving hard to remove, or their presence offers him and his forces something they need. One of these threats, who sees the riches of the Maelstrom as ripe to plunder, along with Huron's resources and fleets, are the Aeldari Corsairs, the Eldritch Raiders. These two corsair factions share much in common, with their members made up of those who leave the structured formats of their previous lives, for plunder and destruction, free from the constraints of laws and moral codes.&nbsp;</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>The Campaign Books</h2><p>The Maelstrom is a lawless place, full of factions vying for power, wealth, and plunder. The Maelstrom Lair of the Tyrant campaign books bring to life this area of the <em>Warhammer 40K</em> universe, with background and lore, new units and army compositions, and a new campaign. The Maelstrom Lair of the Tyrant is a set of 4 linked books, the first details the background for the Maelstrom, and the forces it contains, focusing on the Chaos Space Marines, the Red Corsairs led by Huron Blackheart, and the Aeldari, Eldritch Raiders led by Prince Yriel.</p><p>The second book, The Maelstrom Lair of the Tyrant - Crucible of Champions, lets you build a unique champion for your faction, with options to build 62 different champions across 21 factions, with additional options for 4 specific Space Marine chapters (Space Wolves, Dark Angels, Blood Angels, and Black Templars). Each included faction has 3 archetypes (except Drukhari, who have 2) to begin building your champion. Once selected, you add in a specialism, ability, and weapons to complete the build.</p><p>We built a Raven Guard Champion of the Chapter, with a heavy jump pack and Mk X Gravis armor, the tactical precision ability to make them accurate with the Forge Boltter we armed them with, and topped it off with a Power Fist in case they need to engage in close combat.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The third book, The Malestrom Raid and Ruin, includes a campaign for players to simulate warlords vying for power in the Maelstrom. Players in Raid and Ruin campaigns fight to gain notoriety points (NP) across 7 different challenges, like destroying your opponent's warlord in a battle. The first time you do this, you gain the Vengeful title and 3 NP, and by the third time you complete it, you gain the Imperious title, and your NP count rises to 5. The player with the most NP at the end of the campaign wins.</p><p>But being a space pirate isn't just about fame and glory, there are spoils to be taken too, and for each objective you control at the end of the battle, you can roll on the Spoils of War table. You can only choose to keep one result, of which there are 36 spoils of war to be won, and you keep it until the end of the next battle, when you will get the opportunity to roll again if you score objectives. Some of the spoils grant you bonus NP at the end of a battle, others special abilities like the Chart of Shadows that lets you bring a unit out of strategic reserves earlier, and the rest are weapons, like the Tyrant's Sceptre, which has 5 attacks, Ap -2, 3 damage, and strength equal to your NP.</p><p>The final book, The Maelstrom Lair of the Tryant - Detachments, is a booklet with new Detachments for Chaos Space Marines (Huron's Marauders and Renegade Warband), Aeldari (Eldritch Raiders and Corsir Coterie), Orks (Freebooter Krew), and the Leagues of Votann (Mercenary Oathband). All of these Detachments are available in the <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/downloads/warhammer-40000/" rel="nofollow">downloads section</a> of the Warhammer Community site. Detachments are new with this edition of <em>40K</em> and give unique special rules for your forces, significantly changing the way factions play between detachment choices, and usually some restrictions on the units you can take.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Red Corsairs</h2><p>Alongside the Maelstrom campaign books, the Red Corsairs sail into <em>Warhammer 40K</em> with 2 new boxes, Huron Blackheart and the Masters of the Maelstrom, and the Lords of the Maelstrom battleforce.&nbsp;</p><p>Huron Blackheart and the Masters of the Maelstrom is a box similar to <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-40k-500-worlds-titus-review-titus-and-friends" rel="nofollow">Titus and the Wardens of Ultramar</a>, in that it contains the character Huron, who can deploy by himself, or attached to the rest of his retinue and another unit. Huron boosts the objective control of nearby Heretic Astartes infantry units and comes armed with the Tyrant's Claw and exalted power weapon, which have 6 attacks, strength 8, -3 AP, and 3 damage.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The Masters of the Maelstrom are a 5-model unit that contains 3 Chaos Space Marine specialists, a xenos, and a human fleet officer. They all come on a single datasheet, but each adds their own unique ability. The 3 Chaos Space Marines are Garreon, an apothecary who can return removed models to his unit or gain CP if a nearby unit is below starting strength. Garrix, a character hunter, comes armed with the Axe of Ending, which has anti-character 2+, scoring critical wounds on a roll of 2 or more, and precision, so they can target characters, even if they're hiding within a unit. Garlon, a psyker, whose Mind Wrench power also has precision to target characters, with 1 attack, -2AP, and D6+1 damage.</p><p>The Masters of the Maelstrom xenos is The Enforcer, a Tarellian, a race that has been mentioned several times in 40K lore, but doesn't have a faction of their own. The Enforcer can release her Barghesi companion (which also gets a miniature in the box), that once per battle, deals D3+1 mortal wounds to a unit within 12 inches, on a 2+. The final member of the Masters is Captain Sargotta, who allows you to redeploy up to 3 units from your force after deployment, better placing them to deal with the enemy threats after seeing their placement.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The Lords of the Maelstrom battleforce allows you to kickstart your Red Corsairs army, and includes a new Reave-Captain and 10x Red Corsairs Raiders, alongside 10x Legionaries, 5x Terminators, and 10x Traitor Guardsmen, which can all be upgraded with the included Red Corsairs upgrade kit (which has 5 Terminator and 10 Legionnaire shoulder pads and some new head and arm options) and transfers.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The Red Corsairs Raiders are experienced pirates, used to surging forward to plunder. This is represented through the infiltrator's special rule, which lets them set up further ahead of the rest of the force, and an objective control of 2, which rises to 3 after they destroy an enemy unit. They also have 3 wounds each, and for every 5 models, can add a power fist and melta gun to the unit, to give them some real staying power on objectives.</p><p>Leading the Lords of the Maelstrom is the new Reave-Captain, who loves to get into combat. After they charge, for the rest of the turn, their melee weapons gain 1 to strength and armor penetration, and they can reroll the charge roll if the target is within range of an objective marker. They can also join Raider units, and come with the infiltrators' special rule so they can set up ahead of the main army with them. They come armed with a power sword and bolt pistol, which you can swap for a power maul, which loses 2 attacks to the power sword but does double the damage, and a plasma pistol, which is just superior in every way to a bolt pistol.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Eldritch Raiders</h2><p>Trying to out-pirate the Red Corsairs and releasing alongside them are the Aeldari Eldritch Raiders, led by Prince Yriel in a new battleforce. The Eldritch Raiders Battleforce contains a whole host of new miniatures, including a new miniature for Prince Yriel and a new Vyper, the brand new units Kharseth and 10x Corsair Skyreavers, and 10x of the existing Corsair Voidscarred.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>Prince Yriel can join either of the units that come in the box, and has a Piratical Hero ability that makes it easier for the unit he's in to hit and deal extra damage when they roll critical hits. Yriel is also pretty devastating in combat themselves, with the Spear of Twilight giving Yriel 5 attacks at strength 7, -3 AP, and dealing 3 damage. Accompanying Yriel is the Void Dreamer Kharseth, who can also join both units in the battleforce. Kharseth has an anti-infantry psychic attack with D6+2 attacks, which, along with dealing damage for the attack, can give a unit that it hits the Riven status, which increases the strength of attacks by Aledari units against them.</p><p>The new Corsair Skyreavers are crazy fast, with Scout 7 to get them moving straight away, and then a standard move of 12 inches. For every 5 models in the unit, you can take 2 special weapons from a selection of 4 (with no duplicates with 5 models, and a max of 2 per weapon at 10 models). They also have a Raid and Ruin special ability that lets them move D3+3 inches if not in combat at the end of the fight phase, or fall back D3+3 inches if they are in combat, making them very difficult to pin down, as you can withdraw ready to relocate next turn.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The new Vyper kit can be built as a Vyper armed with a bright lance, scatter laser, or starcannon, or it can be built as the new Starfang, which has the same core stat line as the Vyper, but also has scout 7 to move them up the board at the start of the game. The Starfang comes fitted with a fixed loadout of disintegrator cannon and Starfang grenade launcher. The Starfang can also give a friendly unit stealth at the start of your opponent's shooting phase with their hallucinogen grenades ability to make that unit slightly more difficult to hit.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Warhammer 40K The Maelstrom Lair of the Tyrant Final Thoughts?</h2><p>The Maelstrom Lair of the Tyrant pushes us ever closer to the narrative hook that will launch us into <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> 11th edition, gives us the Cruible of Champions rules for making your own hero, and the awesome Raid and Ruin campaign, which works perfectly for the 2 new piratical battleforces that release alongside this set. I've always been a fan of Huron's narrative, and the new Red Corsair's look awesome, and come with new great detachments to play. Hopefully GW release a Red Corsair boarding actions detachment soon, because they were absolutely made for it, and it would be a travesty if that opportunity was missed.</p><hr><p><em>The copies of</em> <strong>Warhammer 40K The Maelstrom Lair of the Tyrant, Red Corsairs, and the Eldritch Raiders&nbsp;</strong><em>used to produce this review were provided by Games Workshop.</em></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-40k-maelstrom-lair-of-tyrant-review-pirate-vs-pirate]]></content:encoded>
