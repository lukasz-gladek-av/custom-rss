            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Legendary producer Rod Fergusson has been appointed as the new franchise head for the&nbsp;<em>BioShock&nbsp;</em>series, following the fourth game's well-documented production struggles.</p>

<p>Fergusson announced his new position <a href="https://x.com/rodfergusson/status/1957824815018213692" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on social media</a> earlier today, declaring that he'll be heading up&nbsp;<em>BioShock 4&nbsp;</em>developer Cloud Chamber and "overseeing development of the next&nbsp;<em>BioShock&nbsp;</em>game, along with franchise extensions like the in-development Netflix movie".</p>

<p>He goes on to say that while he's excited to start his new role, he understands that "the studio restructuring is a difficult time for the team", and that he's "deeply grateful" for the work completed on&nbsp;<em>BioShock 4&nbsp;</em>by Cloud Chamber thus far (although we still don't know exactly how much work that is).</p>

<p>According to Bloomberg's Jason Schreier, 2K execs are unhappy with the way&nbsp;<em>BioShock 4</em>'s story was progressing, leading to the ousting of Cloud Chamber head Kelley Gilmore and a change in creative director Hogarth de la Plante's role to a more "publishing"-focused position.</p>

<p>The internal review that led to these decisions also apparently resulted in layoffs at Cloud Chamber, which is likely what Fergusson is referring to when he talks about "studio restructuring". It's another corporate term for staff cuts.</p>

<p>Rod Fergusson has something of a reputation as a "closer", a producer who's brought in to bring struggling projects over the finish line. It's a trick he performed before with 2013's&nbsp;<em>BioShock Infinite</em>, which is probably why 2K execs feel like they're in safe hands with him now.</p>

<p>Still, with Fergusson at the helm, perhaps the huge, lumbering Big Daddy that is the franchise at this point can start juddering into motion again. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Tales of Xillia Remastered Officially Confirmed for October]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has revealed that the next&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>game to be getting the remaster treatment is none other than&nbsp;<em>Tales of Xillia</em>, and the remaster is due to land later this year.</p>

<p>Last week, the studio accidentally confirmed the existence of&nbsp;<em>Tales of Xillia Remastered&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-of-xillia-remaster-rumor" rel="nofollow">via an unfortunate YouTube thumbnail</a>, but earlier today, the remaster was officially revealed. It's landing on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch (but not Switch 2, strangely) on October 31st.</p>

<p>The project is part of Bandai Namco's promise to release remastered versions of games in the&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>series <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-series-remasters-regular" rel="nofollow">"fairly consistently"</a>, with the first entry in the so-called Remaster Project, namely&nbsp;<em>Tales of Graces f Remastered</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/tales-of-graces-f-remastered-review-spirited-journey" rel="nofollow">launching earlier this year</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-xillia-remastered-october-cast.jpg?itok=mIx5svaa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tales-of-xillia-remastered-october-cast.jpg?itok=qyikAuRN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Tales of Xillia&nbsp;</em>is the next game to get Bandai Namco's remaster treatment.</figcaption></figure><p>As revealed on the game's <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/tales-of/news/whats-new-tales-of-xillia-remastered" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official website</a>, there are plenty of changes and quality-of-life improvements coming to&nbsp;<em>Tales of Xillia Remastered</em>, so even if you think you know the original inside out, this one's probably worth picking up.</p>

<p>Big changes include new "vivid and beautiful graphics", as well as the inclusion of over 40 DLC packs released for the original game, although certain licensed content (probably referring to the outfits themed around Japanese anime&nbsp;<em>Star Driver</em>) aren't included.</p>

<p>You'll also find a new autosave function that will save your game after events or "moving around the map", as well as the chance to toggle random enemy encounters, a new Retry feature if you die in battle, and much more.</p>

<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Tales of Xillia Remastered</em>, which shows the work the team has done in order to update the original for modern systems, right here.</p>




<p>When the first <i>Tales of Xillia Remastered&nbsp;</i>leak happened, some suggested that the direct sequel&nbsp;<em>Tales of Xillia 2&nbsp;</em>may also be included as part of a package, but that's not the case. I'd imagine, though, that&nbsp;<em>Xillia 2&nbsp;</em>is on the cards if this remaster does well.</p>

<p><em>Tales of Xillia Remastered&nbsp;</em>is coming to PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch on October 31st. Stay tuned for more.</p>
