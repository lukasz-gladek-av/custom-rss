            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-52-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has announced the&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.2 release date, as well as what new characters and features you can expect when the update arrives.</p>

<p>Following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-51-release-date">last month's Version 5.1</a>,&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.2 officially arrives on November 20th, alongside the long-awaited Xbox Series X|S version of the game. There's still no word on when - or, at this point, whether - the game will be appearing on Switch, however.</p>

<p>In any case, Version 5.2 will introduce two new Saurians to get to grips with: Qucusaurs and Iktomisaurs. They'll help you to reach new areas, find hidden treasure, and even engage enemies in combat, and they'll be introduced alongside two new Natlan clans, the Flower-Feather Clan and the Masters of the Night Wind.</p>

Chasca, the Peacemaker of the Flower-Feather Clan, is a five-star Anemo bow user who can "float and attack mid-air".</p>

<p>She's joined by Ororon, a four-star bow user who wields the Electro element. He can deal damage, taunt enemies, and even boost your team's gliding speed, making him invaluable in exploration as well as combat.</p>

<p>Both characters will debut as part of the first half of Version 5.2's Event Wishes, alongside a rerun of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-celebrates-version-40-release-with-lyneys-gameplay-trailer">Lyney</a>. In the second half of the update's cycle, you can expect reruns of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zhongli-conducts-in-lovely-genshin-impact-anime-style-trailer-teasing-upcoming-concert">Zhongli</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-reveals-handsome-new-characters-neuvillette-wriothesley">Neuvillette</a>.</p>

<p>Naturally, you can also look forward to new story quests, a brand new boss to take on, and "an array of quality-of-life updates" to make your&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>gameplay experience smoother.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amplitude-studios-sega-split-indie</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/humankind-developer-amplitude-studios-splits-from-sega-and-goes-indie.1030866/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amplitude-studios-sega-split-indie<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Humankind&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Endless Dungeon&nbsp;</em>developer Amplitude Studios has announced that it's split from Sega and gone independent, with the studio describing the move as a return to its "roots".</p>

<p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1124300/view/4465975096247320950" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on Steam</a>&nbsp;(which can be seen across all of Amplitude's games on the platform), Amplitude says its journey with Sega "has been amazing", but that ownership of the studio has returned "to some of our original founders and members of the team".</p>

<p>According to Amplitude, its parting with Sega happened on "good terms", and the studio remains committed to "working closely with our players", which it says is still very much at the "heart of our philosophy".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/amplitude-studios-sega-split-endless-legend.jpg?itok=q48AdpjT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/amplitude-studios-sega-split-endless-legend.jpg?itok=ZeWbq08T 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Endless Legend&nbsp;</em>developer Amplitude Studios has said goodbye to its former owner Sega.</figcaption></figure><p>In the aforementioned Steam post, Amplitude founder Romain de Waubert de Genlis says the studio currently has two projects in development, describing them as "exciting", although he doesn't elaborate on what they might be.</p>

<p>He also says Amplitude is "backed by strong and meaningful franchises", and that the decision to go independent allows the studio to "be more agile in our approach".</p>

<p>Amplitude Studios was first founded back in 2011, with ex-Ubisoft staffers de Waubert de Genlis and Mathieu Girard setting up the company. The first game released by Amplitude was 2012's&nbsp;<em>Endless Space</em>, which kicked off the&nbsp;<em>Endless&nbsp;</em>series of strategy-focused games.</p>

<p>Said series continued with 2014's turn-based 4X game&nbsp;<em>Endless Legend</em>&nbsp;and tower defense roguelike&nbsp;<em>Dungeon of the Endless</em>, which was released in the same year. Following these releases, Sega snapped up Amplitude in 2016.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/amplitude-studios-sega-split-dungeon-of-the-endless.jpg?itok=WdVRWsbJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/amplitude-studios-sega-split-dungeon-of-the-endless.jpg?itok=h_pO6JOy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Amplitude Studios is working on two new games, although we don't know what they are yet.</figcaption></figure><p>Amplitude's first game under Sega's wing was 2017's&nbsp;<em>Endless Space 2</em>, a followup to the developer's debut game, and that was followed up by an experimental visual novel,&nbsp;<em>Love Thyself - A Horatio Story</em>, which is again set in the&nbsp;<em>Endless&nbsp;</em>universe.</p>

<p>It wouldn't take long for Amplitude to return to strategy development, though, with 2021's&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/humankind">Humankind</a>&nbsp;</em>(not to be confused with&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/ancestors-humankind-odyssey"><em>Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey</em></a>) attempting to rival&nbsp;<em>Civilization&nbsp;</em>in terms of scope and system complexity.</p>

<p>The studio's most recent project is&nbsp;<em>Endless Dungeon</em>, a successor to-come-reimagining of <i>Dungeon of the Endless&nbsp;</i>that features a new 3D art style and plenty of additional mechanics to wrap your brain around.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/astro-bot-sales-hit-1-5m-in-nine-weeks-sony-reveals.1030827/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/astro-bot-sales-sony-financials<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has revealed its financial results for the second quarter of the 2024-25 fiscal year, and they contain some rather reassuring news about&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>sales, especially if you're a 3D platforming fan.</p>

<p>According to a report summarizing the company's financial performance this quarter,&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>has sold 1.5 million copies in the nine weeks since it was released, which Sony says qualifies the game as "a hit".</p>

<p>The report says that 37% of users who bought&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>hadn't picked up a first-party Sony title in the last two years, and that the percentage of younger gamers and families who bought the game was "much higher than other titles", contributing to a "widening of [Sony's] user base".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/astro-bot-sales-sony-financials-platforming.jpg?itok=sajYTDe0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/astro-bot-sales-sony-financials-platforming.jpg?itok=cL9a_i3q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>is "a hit" with younger players and families, according to Sony.</figcaption></figure><p>In the report, Sony also makes reference to the two live-service games it's released so far this year, namely&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Concord</em>.</p>

<p>Of the former, Sony says it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-financials-helldivers-2-sales">was a "huge hit"</a>, although the company does rather conspicuously omit the controversy surrounding the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-pc-playstation-account-link">need for a PSN account</a> to play the game on PC (which was later <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-pc-playstation-backtrack">rescinded after a widespread backlash</a>).</p>

<p><em>Concord</em>, meanwhile, "ended up being shut down", as Sony says, although that's rather understating the catastrophe the game turned out to be; it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds">shut down just two weeks after its launch</a>, and last month, Sony <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-shuts-down-two-studios-including-concord-creator">closed down the game's developer Firewalk</a>.</p>

<p>In numbers terms, Sony's gaming sales increased by 12% on a year-on-year basis, driven mainly by "third-party software sales", including "a new sports title" (likely&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC 25&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/us-sales-data-july-circana"><em>EA Sports College Football</em></a>)&nbsp;and "an action RPG title from China" (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-expansion-sales-18m">probably&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em></a>).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/black-myth-wukong-ps5-sony-financials.jpg?itok=G_qyUeFa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/black-myth-wukong-ps5-sony-financials.jpg?itok=TTgmVLUB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>An "action RPG title from China" helped to drive strong PS5 software sales this quarter.</figcaption></figure><p>That strong performance has apparently helped to offset a decline in PS5 hardware sales, although it is worth noting that this quarter ends in September, so it doesn't include sales of the PS5 Pro, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-pro-announced-november">was released yesterday</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/palworld-developer-reveals-patents-nintendo-says-its-infringed-plus-lawsuit-demands.1030824/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-lawsuit-patents-demands-nintendo<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>studio Pocketpair has outlined the terms of Nintendo's patent infringement lawsuit against its game, and it looks like there are three patents Nintendo is basing its attack on.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/20241108" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on the official Pocketpair website</a>, Nintendo is seeking "an injunction against&nbsp;<em>Palworld"</em>, as well as five million yen payments to both The Pokemon Company and Nintendo itself, in addition to "late payment damages".</p>

<p>The patents Nintendo is accusing Pocketpair of infringing were all apparently filed (or at least published) after&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>was released, and they're all <a href="https://www.j-platpat.inpit.go.jp/c1801/PU/JP-2024-032983/10/ja" rel="noopener" target="_blank">related</a> to various <a href="https://www.j-platpat.inpit.go.jp/c1801/PU/JP-2024-123560/10/ja" rel="noopener" target="_blank">functions</a> within <a href="https://www.j-platpat.inpit.go.jp/c1801/PU/JP-2024-026645/10/ja" rel="noopener" target="_blank">videogames</a>, including one that pertains to a method of throwing an object in order to capture a creature.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-lawsuit-nintendo-pocketpair-airborne-pal.jpg?itok=afVM1Yi7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-lawsuit-nintendo-pocketpair-airborne-pal.jpg?itok=QWIFySw6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>We now know which patents Nintendo is going after&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>developer Pocketpair for.</figcaption></figure><p>The injunction Nintendo is seeking against&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>would presumably involve the game no longer being available to buy in Japan, although since this is a Japanese lawsuit, it's not likely Nintendo could block Pocketpair from selling the game elsewhere.</p>

<p>Just in case you're not familiar with this&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>lawsuit, it was filed against Pocketpair <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-palworld-pocketpair-lawsuit">back in September</a>, with Nintendo alleging that the Japanese studio had infringed on its patents.</p>

<p>Initially, it seemed like the lawsuit might block the release of the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-ps5-release">on PS5 in Japan</a>, but Pocketpair went ahead and launched&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>on PS5 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-ps5-release-japan">in early October</a>, just in time for several <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/spooky-palworld-halloween-skins">new Halloween skins</a> to arrive.</p>

<p>Since the patents in question were approved after the launch of&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>, Nintendo's legal action seems a touch opportunistic to me, but then Nintendo has a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-loses-appeal-in-nintendo-eshop-lawsuit-in-germany">pretty rich history</a> of aggressively <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-dmcas-zelda-pitch-documentary">pursuing legal claims</a> (especially where its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/legend-of-zelda-missing-link-dmcad-by-nintendo">IP is concerned</a>), so perhaps I shouldn't be surprised.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-lawsuit-nintendo-pocketpair-warsect.jpg?itok=jn3lp-En 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-lawsuit-nintendo-pocketpair-warsect.jpg?itok=ZQBUilkD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>is far from Nintendo's first legal target.</figcaption></figure><p>As for&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>itself, it's an open-world creature-collecting survival game that blends the gotta-catch-'em-all aspect of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>with the gameplay of games like&nbsp;<em>Ark: Survival Evolved</em>.</p>

<p>You'll fend for yourself in a hostile world filled with Pals, creatures you can befriend (or enslave) as you see fit, and you'll need to build bases, fend off attacks from aggressive Pals, and generally carve out a life for yourself.</p>

<p><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/palworld/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/palworld-game-preview/9NKV34XDW014" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>. A <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-mobile-version-krafton">mobile adaptation of the game</a> is also apparently in development at&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>studio Krafton. We'll bring you more as soon as we get it.</p>
