            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-celestial-guardians-set<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>DeNA and The Pokemon Company have announced a brand new&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>set in the form of&nbsp;<em>Celestial Guardians</em>, a major expansion that brings hundreds of new cards to the game.</p>

<p>As revealed in an announcement <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/uk/pokemon-news/look-to-the-skies-with-pokemon-tcg-pockets-upcoming-expansion-celestial-guardians" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>,&nbsp;<em>Celestial Guardians&nbsp;</em>is the next mainline expansion for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>, and it's coming on April 29th at 11pm Pacific (that's April 30th at 2am Eastern).</p>

<p><em>Celestial Guardians </em>isn't a mini-expansion like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mythical-island-expansion" rel="nofollow"><em>Mythical Island</em></a>; it's the real deal, and it&nbsp;follows on from previous expansions like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-expansion-shining-revelry" rel="nofollow">Shining Revelry</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-update-new-expansion-release-date" rel="nofollow"><em>Space-Time Smackdown</em></a>, bringing over 200 new cards for you to collect, including "the first immersive Supporter card".</p>

<p>Both legendaries will be getting ex cards, of course, along with the likes of Alolan Raichu. The trailer also gives us a glimpse of a rather beautiful full art Alolan Marowak card, as well as a number of new basic cards, item cards, and more.</p>

<p><em>Celestial Guardians&nbsp;</em>is arriving as&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>prepares to celebrate its six-month anniversary (which is, according to DeNA and The Pokemon Company, a thing).</p>

<p>As part of that celebration, a new series of battles and missions will be available at the same time as&nbsp;<em>Celestial Guardians</em>. Taking them on will give you the chance to earn promo cards, including a gorgeous Rayquaza ex card, as well as other goodies.</p>




<p>If you're wondering what&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>is, the clue's in the name; it's a mobile version of the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>trading card game, in which you can collect cards, battle opponents, and trade with your friends (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trade-tokens" rel="nofollow">to a certain degree, anyway</a>).</p>

<p>Despite criticisms of some of its systems and monetization elements,&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>has proven <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-dena-revenue" rel="nofollow">phenomenally successful</a> for its developers, so you can expect to see new expansions appearing well into the future.</p>

<p><em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>is available now for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.pokemon.pokemontcgp&amp;hl=en_GB" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pok%C3%A9mon-tcg-pocket/id6479970832" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">iOS</a> devices.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/until-dawn-dev-supermassive-reportedly-cancels-blade-runner-game.1172490/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/supermassive-blade-runner-game-canceled-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Quarry&nbsp;</em>developer Supermassive Games has reportedly canceled an in-development&nbsp;<em>Blade Runner&nbsp;</em>game that was set to release some time in 2027.</p>

<p>That's according to an Insider Gaming report, which cites anonymous sources that supposedly worked on the project. According to Insider's report,&nbsp;<em>Blade Runner: Time to Live&nbsp;</em>was a "character-focused, cinematic action-adventure" game that would have run around 10-12 hours.</p>

<p>The game would have featured the four key pillars of "stealth, combat, exploration, and investigation", which would have set it apart from Supermassive's usual fare; the developer is mostly known for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/quarry" rel="nofollow">movie-style adventure games</a> that <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dark-pictures-anthology-little-hope" rel="nofollow">don't usually feature much</a> in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dark-pictures-anthology-man-of-medan" rel="nofollow">way of gameplay</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/blade-runner-enhanced-edition-supermassive-games-canceled-project-rumor.jpg?itok=yly1jTn2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/blade-runner-enhanced-edition-supermassive-games-canceled-project-rumor.jpg?itok=Bwf_bVCX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Quarry&nbsp;</em>developer Supermassive Games has reportedly canceled a&nbsp;<em>Blade Runner&nbsp;</em>game.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Insider Games, you'd have access to various skills and abilities that you could upgrade in&nbsp;<em>Blade Runner: Time to Live</em>, and you'd also be able to use "past memories to figure out the story", as well as using "in-game technology to complete your investigations".</p>

<p>It sounds like the game would have been a pretty ambitious one, and it sounds pretty far out of Supermassive's usual wheelhouse as well; it puts me in mind of The Chinese Room's work on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-october-2025" rel="nofollow">the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</em></a>.</p>

<p>Supposedly,&nbsp;<em>Blade Runner: Time to Live&nbsp;</em>would have arrived in 2027 across PC and current-gen machines, as well as the next generation of PlayStation and Xbox consoles (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/full-next-gen-xbox-reportedly-set-for-2027-xbox-branded-gaming-handheld-due-out-later-in-2025" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">assuming there is one</a> where Xbox is concerned, of course).</p>

<p>Insider's report says that the project would have cost around $45 million before music, testing, and other expenses, and that&nbsp;<em>Blade Runner&nbsp;</em>rights holder Alcon Entertainment is the reason the game was canceled, although the report doesn't go into specifics "to protect the sources of the information".</p>

<p>Supermassive is also the developer on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/little-nightmares-3-delayed" rel="nofollow">Bandai Namco's&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares 3</em></a>, which will be the first game in the series not to be developed by original studio Tarsier.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-1886-announced-2027</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/11-bit-studios-announces-frostpunk-remake-frostpunk-1886-for-2027.1172448/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-1886-announced-2027<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher 11 bit studios has announced&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk: 1886</em>, a remake of the original&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk&nbsp;</em>in Unreal Engine 5 (and, despite what the title suggests, nothing to do with&nbsp;<em>The Order: 1886</em>).</p>

<p>In an announcement <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3645160/view/545607485799530656" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Steam, 11 bit says the aim with&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk: 1886&nbsp;</em>is to "recreate the experience of the original game in [Unreal Engine 5]", and that the project is part of an effort to "further expand upon&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk</em>" away from the original game's now-defunct Liquid Engine.</p>

<p>This is almost certainly the new&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk&nbsp;</em>game to which 11 bit referred in its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-frostpunk-game-2027-11-bit-studios" rel="nofollow">most recent financial summary</a>; the studio already confirmed a 2027 release for that project, so unless there's another one in the works for the same year, it's most probably&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk: 1886</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/frostpunk-1886-remake-original-game-city-view.jpg?itok=R2Vt-VH2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/frostpunk-1886-remake-original-game-city-view.jpg?itok=jiUQUZya 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Frostpunk: 1886&nbsp;</em>aims to reimagine the original (pictured here) with new visuals and gameplay mechanics.</figcaption></figure><p>According to 11 bit,&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk: 1886&nbsp;</em>will feature "improved visuals, higher resolution, and all the other possibilities Unreal has to offer", serving as a "great introduction to the world of&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk</em>" but also the perfect game for "die-hard fans".</p>

<p>However, the project won't just be a rebuilt version of&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk</em>. Instead, it'll feature "tons of new content, new mechanics, new events, technologies, and buildings", as well as a totally new path, Purpose, to go alongside Faith and Order.</p>

<p>In addition,&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk: 1886&nbsp;</em>will support expansion via DLC in future, as well as official modding support, which is something that's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-2-modding-tool-at-launch" rel="nofollow">available for the second</a>&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk&nbsp;</em>but not for the first due to engine limitations.</p>

<p>You can check out the very brief teaser trailer for&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk: 1886&nbsp;</em>below. It doesn't give very much away, and it's really more of a mood piece than a full trailer, but hey, it might help you to get excited for the game.</p>




<p><em>Frostpunk: 1886&nbsp;</em>is due to land on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3645160/Frostpunk_1886/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> sometime in 2027. No console release has been announced yet.</p>
