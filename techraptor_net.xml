            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/disney-lorcana-archazias-island-is-coming-this-march<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At this year's London Toy Fair, Ravensburger and The Walt Disney Company announced a new set of cards for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/disney-lorcana" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Disney Lorcana</em></a>. The latest set for the popular card game, <em>Disney Lorcana Archazia's Island</em>, will introduce more beloved characters for collectors and players alike.</p>

<h2>The Disney Lorcana Archazia's Island Announcement</h2>

<p>In an official press release, Ravensburger showcased some card and product artwork for <em>Disney Lorcana Archazia's Island</em>.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disney-lorcana-archazias-island-booster-box.jpg?itok=NhG-0Zti 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disney-lorcana-archazias-island-booster-box.jpg?itok=cNIMY_dm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The first of these are the booster boxes. The artwork shows Encanto's Mirabelle, Bolt sporting a steampunk-esque leg attachment, Belle from Beauty and the Beast stepping into her father's footsteps with an engineer's outfit and an electric tool, The Mad Hatter brewing some tea, and Iago with his brazen scowl.</p>

The card sleeves sport both Cinderella and Ursula. One game mat features Tigger in a pirate outfit covered in rope high in a crow's nest. The other features the superhero team, Big Hero 6, in full costume.</p>

<p>As for the starter decks, they are appropriately on theme. The first shows Belle and The Beast and appears to be a Ruby and Sapphire deck. The Beast is more dapper than normal, sporting a glowing quill and even a monocle. I suppose Belle has rubbed off on him in the best way. The second starter deck sports Iago and Jafar and is an Amethyst and Steel deck.</p>

The aptly named <em>Reign of Jafar</em> involves the villain taking over Archazia's island, corrupting it into a menacing fortress.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disney-lorcana-fabled-poster.jpg?itok=vCWMorkI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disney-lorcana-fabled-poster.jpg?itok=jf5JFfYD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>What comes after this hostile takeover? Well, if the art of the next set is anything to go on, something more nostalgic. The third set, <em>Fabled</em>, features a more classical version of Mickey and Minnie Mouse in medieval garb riding horses. The set will most likely be fairytale-themed with some early 1920s animation deep cuts thrown in for good measure.</p>

<p>Disney Lorcana Archazia's Island will be released in March 2025. <em>Reign of Jafar</em> will be released on June 6, 2025, with pre-release events happening on May 30, 2025. <em>Fabled</em> will be released sometime in Q3 of 2025.</p>
