In celebration of the global tabletop company's 30th anniversary, its new global rebrand will be consumer-focused, as represented in its new tagline: "inspired by players."</p>

<h2>The Asmodee Global Rebrand</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, the rebrand is intended to mark a key milestone in strengthening the company's direct relationship with players, while reinforcing its reputation for quality.</p>

They have published hundreds of games across hundreds of beloved IPs. Releases such as <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/asmodee-group-announces-catan-sixth-edition-is-out-now" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Catan</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/ticket-to-ride-europe-15th-anniversary-edition-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Ticket to Ride</em></a>, <em>7 Wonders</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/arkham-horror-roleplaying-game-core-rulebook-review-this-is-halloween" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Arkham Horror</em></a>, <em>Marvel: Crisis Protocol</em>, <em>Twilight Imperium</em>, and many more. In addition, they have many board game companies under their umbrella, a strategy they <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/asmodee-group-eyes-buying-out-board-game-companies-again" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">still use today</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"At asmodee, we have made it our mission to create meaningful, shared experiences through our games to celebrate all players” says Thomas Kœgler, CEO of asmodee. “During our 30-year journey in the tabletop games industry, our brand hasn’t always been visible to players themselves. With this brand evolution, we aim to change that—making asmodee a name that’s recognized, trusted, loved, and sought out by players around the world.”&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The rebrand may also be a way of getting a fresh start after departing from Embracer Group. Embracer Group separated <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-splitting-three-companies" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">into three companies</a> last year after a string of acquisitions and deals fell through. Embracer has now been rebranded <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-fellowship-entertainment-coffee-stain" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Fellowship Entertainment</a>, named after its acquisition of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> IP, and another of its studios, Coffee Stain Studios, is also spinning off.</p>

<p>Asmodee remains an active part of the tabletop industry through multiple program initiatives. These include their <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/asmodees-game-in-lab-program-provides-eu20000-for-board-game-research-projects" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Game in Lab</a> program, which provides grants to scientific research projects related to board games, and distribution deals with indie studios such as <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/asmodee-usa-signs-distribution-deal-with-gray-matters-games" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gray Matter Games</a>.</p>
