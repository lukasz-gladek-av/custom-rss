            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has announced another Mega Evolution form for the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>, and this time, it's the turn of topsy-turvy squid Malamar.</p>

<p>Over the last few weeks, the publisher, along with developer Game Freak, has been drip-feeding new Mega Evolution announcements, including a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mega-victreebel-revealed-pokemon-legends-za" rel="nofollow">surprisingly effective horror reveal</a> for Mega Victreebel and a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mega-hawlucha-pokemon-legends-z-a" rel="nofollow">rather touching wrestling match</a> between Mega Hawlucha and Machamp.</p>

<p>Today's reveal shows off the Mega Evolved form of the Dark/Psychic-type Malamar, which is itself the evolved form of the rather adorable Inkay. As you'd probably imagine for a 'mon that looked rather sinister in its original incarnation, Mega Malamar has a sleek, dark appearance that's just a touch unsettling as well.</p>

<p>In today's trailer, we get to see Mega Malamar face off against both Charizard and Dragonite, and it makes short work of them thanks to its aforementioned hypnotic abilities. The trailer concludes with Malamar seemingly hypnotizing its trainer as well, leading to them waking up on a bench surrounded by Malamars.</p>

<p>Naturally, Mega Malamar will be appearing in the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>, which will be the second game in what can now be considered the overarching&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends&nbsp;</em>sub-series.</p>

<p>The game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-release-date-pokemon-presents" rel="nofollow">due to launch on October 16th</a>, will take place entirely in the city of Lumiose in the Kalos region, and it'll see players helping to oversee an urban redevelopment plan while also taking part in a city-wide battle tournament.</p>




<p>You'll be able to play&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>when it launches on October 16th for both Switch 2 and Switch, and if you want to know how the game's shaping up, you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/pokemon-legends-z-preview-another-reason-to-get-switch-2" rel="nofollow">check out our preview here</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Little Nightmares III Preview – Co-Op Nightmares]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/little-nightmares-iii-preview-co-op-nightmares</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/little-nightmares-iii-preview-%E2%80%93-co-op-nightmares.1293642/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Little Nightmares</em> has really earned a reputation for itself as one of the premier spooky sort-of-platformers out there. It's garnered <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/little-nightmares-2" rel="nofollow">lots of acclaim through word of mouth</a>, and that's paid off. According to Bandai Namco, it's sold 20 million units across the franchise.</p>

<p>However, this time around, things are a little different. After <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-thq-nordic-has-bought-little-nightmares-developer" rel="nofollow">Tarsier Studios was acquired by Embracer</a>, the franchise stayed with Bandai Namco. Now Supermassive Games of <a href="https://techraptor.net/series/dark-pictures-anthology" rel="nofollow"><em>Dark Pictures</em> fame</a> is helming development for <em>Little Nightmares III</em>.</p>

<p>Another big change here is the shift toward co-operative play. While not strictly required, single-player gameplay still slots in an AI to control the opposite character. In other words, teamwork is essential in this game—and in some cases, detrimental to its fun.</p>



<h2>Low and Alone in the Middle of Nowhere</h2>

<p><em>Little Nightmares III</em> stars two children named Low and Alone, and they're lost in a surreal world called the Nowhere. This space exists between dreams and reality, and they're trapped in the Spiral, which comprises of multiple dystopian worlds.</p>

<p>In my demo at PAX West, we played through the Carnevale level. I controlled Alone, the girl who wields a giant wrench like a club. A colleague played as Low, who uses a bow and arrow.</p>

<p>Almost every puzzle we ran into required some form of teamwork. Practically every crate needs both players to push or pull them, and defeating enemies requires a coordinated one-two punch, starting with an arrow to the head.</p>

<p>It fosters this sense of desperation and dependency in the player. You know you're not strong or able enough to escape this spooky place alone, and you need your companion if you want to have any chance to survive.</p>

<p>Overall, Supermassive did a good job of making the Carnevale feel unnaturally spooky and otherworldly. The oppressive rain creates a dreary atmosphere, and honestly, carnivals at night are already pretty unsettling. Add an army of creepy-moving puppets and giant, mangled hunchback types, and you've got yourself a perfect vibe for Halloween month.</p>



<h2>Co-Op Brings Worries</h2>

<p>While the overall vibe and atmosphere set the mood well, I found myself pretty quickly taken out of it at various times throughout our play session.</p>

<p>Some of the puzzles felt a bit too obtuse for us to figure out, which left us re-exploring the space over and over again until we realized the solution. And it wasn't that we overlooked the next step; we both found signals to be unclear, and they didn't quite telegraph what the solution was.</p>

<p>Other puzzles required skulking around monsters a very specific way using stealth. The windows for running from one place to the next felt just a little too tight for how slow the characters move while crouching. Even worse, figuring out the solution to these segments often means getting a little further than you did last time, scrambling to figure out what's next, and hopefully hiding before you're caught.</p>

<p>When one player is seen, it's a pretty immediate game over. There's no leeway to avoid capture, and then you're reset to the latest checkpoint. Honestly, the co-op aspect only made this more frustrating, as now you're both replaying the same thing and hoping the other doesn't reset the sequence.</p>

<p>I'm all for immersion and letting players discover the world, but when the punishment for the slightest error is constant retrials, the cycle tends to get wearisome.</p>

<p>Granted, part of this is a skill issue, which I'll readily own up to. I've also never played the previous games in the series. The Carnevale sequence we played occurs partway through the game, so I'd like to hope that by the time you naturally get there with your co-op partner, you'll both understand the gameplay and signals better. As a vertical slice with no context, I found it to be appropriately atmospheric but obtuse to the point of frustration.</p>



<h2><em>Little Nightmares III</em> Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>With such a focus on co-operative play, I do find it odd that there's no split-screen or same-screen option for in-person co-op. This feels like a great opportunity to spend time together in the same space, and facilitating an online session through Discord or something feels like it gets in the way of the magic.</p>

<p>Even worse, I feel like playing the game solo wouldn't capture the same essence, considering how the core gameplay works. Waiting on an AI partner to do its part feels like it could come off a little hollow, but I'm just speculating.</p>

<p>Still, I think if you're looking for a spooky game for the Halloween season, <em>Little Nightmares III</em> is shaping up to be a decent option, if not for its atmosphere alone. It feels properly haunted and eerie thanks to the oppressive nature of the enemies and the dark, dreary presentation. I just hope the puzzle work and stealth sections feel better as the gameplay naturally ramps up from a fresh start.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Nintendo Direct Presentation Announced for Friday]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-september-2025-announced</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced a brand new Nintendo Direct show for this month, and it's set to deliver a significant amount of info about upcoming Switch 2 and Switch games.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1965762503821935034" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a message</a> on social media, Nintendo says the Direct, which is scheduled for this Friday at 9am Eastern, will feature "roughly 60 minutes of information" on games coming to both machines, and this one isn't a Nindies show or a third-party showcase; it's a true blue Direct presentation.</p>

<p>Of course, that doesn't mean it won't feature indies or third-party efforts, but it does hopefully mean we can expect to see what Nintendo itself is cooking up for both Switch consoles for the next year or so.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-direct-september-2025-donkey-kong-bananza.jpg?itok=Fgz1lE3l 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-direct-september-2025-donkey-kong-bananza.jpg?itok=DocM9Ngv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>We'll hopefully find out what Nintendo is up to in the next Nintendo Direct.</figcaption></figure><p>This will mark Nintendo's third major Direct of the year; the first was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-march-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">back in March</a>, just prior to the announcement of the Switch 2, and it was followed by a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">partner show in August</a>&nbsp;and an indie presentation <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-indie-world-august-2025-show" rel="nofollow">just a few days after that</a>.</p>

<p>This Direct feels particularly significant, however; it's the first opportunity we'll have had since the Switch 2 to see what Nintendo's plans for the future look like, including whether any major releases for the studio's big franchises like&nbsp;<em>Mario&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>are in the works.</p>

<p>It's also likely, assuming the game hasn't been delayed, that we'll be getting a release date for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metroid-prime-4-beyond-2025" rel="nofollow">the long-awaited&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metroid-prime-4-beyond-2025" rel="nofollow">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>&nbsp;</em>during this Direct. The game is still scheduled for a 2025 release, but no specific date has been announced by Nintendo thus far.</p>

<p>Whatever's on the cards, this Direct will be longer than the Japanese gaming giant's shows often are, so we'll hopefully get a good chance to go in-depth on the upcoming Switch 2 and Switch slates.</p>

Yes, you read that right.</p>

<p>As a reminder, Nintendo is currently suing Pocketpair, the studio behind&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>, for patent infringement, which has already caused the studio to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-mechanics-changing-nintendo-lawsuit" rel="nofollow">change the game's mechanics</a> at least once.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/fallen-tear-ascension-preview-move-over-silksong</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fallen-tear-the-ascension-preview-%E2%80%93-move-over-silksong.1293552/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's been a good year for sidescrolling action games. <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/shinobi-art-of-vengeance-review-cutting-edge" rel="nofollow"><em>Shinobi: Art of Vengeance</em></a> was wonderful surprise from SEGA, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-review-razor-sharp-retro-platformer" rel="nofollow"><em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em></a> could be the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/pax-west-2025-x-games-you-should-add-to-your-wishlist" rel="nofollow">first of two great <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> games this year</a>. I'm sure I don't even need to mention <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> either.</p>

<p>At PAX West, I found what could be the next sidescrolling metroidvania to keep the party going early next year, and that's <em>Fallen Tear: The Ascension</em>.</p>

<p>Developed by a small but mighty team in the Philippines, this game has a nice pace of combat, a charming art style, and a solid foundation for what could be a fun adventure.</p>



<h2>Classic High-Speed Action</h2>

<p>Honestly, my first note I wrote in my notepad for this game was, "That's that good shit." The combat is silky smooth here, reminiscent of games like <i>Dead Cells</i>&nbsp;and <em>Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</em>.</p>

<p>From the jump in the demo, I had access to a robust move set that kept me mobile and engaged. Thre's a double jump, dash, air dash, and a backwards dodge just like Alucard's. There's a basic multi-hit combo attack that you can dodge out of almost whenever you'd like.</p>



<p>The biggest rule-of-cool move here is this warping spear that I unlocked partway through the demo. When it connects with an enemy, you appear slightly above and behind them, ready to rain down a quick combo. Equal parts mobility and offense, it was something I spammed whenever I had the chance.</p>

<p>It opened up a fun way of thinking as well, where I'd sometimes leave enemies alive but with low health. If I was in a corner, one well-aimed spear zipped me away to relative safety.</p>



<p>In general, I found myself always wanting to be on the move because it just felt good to move. And you'll want to stay mobile, with the number of enemies and attacks that the <em>Fallen Tear</em> throws at you.</p>

<p>I thought the healing mechanic was nifty, too, as it rewards aggression. Pressing down on the D-pad spends some meter to heal, though it's pretty minimal. Some enemies drop red orbs when they die, and as long as they're on screen, Hira, the protagonist, will suck them in to heal more substantially.</p>



<h2>The Power of Friendship</h2>

<p>Fallen Tear: The Ascension also borrows some inspiration from JRPGs, featuring a party of people you can recruit and swap in and out. You meet them along your journey, but they won't necessarily be out and about, wreaking havoc by your side.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Instead, you sort of "equip" them. You can have up to three at a time, and each one will provide a passive buff. Additionally, they'll each have an active ability that's mapped to when you hold a shoulder button and press a face button.</p>



<p>When three are equipped, you can build up a meter and expend it to do a big group attack using your entire party, which is a great way to unload big damage on a boss.</p>

<p>These characters are more than just combat buffs, though. According to the Steam page for <em>Fallen Tear: The Ascension</em>, you can bond with these party members throughout the story, which is giving <em>Persona </em>social links to me.</p>

<p>Additionally, there's supposed to be a larger focus on these bonds in relation to the story, per its inspiration from JRPGs. I'm all for the power of friendship being a core part of the story, and I hope to see more of it as it comes out next year.</p>



<h2><em>Fallen Tear: The Ascension</em> Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>With its charming, hand-drawn art style, <em>Fallen Tear: The Ascension</em> is a treat to look at, especially in motion. When it pulls you in, it keeps you there with its engaging combat and fluid movement. I can only hope that feeling stays for the long-term as the story unfolds in the full game.</p>
