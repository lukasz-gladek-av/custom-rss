            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There’s no hyperbole attached when announcing an opinion as potentially outlandish as “<em>Katamari </em>is possibly the most joyful series of games ever made”. Forget the horrifying implications of what happens to the Katamari, and the King’s true power, just roll away your troubles until the land beneath you attaches to your goals. In all honesty, thank The King of All Cosmos for <em>Once Upon a KATAMARI</em>.</p>

<p>This is the latest release in the saccharine series, developed by the brand new Japanese studio RENGAME, and the first console release since 2011’s <em>Touch My Katamari</em> for the PlayStation Vita. You follow the typical adventures of The King of All Cosmos and the 5cm Prince (and his many, many cousins). Once again, the King’s silly escapades have caused untold destruction to the surrounding Solar System. While you run around at the King’s command, the King and Queen find themselves in awe of the culture they imbibe through your travels.</p>

<p>If you’ve never played a <em>Katamari </em>game before, you’re doing yourself a disservice to what is a fascinating balance of serenity and stress. A Katamari ball has the distinct property of being able to roll up anything smaller than its current diameter, with the game typically throwing you into a very messy environment to expand. In <em>Once Upon a KATAMARI</em>, it’s up to you to roll a Katamari big enough to fix those issues, only this time, we’re going through time.</p>



<p>Yes, that’s right, <em>Katamari </em>has entered the time travel entry of its franchise! Over 9 periods, the Prince is tasked to aid individuals all the way from the Stone Age to the current, all of whom, surprisingly, already know of the King and his deeds. Seemingly reverent to a world he’s shown irreverence towards in the past, the King will task you to help those to understand the Katamari – not just Katamari, but <em>Katamari Damacy</em> in general.</p>

<p>All in all, it’s a very introspective entry in the series, even more so than <em>Katamari Forever</em>. While not explicitly playing on a best-of framing – a common sin for many <em>Katamari </em>titles in the series – what is drawn up for the player is a host of varied challenges, the usual Cousin collecting, and quirky commentary from the King throughout. What follows is an honest, brisk, and otherwise beautifully rewarding experience.</p>

<p>Everything in this game, from the levels, to the challenges, to the cousins, to the cutscenes, to the music, to the costumes, to the simple exiting of the game, feels like a “thank you” from RENGAME and co. It’s par for the course for your average <em>Katamari </em>experience, but with <em>Once Upon a KATAMARI</em>, so much attention has been paid to how the franchise runs parallel to the story’s own history. On top of that, RENGAME has expanded on what that franchise and history mean to the player collectively.</p>



<p>The level design is much more packed and claustrophobic in the initial stretches, compared to previous titles. Maybe it’s due to the King of All Cosmos’ newfound empathy, but a lot of levels will see you bumble and buzz around busy and bustling streets and markets, rarely engaging in the series’ past of continent-swallowing snowballing. For what it’s worth, the pacing is <em>g l a c i a l</em>, which can be a deterrent for some.</p>

<p>It was for me at first, eagerly awaiting the first time a city would face my adhesive wrath, but <em>Once Upon a KATAMARI </em>sidesteps this with gimmicky challenges, similar to <em>We Love Katamari</em>. You’ve got the usual rolling up specific classes of objects, and the ever-so-gluttonous food challenges, but you’ve also got very well-hidden collectibles, in the form of new playable Cousins, cosmetic items, and Crowns.</p>

<p>Crowns are tied to in-game progress, so they do become a necessity over time, but the game offers so much bite-sized content that roadblocks rarely ever feel impassible. Of the several dozen levels available, these roadblocks only ever come at a time when the progression has already branched out multiple times. Sure, you’ll come across a dud of a challenge more than once due to the sheer amount and variety of them, but there’s so much killer on display here.</p>



<p>There’s also “KatamariBall”, a frankly standard quirky multiplayer mode which involves collecting several items, and depositing them in a continuously-moving checkpoint. It feeds into the chaotic nature you’d usually find yourself in while playing a multiplayer Katamari experience, but this is the first time where it falls mechanically flat. The brevity of it all leads to confusing situations that don’t even feel adequately explained, even when The King of All Cosmos is cheering you on.</p>

<p>Still, I found myself chomping at the bit to grow bigger, larger, fighting Kaiju and ripping volcanoes from the crust, but contextually, it started to come around. <em>Once Upon a KATAMARI</em> doesn’t want to focus on the scale of the series, but the sensation. How it feels to roll down a hill and be unable to be stopped by the most rooted obstacle, the perturbed looks from passersby, feeling like the first time, every time. In this instance, it succeeds, more than once.</p>

<p>It helps that the King’s once booming and pragmatic commentary has now softened to a more explorative soul. Whereas his past experiences saw him bitter, almost disgusted at many of your misgivings, the nature of the game has changed a lot since we last saw him 15-odd years ago. His chronicles adventures of Edo Japan throughout, see an individual fascinated by the world he’s destroyed, so many,&nbsp;<em>many</em> times, and The Queen’s partaking of era-adjacent activities are also full of reverberant life.</p>



<p>It’s easy to say “this is the best <em>Katamari </em>has been in a while”. The series has seen so few new entries in the years past, the first two titles’ remakes being the most prominent that many new players have seen. With that said, <em>Once Upon a KATAMARI</em>’s genuinely affecting reflections and presentation leave it in a position where, truthfully? This feels like the new benchmark.</p>

<h2><strong><em>Once Upon a KATAMARI&nbsp;</em></strong>Review | Final Verdict</h2>

<p>While Keita Takahashi’s hand has not been involved in <em>Katamari </em>for a while, it’s easy to see that his ethos hasn’t dissipated since <em>Katamari Damacy</em>’s release, 21 years ago. <em>Once Upon a KATAMARI</em> isn’t just a celebration of Takahashi and co. 's work, but a celebration of the human exercise of collecting. History and humanity hand in hand for a homely, happy time, and readily available for newcomers and veterans alike.</p>

<p>What a vibe.</p>
