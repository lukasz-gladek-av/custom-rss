            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Dropout has dropped a new trailer for <em>Adventuring Academy</em> Season 7. The latest season of the comedy talk show features the company's resident TTRPG expert, Brennan Lee Mulligan, chatting with a new suite of guests.</p><p>The new <em>Adventuring Academy</em> Season 7 trailer provides more of what fans have come to expect from the Dropout crew. For those not aware, <em>Adventuring Academy</em> is a talk show where Brennan Lee Mulligan, the mind behind the platform's comedic actual play anthology series <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/dimension-20-gladlands-is-mad-max-if-everyone-wasnt-being-so-rude-interview" rel="nofollow"><em>Dimension 20</em></a>, casually chats with a host about tabletop gaming.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>These talks span a wide number of topics in regards to play for both new and experienced players. How do you handle a player character dying? How do you make a memorable character in your game? How much worldbuilding is too much? What steps can you take to make your players feel comfortable and safe when undertaking dark or intense scenarios?&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, these episodes can veer into comedic asides and passionate hot takes. That doesn't appear to have changed in the <em>Adventuring Academy</em> Season 7 trailer. A guest declaring their dislike of Gandalf from <em>Lord of the Rings</em>. Brennan's slightly changed relationship with snacking and almonds. The edict of "mandatory queerness." It is all in line with Dropout's distinct irreverent brand.</p><p>The new season's guests are a mix of Dropout regulars and other creatives in the space. They include Vic Michaelis, Robbie Daymond, Oscar Montoya, Kimia Behpoornia, Aabria Iyengar, Emily Friedman, Mica Burton, Quinns Smith, and Jasper William Cartwright.</p><p>Overall, the line-up is consistent with past seasons. Prior guests have included Dropout talent like Jacob Wysocki, Sam Reich, Lou Wilson, and Ally Beardsley, as well as other professional tabletop creatives like Jasmine Bhullar, Deborah Ann Woll, Dave Walters, Marisha Ray, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-campaign-4-trailer-introduces-us-to-land-of-araman" rel="nofollow">Critical Role's</a> own Matt Mercer.</p><p><em>Adventuring Academy </em>Season 7 premieres exclusively on Dropout on February 20th.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>What if I told you a game of <em>Call of Cthulhu</em> didn’t have to take place in 1920s New England? What if it could, for example, take place in the neon-soaked world of 1980s Japan? Sounds pretty rad, right? Well dreams come true (whether we want them to or not)! I previously reviewed the fabulous <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/call-of-cthulhu-arkham-review-supplemental-strangeness" rel="nofollow"><em>Call of Cthulhu: Arkham</em></a>, and was thrilled to receive a review copy of the brand-new adventure module <a href="https://www.chaosium.com/call-of-cthulhu-the-sutra-of-pale-leaves-twin-suns-rising-hardcover/?srsltid=AfmBOorE18GDqZ_l9nqFt_Xb8c97pIqO4m82Rcwi7SXQzF1c0TIWPPKo" rel="nofollow"><em>The Sutra of Pale Leaves - Twin Suns Rising</em></a> from Chaosium.</p><p><em>Call of Cthulhu: The Sutra of Pale Leaves - Twin Suns Rising</em> is the first of two supplemental books for <em>Call of Cthulhu</em> set in 1980s Japan. Consisting of three standalone adventures (which can also each be strung together for a longer narrative), the game sees players tracking down The Sutra of Pale Leaves, a strange religious scripture with otherworldly origins.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The book begins with a very detailed look into 1980s Japan, describing in general details the culture, how society reacted to an economic bubble, and close-up views of various aspects of daily life. Like all books in Chaosium’s <em>Call of Cthulhu</em> line, it feels well-researched, inviting you into a world that feels real and tangible (before things get extremely unreal and intangible, of course).</p><p>From there, readers will find valuable information about key characters, an overview of the plot, and rules for tracking a very specific and secret status effect throughout the campaign.</p><p><strong>WARNING: </strong>If you’re interested in <em>playing</em> this game vs. <em>running</em> this game as a keeper, I suggest you turn back now. I can’t talk about the book without spoiling at least <em>some</em> of the mystery and surprise here! Okay, you’ve been warned, here we go!</p><picture>

  </picture><h2><strong>What’s Going On With This Sutra of Pale Leaves?</strong></h2><p>While the Sutra of Pale Leaves seems to be a very old, obtuse religious text, it’s actually a kind of memetic virus created by the Prince of Pale Leaves, better known to Mythos fans as The King in Yellow.&nbsp;</p><p>Trapped underground in his home world, he seeks to infect Earth with this mind-virus by exposing as many people as possible to the Sutra of Pale Leaves.</p><p>This is where our investigators come in, though they’ll have no idea at the start of the adventure that that’s what they’re up against.&nbsp;</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-cthulhu-the-sutra-of-pale-leaves-twin-suns-rising-cops-large.jpeg?itok=YhwO_3c2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1042" height="712">

  </picture><p>In fact, they could go an entire adventure (they call them Chapters in the book) without realizing the Sutra is actually a problem - such is the insidious nature of the Prince of Pale Leaves.</p><p>As the investigators explore 1980s Japan in the three included scenarios presented in this book (there’s another book in this setting with an additional four adventures also available called <a href="https://www.chaosium.com/call-of-cthulhu-the-sutra-of-pale-leaves-2-carcosa-manifest-hardcover/" rel="nofollow"><em>Carcosa Manifest</em></a>), they’ll slowly gain Exposure Points (which are kept secret from the investigators) by coming into contact with the Sutra.&nbsp;</p><p>As these points accumulate, they’ll become more and more under the sway of the Prince of Pale Leaves.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-cthulhu-the-sutra-of-pale-leaves-twin-suns-rising-tokyo-large.jpeg?itok=6u25ODEG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1280" height="762">

  </picture><p>This creates a wonderfully tense, running problem that the investigators may have little awareness of (especially at the start), and as they begin to realize the danger of coming into contact with the Sutra in all its forms, they’ll have to balance the necessity of interacting with the text against the perils of infecting their minds further with it.</p><h2><strong>What Adventures are included in </strong><em><strong>Call of Cthulhu: The Sutra of Pale Leaves - Twin Suns Rising</strong></em><strong>?</strong></h2><p>Included in <em>Call of Cthulhu: The Sutra of Pale Leaves - Twin Suns Rising </em>are three distinct adventures that can be played solo or chained together to form a longer campaign. I’ll speak briefly here about the flavor and general thrust of each one.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-cthulhu-the-sutra-of-pale-leaves-twin-suns-rising-baku-large.jpeg?itok=qkAG0t93 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="916" height="566">

  </picture><p>First up is <strong>Dream Eater</strong>, in this adventure the investigators are called to a small town outside of Tokyo to help uncover the root cause of bad dreams plaguing the town. As they uncover more, they’ll learn that a Baku (a Japanese supernatural creature known for devouring dreams) is feeding on nightmares caused by exposure to the Sutra.</p><p>This Baku’s presence threatens the Prince of Pale Leaves, as he doesn’t want his nightmares gobbled up - and so the investigators, who have little foreknowledge of any of the goings on with the Sutra (especially if this adventure is played first), may unwittingly end up helping <em>defeat</em> the Baku! Starting slow without thrusting the players into the rush of big city Tokyo, this adventure is great when it serves as the first one played in a longer campaign.</p><p>Next up is <strong>Fan Fiction</strong>, where a talented indie manga artist has turned the Sutra into a manga to increase its viral appeal. Knowing that the Sutra as a sacred religious text won’t reach the masses, this new approach is sure to spread its influence.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>But when the adventure starts, the threat of this manga may not seem overtly apparent, as a twisted off-shoot and poorly made copy of the manga has been making the rounds, distorting the original viral code of the Sutra with disastrous consequences.</p><p>Third and final adventure in this book is <strong>The Pallid Masks of Tokyo</strong>, which begins with the ghastly discovery of a corpse in one of the nightlife districts of Tokyo. But there’s a catch… the body is completely faceless, with no eyes, nose, mouth, or ears!</p><p>This adventure will take investigators briefly through the seedy underbelly of Tokyo before plunging them into a psychiatric ward where machinations are in place to create an army of faceless servants for the Prince of Pale Leaves!</p><picture>

  </picture><h2><em><strong>Call of Cthulhu: The Sutra of Pale Leaves - Twin Suns Rising</strong></em><strong> - Final Thoughts</strong></h2><p><em>Call of Cthulhu: The Sutra of Pale Leaves - Twin Suns Rising</em> is, without a doubt, one of the most exciting run of adventures and settings in <em>Call of Cthulhu</em> I’ve read in a long time. The shift into 1980s Japan is a breath of fresh air, and I love how heady the overall conceit of the campaign feels.</p><p>This isn’t cultists trying to bring a big octopus monster out of the ocean in New England, it’s a dedicated conspiracy in Tokyo trying to blend power, indulgence, and religious and spiritual fanaticism together to virally infect the psyches of as many everyday people as possible. The threat is always immediate <em>and</em> looming, and it feels complicated and conflicted in a way we seldom see in <em>any</em> tabletop roleplaying game.</p><p>And while the scope, depth, and somewhat sandbox style of adventure writing here might feel daunting for new players, I cannot recommend this book enough to players familiar with <em>Call of Cthulhu</em>, or for experienced TTRPG players looking to dip their toes into the system, but aren’t interested in the Roaring ‘20s vibe of the core game.</p><hr><p><em>The copy of </em>Call of Cthulhu: The Sutra of Pale Leaves - Twin Suns Rising<em> used in the creation of this review was provided by Chaosium.
