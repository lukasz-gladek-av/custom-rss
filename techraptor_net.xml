            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong" rel="nofollow"><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em></a> finally released this month after years of teasing and development (can you believe a build was playable at E3 2019?). This is a game so anticipated <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-crashing-storefronts" rel="nofollow">it broke the Nintendo eShop the morning it launched</a>, with countless players praising <em>Silksong's</em> gameplay, challenge, and boss battles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But once the credits roll, you might find yourself craving even more Metroidvania exploration, and we have some recommendations to help fill that hole. Here are six Metroidvanias we recommend checking out if you loved <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong!&nbsp;</em></p>



<h2><em>Metroid Dread</em></h2>

<p>Though it's silly to call a <em>Metroid</em> or a <em>Castlevania</em> game a Metroidvania when the genre is named after these titles,<em> <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/metroid-dread" rel="nofollow">Metroid Dread</a></em> is one of the strongest games that the series has seen in recent memory. The best-selling <em>Metroid </em>game of all time, <em>Metroid Dread</em> brings players into the action immediately and does an incredible job of allowing you to explore organically without overly guiding you.</p>

<p>Where other Metroidvanias can feel a little overwhelming, <em>Metroid Dread</em> is manageable and gives you a steady drop of powerups and upgrades to keep the gameplay interesting and the story moving. If you haven't checked out this Nintendo Switch <em>Metroid</em> game yet, especially ahead of&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime: Beyond</em>, we recommend picking it up.</p>

<h2><em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown&nbsp;</em></h2>

<p>An excellent title that came out just last year,<em> <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/prince-of-persia-lost-crown" rel="nofollow">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a></em>&nbsp;is a refreshing take on the franchise. This sprawling Metroidvania not only boasts colorful and beautiful art direction, but it also gives players crisp controls that make the many platforming sections and boss battles feel very intuitive.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</em> also offers some much-appreciated accessibility options, like a Guided Mode that can highlight where your next objective is. If you prefer the classic Metroidvania feel, though, Exploration Mode is the right choice for you. For a super fun, accessible experience that gives you plenty of upgrades and accessories to equip along the way, be sure to check out <em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><em>Animal Well</em></h2>

<p>Many of the Metroidvania games we recommend you play after <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong </em>fall into the 2.5D HD category, but <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/animal-well" rel="nofollow">Animal Well</a></em>&nbsp;is a deviation that fits securely into the 2D space. Beautiful pixel art and inspiring level design come together to form this experience that quickly became a fan favorite.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Animal Well</em> is designed with layers of puzzles and secrets, though how deep the player descends into these secrets is mostly up to the individual. Many of the items collected have multiple uses, and the explored rooms can offer multiple connections to keep you guessing and working through puzzles during the entire experience.<em> Animal Well</em> exists with minimal exposition, giving the player the opportunity to fully explore and enjoy this world on their own terms.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><em>Ori and the Will of the Wisps&nbsp;</em></h2>

<p>The sequel to 2015's <em>Ori and the Blind Forest</em>, <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/ori-and-will-of-wisps" rel="nofollow">Ori and the Will of the Wisps</a> </em>came along in 2020 and expanded on the original's Metroidvania concepts. Set against artfully designed backdrops with adorably drawn creatures, <em>Ori and the Will of the Wisps </em>offers an impressively intuitive platforming experience with movement mechanics that are extremely fun to master.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With responsive sword combat and a host of skills and upgrades that make <em>Ori and the Will of the Wisps</em> a joy to play, this game provides plenty to love for Metroidvania fans looking for their next experience.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><em>Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night&nbsp;</em></h2>

<p>A true <em>Castlevania</em> spiritual successor (developed by Koji Igarashi, who previously worked on every Metroidvania installment in the franchise), <em>Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night </em>stands out in a crowded segment. If you enjoyed <em>Symphony of the Night</em>, many of the elements carry over to this title, with countless secrets to uncover and a litany of items to collect.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Players will find a sprawling, meticulously designed castle and engaging combat awaiting them if they choose to check out <em>Ritual of the Night</em>. Fluid gameplay and engaging boss battles come together to make an experience that you won't soon forget. If&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>has you craving more excellent game design,&nbsp;<em>Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night&nbsp;</em>is an excellent choice.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><em>Axiom Verge 2&nbsp;</em></h2>

<p>Sequel to 2015's <em>Axiom Verge</em>, <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/axiom-verge-2" rel="nofollow">Axiom Verge 2</a> </em>builds on its predecessor by offering impressively detailed biomes to explore and a variety of upgrades to pick up along the way. The pixelation of the world doesn't take away from any of its beauty—in fact it adds to it—and the fluid gameplay allows you to effortlessly explore and uncover the secrets awaiting you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While many Metroidvania games focus on the strengths of a single character, <em>Axiom Verge 2 </em>offers players both a human form and a drone form that they can transform into, unlocking additional traversing capabilities. If you found&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>'s&nbsp;combat a little too punishing, you'll be pleased to know that much of the combat in <em>Axiom Verge 2</em> is optional. This experience does an exceptional job of providing you with a detailed and expansive world to explore, making it a great option for those looking for a Metroidvania after <em>Silksong</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>What Should I Play After <em>Silksong?&nbsp;</em></h2>

<p>These are just six titles that we recommend you check out after playing <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>, but Metroidvania titles are some of the most robust across the gaming landscape, ensuring there's something for everyone. Likewise, if you haven't played <em>Silksong</em> yet and are looking for an appetizer, these titles can be a great way to ease you into the world of Metroidvanias.&nbsp;</p>
