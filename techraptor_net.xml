            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-profits-plummet-switch-150m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has released its financial statement for the nine-month period between April and December 2024, and although the Switch has hit a new sales milestone, profits and sales are down overall.</p>

<p>In its financial <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250204_3e.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">presentation</a>, Nintendo acknowledges that sales are down by 31.4% and net profit has fallen by 41.9% when compared to the same nine-month period last year, with sales of both hardware and software plummeting.</p>

<p>Despite this, the company also reveals that the Switch has reached 150 million lifetime sales, putting it within throwing distance of the Nintendo DS family (around 154 million) and perhaps even the all-time title holder, Sony's PS2 (160 million).</p>

<p>Newcomer&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>sold almost 4 million copies, while&nbsp;<em>Nintendo Switch Sports&nbsp;</em>picked up another 2.63 million sales for itself. Incredibly,&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&nbsp;</em>sold 5.38 million units during this time period. Could there still be Switch owners out there who don't own this game?</p>

<p>Of course, there's one big, massive exclamation point hanging over these figures, and that's the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">recent announcement</a> of the Nintendo Switch 2, which will be unveiled in full during a Nintendo Direct showcase in April.</p>

<p>While the console itself wasn't revealed until January, Nintendo did reveal in May that a Switch 2 announcement <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation" rel="nofollow">would come before April 2025</a>, suggesting that many consumers may have been holding off on buying a Switch in order to wait for the new machine to appear.</p>




<p>&nbsp;With regards to its future, Nintendo points to a number of games it's releasing in the coming months, including the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-announced" rel="nofollow">remastered version of&nbsp;<em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em></a>, which is due to land in March.</p>

<p>The publisher also recommits to 2025 releases for&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-a-announced" rel="nofollow">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metroid-prime-4-beyond-2025" rel="nofollow"><em>Metroid Prime 4</em></a>, both of which are apparently still slated to come to the original Switch (although I wouldn't be surprised to see Switch 2 ports for both).</p>

<p>You can check out Nintendo's full <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250204e.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">financial results document right here</a> if you want to get super-nerdy with stats and figures.</p>
