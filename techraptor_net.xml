            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Larian Studios is celebrating&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>'s second anniversary, and as part of those celebrations, the developer has released some fun statistics about the celebrated CRPG, including which of the game's cast is the most-respecced character and more.</p>

<p>As part of&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>'s Community Update 35 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/538860954058754131" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on Steam</a>, Larian reveals that the cleric Shadowheart is the game's most-respecced character, which, if you're new to CRPGs, means she's the one whose class or subclass players have changed the most.</p>

<p>According to Larian, Shadowheart was most often switched to either the Life Domain or Death Domain subclasses, so while players aren't changing her overall class, they're clearly split on which cleric path Shadowheart should follow. That makes sense, given her personal storyline.</p>

<p>Some other fun&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>stats include the 4,647 players who managed to beat the game's Honour Mode at level one, as well as the 350 players who decided that returning character Minsc would be better served as a Death Domain cleric. Hmm.</p>

<p>You can also see a bunch of fun photo mode creations that players have put together in the Steam post, as well as some info about what Larian is up to over the next few months (although that probably doesn't involve the studio announcing its next game, unfortunately).</p>




<p>The final major&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>update <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-major-baldurs-gate-3-update-patch-notes" rel="nofollow">was released back in April</a>, bringing features like a photo mode, crossplay between platforms, and cross-platform progression to allow you to continue your save across PC and console.</p>
