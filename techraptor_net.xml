            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>A Short Hike&nbsp;</em>developer Adam Robinson-Yu has announced that he's ceased work on his project&nbsp;<em>Untitled Paper RPG</em>, but he's released a free demo if you want to know how the game would have turned out.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://adamgryu.itch.io/paper-game/devlog/971220/i-might-never-finish-this-game-so-im-releasing-the-demo" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> on his Itch.io page, Robinson-Yu says that after taking a break from <i>Untitled Paper RPG&nbsp;</i>to work on&nbsp;<em>A Short Hike</em>, as well as its various ports and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/short-hike-99-is-multiplayer-mod-for-up-to-99-players" rel="nofollow">updates</a>, he found he "didn't really want to go back to [<em>Untitled Paper RPG</em>]".</p>

<p>He says development on the project "had become difficult", which was the reason for taking a break from it in order to work on&nbsp;<em>A Short Hike</em>. The game technically isn't completely canceled; Robinson-Yu says he "might return" to it someday, but that he "[doesn't] see [himself] making time for this RPG in near future".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/a-short-hike-dev-untitled-paper-rpg-dialogue.jpg?itok=kUUB0vD2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/a-short-hike-dev-untitled-paper-rpg-dialogue.jpg?itok=6LChqLSU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Untitled Paper RPG&nbsp;</em>is no more, at least for now.</figcaption></figure><p>Robinson-Yu gives various reasons for&nbsp;<em>Untitled Paper RPG</em>'s development becoming difficult, including overscoping, a lack of narrative focus, and "doubts" about the game's turn-based combat, which he says ended up feeling like "an annoying obstacle".</p>

<p>In the end, Robinson-Yu says he simply "started to lose the joy that [he] felt working on [<em>Untitled Paper RPG</em>]", which is usually a pretty good sign that it's time to stop and look for something new, if you ask me.</p>

<p>However, if you do want to know how&nbsp;<em>Untitled Paper RPG&nbsp;</em>might have turned out, then there's a free demo available from <a href="https://adamgryu.itch.io/paper-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Robinson-Yu's Itch.io page</a> right now. It constitutes around an hour or two of gameplay, but don't expect it to feel like a finished product.</p>

It's not clear whether any of these games will see the light of day, of course.</p>

<p>If you want to check out what Robinson-Yu was doing during his&nbsp;<em>Untitled Paper RPG&nbsp;</em>sabbatical,&nbsp;<em>A Short Hike&nbsp;</em>is available now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1055540/A_Short_Hike/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/a-short-hike/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 4</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/a-short-hike/9nk78df207sd" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox One</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/a-short-hike-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>, and you can play it on all of those consoles' successors through backwards compatibility as well.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>From web-slinging teenagers to mutants with god-like powers, I think just about any gamer who's ever read a Marvel comic or watched a Marvel movie or show has thought to themselves&nbsp;<em>this would be pretty sick to play in an RPG</em>. And while RPG systems have come and gone, the newest entry in town,&nbsp;<em>The Marvel Multiverse RPG</em>, from CMON is here to help you get right into the action. Distributor Asmodee USA sent along a copy of the new Starter Set for us to check out, so you know what to do... read on for my thoughts!</p>

<h2>What's Included In <em>The Marvel Multiverse RPG</em> Escape From Planet Hulk Starter Kit?</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-multiverse-roleplaying-contents.jpg?itok=Hwz2G0_o 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-multiverse-roleplaying-contents.jpg?itok=XO1szYQz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The Escape from Planet Hulk Starter Kit comes with everyone you need to get your group of gamers suited up and ready to fight the big bads. Each set contains:</p>

<ul><li>Booklet with Starter Set Rules, 64 pages</li>
	<li>Booklet with Power References, 8 pages</li>
	<li>Booklet with “Escape from Planet Hulk Adventure”, 24 pages</li>
	<li>6 Character Sheet Folios</li>
	<li>One 2-sided giant map, sized 864x1120 mm &nbsp;</li>
	<li>1 Punchboard with 6 Heroes and 50 round tokens for Villains and other Characters</li>
	<li>3 custom “616” Dice (2 regular dice and 1 Marvel dice)</li>
</ul><p>With one Game Master and six available characters to play with, you could potentially run this box set for a group of 7! I wouldn't recommend it, that feels a little on the heavy side to me, but it&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;possible. The included characters are an interesting mix, allowing you to play as Black Panther, Captain America, Black Widow, Storm, Spider-man (Miles Morales), and Wolverine (Laura Kinney).</p>

<h2>The Adventure In The Box</h2>

<p>The adventure contained in the box begins with a bang, as our characters find themselves instantly and magically transported to Planet Hulk by The Grandmaster, where they're forced to face off against robotic drones in a televised bout. But as a captured Hulk begins doing what he does best, chaos erupts and offers our heroes a chance for escape.</p>

<p>Without spoiling too much of the story for interested players, you'll spend the rest of the adventure finding other captured (and unexpected) allies, battling back against the Grandmaster, and using your strength, speed, and cunning to make an escape - but not before an iconic villain steps into your path to mess things up.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-multiverse-roleplaying-rules.jpg?itok=l4PfTFXx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-multiverse-roleplaying-rules.jpg?itok=gUb1b99W 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Powers are central to the game, and the introductory rulebook gives us a nice intro. There's a much more intense additional book of powers, too.</figcaption></figure><p>This adventure works really well as a teaching device, slowly introducing the many different systems of the game. The funny thing about&nbsp;<em>Marvel Multiverse&nbsp;</em>is that, for a system designed around such a popular IP, it's honestly kind of crunchy! So having an introductory adventure to guide both the game master and the players through is crucial. I'm honestly not sure that I'd want to run this game straight out of the core rulebook for new players.</p>

<h2>The Core Mechanic Behind <em>Marvel Multiverse RPG</em></h2>

<p>The core mechanic of the game revolves around the ingenious d616 system. In essence, this system sees you rolling 3d6, with one of the three d6's being designated the Marvel die. Those dice are rolled, added up (along with any relevant modifiers), and set against a target number to beat. If you beat the number, your action (attacking a villain, throwing a car, shooting laser beams from your eyes) is successful (and damage will be rolled if relevant).</p>

<p>But here's where the system has a fun twist - the Marvel die. If you roll a six on that die,&nbsp;<em>something</em>&nbsp;good will happen whether you succeed or fail the check. So, for example, let's say you're playing as Captain America, and you want to use your shield to smash a control panel before automatic doors slam shut, locking you inside a chamber. You roll your dice and fail the check, but that Marvel die is a 6!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-multiverse-roleplaying-tokens-and-dice.jpg?itok=Du4gy4La 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-multiverse-roleplaying-tokens-and-dice.jpg?itok=zZiL4_qZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A roll like this is a huge success, and creates even better situations for the heroes.</figcaption></figure><p>How do we squeak out some benefit from this failure? Maybe the shield ricochets off of the console and, while it doesn't shut it down, it bounces and crashes into an air duct, opening up a new (but potentially more complicated or dangerous) route of escape! Or maybe the shield misses the console completely, but knocks out a few of the guards coming to take you down!</p>

<p>Though the game can get complicated with its damage and powers, this element really shines bright for me. It reminds me of the Fantasy Flight <i>Star Wars</i>&nbsp;RPG's like&nbsp;<em>Edge of Empire</em>, where you would roll custom dice with pips that could see you failing a check but still getting some sort of benefit (or the opposite, succeeding with some bad luck thrown in). This leads to a lot of narrative flexibility, inviting both the players and the DM to get into character and think creatively about the situation they find themselves in.</p>

<h2>BONUS:&nbsp;<em>Marvel Multiverse RPG&nbsp;</em>2D Miniatures</h2>

<p>The adventure itself only includes cardboard tokens for your heroes and villains, but Asmodee also sent along their two new kits of 2D miniatures, which each feature a random assortment of heroes and villains. It should be noted that this product wasn't made with the adventure in mind - so none of these characters show up in the adventure itself.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-multiverse-roleplaying-2d-minis-2.jpg?itok=uJZ4fyVu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-multiverse-roleplaying-2d-minis-2.jpg?itok=OdVQ2zUO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The first pack contains Captain Marvel, Photon, Hawkeye, Scarlet Witch, Titania, Iron Man, Bullseye, Jessica Jones, Kraven the Hunter, and Doctor Doom. That's quite the mix!</p>

<p>I really like the quality of these 2D acrylic miniatures - in a world where plastic painted minis are constantly elbowing for space on my shelves, it's nice to be able to tuck twenty miniatures into a tuck box.</p>

<p>And I think the 2D nature even adds to the experience when playing with these comic book characters. It's like they're jumping off the page!</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-multiverse-roleplaying-2d-minis-1.jpg?itok=BB-lHZqw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-multiverse-roleplaying-2d-minis-1.jpg?itok=aw1H9-9I 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The second set contains the following characters: Ms. Marvel, Wasp, Thanos, Sabretooth, Luke Cage, Doctor Strange, Doctor Octopus, America Chavez, Hela, and Iceman.</p>

<p>It's an odd assortment across these two kits, but I think it encourages players and GM's to incorporate these heroes and villains into the game in a fun way. It's kind of like hero and villain adlibs! I could see a GM looking at this pile of miniatures and, in a pinch, throwing Doctor Octopus, Titania, and Luke Cage into a scene just to see what happens.</p>



<p>Giving final thoughts on this product is interesting, because I have different thoughts about the game system itself and this box, but how do they intersect with one another?</p>

<p>I find the game itself to have a really fun core mechanic, I love that d616 dice rolling mechanic, it's clean and easy to grasp, but then there are other elements - like the way you calculate damage - that either feel unbalanced or overly complicated.</p>

<p>But here's where it gets confusing for me - I'm not&nbsp;<em>just</em>&nbsp;reviewing the core system, and I think this box itself is pretty damn great! With a nice and slow intro into the game, and good components, this Starter Set could help a lot of players get past the learning curve.</p>

<p>If you love comic book action, and the Marvel comic book world, this is a great entry point - but be warned, this isn't going to be the Kapow! kind of action you might expect from a Marvel RPG.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bohemia Interactive has announced&nbsp;<em>Badlands</em>, the third major expansion for zombie survival sandbox&nbsp;<em>DayZ</em>, and it's bringing the game's biggest map ever and more next year.</p>

<p>As you might have guessed from the name,&nbsp;<em>Badlands</em>, which is due out next year,&nbsp;will take place in a desert environment, namely the province of Nasdara, described by Bohemia as "a war-scarred desert region where thirst is lethal".</p>

<p>Nasdara offers the biggest map in&nbsp;<em>DayZ&nbsp;</em>history, according to the developers; it'll provide you with a staggering 267 kilometers squared to explore, which works out at roughly 103 square miles. That's a lot of wandering.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dayz-badlands-2026-vista.jpg?itok=ICG8zKWO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dayz-badlands-2026-vista.jpg?itok=4SR6VN19 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Badlands</em>, the third major&nbsp;<em>DayZ&nbsp;</em>expansion, is due out next year.</figcaption></figure><p>Bohemia Interactive is promising the chance to "endure droughts, manage hydration, and survive a harsh arid spring climate" as you explore Nasdara, which, the developer says, will tell "a story of failed invasions, abandoned cities, and the silence that followed decades of war".</p>

<p>Not only will you find "dense towns, abandoned ruins, oil fields, and infrastructure left behind by war", but you'll also get the chance to encounter specific infected variants unique to Nasdara. You'll also find loot "tailored to the region".</p>

<p>Of course, the new region also offers the opportunity for some more of&nbsp;<em>DayZ</em>'s classic player-driven storytelling, so there will be plenty of stalking through silent towns only to get suddenly sniped by someone a hundred meters away. Joy of joys.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>DayZ Badlands&nbsp;</em>right here. It doesn't give too much away about what you can expect from the expansion, but it will give you a sense of what the vibe will be.</p>




<p>Last year saw developer Bohemia <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bohemia-interactive-revenue-up-2024" rel="nofollow">enjoy an "extremely successful" twelve months</a>, driven by the success of&nbsp;<em>Arma Reforger</em>&nbsp;and other titles (including&nbsp;<em>DayZ</em>, no doubt).</p>

<p>Alongside the long-awaited&nbsp;<em>Arma 4</em>,&nbsp;Bohemia is also currently hard at work on&nbsp;<em>KSA</em>, a so-called "<em>Kerbal Space Program&nbsp;</em>killer" that should help to fill the (quite literal) void left by Take-Two's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-denies-roll7-intercept-closure" rel="nofollow">supposed dastardly machinations</a>.</p>

<p><em>DayZ Badlands&nbsp;</em>launches across PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One (and current-gen machines thanks to backwards compatibility) next year. We don't have a more specific release date for it than that yet, unfortunately.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/riot-games-responsibly-opens-esports-betting-sponsorships.1230057/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Riot Games has announced it will open up "betting sponsorship opportunities" for Tier 1&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>and<em>&nbsp;Valorant&nbsp;</em>teams in the Americas and EMEA regions, but the studio says it's implemented "safeguards to protect competitive integrity and the fan experience".</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/esports-betting-sponsorships" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the official Riot website, the studio's esports head John Needham says that since sports betting "already exists" around Riot's games and "will continue whether we engage with it or not", the studio made the choice to open up sports betting sponsorships "to create more revenue opportunities for teams".</p>

<p>Needham says that although he knows "some fans have strong feelings" about sports betting, it's "a space that more fans choose to engage with every year", and so it's better for Riot to "engage in allowing betting sponsorships" with appropriate protections "than to sit on the sidelines while risks to fans and integrity go unchecked".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/valorant-riot-games-esports-betting.jpg?itok=QSukDiW2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/valorant-riot-games-esports-betting.jpg?itok=FBACfTyV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Riot is opening up esports betting sponsorships for some&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>and<em>&nbsp;Valorant&nbsp;</em>esports teams.</figcaption></figure><p>In practical terms, this means that esports teams in the&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;Valorant&nbsp;</i>spaces will be allowed to seek sponsorships from sports betting companies, many of whom already take bets on esports.</p>

<p>Riot says it's taking a "guardrails first" approach to this decision. The studio promises to "vet and approve all potential sports betting partners", as well as to require teams to create and enforce an Internal Integrity Program to ensure competitive integrity.</p>

<p>Additionally, although Tier 2 teams can't seek esports betting sponsorships, Riot says it'll invest some of the revenues from its new sports betting program into Tier 2. This will involve boosting prize pools, more training, and "additional integrity system developments".</p>

<p>What's more, if you're watching Tier 1 Riot esports, the studio says all of its broadcast and social channels "will stay betting-free", so you won't see sports betting ads or logos on team apparel. You may, however, see this stuff on official non-Riot team channels.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/league-of-legends-riot-games-esports-betting.jpg?itok=4krBl_nl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/league-of-legends-riot-games-esports-betting.jpg?itok=2ps_kInn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Riot has promised you won't see esports betting content during official Riot-owned broadcasts.</figcaption></figure><p>There's some truth to Riot's statement that this kind of thing will go on anyway, regardless of whether the company gets involved or not. According to Statista (via <a href="https://esportsinsider.com/esports-betting-statistics-2025" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Esports Insider</a>), the esports betting industry brought in $2.5 billion in revenue in 2024 alone, and that number is only set to grow.</p>

<p>However, according to the <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/gambling" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">World Health Organization</a>, around 5.5% of women and about 12% of men around the world "experience some level of harm from gambling", with one Swedish study suggesting that those suffering from gambling disorders were "15 times more likely to due by suicide than the general population".</p>

<p>With stats like that floating around, it's no wonder some are squeamish when it comes to esports betting sponsorships; after all, betting on video game events is still betting, and it comes with all of the usual associated risks and harms that betting does.</p>

<p>Still, it looks like Riot is determined to press on with this decision, so expect to start seeing more and more esports betting sites on the jerseys of&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Valorant&nbsp;</em>esports teams (as long as you're not viewing through Riot, of course).</p>
