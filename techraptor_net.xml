            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-financials-layoffs-possible<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has released its latest financial summary, which covers the 2024-25 fiscal year, and it's safe to say that things aren't exactly looking up for the studio right now.</p>

<p>In its presentation, Ubisoft reveals that both sales and profit are down compared to last year. The period in question technically also covers the launch of recent flagship game&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>, so although the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-circana-march-2025-sales" rel="nofollow">sales performance was strong</a>, it wasn't enough to save the studio from a tough year.</p>

<p>In an accompanying <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/75aGUbWM9kwnQj44Tr7d6H/ce4ca047ddadf45cf1e98cea8d1d7a78/Ubisoft_FY25_PR_English_vfinal.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a>, Ubisoft says it will refocus its efforts towards "more evergreen offering(s)" as part of a "product roadmap optimization", presumably meaning we can expect to see fewer one-off titles and more live-service-adjacent games from the company.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-financials-2024-25.jpg?itok=suJOpzQH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-financials-2024-25.jpg?itok=DpKAnvcB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>did well, but not well enough to save Ubisoft from a grim year.</figcaption></figure><p>Additionally, Ubisoft says it will continue its ongoing cost reduction program, as part of which the company hopes to slash "at least&nbsp;€200m" from its costs by the next financial year.</p>

<p>The studio says it's already achieved a reduction of "around&nbsp;€205 million" as of March 31st, but that a further&nbsp;€100m will need to be cut over the next two years, which means that we could see a repeat of the sweeping cuts that saw three Ubisoft <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing" rel="nofollow">studios</a> close their <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-layoffs-leamington-closure" rel="nofollow">doors</a> in the last six months or so.</p>

<p>Company CEO Yves Guillemot says the plan is to build "evergreen, billion-euro-brand ecosystems" based on Ubisoft's three most successful franchises:&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed</em>,&nbsp;<em>Rainbow Six</em>, and<i>&nbsp;Far Cry</i>.</p>

<p>That's the rationale behind the creation of a brand new corporate entity for the company's core IP, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft--report-new-gaming-entity-core-ip" rel="nofollow">first mooted back in March</a> before being made official later in the year.</p>

<p>He doesn't name those productions, but upcoming titles include mobile game&nbsp;<em>The Division Resurgence&nbsp;</em>and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sands-of-time-remake-another-studio" rel="nofollow">long-awaited&nbsp;<em>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake</em></a>, so it's entirely possible that both of these productions will be delayed even further.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Persona 5: The Phantom X Release Date Seemingly Leaked Ahead of Reveal]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-5-phantom-x-release-date-leaked<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Update: Atlus has now <a href="https://x.com/P5XOfficialWest/status/1923019286508880119" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">officially confirmed</a> that&nbsp;<em>Persona 5: The Phantom X&nbsp;</em>is launching on June 26th in the West. Original story follows below.</p>

<p>Original story: The release date for upcoming mobile RPG&nbsp;<em>Persona 5: The Phantom X&nbsp;</em>appears to have been leaked ahead of an official reveal later today hat's likely to contain said information.</p>

<p>As spotted by&nbsp;<em>Persona&nbsp;</em>fan site&nbsp;<a href="https://personacentral.com/p5x-english-release-date/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Persona Central</a>, the game, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-5-phantom-x-western-release-atlus-tease" rel="nofollow">teased for a Western release earlier this week</a>, now has live listings across the Play Store, the App Store, and Steam. Apple's App Store is the one to give the game away, listing an expected release date of June 26th.</p>

<p>Of course, since neither the Steam page nor the Play Store listing have the same date, Apple's date could be a placeholder, but that seems unlikely given how oddly specific said date would be if it was just for demonstration purposes.</p>

You'll play as a new original character who's "thrust into a changed world drained of hope" following a "nightmare".</p>

<p>Before long, he meets an "eloquent owl named Lefaye" and "a long-nosed man" alongside a "beauty donned in blue", which presumably refers to Igor and his new assistant character. Evidently, twin youngsters Caroline and Justine will not be returning for&nbsp;<em>The Phantom X</em>.</p>

<p>Like the original&nbsp;<em>Persona 5</em>, you'll be switching between the Metaverse and the real world, exploring dungeons and balancing your adventuring life with socializing and building relationships.</p>

<p>Combat will follow the original&nbsp;<em>Persona 5</em>&nbsp;rather than either of its spinoffs; it'll be a strictly turn-based affair, so don't expect to be doing any <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/persona-5-strikers" rel="nofollow">real-time hack-and-slash-style fighting</a> or grid-based tactical strategizing here.</p>
