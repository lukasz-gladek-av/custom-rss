            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A movie adaptation of Bloober Team's psychological horror game&nbsp;<em>The Medium&nbsp;</em>is in the works, with production duties being handled by&nbsp;<em>Annabelle&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;It</i>&nbsp;writer Gary Dauberman through his Coin Operated banner.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/gary-dauberman-spooky-video-game-the-medium-exclusive-1236333819/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Hollywood Reporter</a>, Dauberman has secured the rights to the IP, but the movie has yet to find a writer or a director. Naturally, that also means casting hasn't started yet; it's likely to be a while before we know who's playing Marianne (assuming she's the lead) or who else will be joining her.</p>

<p>In a statement, Dauberman says&nbsp;<em>The Medium</em>'s "compelling story and incredibly cinematic visuals" make it a "natural" fit for a movie adaptation. Bloober CEO Piotr Babieno, meanwhile, says he has a "deep sense" that Dauberman is the "perfect partner" for his studio.</p>

That show is a co-production with Polish studio Platige Image, whereas the movie doesn't seem to involve that outfit at all.</p>

<p>In his statement, Dauberman says he has "no doubt anything Bloober develops is going to push horror forward in unique and terrifying ways", and it seems like he's not the only one who believes that.</p>

<p>Not only did Konami choose Bloober Team to develop its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">successful</a>&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake, but the company has also teamed up with the Polish studio again for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/konami-bloober-team-new-silent-hill" rel="nofollow">a remake of the first&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill</em></a>, which is currently slated for release...well, sometime in the future, I expect.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Xbox Revenue Up Following Thousands of Microsoft Layoffs]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-revenue-up-following-thousands-of-microsoft-layoffs.1257954/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft has released its fiscal information for the final quarter of 2025, as well as for the year as a whole, and despite thousands of layoffs earlier this month, the company's revenue continues to climb.</p>

<p>Per its Q4 <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/fy-2025-q4/press-release-webcast" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">earnings release</a>, Microsoft's revenue grew by 15% for the year overall, and its quarterly revenue jumped by 18% when compared to last year's Q4 earnings. There's pretty much no area in which Microsoft's finances aren't growing.</p>

<p>When it comes to Xbox, Microsoft's gaming wing is doing just fine as well. The Xbox division saw its "content and services revenue" increase by 13% compared to last year's fourth quarter, and, as noted by TweakTown's <a href="https://x.com/DeekeTweak/status/1950666422742393018" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Derek Strickland</a>, Xbox earned a record-breaking $23.45 billion in revenue this fiscal year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-revenue-up-indiana-jones.jpg?itok=d1b5dt1b 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-revenue-up-indiana-jones.jpg?itok=-BMrdYBO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Xbox's revenue was no doubt bolstered by releases like&nbsp;<em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle&nbsp;</em>this fiscal year.</figcaption></figure><p>In an accompanying earnings call, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says that Xbox now has "500 million monthly active users across platforms and devices", and that it is the "top publisher on both Xbox and PlayStation this quarter", although one would hope Xbox is the top publisher on its own hardware, honestly.</p>

<p>Nadella says that revenue from Game Pass reached "nearly $5 billion for the first time", which feels like another slightly strange way to phrase the achievement; "nearly" reaching a figure for the first time doesn't quite feel like the win Nadella seems to think it is.</p>

<p>Still, these figures will be very encouraging for Microsoft, although they won't be anywhere near as encouraging for the nearly-9,000 employees (there's that word again!) who lost their jobs as part of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" rel="nofollow">massive layoff wave</a> earlier this month.</p>

<p>That layoff wave also saw Xbox subsidiaries like Rare and The Initiative affected; the former's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow"><em>Everwild&nbsp;</em>was canceled</a>, while the latter's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow"><em>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</em>reboot was shuttered</a>, along with the studio as a whole.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/perfect-dark-xbox-the-initiative-revenue.jpg?itok=DvXsbqdn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/perfect-dark-xbox-the-initiative-revenue.jpg?itok=hd0mdPlZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Xbox canceled at least two projects earlier this year and shuttered one of its subsidiary studios.</figcaption></figure><p>Between those layoffs and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-3-percent-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">several</a> earlier <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-layoffs-january-2025" rel="nofollow">rounds</a> of job cuts, it feels particularly galling that Nadella <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-ceo-payrise-layoffs" rel="nofollow">took home an eye-watering payrise</a> back in October, but that's just the hyper-corporate world we live in, I suppose.</p>

<p>Whether or not Microsoft and Xbox continuing to do these kinds of numbers will affect their approach to keeping staff on in the future is unclear, but I suspect the answer is no. Stay tuned for more.</p>
