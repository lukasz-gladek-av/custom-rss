            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/payday-pubg-crossover-starbreeze-krafton<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Starbreeze and Krafton have announced a&nbsp;<em>PUBG Payday&nbsp;</em>crossover, with the latter set to infiltrate the world of the former through what sounds like a new gameplay experience within&nbsp;<em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em>.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://corporate.starbreeze.com/en/press/press-releases/starbreeze-partners-with-krafton-to-expand-payday-into-pubg-battlegrounds/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official announcement on Starbreeze's website</a>, the studio says the crossover is about increasing "the visibility and reach of the&nbsp;<em>Payday&nbsp;</em>franchise", which Starbreeze aims to do by "bringing the heisting experience to a broader audience through&nbsp;<em>PUBG</em>".</p>

<p>It's a goal that Starbreeze rather desperately needs to chase right now, since&nbsp;<em>Payday 3</em>'s in a bit of a tight spot. Recently, <em>Payday 3</em> saw <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/payday-3-game-director-steps-down" rel="nofollow">its director step down</a> in the run-up to its first anniversary, and the game's poor performance also led to Starbreeze's CEO <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-studios-ceo-steps-down" rel="nofollow">quitting back in March</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pubg-payday-crossover-zipline.jpg?itok=n-GvAGi8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pubg-payday-crossover-zipline.jpg?itok=qXEtFWam 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Payday 3&nbsp;</em>is making its way to the explosive, high-octane world of&nbsp;<em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>According to the aforementioned announcement, the collaboration will involve "about a quarter of Starbreeze's development organization during a year" under what Starbreeze calls a "work-for-hire agreement".</p>

<p>It sounds, then, like Starbreeze will be creating the&nbsp;<em>Payday&nbsp;</em>content that will make its way into&nbsp;<em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em>. The two studios say they're "currently collaborating on the project's integration roadmap", and we'll get more updates later down the line.</p>

<p>It's been a rocky road for&nbsp;<em>Payday 3</em>, with Starbreeze admitting back in February that the game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-payday-3-performance" rel="nofollow">performing at "significantly lower levels"</a> than it wanted.</p>

<p>Perhaps more embarrassingly for Starbreeze,&nbsp;<em>Payday 2&nbsp;</em>is currently leagues ahead of&nbsp;<em>Payday 3&nbsp;</em>in the Steam player count stakes; at last count,&nbsp;<em>Payday 3</em>'s 24-hour player peak <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1272080/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">was 860</a>, while&nbsp;<em>Payday 2</em>'s stood at a <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/218620/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">far more respectable 38,324</a>.</p>

The game's 24-hour Steam player peak is <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/578080/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a princely 756,872</a>, which probably goes some way towards explaining why Starbreeze wants to integrate&nbsp;<em>Payday&nbsp;</em>into the battle royale hit.</p>

<p>With regards to the two studios' future plans, Krafton is currently working on a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-mobile-version-krafton" rel="nofollow">mobile version of survival hit&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em></a>, and it's also overseeing <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hi-fi-rush-2-krafton-ceo" rel="nofollow">a sequel</a> to&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>, the IP for which (along with developer Tango Gameworks) it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-acquires-tango-gameworks-and-hi-fi-rush-ip-with-plans-for-future-expansion" rel="nofollow">bought earlier this year</a>.</p>

<p>Starbreeze, meanwhile, is engaged in a multi-stage plan to try and improve&nbsp;<em>Payday 3</em>'s fortunes, and the studio is also working on a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-dnd-game-2026" rel="nofollow">multiplayer game using the&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;</em>IP</a>.</p>
