While he wasn't a core part of <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bccf8de0-f24d-4021-9f80-f175dae84092" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/dying-light-2-stay-human-review" rel="nofollow">Dying Light 2</a>'s</em> story, only being mentioned by name, he's back again in <em>Dying Light: The Beast </em>a smaller adventure set after the events of <em>Dying Light 2 </em>that pick up with Crane looking to find and get revenge on the Baron for what he got put through.</p>

<h2>Catching Up With Kyle Crane</h2>

<p>Since we last saw Kyle Crane, more has been understood about how he's simultaneously infected but also able to retain his humanity. He spent time offscreen trapped by The Baron, and now that he has been able to get out, he's wanting revenge. While we don't know much about what The Baron put Crane through, we know that he was experimenting on him for thirteen years.</p>

<p>At Summer Game Fest, I got to sit down and get my hands on an hour of <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em>. This gameplay demo gave me a chance to explore the open world, make a safe house, hide from volatiles in the dark, take on an armed militia, and lastly take on a massive Chimera creature.</p>

<p>Sitting down with Aaron Telty, QA Analyst at Techland, I loaded into the world. Immediately, I was hit with just how gorgeous <em>Dying Light: The Beast </em>looks. Starting in a courtyard of derelict buildings with an afternoon sun shining warm orange light across the world… I was immediately beset by zombies.</p>

<p>After getting familiar with the controls, I headed out into the world. Much like previous <em>Dying Light </em>titles the world of <em>Dying Light: The Beast </em>is a parkour playground. I was hopping from light post to dangling rope, through a building (doing a bit of looting along the way), and launching off zombies to attain higher ground.</p>

<p>Starting with just a crowbar, it wasn't too long (with the assistance of a guiding QA hand) that I stumbled upon an Axe lodged into a poor human in the back of a truck. Swapping between weapons was an easy process and there was clear indications as to just how powerful everything was in comparison.</p>

<p>An interesting gameplay mechanic I learned early, when I horribly misjudged a jump and ended up staring at a game over screen, was that in <em>Dying Light: The Beast </em>when you die you'll lost a portion of your gained experience for the level. While not a lot it's an interesting balance between stat progression, risking your time outside (especially at night), and wanting to progress in levels.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Improvements To <em>Dying Light 2 </em>That Have Carried Over<br>
An interesting aspect that kept coming up while playing <em>The Beast </em>was that since I last played <em>Dying Light 2 </em>at time of review and release there are a lot of systems including weapon, gore, and movement mechancs that have been improved over time that I didn't experience in 2, that I now could as part of The Beast.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I continued my path to a safe house the sun began to set on the world. With that Volatiles, incredibly dangerous zombies began appearing. With a quick scan of the environment Crane is able to directly spot them, glowing with red skeletons in the night.</p>

Crouching down and switching off my flashlight I quietly navigated through tall grass to reach the safe house. It was reinforced that the stage of the game I was playing it was definitely more important to remain stealthed but that later on in the game, after leveling up and unlocking additional abilities you'd be able to hold your own much better in the night sections.</p>

<h2>Playing Your Way</h2>

<p>A key theme of <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> was how it's up to the player to decide how they want to approach each new obstacle in the game. I got to see this a number of times. Initially, it was in securing the safe house. Descending into the basement to return power to the small apartment I snuck through a room of unconscious zombies. There were at least a dozen in this small room.</p>

<p>Creeping around I was able to obtain a fuse and power up the generator, waking the zombies in the process. Knowing I had limited durability on my weapons, and I wasn't likely going to get much out of killing the zombies in this room I simply left, jumping back into the vent I had entered the room in.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dying-light-the-beast-sgf-2025-parkour.jpg?itok=28Ba4wjl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dying-light-the-beast-sgf-2025-parkour.jpg?itok=5-WTLU3I 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This kind of difference in approach came up again shortly after, reaching a facility that was being guarded by a small militia. Ascending to the roof it was recommended that I approach this with stealth where I can… unfortunately I was already charging forward and had prepared to dropkick the nearest guard clean off the roof.</p>

<p>With a variety of quiet and loud combat options, stealth sections, and even open world driving I was impressed with just how quickly you might have one plan, that immediately becomes something else.</p>

<h2>Unleash The Beast</h2>

<p>A unique gameplay aspect of <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> is in Kyle Crane's infected genetics. As you deal and take melee damage you'll be slowly increasing a rage meter in the lower left of your screen.</p>

<p>Once that meter has reached it's peak you can click in with both thumbsticks to tap into a more menacing kind of combat. Putting away his weapons Crane bares his fists to grab, smack, punch, and even tear off zombies limbs as he goes fully feral.</p>

<p>While in this mode I also seemed to notice that Crane ran faster, possible a good ability to have in your back pocket in case a situation is about to go sideways.</p>

<h2>Investigate The World As Kyle Crane</h2>

<p>Another neat aspect of the demo experience (after I dropkicked way too many guards off roofs) was entering a facility where I needed to do some sleuthing. Standing next to a cage that something had broken out of, interesting machinery, and suspicious piping Crane was able to analyse each to get an idea of what creature had been contained, a Chimera, and what he could do to lure it back and kill it.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dying-light-the-beast-sgf-2025-interior.jpg?itok=EzUV1AxK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dying-light-the-beast-sgf-2025-interior.jpg?itok=5Bi85aCg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Entering another zombie infested area and obtaining a flamethrower I then got gas to attract the Chimera and engaged in a massive battle. This creature, at least 12 feet tall even with a hunched over stance, was a beast that while humanoid in shape had clearly been stretched to the limits of it's form.</p>

<p>The Chimera, with exposed muscle tendons glistening in the light crashed through a car yard. This boss battle was hard, and not just in the way that I was rusty with the controls, but that where Crane was in the story just two attacks connecting from this creature would put me in the dust.</p>

<p>Through (alot) of trial and error I was able to coordinate dodging shockwave attacks, rocks getting hurled at me, and sliding out of the way of a charging attack defeating him. For Crane upgrades to movement and attacks are through natural experience and progressions, but it's only in defeating the Chimera and possibly other advanced infected that Crane is able to level up his infected abilities.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dying-light-the-beast-sgf-2025-chimera.jpg?itok=3kS_tuqv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dying-light-the-beast-sgf-2025-chimera.jpg?itok=WTpYsPXQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>A More Linear Experience</h2>

<p>Unlike <em>Dying Light </em>and <em>Dying Light 2</em> the experience for The Beast is more linear. This is in essence part of how the game came about, initially as DLC for Dying Light 2 before getting spun off. It's total runtime will also be shorter, but will still likely be around the 20 hours space.</p>

<p>If you're a fan of <em>Dying Light </em>there's really no reason to not be looking forward to <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em>. It's not only an evolution on the basic formula but with a more linear approach to the narrative there is a lot more chance to really get invested in the world and it's characters.</p>

<p><em>Dying Light: The Beast </em>releases this year on August 22nd</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/chromagun-2-dye-hard-is-more-of-same-but-zanier-stil<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>ChromaGun 2: Dye Hard</em> is the latest of the <em>ChromaGun </em>color puzzle games from PM Studios. After the initial title's success, the ChromaGun is back once again to test players with their memory of basic color matching.</p>

<p>I got a chance to sit down and play 30 minutes of <em>ChromaGun </em>at Summer Game Fest. The demo opened with the standard fair for anyone familiar with these kinds of portal-like titles. In a testing facility you’ll be enticed to pick up the <em>ChromaGun</em>, getting just a single color at first your aim.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/chromagun-2_-dye-hard-color-matching.jpg?itok=bV6Ejzv4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/chromagun-2_-dye-hard-color-matching.jpg?itok=xjZLSO9I 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Your aim is to progress through a series of puzzle rooms that get more and more challenging as you go. The main way you progress is by successfully moving floating spheres around rooms. The way that you move them is by creating wall and ceiling panels of the same color.</p>

<p>A yellow sphere will be attracted to a yellow wall tile. This works when the switch you need the sphere to be on is located right under a tile. If the switch is between wall tiles then you may need to daisy chain it between two, in that case the sphere will move to an equidistant location between the two tiles.</p>

<h2>How Do You Make Purple Again?</h2>

<p>Adding further complication, different wall tiles and spheres will not just come in the primary colors – yellow, blue, and red – but also in Secondary colors. Forcing you to have to remember something basic like if you want your Blue Sphere to head towards the Purple wall tile then you’ll have to shoot your Sphere with the color Red.</p>

While there was no strict tutorial,&nbsp;<em>ChromaGun 2</em> did a good job to slowly layer mechanics.</p>

<p>A core theme within <em>ChromaGun 2</em>, something I learned as I leapt from a ledge straight into a portal was that ChromaGun’s ‘worlds’ are all based on alternate realities where you might trade out the sterile white walls and right angles, for curved structures, a visual filter that makes it look like you’re playing the game as a classic comic book, and the last ‘world’ I entered before I finished my time was a barnyard settings.</p>

<h2>Weird Worlds</h2>

<p>Each zone has a unique style that makes it easy to check where you are at any point, but didn’t vary too much in terms of gameplay. Regardless, it was an interesting reskin of what you’d expect to see in a game about completing tests.</p>

<p>Each zone additionally has a different robotic/AI voice as your tested who is confused upon your arrival, but interacts with you with a different personality.</p>

<p>If you’re a fan of the original ChromaGun title, or you’re into the idea of a puzzle game that leans heavily into color shifting and matching then this will likely be a title that you’ll want to keep an eye on. There’s a lot of times where you see a game attempt to totally reinvent itself between iterations, but if you’re good at what you do is that totally necessary?</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/directive-8020-enhances-gameplay-putting-stealth-and-scares-in-players-hands</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/directive-8020-enhances-gameplay-putting-the-stealth-and-scares-in-players-hands.1213629/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/directive-8020-enhances-gameplay-putting-stealth-and-scares-in-players-hands<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've been a massive fan of Supermassive games since <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="8b369c29-3d2f-4f8f-ae11-ac3c77f5e39e" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/until-dawn-2024-review-new-faces-old-blood" rel="nofollow"><em>Until Dawn</em></a> and with every new title iterating on gameplay, scares, and ways to experience the horror with my friends, I was very excited to sit down and get my hands on a small portion of <em>Directive 8020</em> and talk with Executive Producer Dan McDonald.</p>

<p>My gameplay demo began with a tense but hopeful conversation between a new astronaut Young talking with her mission direction Stafford. During the conversation there are hints about the declining state of the world, how Young's father died four years prior, and that they would be ready to head to the stars once again to visit a planet that could inhabit life.</p>

<p>McDonald explained to me that this mission is one to visit and gather information about this new planet and how it might be habitable. The plan is to just fly by, but one thing leads to another and the crew needed to land.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/directive-8020-overgrowth.jpg?itok=0XygnpiC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/directive-8020-overgrowth.jpg?itok=CdMIy7TV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>After watching the cutscene, a discussion that McDonald said would continue to be flashed back to over the course of the story, the gameplay demo leapt ahead to Chapter 6 of the 8 Chapter story.</p>

<h2>Friends Or Enemies You Can't Trust</h2>

<p>Two Astronauts, Sermon and Stafford, were in the hydroponics lab aboard the spaceship. Canisters were broken and a strange organism was growing over them. From the darkness a humanoid figure steps forward, a perfect clone of one of the Astronauts until his face ripples unsettlingly.</p>

<p>Attacked by not just one, but two clones (one of which shapeshifts into a horrific alien creature), I was in control. Playing as Sermon, I was skulking around the service tunnels underneeth the main hydroponics area. The giant hunter seeking me out, I was able to try to crouch walking by it to make my escape.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/directive-8020-turning-point-choice.jpg?itok=Yee7Fz8D 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/directive-8020-turning-point-choice.jpg?itok=VF41BBmD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Failing that I was thrown into a QTE, quickly mashing the X button I was able to turn my stun baton on the creature and get away while it writhed in pain. The Stun Baton was a multi-use weapon with a brief recharge (luckily, it charged again in time before I needed it once more).</p>

<p>In these tunnels, there were also other options to distract or make my way past the creature. Running was an option, but McDonald also showed me that there were a variety of interactable objects that could take the Hunter's attention as well as a radar system that allows the player to briefly see the creature through walls.</p>

<p>Shortly after escaping, the two astronauts returned to the rest of the crew with a new fear that one of the party members was not what they seemed.</p>

<p>While the horror of other Dark Pictures games from Supermassive have been about a very recognizable foe, the thought of an enemy that could be one of the players (even one being played by a character) is a fantastic approach to horror. As well as being inspired by <em>The Thing</em> McDonald highlighted other sources such as <em>Event Horizon, Alien</em>, and specifically called out the purples and greens to add that eerie <em>Color Out Of Space</em> vibe to the game.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/directive-8020-attacked-human.jpg?itok=hxF3x39z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/directive-8020-attacked-human.jpg?itok=xTUXMC1m 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>While I didn't see too much, what I did see spoke wonders about the game. After getting to play through the game and understand more of the tense nature of the plot I got to talk with McDonald more about gameplay elements, multiplayer, and how the shift away from only walking and reactions to active stealth and combat will remain accessible to all skill levels.</p>

<h2>An Overall Upgrade</h2>

<p>In terms of gameplay all of the movement has been overhauled to align with a more traditional 3rd person horror title. McDonald highlighted the experiences working on <em>Devil In Me</em>, specifically the clamber mechanic, with how they could continue to reshape their movement.</p>

<p>It's not just movement related to stealth that's been improved either as changes have also been made to allow for more puzzle systems to be used in the game.</p>

<p>Highlighting a few of the choices that were made over the course of gameplay McDonald pulled up a detailed path showing where events you encounter are intended, and where they can split. He explained that with every choice you make you can then easily revert back to the choice right before.</p>

<p>They wanted to make sure that anyone playing the game could play it in a linear fashion, or they could go back through and retry choices over and over again to get the whole scope of the game without needing to replay it from scratch.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/directive-8020-05.jpg?itok=HNamyInN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/directive-8020-05.jpg?itok=2bwgkU8c 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Another important change was that instead of building the game for a three act structure, like a movie, instead each chapter followed the structure of a TV show episode. Understanding that as their games were becoming larger and more involved, it would be harder for players to complete them in a single sitting. By swapping to an episodic structure there are more places for players to conclude a single session, but be excited to pick up when the story continues.</p>

<h2>Accessible To Everyone, No Matter Your Skill Level</h2>

<p>The last important piece of information that I got about <em>Directive 8020</em> was that Movie Night mode is not only returning but has been improved. Movie Night, a mode where each character in the story can be assigned to a different player in your party, now functions not only with local play but over the internet, creating a fun group experience.</p>

<p>Additionally, while the game was becoming more mechanically complex in Movie Night mode you can adjust the difficulty and accessibility per player. This means someone who is familiar with video games and the Dark Pictures games can have normal QTE timing and stealth modes, while the senses of the Hunter can be turned down for a player less familiar with the controls.</p>

<p>As a game series that I love to play with friends of all different skill levels I was so happy to hear that a custom experience could be created to allow for everyone to have just as fun a time.</p>

<p><em>Directive 8020</em> is certainly one of the most anticipated releases for me coming out to Summer Game Fest and with the developments to the gameplay, and the understanding of the audience and wanting to include as many players as possible the team at Supermassive have really demonstrated an understanding for fans of their games.</p>
