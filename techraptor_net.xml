            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/white-knuckle-early-access-preview-falling-from-cloud-9<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If there’s one thing that defines the roguelite genre, it’s ascension. Climbing a peak until something – and almost always something unexpected – knocks you back down to the bottom of the mountain. It’s never going to be a breeze, but it’s worth it to know that the wind at the top is going to feel so much better. <em>White Knuckle</em> takes this sentiment to a literal extreme and then some.</p>

<p>This is the debut title from Dark Machine Games, a first-person roguelite parkour platformer, and published by DreadXP, who have been on a tear in the indie horror scene for quite a while now. From the jumpscare jamboree of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/mortuary-assistant" rel="nofollow"><em>The Mortuary Assistant</em></a> to the downright inspiring <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/dread-delusion-preview" rel="nofollow"><em>Dread Delusion</em></a>, if there’s a forefront, DreadXP are standing there with arms wide open. As it stands, sprints, and springs, <em>White Knuckle</em> is a definitive example of that.</p>

<p>You play as a disembodied pair of hands, stranded at the bottom of a brutalist spire. An autonomous female voice occasionally spouts warnings and staff updates from the intercom, but beneath her announcements, and your own feet, something is bubbling below you and rising up. You’re tasked with climbing this seemingly endless tower to freedom, before you fall victim to the horrors of this facility’s work.</p>



<p>Even in this primitive state of “Early Access”, what’s fascinating to me about <em>White Knuckle</em> is how emboldened it is with crafting an identity for itself. It doesn’t take long for the core, or rather, cores, to open up layer by layer as time goes by, which is admirable, if a little bit foolishly noble for something so eager to make a statement.</p>

<p>It starts off as a goofy precision platformer in first person, like if <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/human-fall-flat-review-drunk-puzzling" rel="nofollow"><em>Human Fall Flat</em></a> was in VR, where you control your jerky hands and elastic physical movement with the mouse buttons. How big your hitbox is exactly isn’t known, but that seems to add to the general fun of figuring out how you can cheese the climbing system.</p>

<p>One of <em>White Knuckle</em>’s sneaky assets is the inventory system, which is populated over time with pitons you can hammer into the wall to create new routes, weapons, and temporary health buffs. There is a limit to how much you can carry, but for better or worse, the game is reluctant to portray this information, or indeed, any information necessary to retain. With how stripped-down the game is, GUI-wise, it’s exceptionally difficult to figure out what your buffs are doing, even when they’re unlocked for further use.</p>



<p>Then there’s the aesthetic itself, remarkably cold concrete that only becomes colder as it’s smothered in brutalist architecture and PSX-style dithering. It’s not exactly retro, it’s more that it’s lending itself to how direct and suffocating this Soviet-era construction could be, alongside the generic announcements that pertain to employee retention and on-site alerts of failing power units. However, it won’t be long before the voice gives you a fairly direct warning: “It is below you”.</p>

<p>Now the horror kicks into gear, and indeed, the mass underneath you slowly rising up, sludge spitting out to stick to your boots is a threat, and you’re on a timer. You can’t sit there and strategize, this thing is constantly climbing, the same as you, and you’ve gotta pray that you can close the door behind you. You can take minor breaks in interludes that serve as vending machines for equipment, enhancements and extra lives, and this is where the roguelite elements come into play.</p>

<p>Despite this four-piece matinee of mechanics and design trying their best to work in tandem with each other, something still isn’t right. There’s another piece to the puzzle that was exceptionally difficult to ascertain as I threw myself through the monkey bars and motions that <em>White Knuckle</em> presents. It’s not just that the game feels unfocused, but there’s an element in play that’s actively sabotaging the rest of it quite successfully.</p>



<p>Indeed, I kept pushing further, looking for answers when and where I could. In time, I discovered small narrative snippets that present themselves in brief glimpses of the facility’s history and encounters with remnants of individuals designated to the same fate as you. I couldn’t ruminate on them for long, or indeed, at all, because I was on the clock, and there was a good chance I’d lose it if I didn’t make it up in time, which happened a lot, to my rage-fueled chagrin – and that’s when it hit me.</p>

<p>You can point to any number of influences <em>White Knuckle</em> wears as a pinstripe suit, from <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/portal-2-tale-of-two-female-icons" rel="nofollow">Portal</a> </em>to <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/half-life-2" rel="nofollow"><em>Half-Life</em></a> – hell, even <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/infra" rel="nofollow">INFRA</a> </em>– but one thing that shines through more than anything else is its synonymy with rage-bait platformers, your <em>QWOP</em>s and your <em>Getting Over It</em>’s. This, in turn, seeks to dismantle the outrageous amount of promise White Knuckle inhibits, to the point where every other core is actively sabotaged by one another.</p>

<p>The roguelite elements tend to be undermined by how linear the platforming elements have to be, lest you’re softlocked by a lack of resources, which happens more often than you’d think. <em>White Knuckle</em>'s extra lives system works as such: If you die after using one, you’ll spawn back at the computer you used the floppy disk on, BUT, you lose your entire inventory upon death unless you acquire a perk, and if you can’t find a piton or rebar rod before you come across something which requires it, you can only jump against the wall and await death.</p>



<p>The progression system is undermined by the sheer reluctance <em>White Knuckle</em> shows when trying to convey information, largely reducing the player’s power to contextless icons and minor screen flashes. What’s the difference between the effect of a syringe, and the effect of a medicine bottle? Who knows! One flashes red, and the other flashes blue, but you’ll be damned to the goo before the game tells you what it’ll do!</p>

<h2><em>White Knuckle</em> Early Access Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Fear is replaced by frustration, and discovery is replaced by dismissal. In its current state, <em>White Knuckle</em> isn’t a well-oiled machine juggling its various gameplay features, it’s the Olympic logo warped to “OOOOO”. Thankfully, this infancy can be nothing but a learning curve, as despite so much vigor in their chest, and pep in their step, <em>White Knuckle</em> has been summoned in a disillusioned state that doesn't know where to jump to.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/forever-skies-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Most post-apocalyptic games have you building out a base and exploring the world.&nbsp;<em>Forever Skies</em>&nbsp;is part of the growing subset of survival games where your base is a mobile ship that you take with you around the world. In this&nbsp;<em>Forever Skies</em>&nbsp;review, I'll go over my experience traveling above a ruined Earth, warts and all.</p>

<p><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="670cb0ae-b83d-4879-95e2-a5fc28b63dc2" href="https://techraptor.net/games/forever-skies" rel="nofollow"><em>Forever Skies</em></a>&nbsp;takes place on a futuristic Earth that has been overrun by the "Dust", an amalgamation of mutated flora and fauna that has rendered the surface toxic and uninhabitable. This has also caused the birth of new diseases, including the "Grey Plague", a terrible malady that is bringing humanity to the brink of extinction — and now, it's up to you to cure it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/forever-skies-review-building-out-your-airship-in-the-early-game-of-forever-skies.jpg?itok=ZTVpwddb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/forever-skies-review-building-out-your-airship-in-the-early-game-of-forever-skies.jpg?itok=MuhUbXWN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you're anything like me, you'll likely spend a few hours in the early game collecting crafting materials so you can build out your airship.</figcaption></figure><h2>Taking to the Skies</h2>

<p>Your adventure begins after emerging from a drop pod that descended from the <em>Ark</em>, a space station that is home to the handful of humans who have escaped Earth entirely. The Grey Plague is slowly killing them, and you are their only hope to fix it. But first, you'll have to get on your feet.</p>

<p>As with many survival games,&nbsp;<em>Forever Skies</em>&nbsp;starts you off on a tutorial tower where you learn the basics of the game on foot. You'll assemble a basic Airship toward the end of this tutorial zone and take to the skies in search of answers and valuable crafting materials.</p>

<p>Much like&nbsp;<em>Raft</em>, your Airship is both your means of transportation and your base. You'll only have a small airship with one balloon and one engine at the beginning; eventually, you could build it out to a multi-level leviathan with multiple balloons, engines, turbines, and automated turrets that collect debris to fuel your crafting.</p>

<p>You'll be limited to a handful of different types of towers in the early hours of the game. Adding some turbines and unlocking key crafting recipes will let you access taller buildings and open up new areas of the map. Eventually, though, you'll have to descend below the surface.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/forever-skies-review-approaching-a-tower-in-forever-skies.jpg?itok=XvyMGGNw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/forever-skies-review-approaching-a-tower-in-forever-skies.jpg?itok=zmDtR568 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some of the aboveground locations are surprisingly large, and you can easily spend 10–20 minutes exploring and looting these rickety towers.</figcaption></figure><h2>Delving Into the Dust</h2>

<p>The early parts of&nbsp;<em>Forever Skies</em> are all about landing at towers to get the raw materials you need for your airship. Your main concerns will be keeping up your survival stats, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="58f0451d-7399-4cb6-ac14-0b4f1d61a4ea" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/how-to-build-your-ship-in-forever-skies" rel="nofollow">building your airship</a>, and avoiding falling off a tower into the ground below. Eventually, the story will take you to your first underground area in the "Underdust."</p>

<p>The surface of Earth is a very different beast. The air is totally unbreathable, and you'll need to rely on a small oxygen tank to survive, supplemented by oxygen stations throughout the Underdust that you'll have to power up.</p>

<p>Early Underdust areas won't have much in the way of hazards save for the oxygen limit and the occasional harmful flora. Later areas, though, will have you fighting against actual enemies. Combat isn't all that difficult, especially when you're using a ranged weapon.</p>

<p>The Underdust is often home to <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="956df2a5-09b9-4609-96b5-3636826a117f" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/where-to-find-resources-in-forever-skies" rel="nofollow">crafting materials</a>&nbsp;that can't reliably be found elsewhere, such as Crystals, as well as <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ed3c7773-13d3-4637-9df8-7dc7ad9cce99" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/forever-skies-trading-guide-how-to-buy-and-sell-items" rel="nofollow">trading kiosks</a>. Although you only need to visit each of these dangerous locations once, you'll often find yourself returning to them multiple times to fuel <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7e81d8e6-64ca-49e2-8cf2-d6225e3a402f" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/forever-skies-crafting-and-unlocks-guide" rel="nofollow">your crafting</a> and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="58f0451d-7399-4cb6-ac14-0b4f1d61a4ea" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/how-to-build-your-ship-in-forever-skies" rel="nofollow">Airship building</a> — all the more so when you're <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="995f762e-ef6c-4c8d-92de-c850561bfa1d" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/forever-skies-multiplayer" rel="nofollow">playing multiplayer</a>.</p>

<p>The Underdust is indeed filled with mystery, but it presents another problem — these handcrafted story locations often tanked my framerate.</p>

<p>The PC I used to play the 1.0 beta version exceeded the recommended requirements on the Steam page on every metric — I have a much better processor and graphics card, and more than enough RAM. For some reason I don't understand, however, my framerate would randomly drop to 10 FPS or worse in many of these Underdust areas.</p>

<p>A similar phenomenon happened with bad weather. Whenever it rained, my framerate would go right into the gutter. Saving and restarting the game seemed to help, so my gut tells me that there may be a memory leak or some other unresolved optimization issue.</p>

<p>I was not alone, either; I spent some of my time playing in multiplayer with my girlfriend and a good friend. The three of us all met the minimum and recommended requirements, but our framerate would go to hell in the Underdust, and while it was raining.</p>

<p>This wasn't the only performance issue I encountered, mind; at a certain point, adding or removing pieces from your Airship caused the game to freeze for a moment. As with most survival games, it seems that&nbsp;<em>Forever Skies</em>&nbsp;gets a little bit laggy when you start building big.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/forever-skies-review-fighting-a-impious-mantis-in-the-underdust-in-forever-skies.jpg?itok=_8tHK0_v 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/forever-skies-review-fighting-a-impious-mantis-in-the-underdust-in-forever-skies.jpg?itok=y31_n3mV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you're freaked out by bugs, you might want to avoid&nbsp;<em>Forever Skies</em>...</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Forever Skies</em>&nbsp;Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>I'll close out this&nbsp;<em>Forever Skies</em>&nbsp;review with an inevitable comparison: yes,&nbsp;<em>Forever Skies</em>&nbsp;feels a lot like&nbsp;<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="43038c34-13cb-4306-a71a-537928a67c0a" href="https://techraptor.net/games/raft" rel="nofollow"><em>Raft</em></a>. You take your base with you, going from story location to story location and stopping at smaller points of interest along the way to collect <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="956df2a5-09b9-4609-96b5-3636826a117f" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/where-to-find-resources-in-forever-skies" rel="nofollow">crafting materials</a> and decorations for your ship.</p>

<p>If you (and your friends) enjoyed<i>&nbsp;Raft</i>, you'll find a lot to love in&nbsp;<em>Forever Skies</em>. If you've never played a game like this before, the sci-fi setting and light first-person shooter elements may be easier for you to pick up than the coconut technology found in&nbsp;<em>Raft</em>.</p>

<p><em>Forever Skies</em>&nbsp;is a fine game in its own right, and Far From Home may very well deliver some excellent post-launch content. However, all of this great game design and fun exploration is hampered by performance issues that should have been sorted out before launching a 1.0 version; one hopes that the developers will fix these problems sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/EAStarWars/status/1911811628124742117" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Respawn's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/electronic-arts-completes-acquisition-of-respawn-entertainment" rel="nofollow">parent company</a> EA invites players to "engage in turn-based tactical combat" with&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Zero Company</em>&nbsp;and confirms that the game will be revealed in full during the&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>celebration on Saturday, April 19th.</p>

<p>There, a panel will be held involving Bit Reactor, Respawn, and Lucasfilm Games, during which "a world-exclusive first look" at&nbsp;<em>Zero Company&nbsp;</em>will be shared. Not much more information than that is available right now, unfortunately.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xcom-bit-reactor-star-wars-zero-company.jpg?itok=8HORDqWu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xcom-bit-reactor-star-wars-zero-company.jpg?itok=t4F6GdUW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Star Wars Zero Company</em>'s developers previously worked on franchises like&nbsp;<em>XCOM</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>The developer behind&nbsp;<em>Zero Company</em>, Bit Reactor, counts veterans from&nbsp;<em>XCOM&nbsp;</em>and <i>Civilization&nbsp;</i>studio Firaxis Games among its number. Founded back in 2022, the studio was first revealed to be working on a&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>game alongside Respawn <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/three-respawn-star-wars-games-in-works" rel="nofollow">in January that same year</a>.</p>

<p>Since then, it's been a bit of a rocky road for Respawn; one of the studio's&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>games, an FPS being worked on by Respawn exec Peter Hirschmann, was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/electronic-arts-to-lay-off-5-of-its-workforce-amid-refocus-on-owned-ip-and-sports-games" rel="nofollow">canceled back in February last year</a>, which is also when around 5% of EA employees were laid off.</p>

<p>As part of that layoff wave, Respawn employees working on the battle royale hero shooter&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/apex-legends-developer-respawn-hit-by-layoffs-among-cuts-at-electronic-arts" rel="nofollow">were let go</a>, leaving the future of Respawn's tactical&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>game in question.</p>

<p>Happily, it seems that the game was still being worked on all this time, and a full reveal is scheduled for the weekend. If you've been clamoring for something a little different from the&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>property, this might well be it.</p>

<p>Announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shotgun-cop-man-my-friend-pedro-creator" rel="nofollow">in February</a>,&nbsp;<em>Shotgun Cop Man&nbsp;</em>is the next game from DeadToast, whose name you might recognize from the similarly irreverent shooter&nbsp;<em>My Friend Pedro&nbsp;</em>(although this one doesn't feature any talking bananas, to the best of my knowledge).</p>

<p>It's launching on May 1st, also known as May Day in Europe, which feels particularly appropriate given the frantic nature of your mission. The game will be landing on Switch and PC, and while there's no word of a Switch 2 release, I'm not sure this one would benefit from the new machine's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-specs-revealed" rel="nofollow">beefier specs</a> anyway.</p>

As you can probably imagine, he's none too pleased about the intrusion, so you must battle your way through the hordes of the underworld to reach him.</p>

<p>DeadToast says you'll be armed with "a devastating arsenal and a relentless thirst for glory" in the pursuit of said goal; not only will you have access to a range of weapons (including the titular shotgun), but you'll also use them to propel yourself through&nbsp;<em>Shotgun Cop Man</em>'s world.</p>

<p>The game will feature a handcrafted campaign with more than 150 levels to take on, but once you're done with that, you can also try out user-generated levels or perhaps even make your own.</p>

<p>Various challenges are also available if you want to step up your&nbsp;<em>Shotgun Cop Man&nbsp;</em>experience a notch, including No Damage runs, Speedrun parameters, and Kill All stipulations.</p>
