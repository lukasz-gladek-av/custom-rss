            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Official <em>Dungeon Crawler Carl</em> board games are coming next year. Renegade Game Studios will be adapting the popular LitRPG book series into two official tabletop experiences, bringing the science-fantasy series to gaming tables.</p>



<p>In an official <a href="https://renegadegamestudios.com/blog/renegade-game-studios-announces-two-upcoming-dungeon-crawler-carl-tabletop-games/" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>, Renegade Game Studios announced they will be producing two <em>Dungeon Crawler Carl</em> board games. Both of these games will be coming to the crowdfunding platform Backerkit in April 2026.</p>

This is obvious, since the book series heavily leans on the fantasy TTRPG trope of the "dungeon crawl," blown out into a demented, competitive reality show. The announcement does not specify which RPG system it will use, but confirms that navigating the commercialized elements of the dungeon will be a central mechanic.</p>

<p>The second <em>Dungeon Crawler Carl</em> board game will be a co-op deck builder. The game will be based on <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/unstoppable-board-game-roguelike-deck-builder-is-fully-funded-on-kickstarter" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Unstoppable</em></a>, designed by John D. Clair. The game is set in the World Dungeon, where you'll battle against neighborhood, borough, and city bosses, gearing up and leveling up along the way. The game can be played solo or 2-player co-op.</p>

<p>Regardless of which <em>Dungeon Crawler Carl</em> board game catches your eye, illustrations for both will be done by longtime artist&nbsp;<span>Luciano Fleitas, adding a layer of authenticity to these tabletop adaptations.</span></p>

<p><span><em>Dungeon Crawler Carl</em> is a science-fantasy book series written by Matt Dinniman. It involves Carl, a former Coast Guard, and his ex's cat, Princess Donut, being thrown into a subterranean dungeon created by the alien Borant Corporation as part of a Running Man-esque reality show, <em>Dungeon Crawler World</em>. Carl can either compete, or stay on the Earth's surface where modern amenities are gone.</span></p>

<p><span>The series is currently up to seven novels. According to Dinniman, he has plans for up to ten books in the series.</span></p>
