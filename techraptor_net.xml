            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zaum-project-c4-disco-elysium<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>ZA/UM, the studio responsible for 2019's cult classic RPG&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>(although it's fair to say there's a little more to it than that), has revealed its new game&nbsp;<em>Project C4</em>.</p>

<p>The studio describes the game as "a mind-warping story of espionage and team-building" which takes place in an "original yet achingly familiar setting", which might suggest the setting will bear some similarities to&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>'s Revachol.</p>

<p><em>Project C4</em>'s debut trailer is characteristically vague and oblique, with a voiceover intoning vague lines like "my mind is eating itself" and "obliteration wears a rented suit" with a withering English twang. In fairness, this is a teaser trailer (and one made by ZA/UM, no less), so we probably shouldn't expect straightforward.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zaum-project-c4-conspiracies.jpg?itok=fFORnnmQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zaum-project-c4-conspiracies.jpg?itok=rjaik5SH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Project C4&nbsp;</em>looks like a characteristically weird RPG from ZA/UM.</figcaption></figure><p>The opening words of the trailer confidently read "WE ARE ZA/UM" and "WE BROUGHT YOU&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>", but that's arguably only true up to a certain point.</p>

<p>Back in 2022,&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>lead designer Robert Kurvitz, along with art director Aleksander Rostov and writer Helen Hindpere, <a href="https://x.com/artofrostov/status/1576539500012240897" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">confirmed</a> that they were no longer a part of ZA/UM after it was <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/report-i-disco-elysium-i-co-founders-ousted-from-developer-za-um" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reported</a> that the three had been quietly removed from the studio.</p>

<p>What followed is a lengthy, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-wild-story-behind-disco-elysiums-spiritual-successors-allegations-legal-threats-and-a-usb-stick" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">winding story</a> of legal disputes and bitter recriminations, so ZA/UM saying that it's the studio responsible for&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>feels just a little bit audacious given that many of that game's key creative personnel are no longer there.</p>

<p>Additionally, in early 2024, ZA/UM was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/disco-elysium-developer-zaum-confirms-game-cancellation-and-layoffs" rel="nofollow">hit by layoffs</a>, with the studio also canceling one of its in-development game projects (which was reportedly a standalone&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>expansion).</p>




<p>Since then, a number of ex-<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>developers have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-disco-elysium-devs-new-studios-spiritual-successors" rel="nofollow">founded their own studios</a> and announced their own games, many of which bear at least superficial similarities to the&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>formula.</p>

<p>Of course, it remains to be seen whether&nbsp;<em>Project C4&nbsp;</em>will itself be similar to&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>, but since ZA/UM reminds us of that game's existence in the first few seconds of the trailer (and describes&nbsp;<em>C4&nbsp;</em>as "the next genre-defining RPG" from the studio), it's a safe bet it will.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what's in store for us when it comes to <i>Project C4</i>. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steel-hunters-early-access-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>World of Warships&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;World of Tanks&nbsp;</i>developer Wargaming has announced the Early Access release date for its upcoming PvPvE mech shooter&nbsp;<em>Steel Hunters</em>.</p>

<p>Per a new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Steel Hunters&nbsp;</em>will arrive on PC via Steam Early Access on April 2nd "after three years of relentless development". The game will include "the core gameplay mechanics, maps, Hunters, and progression systems" necessary for "a strong starting point", according to Wargaming.</p>

<p>The developer is promising that the game will evolve with the input of its community; in an accompanying Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1691340/view/516329641817933073" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>, Wargaming says it intends to "refine and expand the game together" with the player base, "ensuring every shot fired and every Hunter unleashed is finely tuned".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steel-hunters-early-access-release-date-mechs.jpg?itok=0agCnVZQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steel-hunters-early-access-release-date-mechs.jpg?itok=-Ej4FXhD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Steel Hunters</em>' Early Access release is set for April.</figcaption></figure><p>Rather uniquely, Wargaming also says it doesn't want&nbsp;<em>Steel Hunters&nbsp;</em>to be stuck in Early Access for a protracted period of time. The studio says the Early Access period "won't be a drawn-out process" and that the goal is to "move quickly to a full release" once feedback has helped to "polish the core experience".</p>

<p>Wargaming says it will share more information about how&nbsp;<em>Steel Hunters</em>' Early Access period will unfold in the future, but for now, the game is set for an April release. It'll be free-to-play as well.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Steel Hunters</em>, it's a mech shooter that takes place after a "cataclysmic event" leads mankind to create robots called Hunters to protect caches of Starfall, a new resource "crucial to human survival".</p>

<p>Of course, things don't quite work out, and before long, Hunters led by different factions are doing battle with one another in order to secure the precious Starfall bounty they need to ensure their prosperity.</p>




<p>The game will feature multiple different Hunter playstyles with different "destructive weapons, gear, mods, and abilities" to discover, and as well as quick reflexes, you'll also have to exhibit "sound tactics" to win.</p>

<p>If you checked out the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mecha-break-demo-player-count-300k" rel="nofollow">hugely popular demo for mech shooter&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mecha-break-demo-player-count-300k" rel="nofollow">Mecha Break</a>&nbsp;</em>back in February and enjoyed it, then this one may well be right up your alley too.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Steel Hunters&nbsp;</em>when it launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1691340/STEEL_HUNTERS/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on April 2nd.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Silent Hill f Set to Be Revealed in New Silent Hill Transmission This Week]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-transmission-announced-silent-hill-f</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/silent-hill-f-set-to-be-revealed-in-new-silent-hill-transmission-this-week.1130952/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-transmission-announced-silent-hill-f<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Konami has announced a brand new&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>Transmission showcase for this week, and it sounds like the show will focus pretty much exclusively on the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f</em>.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/SilentHill/status/1899218771375481118" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Konami reveals that the stream will air on March 13th at 3pm Pacific, which is around 6pm Eastern and about 10pm GMT. It's going to be a fairly late one if you're in the UK or Europe.</p>

<p>According to the post, the stream will "uncover&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f</em>", so presumably, we'll get a full reveal for the game. I'm not sure you should hold your breath for a release date, but at the very least we should get a full story reveal and perhaps some gameplay as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/silent-hill-f-reveal-next-week-flower-girl.jpg?itok=otsaKKu5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/silent-hill-f-reveal-next-week-flower-girl.jpg?itok=4fw1eN9z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Silent Hill f&nbsp;</em>was first revealed back in late 2022.</figcaption></figure><p>In case you need a reminder,&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f&nbsp;</em>was revealed via a rather effectively creepy teaser trailer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-and-more-all-but-confirmed" rel="nofollow">back in 2022</a>, but we don't know too much about the game outside of that initial reveal.</p>

<p>The trailer featured some pretty creepy imagery, including a Japanese-style doll and a girl covered in some kind of strange floral growth, but it's not clear yet how those things will fit into&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f</em>'s story.</p>

<p>In the interim, however, Konami didn't forget about&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill</em>; the&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake was released late last year, going on to sell <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">over two million copies</a> at last count. It seems the game performed well enough to prompt Konami to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloober-team-konami-new-game-ip" rel="nofollow">work with Bloober on another game</a> based on one of the publisher's IPs, too.</p>

<p>You can rewatch the&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f&nbsp;</em>teaser trailer (or perhaps even watch it for the first time, if you missed it back in 2022) right here.</p>




<p>The next&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>Transmission will air on March 13th (that's this Thursday!) at 3pm Pacific. It's worth noting that Konami hasn't ruled out other franchise news, so we could well learn more about what's in store for&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>on Thursday as well.</p>
