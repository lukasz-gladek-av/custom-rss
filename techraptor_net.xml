            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-roadmap-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Kinetic Games has shared the&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>roadmap for 2025, showing what you can expect from the multiplayer-focused ghost-hunting horror game throughout the rest of this year.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.kineticgames.co.uk/blog/phasmophobia-2025-roadmap" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on its blog, Kinetic splits said&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>roadmap into three elements: major updates, maps and reworks, and seasonal events. In the first column, you can look forward to the Chronicle update first, which will revamp evidence recording and bring "a few extra bits". It has no release date yet, sadly.</p>

<p><em>Phasmophobia</em>'s second major update this year will bring a player character overhaul to give you more choices when it comes to your ghost hunter. You can expect refreshed models, improved animations, and more. Full customization, however, isn't coming until 2026.</p>

Kinetic is keeping its cards close to its chest, but the developer does say the map will be "small" and based in a "totally unique" location.</p>

<p>Reworks are also coming for several maps. You can expect redone versions of Bleasdale and Grafton Farmhouses, as well as 6 Tanglewood Drive.</p>

<p>The first rework for Bleasdale Farmhouse will arrive sometime in March, Kinetic says, and the latter two will be coming sometime later in the year. In 2026, more map reworks and new maps will be coming, although Kinetic doesn't share any details about those.</p>

<p>Finally, the new 2025&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>roadmap looks ahead to seasonal events, with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-crimson-eye-update" rel="nofollow">Halloween</a> and winter events repeating "with the same themes" this year. A "new take" on the Easter event will also be coming in April.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-extended</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-extended-after-psn-outage.1104948/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-extended<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has announced that the upcoming second week of February's&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>open beta will be extended thanks to a recent PSN outage that saw many unable to log into PlayStation's online services.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1888907040879485237" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message</a> on X, Capcom says the open beta period, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/second-monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta" rel="nofollow">set to begin on February 13th</a> (or 14th depending on your timezone), will be extended by 24 hours. That means it'll now be coming to an end on either February 17th or 18th, again dependent on timezone.</p>

<p>If you're a PC or Xbox player, don't worry; the open beta has been extended across all platforms, so even if you weren't directly affected by the outage, you'll still be able to enjoy the game for an extra day.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-extended-fleeing.jpg?itok=IrkoceCC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-extended-fleeing.jpg?itok=DgdAHT5k 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' open beta has been extended by a day.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as the extension itself, Capcom has also <a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1888907223285256244" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">confirmed</a> that the rewards you'll get for participating in the open beta will remain available for the additional day, so you don't need to miss out on those.</p>

<p>The PSN outage to which Capcom is referring <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/live/playstation-network-outage-february-2025-live" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">began on Friday evening</a> (Eastern time) and was resolved the following day, meaning PSN was unavailable for around a 24-hour period.</p>

<p>Sony hasn't revealed the reason behind the outage, simply putting it down to an "operational issue" in an apologetic <a href="https://x.com/AskPlayStation/status/1888454556125708758" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message on X</a>.</p>

<p>If you're a PlayStation Plus member, then you'll be getting an extra five days of subscription by way of apology. Non-PS Plus members don't get anything, but it looks like it doesn't matter which tier you're subscribed to, at least.</p>




<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, it's the upcoming next major installment in the&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>series. The game will see you sally forth into the Forbidden Lands to investigate rumors of a mysterious monster attacking villages.</p>

<p>Along the way, you will, of course, hunt and kill plenty of monsters, collecting unique gear and discovering a deep ecosystem as you go.</p>

<p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/monster-hunter-wilds/9NMT6XFN0LVD" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on February 28th. You can check out our <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/monster-hunter-wilds-preview-wildly-impressive" rel="nofollow">preview of the game here</a> to find out how it's shaping up.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Bubble Ghost Remake Reimagines a Retro Platforming Classic in March]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bubble-ghost-remake-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bubble-ghost-remake-reimagines-a-retro-platforming-classic-in-march.1104915/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bubble-ghost-remake-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Nakama Game Studio and publisher SelectaPlay have announced a release date for&nbsp;<em>Bubble Ghost Remake</em>, a reimagined version of the cult classic 1987 platformer.</p>

<p>Launching on March 27th,&nbsp;<em>Bubble Ghost Remake&nbsp;</em>offers a "reimagined, visually captivating gameplay experience" largely based on the 1987 original, although it'll also boast a host of new features to bring it up to speed with modern gaming standards.</p>

<p>These features include new game modes, boss battles, and collectibles, as well as "many more surprises". It sounds like you'll have to play&nbsp;<em>Bubble Ghost Remake&nbsp;</em>yourself if you want to find out what those surprises are.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bubble-ghost-remake-release-date-level.jpg?itok=ILBGCzH0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bubble-ghost-remake-release-date-level.jpg?itok=yLkhiMU1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Bubble Ghost Remake&nbsp;</em>offers a fresh take on a classic platformer.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Bubble Ghost Remake</em>'s Story mode will offer over 40 levels to play through, each of which promise "hours of entertainment and challenge", according to the developers.</p>

<p>If you don't fancy playing through the game with its narrative trappings intact, you can instead opt for the Arcade mode, and Challenge and Speedrun modes are available if you're the kind of person who likes to test themselves to their limits.</p>

<p>These aren't the aforementioned surprises, though; Nakama Game Studio promises further game modes you can unlock "for an even more thrilling gameplay experience".</p>

<p>Naturally, the game will feature revamped graphics and sound when compared to its bleepy-bloopy 80s counterpart, and you can also look forward to in-game achievements, so if you're playing the Switch version, you don't have to miss out on that sweet dopamine hit.</p>




<p>As well as the digital versions, <i>Bubble Ghost Remake&nbsp;</i>will also be available as a physical release. In North America, you'll be able to get the standard version, but there's also an EU-exclusive Collector's Edition for Switch that packs in some extra goodies.</p>

<p>These include the game itself (of course), as well as a prequel comic, a soundtrack CD, a "selection of stickers", and a special standee. If you love yourself some&nbsp;<em>Bubble Ghost</em>, you'll want to plump for that.</p>

<p><em>Bubble Ghost Remake&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2412240/Bubble_Ghost_Remake/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Bubble-Ghost-Remake-2702820.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> on March 27th.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/relic-entertainment-future-plans</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dawn-of-war-and-company-of-heroes-developer-relic-shares-future-plans.1104912/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/relic-entertainment-future-plans<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Relic Entertainment, the studio behind games like&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Dawn of War&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Company of Heroes</em>, has announced its plans for the future, and while they're rather vague on the whole, there are some interesting tidbits to pore over.</p>

<p>In a press release, Relic, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sega-relic-entertainment-layoffs" rel="nofollow">became independent</a> after being sold off by Sega in March last year (sustaining a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/relic-entertainment-layoffs" rel="nofollow">number of layoffs</a> into the bargain), says it's identified three key pillars for its strategy when it comes to the studio's future.</p>

<p>Pillar one involves "deepening commitment to existing titles", which means providing updates and continuing support for Relic's existing games. At the moment, the company is actively supporting strategy titles&nbsp;<em>Company of Heroes 3&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Age of Empires 4</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/relic-entertainment-future-plans-company-of-heroes-3-battle.jpg?itok=UzEe6FaP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/relic-entertainment-future-plans-company-of-heroes-3-battle.jpg?itok=eAMsoasP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Relic will continue supporting&nbsp;<em>Company of Heroes 3</em>, but it has plans for new games too.</figcaption></figure><p>Relic's second major new pillar is titled "independent development, creative experiences", and it involves the developer branching out into "smaller-scope, in-house games", as well as "continuing to develop the larger, complex strategy titles" for which it's known.</p>

<p>Finally - and perhaps most interestingly - Relic says it wants to "reimagin[e] classics", finding ways to "bring [its] classic titles to modern audiences". This could entail "re-releases, remasters, or brand-new franchise experiences" that capture the originals' "spirit" while appealing to new players as well.</p>

<p>Relic CEO Justin Dowdeswell says the studio's new direction marks "a significant milestone", and that he's "confident" Relic will be able to deliver "innovative, high-quality games that resonate with players around the world".</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Relic doesn't commit to announcing exactly what any of the aforementioned games might be, so we don't know just how far away from that tantalizing&nbsp;<em>Dawn of War&nbsp;</em>remaster we might be. Let's hope it's just around the corner, eh?</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-dawn-of-war-relic.jpg?itok=Z7ptPWPo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-dawn-of-war-relic.jpg?itok=DC8CvpIq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Let's hope that&nbsp;<em>Dawn of War&nbsp;</em>remaster is just around the corner.</figcaption></figure><p>If you were worried that Relic's independence from Sega meant it wouldn't be able to create its large-scale RTS games anymore, then it looks like you won't need to worry about that. We'll just be getting some extra experiments on the side.</p>

<p>What this means for Relic in a broader sense remains to be seen, though. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things Relic-related.</p>
