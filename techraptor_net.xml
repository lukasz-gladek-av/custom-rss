            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sultans-game-100k-sales-48-hours<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Double Cross Studio and publisher 2P Games have announced that card-based RPG&nbsp;<em>Sultan's Game&nbsp;</em>has crossed a pretty big sales milestone within its first couple of days on release.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Sultan's Game&nbsp;</em>crossed 100,000 sales within 48 hours, which puts it on par with the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/soulmask-sales-100k" rel="nofollow">survival-crafter&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/soulmask-sales-100k" rel="nofollow">Soulmask</a>&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/core-keeper-sales-reach-100k-in-two-days" rel="nofollow">underground indie explore-'em-up&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper</em></a>.</p>

<p>By way of a celebration for the sales milestone, Double Cross has revealed some of its plans for&nbsp;<em>Sultan's Game&nbsp;</em>in the next couple of months, which include a new epilogue, extra story stuff, and support for Steam Workshop to allow players to create their own mods.</p>

You don't have to switch this on if you prefer to sit these events through, though.</p>

<p>You'll also soon be able to assign card categories to certain hand slots, and you'll be able to set hotkeys to automatically organize your card collection too, which should make it a little easier to sift through your deck.</p>

<p>In addition, Double Cross says it's looking to "fine-tune disruptive sound effects and musical transitions", and a new sensitive content warning toggle will be added to allow you to decide whether you want to be warned about "sensitive storylines" or not.</p>

<p>As well as all of this, a manual save-load system is coming, along with controller and Steam Deck optimization, a new gallery mode for cards and endings, and lots more. Suffice it to say Double Cross and 2P are in it for the long haul when it comes to&nbsp;<em>Sultan's Game</em>.</p>
