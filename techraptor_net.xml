            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/striking-distance-layoffs-callisto-protocol<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>The Callisto Protocol&nbsp;</em>developer Striking Distance Studios has apparently laid off the majority of its staff, at least according to two employees who were let go from the company.</p>

<p>As spotted by ResetEra user <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-callisto-protocol-dev-striking-distance-studios-has-made-another-round-of-layoffs.1117866/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Cyberia</a> (who also spotted posts confirming Wizards of the Coast subsidiary Skeleton Key's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wizards-of-the-coast-skeleton-key-project-canceled" rel="nofollow">project cancellation</a>), Striking Distance staff members <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jesseleeconceptart_opentowork-activity-7298625255500091392-t4QX" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Jesse Lee</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/zach-volker_it-was-a-tough-morning-at-striking-distance-activity-7298480796674183168-Ft3a" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Zach Volker</a> posted on LinkedIn earlier this week confirming that they were laid off.</p>

<p>Lee, who served as concept art director for Striking Distance for four years, says in his post that "most of the devs" at the studio "were laid off", while Volker says there were "lots of layoffs, including [himself]".</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with Striking Distance, it's a studio founded by&nbsp;<em>Dead Space&nbsp;</em>creator Glen Schofield back in 2019. The studio's first project was survival horror title&nbsp;<em>The Callisto Protocol</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/callisto-protocol-is-set-in-pubg-universe-apparently" rel="nofollow">originally to be set in the&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>universe</a>, although this aspect of the game was subsequently downplayed.</p>

<p>The game's production was reportedly troubled, with staff <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/callisto-protocol-crunch-is-problem-with-100-hour-work-weeks" rel="nofollow">being asked to work 100-hour weeks</a> in order to finish the project on time.</p>

<p>Eventually,&nbsp;<em>The Callisto Protocol&nbsp;</em>was released in 2022, attracting a range of opinions. Our own Sam <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/callisto-protocol-review" rel="nofollow">"awarded" the game a 4.5 out of 10</a>, praising its "beautiful" visuals but criticizing its story, chaotic combat, and "terrible" boss encounters.</p>




<p>Following&nbsp;<em>The Callisto Protocol</em>'s release, Striking Distance founder Glen Schofield <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-space-co-creator-pursuing-new-opportunities-less-than-year-after-callisto" rel="nofollow">departed the studio</a>, with parent company Krafton confirming his departure was in order to "pursue new opportunities".</p>

<p>A spinoff game,&nbsp;<em>[Redacted]</em>, was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/redacted-callisto-protocol-spinoff-release-date" rel="nofollow">released back in October</a>. Set in the same universe as&nbsp;<em>The Callisto Protocol</em>, the game eschews the&nbsp;<em>Dead Space</em>-style survival horror trappings of its parent, opting instead for a top-down action roguelike approach.</p>

<p>Striking Distance is far from the only studio to lay off staff in recent months. Others include&nbsp;<em>Killer Instinct&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rumbleverse-and-killer-instct-studio-iron-galaxy-suffers-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Iron Galaxy</a>,&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioware-layoffs-veilguard-failure" rel="nofollow">BioWare</a>, and tech giant <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-layoffs-january-2025" rel="nofollow">Microsoft</a>, among many, many others.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anna-williams-is-tekken-8s-first-season-2-dlc-character.1118244/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-anna-williams-dlc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has revealed that the next&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8&nbsp;</em>DLC fighter, as well as the first one to join the game's roster as part of its second season, is none other than Nina Williams' deadly sister Anna.</p>

<p>As part of&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8</em>'s first season of DLC characters, iconic fighters like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-heihachi-mishima-dlc-release-date" rel="nofollow">Heihachi Mishima</a>, capoeira dancer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-reveals-eddy-gordo-as-first-dlc-character-alongside-season-pass-1-roadmap" rel="nofollow">Eddy Gordo</a>, and&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>'s Clive Rosfield, and Bandai Namco is continuing to add classic&nbsp;<em>Tekken&nbsp;</em>characters to&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8</em>'s roster with its second season.</p>

<p>Introduced as "Scarlet Lightning" in her debut trailer, Anna proceeds to beat seven bells out of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-victor-chevalier-reveal" rel="nofollow">French agent Victor Chevalier</a>, who's voiced by none other than acting legend Vincent Cassel.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/anna-williams-tekken-8-weapon.jpg?itok=z80Nnj4S 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/anna-williams-tekken-8-weapon.jpg?itok=W9KI8BUI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Anna Williams is back in&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8</em>, and she's sporting Lovely Tom once more.</figcaption></figure><p>As you might expect, Anna's moveset is a mixture of elegant martial arts moves and brutal beatdowns with Lovely Tom, her multi-purpose heavy weapon.</p>

<p>After battling Victor, Anna moves on to taking on Polish Prime Minister (in the game, of course, not in real life) and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-lidia-release-date" rel="nofollow">fellow DLC fighter</a> Lidia Sobieska. As you'd expect given that this is Anna's trailer, the assassin makes short work of Lidia.</p>

<p>Finally, in a showdown for the ages, Anna gets to take on her sister Nina, who once again takes a beating from Anna. We also get to see Anna's Rage Art, which sees her summoning a helicopter to provide fire support as she blasts her opponent with Lovely Tom.</p>

<p>Anna will be released for&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8&nbsp;</em>on April 3rd, with three-day early access available on March 31st for those who purchase the game's second season pass. You can see Anna in action via her debut trailer right here.</p>




<p>The second round of&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8&nbsp;</em>DLC will include not only Anna, but also three more characters, as well as two extra stages. The first stage will arrive in summer, as will the next character after Anna. One more character will arrive in fall, and in winter, the season's final character and stage will launch.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1778820/TEKKEN_8/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/tekken-8/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/tekken-8/9ppsm14vkclw" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloober-team-konami-new-game-ip</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/silent-hill-2-remake-studio-bloober-team-working-with-konami-on-new-game.1118211/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloober-team-konami-new-game-ip<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake developer Bloober Team has announced that it's working on another project alongside Konami, and that the game will be based on Konami's intellectual property.</p>

<p>In a press <a href="https://blooberteam.prowly.com/383560-bloober-team-and-konami-continue-their-collaboration" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">release</a>, Bloober says it's "focusing on a new game based on Konami's IP" and that details of the project "remain a mystery" right now. The studio goes on to say it "can't reveal too many details at this time" but that fans will be "just as excited" about the collaboration as Bloober is.</p>

<p>It's interesting that Bloober is remaining cagey about exactly what IP it's working on. The obvious choice would, of course, be&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill</em>; perhaps the team has been selected to develop another remake. Still, it's a little odd Bloober would play those cards so close to its chest given its work on&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bloober-team-konami-new-game-silent-hill-2.jpg?itok=vItbk2rq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bloober-team-konami-new-game-silent-hill-2.jpg?itok=Uhp93h6U 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bloober Team is working on another game based on Konami IP, and it may or may not be&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Given Bloober Team's penchant for horror, it doesn't feel like any other IP makes sense; I can't quite picture a Bloober Team&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid&nbsp;</em>game, for instance, although<i>&nbsp;</i><em>Castlevania&nbsp;</em>might be a slightly easier pitch.</p>

<p>If you ask me, I think it'll likely be a remake of the original&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill</em>. Remaking the third game before the first makes no sense to me since they share plot elements, and while I'd love&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 4: The Room&nbsp;</em>to get a remake, it hasn't been that long since <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-4-room-comes-to-gog-for-gogs-12th-anniversary" rel="nofollow">the game was re-released on PC</a>.</p>

<p>Either way, picking Bloober Team to work on a new Konami game makes sense given their first collaboration's success; Konami recently revealed that the&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">topped two million sales worldwide</a>,&nbsp;</p>




<p>It's been a pretty active time for Konami recently in terms of its major franchises. After many years of dormancy, the&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake launched in October, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-and-more-all-but-confirmed" rel="nofollow">more&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>projects are on the way</a>&nbsp;as well.</p>

<p>Not only that, but <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-release-date-leak-playstation" rel="nofollow">in August</a>, Konami will release&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em>, a full remake of the 2004 stealth-action classic built in Unreal Engine 5 and sporting revamped gameplay.</p>

<p>Now, all Konami needs to do to complete the trifecta of my childhood dreams is to revive&nbsp;<em>Castlevania</em>. It's been so long that I'd even take a remake at this point, although I'd prefer an entirely new game, of course. Stay tuned for more!</p>
