            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Upcoming Viking tactics RPG <em>Norse: Oath of Blood </em>has been delayed on both PC and consoles, and while PC players won't have to wait too much longer to check the game out, it'll be a bit of a longer delay for PS5 and Xbox.</p><p>Originally set to launch on February 3rd, <em>Norse: Oath of Blood </em>will now be arriving on February 17th on Steam, Epic, and GOG, which represents a delay of just two weeks. That's not too bad, if you ask me.</p><p>The PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions of the game were initially due to arrive alongside the PC launch, but that's no longer happening; instead, console players will have to wait until spring to check out <em>Norse: Oath of Blood</em>.</p><figure role="group">

<p>Arctic Hazard explains the delay <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/norsegame.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">over on Bluesky</a>, but it's a fairly standard explanation; the devs need more time to "further refine and polish the experience" of <em>Norse: Oath of Blood </em>so that it reflects the studio's "passion for the source material".</p><p>Although the game is being delayed, Arctic Hazard and Tripwire are promising new developer diaries in the coming weeks, which will include "behind-the-scenes looks at development, deeper dives into gameplay, and additional updates".</p><p>If you're not familiar with <em>Norse: Oath of Blood</em>, it's a gritty tactical RPG that emphasizes down-to-earth realism in a way that I suspect <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/wartales" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fe4a9aa9-b171-4bf8-a97d-e538c2805501" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Wartales</em></a><em> </em>fans will appreciate.</p><p>You play as a young Viking called Gunnar (because of course he is), who's out for vengeance after his home is destroyed by the intimidating-sounding Steinarr Far-Spear. You must build a settlement from scratch, training warriors and assigning villagers as you go.</p>
<p><em>Norse: Oath of Blood </em>will be launching on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3054690/NORSE_Oath_of_Blood/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/norse_oath_of_blood" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GOG</a>, and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/norse-d7df8c" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Epic</a> on February 17th, and it'll be arriving on <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10014665" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/norse-oath-of-blood/9ndrfjpjfx5x" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a> at some point this spring.
