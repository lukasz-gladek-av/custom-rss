            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideki-kamiya-platinumgames-execs-leaving<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>PlatinumGames founder and former CEO Hideki Kamiya has revealed that at least four more high-profile execs have quit the company, including the directors of hits like&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 3</em>.</p>

<p>In a recent video on his YouTube channel (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/hideki-kamiya-video-reveals-five-more-leads-have-quit-platinum-including-bayonetta-3s-director/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">VGC</a>), Kamiya includes a photograph of himself and five other individuals, labeling the picture as a "former PlatinumGames directors' drinking party".</p>

<p>As well as Kamiya himself, the photo also includes Yusuke Miyata, Kenji Saito, and Takahisa Taura, the directors of <i>Bayonetta 3</i>,&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Rising</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Astral Chain</em>, respectively. You can also spot&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta Origins</em>' Abebe Tinari, as well as character artist Masaki Yamanaka.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hideki-kamiya-platinumgames-directors-photo.jpg?itok=hhKATQvb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hideki-kamiya-platinumgames-directors-photo.jpg?itok=ygdronBD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Several more folks appear to have left PlatinumGames.</figcaption></figure><p>As VGC points out, Tinari already revealed his departure from PlatinumGames last month, but to the best of my knowledge, the departure of the other four from PlatinumGames is new.</p>

<p>Kamiya doesn't state in the video whether any of the folks in the photo have joined his new studio Clovers or whether they'll be moving on to other ventures within the gaming industry, although at the very least, it seems plausible that&nbsp;<em>Astral Chain</em>'s Taura is <a href="https://x.com/NSK29_0916/status/1869213824198599053" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">starting his own studio</a>.</p>

<p>In any case, these departures follow some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platinumgames-quietly-removes-all-mentions-of-project-gg-from-website" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">rather odd changes</a> to PlatinumGames' website. A number of games, including titles like&nbsp;<em>Transformers: Devastation</em>, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/world-of-demons-delisted" rel="nofollow">now-delisted</a>&nbsp;<em>World of Demons</em>, and the previously-teased&nbsp;<em>Project G.G.</em>, have all been removed from the site's listings.</p>

<p>It seems the studio has removed games that are no longer available, which presumably also means&nbsp;<em>Project G.G.&nbsp;</em>has been canceled, although the fact that they're completely gone from PlatinumGames' list feels a touch like revisionist history.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/transformers-devastation-platinumgames.jpg?itok=U7B6A1Sy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/transformers-devastation-platinumgames.jpg?itok=FQKd5U6J 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Delisted games like&nbsp;<em>Transformers: Devastation&nbsp;</em>have been removed from PlatinumGames' website.</figcaption></figure><p>As for Kamiya himself, after leaving PlatinumGames <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideki-kamiya-explains-why-he-quit-platinumgames" rel="nofollow">back in 2023</a>, he's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/okami-2-hideki-kamiya" rel="nofollow">currently working on a sequel to&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/okami-2-hideki-kamiya" rel="nofollow">Okami</a>&nbsp;</em>with his new studio Clovers, which also has several ex-PlatinumGames staffers working for it.</p>

<p>The sequel is likely some way away from being released, but it's nice to know that Kamiya is getting to work on a project in which he'd <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideki-kamiya-would-like-to-make-new-viewtiful-joe-and-okami-games-comments-on" rel="nofollow">previously expressed interest</a>. Maybe now we can hope for that new&nbsp;<em>Viewtiful Joe&nbsp;</em>game.</p>

<p>PlatinumGames, meanwhile, is currently working on&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 4&nbsp;</em>alongside Team Ninja. The game was revealed during last month's Xbox Developer Direct and is set to launch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2627260/NINJA_GAIDEN_4/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012110" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/ninja-gaiden-4/9p0sq1s72g4j" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> later this year.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Wreckfest 2 Early Access Release Date Scheduled for March]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wreckfest-2-early-access-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wreckfest-2-early-access-release-date-scheduled-for-march.1099785/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wreckfest-2-early-access-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>THQ Nordic and Bugbear have announced the Early Access release date for destruction derby racer&nbsp;<em>Wreckfest 2</em>, so get ready to engage in what the two studios describe as "absolute vehicular mayhem".</p>

<p><em>Wreckfest 2&nbsp;</em>officially arrives on PC via Steam Early Access on March 20th. The game will also eventually come to consoles, although it doesn't look like the Early Access release is making it onto PS5 or Xbox Series X|S, sadly.</p>

<p>When it launches,&nbsp;<em>Wreckfest 2&nbsp;</em>will pack in three gameplay modes: Racing, Derby, and Multiplayer. They're fairly self-explanatory, and as Early Access progresses, Bugbear says it'll also add "a completely revamped career mode that adapts to your individual playstyle".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wreckfest-2-early-access-release-date-crash.jpg?itok=Fej_bZWq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wreckfest-2-early-access-release-date-crash.jpg?itok=v8MCyrFL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Wreckfest 2&nbsp;</em>promises glorious destruction derby action in March.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as the career mode, Bugbear is also promising to add new tracks and vehicles throughout&nbsp;<em>Wreckfest 2</em>'s Early Access development, and new special challenges in which you race vehicles that "were definitely never supposed to end up on a racetrack" will be introduced.</p>

<p>Various other features, like tournaments and mod support, are also on the cards for Early Access. Rest assured that it does sound like&nbsp;<em>Wreckfest 2&nbsp;</em>has a solid core in place if you do decide to pick it up before these features have been implemented, though.</p>

<p>That experience involves what Bugbear and THQ Nordic describe as "full-contact racing action with no rules, just jaw-dropping moments of chaos and destruction". The sequel will sport an improved physics engine compared to <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/wreckfest" rel="nofollow">the original</a>, too.</p>

<p>You can check out the Early Access release date announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Wreckfest 2&nbsp;</em>right here. It should give you a good idea of what kind of destructive action to expect from the game.</p>




<p><em>Wreckfest 2&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1203190/Wreckfest_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on March 20th. There's no word yet on when the game is coming to consoles, although it has been slated for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S as well. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/helldivers-2-servants-of-freedom-warbond-to-bring-portable-hellbomb-and-more.1099782/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-servants-of-freedom-warbond<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and Arrowhead Game Studios have announced a new&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Warbond, and if you've ever wanted the destructive power of a Hellbomb strapped to your back, this is the Warbond for you.</p>

<p>Like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-truth-enforcers-warbond" rel="nofollow">previous</a>&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-chemical-agents-warbond" rel="nofollow">Warbonds</a>, Servants of Freedom brings a bunch of new gear for you to try out, foremost among which is the B-100 Portable Hellbomb Stratagem. Like the regular Hellbomb, make sure you're nowhere near this one when it goes off.</p>

<p>Of course, new weapons are also coming as part of this Warbond, including the LAS-17 Double-Edge Sickle, which powers up the regular Sickle and allows it to overheat, potentially damaging both you and "everything in its path".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-servants-of-freedom-warbond-hellbomb.jpg?itok=dpfGsSCh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-servants-of-freedom-warbond-hellbomb.jpg?itok=y7p1VvWv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Helldivers 2</em>'s new Warbond gives you your very own portable Hellbomb.</figcaption></figure><p>The secondary slot, meanwhile, gets a new GP-20 Ultimatum grenade pistol, which is "designed for closer-range use". That, given&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>'s penchant for randomly murdering you in hilarious ways, sounds like a recipe for disaster to me.</p>

<p>Servants of Freedom also brings a new throwable weapon in the G-50 Seeker, a drone that follows along behind you and explodes near enemies when it detects them. It can also target enemies you ping.</p>

<p>Two new armor sets have been added, both medium sets: the IE-3 Martyr and the IE-12 Righteous. Both sets come complete with rather terrifying masked helms that will make you look like Doctor Doom, but if he fought on the side of justice, truth, and democracy (ahem).</p>

<p>Naturally, the Warbond comes complete with new capes, a new player title, and a new cheer as well, all of which should help you express yourself when you're taking the fight to those dastardly Terminids (or bots, or Illuminate, of course).</p>




<p>Elsewhere in&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>news, chief creative officer Johan Pilestedt announced last week that he's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-johan-pilestedt-sabbatical" rel="nofollow">intending to take a sabbatical from work</a>, and that when he returns, he'll begin work on a new Arrowhead game. Exciting!</p>

<p><em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/helldivers-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and the Servants of Freedom Warbond arrives on February 6th.
