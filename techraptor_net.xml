            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Level-5 has finally announced what we can only hope will be the final&nbsp;<em>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road&nbsp;</em>release date, and a Switch 2 version of the game has also been confirmed.</p>

<p>Over on its official <a href="https://www.inazuma.jp/victory-road/en/topics/250411/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, Level-5 says&nbsp;<em>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road&nbsp;</em>is coming on August 21st. The game was previously slated for a June release, but Level-5 says it needs more time to "further polish the game and deliver the best possible experience".</p>

<p>Additionally, while the game was originally set to come to mobile platforms as well as PC and consoles, the iOS and Android versions of&nbsp;<em>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road&nbsp;</em>have seemingly been dropped. However, it's now coming not only to Switch 2, but to Xbox Series X|S as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-release-date-august-match.jpg?itok=1qP79FYB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-release-date-august-match.jpg?itok=50ghX4w4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road&nbsp;</em>finally has a release date.</figcaption></figure><p>The game is also still planned to release for the original Nintendo Switch, so don't worry; if you're a Nintendo fan, you won't need the newest console, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">which launches on June 5th</a>, to play&nbsp;<em>Victory Road</em>.</p>

<p>What's more,&nbsp;<em>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road&nbsp;</em>will feature full cross-play and cross-progression, so if you've bought the game on Switch but you want to continue playing on PlayStation, you should be able to use the same save to do so.</p>

<p>More trailers for <i>Victory Road&nbsp;</i>are also set to debut in the coming months. In May, a making-of trailer will show you how Level-5 created the game, while in June, you'll get a new story trailer. At the end of July, a final trailer will preface the release of&nbsp;<em>Victory Road&nbsp;</em>in August.</p>




<p>It's been a long road for Level-5 and&nbsp;<em>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</em>. The game was originally announced in 2016 and was set for a 2018 release, but it was delayed to 2020, then <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/inazuma-eleven-heroes-great-road-delayed-until-2021" rel="nofollow">again to 2021 after a name change</a>.</p>

<p>A Western version of&nbsp;<em>Victory Road&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-will-come-west-new-trailer-details-revealed" rel="nofollow">confirmed in 2023</a>, and a PC version was subsequently announced in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-pc-release" rel="nofollow">December that same year</a>. Here's hoping that no further delays or platform changes are on the way and that we can now look forward to playing the game at last.</p>

<p><em>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road&nbsp;</em>is set to launch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2799860/INAZUMA_ELEVEN_Victory_Road/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/231308" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo consoles on August 21st.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/zenless-zone-zero-version-1-7-release-date-revealed.1161711/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-version-17-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has revealed the release date for&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 1.7, with the latest update for the gacha action RPG due to end the first season later this month.</p>

<p>Arriving on April 23rd,&nbsp;Version 1.7 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-version-16-march" rel="nofollow">follows on from March's Version 1.6</a>, and HoYoverse says it'll mark "the grand finale of&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Season One". The story will revolve around the Sacrifice crisis; you'll "finally reveal the long-sought truth" behind the crisis and learn more about two new characters as well.</p>

<p>Both of those characters, Vivian and Hugo, will be available as S-Rank agents, and it sounds like they'll be heavily involved in the climactic story of this update as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zenless-zone-zero-version-1.7-release-date-vivian.jpg?itok=yDWwETYS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zenless-zone-zero-version-1.7-release-date-vivian.jpg?itok=TMvkPnDW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 1.7 arrives later this month.</figcaption></figure><p>The first S-Rank agent, Vivian, is an Ether Anomaly Agent who uses her parasol and rapier to shift "seamlessly" between ground attacks and aerial combat. She can also amplify Anomaly damage and boost her team's Corruption damage.</p>

<p>Hugo, meanwhile, is an S-Rank Ice Attack Agent who uses a suitcase that transforms into a scythe. How very&nbsp;<em>Gungrave</em>. He can increase his damage based on enemies' stun duration, and he's got a pretty good area-of-effect game as well.</p>

<p>This version's banners will also bring back Jane and Lighter for reruns, so if you missed your chance to recruit them both to your team when they debuted, you'll have another shot at doing so now.</p>

<p>According to HoYoverse,&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 1.7 will also provide opportunities to "unwind or embrace new challenges through in-game events" like the new "Say It With Flowers" shop management minigame.</p>




<p>If you prefer a more thrilling challenge, the return of Bangboo Bash, which sees you participating in "obstacle and survival courses" to earn exclusive rewards, is also making a return in this Version cycle.</p>

<p><em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 1.7 arrives on April 23rd. The game is available to play for free right now on <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/en-us/main" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Mafia: The Old Country Release Date Seemingly Leaked Via Steam]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mafia-old-country-release-date-seemingly-leaked</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mafia-the-old-country-release-date-seemingly-leaked-via-steam.1161708/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mafia-old-country-release-date-seemingly-leaked<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The&nbsp;<em>Mafia: The Old Country&nbsp;</em>release date may have been leaked by a now-amended Steam blog post, if a new report is to be believed.</p>

<p>According to the folks at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mafia-old-country-release-date-revealed-steam/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Insider Gaming</a>, a post was recently uploaded to the game's Steam page in which an upcoming PAX livestream was highlighted. The livestream will be aired in early May, and it's aiming to celebrate the 23-year lifespan of the&nbsp;<em>Mafia&nbsp;</em>series.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the post, a release date of August 8th was apparently listed. I say "apparently", because the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1941540/view/592894082264596999" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">same post</a> has since been scrubbed of that information, although the promo for the PAX livestream remains.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mafia-the-old-country-release-date-leak-lemons.jpg?itok=JbuvzkbE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mafia-the-old-country-release-date-leak-lemons.jpg?itok=ZruTkqYt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nice lemons. Be a shame if anything were to happen to them.</figcaption></figure><p>At the moment,&nbsp;<em>Mafia: The Old Country&nbsp;</em>simply has a broad release window of "2025" listed, and it would make sense if a full release date was announced during a retrospective of the&nbsp;<em>Mafia&nbsp;</em>series as a whole. We'll probably have to wait until May for confirmation, though.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Mafia: The Old Country</em>, it's the latest entry in the&nbsp;<em>Mafia&nbsp;</em>series, which so far consists of three mainline entries (not counting remakes like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/mafia-definitive-edition" rel="nofollow"><em>Mafia: Definitive Edition</em></a>, that is).</p>

<p>Although the games are technically open-world sandbox affairs, they're usually much more focused on their narratives than on freeform gameplay, so you might want to put comparisons to&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto&nbsp;</em>out of your mind.</p>

<p><em>The Old Country&nbsp;</em>is the series' first game not to be set after the previous one, chronologically speaking; instead, it's a prequel taking place in 1900s Sicily, where you'll play as indentured laborer Enzo Favara as he seeks a better life for himself.</p>




<p>Assuming this leak is correct, you'll be able to get your hands on&nbsp;<em>Mafia: The Old Country&nbsp;</em>on August 8th, when it'll launch for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1941540/Mafia_The_Old_Country/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/mafia-the-old-country/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/mafia-the-old-country/9P834N9S4LL0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>
