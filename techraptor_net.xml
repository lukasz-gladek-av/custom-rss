            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/riders-republic-movie-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>According to a new report, a movie based on Ubisoft's extreme sports racer&nbsp;<em>Riders Republic&nbsp;</em>is in the works, and I'd love to meet literally anyone who asked for such a project.</p>

<p>Per a Deadline <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/05/riders-republic-adil-bilall-gaumont-ubisoft-1236397176/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">article</a>, the&nbsp;<em>Riders Republic&nbsp;</em>movie will be a co-production between French movie house Gaumont and Ubisoft, and it'll be directed by&nbsp;<em>Bad Boys: Ride or Die&nbsp;</em>helmsmen Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah, colloquially known as Adil &amp; Bilall.</p>

<p>Writing duties on the project will be handled by&nbsp;<em>The World Is Yours&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Stillwater&nbsp;</em>scribe&nbsp;Noé Debré, although it's not clear whether there will be any other writers on the movie or whether Debré will be the sole writer.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riders-republic-movie-racing.jpg?itok=bcAQTRwJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riders-republic-movie-racing.jpg?itok=nBQyJQs3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Was a&nbsp;<em>Riders Republic&nbsp;</em>movie in the cards for 2025 as far as you're concerned?</figcaption></figure><p>This won't be Ubisoft's first foray into multimedia; the company is currently gearing up for the release of Netflix animated series&nbsp;<em>Splinter Cell: Deathwatch</em>, which is set to launch sometime later this year. Lest we forget, there's also 2023's Netflix series&nbsp;<em>Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix</em>.</p>

<p>Indeed,&nbsp;<em>Riders Republic&nbsp;</em>is just one of a number of video game movies in the works right now. Others include <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-movie-sydney-sweeney" rel="nofollow">a movie</a> based on EA's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-sales-4m-battlefield-skate" rel="nofollow">hit multiplayer game</a>&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>, as well as a movie based on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortuary-assistant-movie-announced" rel="nofollow">horror work sim&nbsp;<em>The Mortuary Assistant</em></a>&nbsp;and an adaptation of Sega's racer&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/outrun-movie-report" rel="nofollow"><em>OutRun</em></a>.</p>

<p>Video games are also proving ripe territory for series adaptations. Amazon's wildly successful&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>series, for instance, is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-season-3-confirmed-season-2-december" rel="nofollow">set to air its second season later this year</a>, and a third season has already been greenlit. HBO's&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us</em>, meanwhile, is partway through its second season at time of writing.</p>

<p>These shows join animated fare like Netflix's&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-devil-may-cry-renewed-second-season" rel="nofollow">Devil May Cry</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Castlevania&nbsp;</em>shows, as well as Prime Video's&nbsp;<em>Secret Level</em>, an anthology series with shorts based on properties like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/warhammer-40000-secret-level-trailer-brings-glory-to-imperium" rel="nofollow"><em>Warhammer 40k</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Armored Core</em>, and, er,&nbsp;<em>Concord</em>.</p>




<p>Naturally, the&nbsp;<em>Riders Republic&nbsp;</em>movie doesn't have a release date yet, and we don't know who's attached to star in it either. It's likely we'll learn more about the project in the coming months, but don't expect it to arrive in cinemas for a while.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-legends-of-zone-enhanced-edition-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GSC Game World has revealed the&nbsp;<em>Stalker: Legends of the Zone - Enhanced Edition&nbsp;</em>release date, with the updated versions of all three classic shooters coming to PC and current-gen consoles next week.</p>

<p>Back in December, it was revealed that the long-awaited next-gen update for&nbsp;<em>Stalker: Legends of the Zone&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-roadmap-legends-of-zone-next-gen-2025" rel="nofollow">would arrive in 2025</a>, and now we have a concrete release date: May 20th.</p>

<p>All three games will receive significant enhancements across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, including visual and performance improvements, gameplay tweaks to bring the games "more in line with current game practices", and more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stalker-legends-of-the-zone-enhanced-edition-release-date-gameplay.jpg?itok=iJEWmIrK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stalker-legends-of-the-zone-enhanced-edition-release-date-gameplay.jpg?itok=dESfbHaG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Stalker: Legends of the Zone - Enhanced Edition&nbsp;</em>comes to PC and current-gen consoles next week.</figcaption></figure><p>In addition, GSC Game World has also <a href="https://www.stalker-game.com/en/faq" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">revealed the PC specs</a> you're going to need if you want to run the&nbsp;<em>Legends of the Zone - Enhanced Edition&nbsp;</em>trilogy, and they're significantly beefed up compared to the original games, as you'd expect.</p>

<p>Running the games at 1440p and 60fps will require a GTX 1070 Ti and a Core i5-6600K or equivalent, while 4K at 60fps will need an RTX 2080 Ti and Core i7-6700K or AMD's version of the same.</p>

<p>On the plus side, if you already happen to own the original three&nbsp;<em>Stalker&nbsp;</em>games on PC, you will receive the&nbsp;<em>Legends of the Zone&nbsp;</em>enhancements as a free upgrade. It's not just visual updates, either; you're also getting extras like controller support and Steam achievements.</p>

<p>However, it's worth bearing in mind that the new versions of the game won't support mods created for the old versions. Still, these enhanced versions won't be replacing the originals in storefronts, and there's every chance modders will create new mods for the enhanced editions.</p>




<p><em>Stalker: Legends of the Zone - Enhanced Edition&nbsp;</em>launches across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on May 20th. You can buy all three games separately or together as a bundle, and console players also won't have to pay for the upgrade.</p>
