            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ananta-project-mugen-gameplay-trailer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Naked Rain and publisher NetEase have revealed a brand new gameplay trailer for&nbsp;<em>Ananta</em>, the open-world anime action RPG formerly known as&nbsp;<em>Project Mugen</em>.</p>

<p>The name change was <a href="https://x.com/Ananta_EN/status/1862316133988409359" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">put into effect in late November</a>, and at that point, NetEase and Naked Rain teased a new gameplay trailer for the game, which has now arrived. It looks exactly as you'd expect; essentially like a cross between the likes of&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>and a strange anime-inflected&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto</em>.</p>

<p>The trailer shows off&nbsp;<em>Ananta</em>'s central hub of Nova City, which is where you'll be spending most of your time, whether you're taking on one of the game's missions or engaging in its many minigames and distractions.</p>

<p>In a press release, NetEase and Naked Rain describe <i>Ananta</i>'s world as a place "where the unexpected is the norm and having fun is the ultimate goal".</p>

<p>While you'll be spending most of your time in Nova City, the two studios say you'll also be able to visit other "interconnected cities" to take on challenges, and they're also promising "kung fu movie"-style combat in which you can utilize your surroundings to defeat your enemies.</p>

<p>You can check out the latest trailer for&nbsp;<em>Ananta&nbsp;</em>right here.</p>




<p><em>Ananta&nbsp;</em>will be a free-to-play RPG, but NetEase and Naked Rain haven't revealed what kind of monetization the game will employ. It does rather resemble a HoYoverse-style gacha game, but we'll likely learn whether that's the case in the coming months.</p>

<p>We still don't know when&nbsp;<em>Ananta&nbsp;</em>will be released, but when it is, it'll land on PC, PS5, and mobile devices. You can check out our <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/project-mugen-interview" rel="nofollow">interview with the game's producer here</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ambitious Action-Strategy Game Kingmakers Delayed to Next Year]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingmakers-delayed-q1-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ambitious-action-strategy-game-kingmakers-delayed-to-next-year.1052466/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingmakers-delayed-q1-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Redemption Road and publisher tinyBuild have announced that ambitious upcoming action-strategy sandbox hybrid game&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>has been delayed until next year.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2109770/view/4445711438670988556" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an announcement on Steam</a> (which is, rather amusingly, worded as though it were an old-timey town crier decree), the two studios say that&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>will now launch "nay later than the end o' Q1 2025". I suppose the originally-slated release window of 2024 was pretty much unattainable given we're in December now.</p>

<p>The premise of&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>is a pretty novel one; it revolves around players being able to travel back in time with modern weaponry and lay waste to medieval armies in order to change the course of a war and "stave off the apocalypse".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingmakers-delayed-shooting.jpg?itok=zY9dK4Ei 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingmakers-delayed-shooting.jpg?itok=WKlZAUh3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>promises some astoundingly historically inaccurate action-sandbox shenanigans.</figcaption></figure><p>It's not a million miles away from the premise of 2009 FPS&nbsp;<em>Darkest of Days</em>, although&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>isn't an FPS; rather, it's an ambitious and sprawling mixture of action, strategy, city-building, and sandbox gameplay.</p>

<p>You'll engage in battles in which soldiers are "controlled by a next-gen multi-threaded AI" and animated by "a unique procedural animation system". In those battles, you'll use modern weaponry like machine guns, attack helicopters, and air strikes to "wreak absolute havoc on the battlefield".</p>

<p>The game will also feature base-building elements and real-time strategy gameplay; you'll be able to zoom out and issue orders to your soldiers before joining the fray yourself, watching the plan you've built be executed in real time.</p>




<p><em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>may not be out yet, but its publisher tinyBuild clearly has faith that it's going to be a smash hit. Back in August, the studio announced that a&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingmakers-movie-announced" rel="nofollow">movie is in production</a> in conjunction with movie studio Story Kitchen.</p>

<p>We still don't have a full release date for&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>yet, but given the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tinybuild-financials-2023" rel="nofollow">financial straits tinyBuild appears to be in right now</a>, it likely can't come soon enough. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2109770/Kingmakers/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wishlist the game on Steam right now</a> if you want to keep up with its progress.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 Release Date Moved Forward One Week]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-moved-forward</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-moved-forward-one-week.1052463/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-moved-forward<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Warhorse Studios has moved the&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>release date forward a week, and there are new goodies coming for the game this week as well.</p>

<p>Over <a href="https://x.com/WarhorseStudios/status/1864354217139314820" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on social media platform X</a>, the studio confirms that the game's new release date is February 4th, which is exactly a week before the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-delay" rel="nofollow">originally intended launch date of February 11th</a>.</p>

<p>That should come as a pleasant surprise for&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance&nbsp;</em>fans, especially since the game's original release date technically constituted a delay. It was originally meant for release sometime in 2024.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-early-henry-horse.jpg?itok=2_uzGPdP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-early-henry-horse.jpg?itok=eC1LdW1B 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll now be able to play&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>a whole week early.</figcaption></figure><p>In the release date announcement post, Warhorse also says that more info about&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>is on the way this week, with a new story trailer for the game set to debut later today.</p>

<p>Additionally, we'll also be learning the&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>PC specs this week, as well as "console specs", which presumably refers to what modes the console versions of the game will offer, as well as whether it'll join the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/full-ps5-pro-enhanced-list-launch" rel="nofollow">list of PS5 Pro-enhanced games</a>.</p>

<p>If you're not across&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>, it's the sequel to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-sales-8m" rel="nofollow">hugely successful</a> 2018 RPG&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em>, an open-world adventure that emphasizes realistic combat and historical detail.</p>

<p>The second game will once again revolve around protagonist Henry of Skalitz, which also means that like its predecessor, it'll be set in 15th-century medieval Europe.</p>




<p>As well as bringing back many elements from the first game, including multiple approaches to combat and quest completion,&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>will also feature ranged weaponry like crossbows, as well as firearms.</p>

<p>Lest you think the introduction of new features will cause Warhorse to scale the story back, however, think again; the studio confirmed back in August that&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>'s script <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-script-words" rel="nofollow">contains over two million words</a>.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>when it launches on February 4th for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1771300/Kingdom_Come_Deliverance_II/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/9N4W31HSMVVD" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. If you want to know how the game is shaping up, you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-preview-bigger-better-and-more-approachable" rel="nofollow">take a look at our preview here</a>.</p>
