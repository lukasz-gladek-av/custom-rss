            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced three more SNES games making their way to the Nintendo Switch Online library, and if you're looking for more opportunities to spend time with some of the most iconic platforming mascots around (and Bubsy), then this one's for you.</p>

<p>As a quick reminder, unlike <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-klonoa-mr-driller" rel="nofollow">Game Boy Advance</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/forsaken-64-nintendo-switch-online" rel="nofollow">N64</a> games, SNES titles are available for everyone who subscribes to Nintendo Switch Online, regardless of whether you pick up an Expansion Pack addon or not.</p>

<p>The first game being introduced to the SNES lineup for Nintendo Switch Online this month is&nbsp;<em>Mario &amp; Wario</em>, a puzzler that has never been released in the West before. This one, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-paint-nintendo-switch-online" rel="nofollow">like <em>Mario Paint&nbsp;</em>before it</a>, comes complete with Joy-Con 2 mouse support as well (in fact, it's required to play).</p>

<p>The first of these two is the pun-tastic&nbsp;<em>Bubsy in: Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind</em>, a side-scrolling platformer which stars a mascot who, with the best will in the world, apparently refuses to die despite the industry's best efforts.</p>

<p>As&nbsp;<em>Bubsy&nbsp;</em>games go, this one probably isn't quite as offensive as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/bubsy-paws-on-fire-review-stop-making-bubsy-games" rel="nofollow">some of the little bobcat's other offerings</a>, which isn't a ringing endorsement, but hey - if you've exhausted all of the other Switch Online platformers, this one might kill an hour or two.</p>

<p>Finally, the last game to be added to the SNES contingent of Nintendo Switch Online this month is&nbsp;<em>Fatal Fury Special</em>, a one-on-one fighter that features the cast of&nbsp;<em>Fatal Fury 2</em>, plus new fighters to get to grips with.</p>




<p>It looks as though all three of these games are available to check out via Nintendo Switch Online right now, so if you're a member and you're interested, just fire up your console and you should be able to play them all.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Hyper Light Breaker Development Ending as Dev Suffers Layoffs]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>developer Heart Machine has announced that it's ending development on the game, and that several of its staff members will be laid off as well.</p>

<p>In a statement provided to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/heart-machine-making-layoffs-and-ending-development-on-hyper-light-breaker" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Game Developer</a>, Heart Machine says it intends to "wrap up" work on the open-world roguelike action game, and that as a result, the studio will be "part[ing] ways with a number of talented team members".</p>

<p>According to Heart Machine, this outcome was "the only one available given the circumstances". The developer puts the layoffs and&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker</em>'s development closure down to "shifts in funding, corporate consolidation, and the uncertain environment" faced by many studios of a similar size to itself.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hyper-light-breaker-development-ending-layoffs-attack.jpg?itok=hL6QoUPq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hyper-light-breaker-development-ending-layoffs-attack.jpg?itok=Mg-C2zMG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hyper Light Breaker</em>'s development is coming to a close.</figcaption></figure><p>It's not quite over for&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>just yet, though. Heart Machine also told Game Developer that it intends to leave the game in as "meaningful and as polished and complete" a state as possible prior to ending work on it.</p>

<p>As such, an update for the game is set to arrive in January, which the studio says will attempt to "refine what [it] can, complete key systems, and have the game culminate in a satisfying punctuation point".</p>

<p>However, Heart Machine doesn't clarify whether&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>will be getting a 1.0 release or whether it'll essentially remain an Early Access game in perpetuity. The studio simply says there won't be any more updates or question-and-answer sessions for the game this year.</p>

<p><em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>launched in January this year to a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hyper-light-breaker-fixes-coming" rel="nofollow">mixed response from its players</a>, who cited the game's performance, accessibility issues, and gameplay imbalance as drawbacks. A <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hyper-light-breaker-roadmap-first-update" rel="nofollow">roadmap arrived in February</a> promising to address many of those issues, but it doesn't seem to have turned any fortunes around.</p>




<p>If you'd still like to check out&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker</em>, you can do so right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1534840/Hyper_Light_Breaker/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>. Stay tuned for more.</p>
