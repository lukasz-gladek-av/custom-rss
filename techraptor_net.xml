            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher IO Interactive has announced that upcoming spy adventure <em>007 First Light </em>has been delayed beyond its originally-announced release date.</p><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/007GameIOI/status/2003511022141817016" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">message</a> on social media, the studio reveals that <em>007 First Light </em>will now be released on May 27th next year, which represents a delay of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/007-first-light-release-date" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2642ca01-5e15-44ba-9ed9-26d9d752f67a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">roughly two months</a>. IO says the game is its "most ambitious project to date", and that the delay will allow the devs to ensure the project is up to snuff when it's released.</p><p>Despite the delay, it sounds like development on <em>007 First Light </em>is going smoothly; IO Interactive says the game is "fully playable from beginning to end", so all that needs to be done now is work to "further polish and refine the experience".</p><figure role="group">

<p>If you're awaiting more information about <em>007 First Light</em>, IO Interactive says it'll share more about the project early next year, so you won't have to wait too long. Hopefully, that'll take the sting out of the tail of this delay.</p><p>If you're unfamiliar, <em>007 First Light </em>is an upcoming stealth-action game from IO Interactive, the creator of the <em>Hitman </em>franchise.&nbsp;</p><p>Revealed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/io-interactive-007-first-light" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f80f45ac-0336-4e81-901a-6eb99e901f21" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">earlier this year</a>, the game will seemingly operate along similar lines to the studio's flagship series, placing protagonist James Bond in a series of exotic locales as he sneaks and bluffs his way past the locals in an attempt to "expose a deep conspiracy".</p><p><em>007 First Light </em>takes place towards the beginning of Bond's career; despite the game's name, Bond hasn't yet earned his "00" license to kill, so you'll witness how he does so over the course of <em>First Light</em>'s narrative.</p>
<p><em>007 First Light </em>is now slated for release on May 27th next year. When it arrives, you'll be able to pick it up on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3768760/007_First_Light/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/007-first-light/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/007-first-light/9PJ34M93ZV7Z" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/007-First-Light-2792136.html" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Mike Klubnika and publisher Critical Reflex have revealed that unsettling indie horror game <em>Buckshot Roulette </em>has managed to pass another huge sales milestone, and they've provided an update on the game's console ports as well.</p><p>As revealed <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2835570/view/509600244355303413" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">on Steam</a>, <em>Buckshot Roulette </em>has reached a staggering eight million copies sold since launching back in 2023. Given that it's currently only available via Steam or Itch.io, that's a very impressive milestone indeed, putting the game ahead of heavy hitters like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-5m-update" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a11aa258-e2c1-48df-ac44-95f3a37e9c4a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a>, not to mention <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/octopath-traveler-series-sales-6m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ee685a54-e9eb-48df-87dd-8c1a309e1116" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">the entire <em>Octopath </em>series</a>.</p><p>Klubnika and Critical Reflex describe the new milestone as "insane", emphasizing that there are "whole countries with fewer citizens" than the total count of <em>Buckshot Roulette </em>players. Again, it's worth remembering that the game isn't available on any kind of subscription service and never has been, so this really is sales rather than just players.</p><figure role="group">

<p>In the Steam post, Klubnika and Critical Reflex also provide an update on the console versions of <em>Buckshot Roulette</em>, which were originally due to arrive this year. However, due to "some technical difficulties, mostly because of the engine", the game will be arriving on consoles next year.</p><p>Additionally, over the course of the next year or so, you can look forward to new <em>Buckshot Roulette </em>merchandise hitting the shelves, as well as a physical release for the game's soundtrack in case you want to relive your days trying not to shoot yourself in the face in a grimy basement.</p><p>In case you're unfamiliar, <em>Buckshot Roulette </em>is an indie horror game that combines <em>Inscryption</em>-style atmosphere with Russian roulette gameplay mechanics. As you've probably surmised from the title, the idea is to "play Russian roulette with a 12-gauge", and whether you walk away with your life or not is up to fate.</p>
<p><em>Buckshot Roulette </em>is just one of the unnerving horror games available as part of publisher Critical Reflex's slate; it joins the likes of <em>Mouthwashing </em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-im-not-a-human-500k-sales" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d5684c77-487f-4888-bbf9-847c5d9828ec" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>No, I'm Not a Human</em></a>, along with experimental fare like <em>How Fish Is Made </em>and <em>Carimara</em>.</p><p>You can check out <em>Buckshot Roulette </em>right now on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2835570/Buckshot_Roulette/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Steam</a> and <a href="https://mikeklubnika.itch.io/buckshot-roulette" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Itch.io</a>, and it's slated to come to consoles next year as well.

<p>The certification process for Ubisoft’s Halifax union began last year, but the vote couldn’t be officially counted until Ubisoft responded, according to CTV News.</p><p>The publication goes on to say that Ubisoft dropped the challenges it had for the Halifax union after “a few hearings”. Employees from European Ubisoft unions, particularly those based in France, have apparently given their support to Huffman and the Halifax arm.</p><p>Ubisoft Halifax’s move comes after Bethesda subsidiary and legendary <em>Doom</em> developer id Software <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/id-software-union" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="798f9a5e-70df-4a38-b29c-fcb262d46b24" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">voted to unionize earlier this month</a>, and after <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> behemoth Rockstar was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rockstar-union-busting-accusation-gta-6" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2fb963bf-6dd1-47b3-bfbd-3f16511b3076" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">accused of union-busting</a> following the firing of several employees involved in union activity back in November.</p><p>It also follows layoffs at Ubisoft earlier this year, with <em>The Division</em> developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/massive-entertainment-ubisoft-layoffs" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="eb337fd6-aaaa-412a-8249-337dc274de4e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Massive Entertainment</a> and <em>Trials</em> studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-layoffs-redlynx-restructuring" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c40ca2ba-0c2c-453f-a503-eb81293d2704" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">RedLynx</a> both being hit by restructuring efforts. The studio has also confirmed that tentpole release <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> won’t be getting a second expansion, bucking a trend that began with 2017’s <em>Origins</em>.</p><figure role="group">

<p>We’ll have to wait and see whether other Ubisoft studios decide to follow Halifax’s example and unionize, but with jobs across the industry seemingly less secure than they’ve ever been, it’s hard to imagine how unionization could be anything but a boon for Ubisoft employees.
