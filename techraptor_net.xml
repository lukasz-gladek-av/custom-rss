</figure>
<p>Roger Jr. completes the three characters we know about so far, and he'll be making his <em>Tekken 8 </em>debut in fall. No more specific release timings were announced for any of the characters, but we'll probably learn exactly when they're due as their releases near.</p><p>Finally, there's one more mystery character due to debut in <em>Tekken 8 </em>as part of this third season pass, although Bandai Namco is keeping its cards close to its chest with regards to who exactly that fighter might be. Stay tuned for more on that!</p><p>A new stage will also be introduced in winter alongside said fighter, and if you pick up the <em>Tekken 8 </em>Season 3 Pass when it launches on February 9th (or 10th depending on your timezone), you'll get extra character costumes for some of <em>Tekken 8</em>'s most iconic fighters.</p><p>News of <em>Tekken 8</em>'s latest season pass comes just under two months after franchise legend Katsuhiro Harada <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/katsuhiro-harada-tekken-leaving-bandai-namco" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="06cf8166-bdf9-443a-b396-5dacadaa7eb4" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">announced his departure from Bandai Namco</a>, although he said at the time that he's been handing down his responsibilities to the <em>Tekken </em>team for the last "four to five years".</p>
<p><em>Tekken 8 </em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1778820/TEKKEN_8/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/tekken-8/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/tekken-8/9PPSM14VKCLW" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Reports are emerging that long-awaited MMORPG <em>Ashes of Creation </em>has been canceled amid mass layoffs among its development team, with former staff members at developer Intrepid Studios pointing to resignations, firings, and chaos at the company.</p><p>Speaking <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7423531204198436864?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7423531204198436864%2C7423541468151140352%29&amp;replyUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7423531204198436864%2C7423623021862580224%29&amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287423541468151140352%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7423531204198436864%29&amp;dashReplyUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287423623021862580224%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7423531204198436864%29" rel="nofollow">on LinkedIn</a>, former Intrepid communications director Margaret Krohn says the <em>Ashes of Creation </em>development team, which she describes as "the heart and soul of the product", were laid off en masse, and in her <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/margaretkrohn_well-this-chapter-has-come-to-a-close-activity-7423531204198436864-XsUB" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">original post</a>, she says the layoffs weren't "what [she] expected".</p><p>It's not just Krohn, either. As spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/mmo/2-days-after-promising-it-was-still-worthy-of-your-investment-the-most-successful-kickstarter-mmo-ever-was-canceled-and-its-team-laid-off-the-developers-and-staff-acted-in-good-faith-and-deserved-better/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, former Intrepid creative director Steven Sharif (who's also one of the studio's original founders) told the <em>Ashes of Creation </em>Discord server that control of Intrepid "shifted away from [him]", and that he resigned "in protest".</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Things are not OK with <em>Ashes of Creation</em>, it seems.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Sharif goes on to say that after he resigned, "much of the senior leadership team" followed suit, and then Intrepid Studios' board decided to "proceed with a mass layoff".</p><p>In closing, Sharif says the development team "acted in good faith and deserved better than the uncertainty they are now facing", but that he can't elaborate any further "due to ongoing legal and governance matters".</p><p>Intrepid Studios itself hasn't commented on this situation, but just last week, the studio posted <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/4124950/view/512981748906197719" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">an update</a> to <em>Ashes of Creation</em>'s Steam page, promising a development update on February 13th and pledging to "outline Q1 plans and next steps".</p><p>That may not sound much like a game that has been canceled, and it's true that there's been no official word that <em>Ashes of Creation</em>'s development is ending, but it's hard to imagine how Intrepid could continue if its entire development team has indeed been let go.</p>
<p>If you need a reminder, <em>Ashes of Creation </em>is an MMO that was Kickstarted back in 2017, pledging to offer features like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ashes-of-creation-gameplay-video-shows-impressive-player-run-town" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="186760a2-cafa-435f-9785-d6ef92342282" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">player-run towns</a>, an innovative <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ashes-of-creation-features-innovative-story-arc-system-tower-of-carphin-in-new-gameplay" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4fbf13c0-770f-4e1e-a8c7-85bd1fa76b77" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">player-driven Story Arc system</a>, and an extensive range of combat archetypes to choose from.</p><p>The game was released in Early Access back in December following a number of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ashes-of-creation-shows-fighter-archetype-in-action-ahead-of-alpha-2" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6056f7a8-f458-478e-9379-ea63fef47ffb" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">alpha playtests</a>, which makes the idea of its cancellation doubly strange; after all, it hasn't even been two months since <em>Ashes of Creation </em>was released.</p><p>Still, the game's Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4124950/Ashes_of_Creation/#app_reviews_hash" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">reviews</a> have dropped to Mostly Negative in recent days, with players warning others off buying a game they consider "officially canceled" or "a scam" following its development team's departure.</p><p>You can check out <em>Ashes of Creation </em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4124950/Ashes_of_Creation/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC via Steam</a> if you'd like, although I'd caution against doing so until the situation is a little clearer.

<p><em>Cairn </em>is the latest project from The Game Bakers, whose previous efforts include boss rush bullet hell action game <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/furi" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="68c7153c-22c9-4290-a476-9bdf9c4a6ecc" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Furi</em></a><em> </em>and co-op RPG <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/haven" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ebce69ab-0435-4600-82ab-b692ec1e416a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Haven</em></a>, and it continues the studio's track record of not repeating itself with subsequent releases.</p><p>The studio describes <em>Cairn </em>as a "survival-climber" in which your goal is to plan a route of ascension up the "unforgiving" Mount Kami, checking your resources and plans to make sure you've got enough to make each climb.</p><p>Along the way, you'll discover the stories of both the mountain itself and protagonist Aava, meeting "unexpected companions" as you go, as well as hearing from the people left at the mountain's base.</p><p>You can check out a trailer that shows off the kind of thing you can expect from <em>Cairn </em>right here.</p>
<p><em>Cairn </em>isn't the only climbing sim to have been released in recent years; it joins the likes of Don't Nod's meditative <em>Jusant </em>(which, sadly, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-nod-financials-first-half-2024" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b15eacd1-370f-48d4-a7cd-49ccd57bc1ab" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">underperformed for the studio</a>) and "friendslop" multiplayer game <em>Peak </em>(which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/peak-2m-sales" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="39196bca-464e-4fee-9f7e-6c78d8d44d76" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">very much did not</a>).</p><p>If you'd like to join in the fun, you can check out <em>Cairn </em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1588550/Cairn/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a> and <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10014085" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a>.
