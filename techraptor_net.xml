            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Giants Software has revealed that&nbsp;<em>Farming Simulator 25&nbsp;</em>sales have reached a major milestone since the game launched just over a year ago.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Farming Simulator 25&nbsp;</em>has hit four million sales across all platforms, which puts it ahead of fairly major hits like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-2-5m-worldwide" rel="nofollow">Konami's&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake</a>&nbsp;(although it's still trailing major breakout hit&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-5m-update" rel="nofollow"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a>).</p>

<p>Giants isn't slowing down with content for&nbsp;<em>Farming Simulator 25</em>, either; a second season pass has been released today, and it promises lots of new content throughout the rest of the year, including a brand new JCB tractor that's ready to claim right now if you own the pass.</p>

Never change.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as the aforementioned vehicle,&nbsp;<em>Farming Simulator 25</em>'s Year 2 Season Pass will also bring a major DLC pack somewhere between January and March, followed by another between April and June.</p>

<p>They'll be chased up by a major expansion that will launch between October and December this year, which will introduce a brand new map and more to the farming simulator. It sounds like there will be plenty of players waiting to greet that pack as well.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Farming Simulator 25</em>, it's...well...it's a farming simulator, and it's this year's iteration of Giants Software's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/farming-simulator-22-sales-surpass-3-million-units-globally" rel="nofollow">successful</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/farming-simulator-15-coming-consoles" rel="nofollow">long-running</a> series.</p>

<p>Released back in November last year, the game managed to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/farming-simulator-25-sales-2-million-one-week" rel="nofollow">rack up two million sales for itself</a> within its first week of launch, which means it's picked up another two million in the intervening year. That's not bad at all, especially for what remains an essentially niche title.</p>
