            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-rogue-trader-1m-sales<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Owlcat has announced that its grimdark CRPG&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Rogue Trader&nbsp;</em>has managed to hit a major sales milestone just over a year after the game's initial 1.0 release.</p>

<p>According to a press release,&nbsp;<em>Rogue Trader&nbsp;</em>has crossed one million sales across all of the platforms on which it's currently available, i.e. PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

<p>Studio head Oleg Shpilchevskiy says the milestone is a "sign" that Owlcat is "working in the right direction", and that he wants his team to "bring more stories to the endless universe of&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k</em>".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-rogue-trader-sales-1m-cassia.jpg?itok=lbT7y2F9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-rogue-trader-sales-1m-cassia.jpg?itok=KYWndPTW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Warhammer 40k: Rogue Trader&nbsp;</em>has hit an important sales milestone for Owlcat.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Rogue Trader</em>, it's a CRPG set in the grim darkness of the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k&nbsp;</em>universe. As the title suggests, you play one of the titular Rogue Traders, who are essentially Imperium-sanctioned explorers and merchants given special permission to travel the galaxy.</p>

<p>As you'd expect from an Owlcat game, you'll meet a number of companions who represent several of the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k</em>&nbsp;setting's races and character archetypes. Companions include a Navis Nobilite navigator, a tech-priest, and a warrior from the Adeptus Sororitas, among many others.</p>

<p>Released <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-rogue-trader-alpha-goes-live-today" rel="nofollow">in alpha in 2022</a>, the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-rogue-trader-release-date" rel="nofollow">scored a full 1.0 release</a> on PC and consoles in December 2023, and a number of updates both <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-rogue-trader-update-biggest-yet" rel="nofollow">big</a> and small have been released for&nbsp;<em>Rogue Trader&nbsp;</em>in the intervening months.</p>




<p>In September last year,&nbsp;<em>Rogue Trader</em>'s first DLC,&nbsp;<em>Void Shadows</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-rogue-trader-dlc-void-shadows-delayed" rel="nofollow">was released</a>. It added lots of content to the game, including a new Death Cult assassin companion, new quests, and more.</p>

<p>Another major expansion,&nbsp;<em>Lex Imperialis</em>, is currently in the works, bringing a new companion from the Adeptus Arbite, which you can essentially think of as the Imperium's police force. Naturally, you can also look forward to new areas, mechanics, and plenty more in that expansion.</p>

<p>You can grab&nbsp;<em>Rogue Trader&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2186680/Warhammer_40000_Rogue_Trader/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10008102/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader/9p30bfhz1bkn" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bohemia-interactive-revenue-up-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>DayZ&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Arma&nbsp;</em>studio Bohemia Interactive has reported an "extremely successful 2024", contrasting against what the Czech studio calls the "global stagnation" of the gaming industry at large.</p>

<p>In a press release, Bohemia says its revenue jumped 34% in 2024, reaching a total of $60.8 million. The company managed to sell 4.85 million copies of its games across PC and consoles last year, with player numbers hitting 17 million around the world.</p>

<p>According to Bohemia, 99% of those sales came from "abroad" rather than from its native Czech Republic, with the US enjoying a 42% market share. Bohemia also reports "significant growth" in Ukraine, which saw player numbers doubling year-on year, and points to Brazil as a market of "growing importance".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bohemia-interactive-financials-2024-dayz-frostline.jpg?itok=FcH4lApj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bohemia-interactive-financials-2024-dayz-frostline.jpg?itok=mHDeG0uf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>17 million players played Bohemia Interactive's games, including the likes of&nbsp;<em>DayZ </em>and its&nbsp;<em>Frostline&nbsp;</em>DLC,&nbsp;last year.</figcaption></figure><p>Bohemia co-founder&nbsp;Slavomír Pavlíček says 2024 "exceeded all our expectations" and that&nbsp;<em>Arma Reforger</em>, which launched on PS5 in December last year, "currently has no competition in its genre" on Sony's platform, which contributed to Bohemia's success.</p>

<p>The studio also says that fans can look forward to "interesting game surprises" over the coming year, including the "intensive development" of&nbsp;<em>Arma 4</em>, which is now expected to launch sometime in 2027.</p>

<p>More games under the Bohemia Incubator program, through which Bohemia gives smaller teams funding and publishing support for their games, will also be introduced this year, with action platformer&nbsp;<em>Brute Horse&nbsp;</em>and sandbox RPG&nbsp;<em>SkyVerse&nbsp;</em>both on Bohemia's 2024 infographic.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bohemia-interactive-financials-2024-infographic.jpg?itok=SzUDqc8D 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bohemia-interactive-financials-2024-infographic.jpg?itok=nUtvCWyy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bohemia had a pretty good 2024, all things considered.</figcaption></figure><p>The "global stagnation" of which Bohemia speaks has seen a lot of game studios caught up in its field, with major studios like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Sony</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-interactive-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Take-Two</a> laying off staff members, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown" rel="nofollow">shutting down studios</a>, and even <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds" rel="nofollow">canceling live service games shortly after release</a> in 2024.</p>

<p>It's fair to say that Bohemia's growth certainly goes against the grain in that regard, although given the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-ceo-payrise-layoffs" rel="nofollow">eye-watering cash</a> some of these companies' C-suites <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-ceo-25-million-income-layoffs" rel="nofollow">took home for themselves</a> last year and the year before, I'd question whether those decisions were, in fact, made due to industry trends.</p>

<p>In any case, we'll bring you more on what Bohemia Interactive gets up to in 2025 as and when we get it, so stay tuned for that.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-update-limited-time-mode</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-update-promises-new-limited-time-mode-and-more.1087752/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-update-limited-time-mode<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has released a new&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>update, and it comes complete with adjustments to the game's modes and battle system, as well as a new limited-time mode (although that technically hasn't arrived yet).</p>

<p>Somewhat confusingly, in the update's official <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/dragon-ball/news/update-dragon-ball-sparking-zero-changes-and-adjustments-features-and-battle" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">patch notes</a>, Bandai Namco says the Legendary Warrior Face-Off mode "has been added for a limited time", but players are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SparkingZero/comments/1i6498f/where_is_the_new_gamemode_at/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reporting</a> that they're <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SparkingZero/comments/1i6446m/so_how_can_i_access_legendary_warrior_faceoff/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">unable</a> to access it, even though the update has been applied.</p>

<p>However, other players are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SparkingZero/comments/1i6498f/comment/m8940nx/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">speculating</a>&nbsp;that the new mode will arrive alongside the game's first major DLC, which is currently available for those who forked out for 72 hours' access but which is not on general release yet. It's set to arrive later this week.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-update-new-mode-gamma.jpg?itok=HD1MeMgG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-update-new-mode-gamma.jpg?itok=RPGUa0zH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The new&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>mode will probably arrive later this week alongside the game's first DLC.</figcaption></figure><p>Per a <a href="https://x.com/BandaiNamcoUS/status/1880255701613711711" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Bandai Namco's X page (which also doesn't confirm the release date for the mode), Legendary Warrior Face-Off will allow you to "challenge yourself against characters with sky-high power levels", with the first being iconic Saiyan Broly.</p>

<p>The patch notes clarify that you "cannot select this mode outside of the period" during which it's available, although rather unhelpfully, that period isn't specified.</p>

<p>The wording of Bandai Namco's post, however, suggests that there will be other warriors against whom you can face off, so presumably, this mode will cycle in and out periodically, offering different characters to fight.</p>

<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</em>'s first DLC, that's due out on January 24th, so that's probably also when Legendary Warrior Face-Off will become available. The "Hero of Justice" pack adds a number of new characters, including the likes of Gamma, new Gohan variants, and more.</p>




<p><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>is the latest game in the&nbsp;<em>Budokai Tenkaichi&nbsp;</em>sub-series of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball&nbsp;</em>games and the first to bear the series' original Japanese name in the West.</p>

<p>The game launched in October to the&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball&nbsp;</em>series' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-series-best-steam-debut" rel="nofollow">best Steam debut ever</a>, going on to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-sales-3m" rel="nofollow">sell three million copies</a> across all platforms within its first day on sale.</p>
