            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/echtra-games-shut-down-torchlight-3<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Echtra Games, the studio responsible for 2020's&nbsp;<em>Torchlight 3</em>, has been closed down by its parent company Zynga, presumably leaving its as-yet-unannounced cross-platform action RPG abandoned for eternity.</p>

<p>Per an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-hunters-publisher-shutters-studio-founded-by-torchlight-diablo-creator-before-it-could-announce-its-new-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">IGN report</a>, Echtra's shutdown is part of a "strategic realignment of [Zynga's] resources and priorities", which is pretty typical corporate-speak that generally appears to mean "the studio wasn't making us any money and wasn't likely to in future".</p>

<p>Echtra's only game was&nbsp;<em>Torchlight 3</em>, which began life as a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/torchlight-frontiers-release-date-wont-be-in-2019" rel="nofollow">pseudo-MMORPG</a> by the name of&nbsp;<em>Torchlight Frontiers</em>. Eventually, however,&nbsp;<em>Frontiers</em>' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/torchlight-frontiers-torched-torchlight-3-rises-from-free-to-play-ashes" rel="nofollow">development scope shifted</a>, and the project became&nbsp;<em>Torchlight 3&nbsp;</em>instead, with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/torchlight-3-release-date-announced-for-next-month" rel="nofollow">release</a> moving from publisher Perfect World's Arc platform to Steam and consoles (and later the Switch).</p>

<p>Several months after that, in January 2022, Zynga itself would be acquired by&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-acquires-zynga-to-strengthen-mobile-gaming-division" rel="nofollow"><em>GTA&nbsp;</em>IP holder Take-Two for $12.7 billion</a>, which was the most expensive gaming acquisition until Microsoft's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-buys-activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick-staying-as-ceo" rel="nofollow">purchase of Activision Blizzard</a> just a few days later.</p>

<p>When Echtra was acquired by Zynga, the company said its new acquisition was working on a "new, yet to be announced RPG for cross-platform play in partnership with Zynga's NaturalMotion studio".</p>

<p>That project was never announced in full, and it now looks like it never will be, unless work on the game is transferred to another studio within Zynga. We'll have to wait and see, I suppose.</p>

<p>Other studios to shut down in recent months include&nbsp;<em>Condemned&nbsp;</em>and <i>Shadow of War&nbsp;</i>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monolith-productions-and-more-reportedly-closed-by-wb-games" rel="nofollow">Monolith</a>, as well as the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-40m" rel="nofollow">Seattle NetEase studio</a> responsible for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>,&nbsp;<em>Risk of Rain 2&nbsp;</em>studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/risk-of-rain-2-hopoo-games-valve" rel="nofollow">Hopoo Games</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-and-closes-studio-making-it" rel="nofollow">EA studio Cliffhanger Games</a>, which had been working on a&nbsp;<em>Black Panther&nbsp;</em>game.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-60fps-switch-2</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-60fps-switch-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has revealed that the performance update coming to&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>on Switch 2 will see the game running at what appears to be a silky-smooth 60fps.</p>

<p>As documented by the folks at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-footage-shows-60fps-gameplay-for-switch-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Life</a>, the news was posted on the Nintendo Today news app, and while several people have posted footage of the game running at 60fps on social media platforms, it's probably best to watch the footage on the original app if you can thanks to the "wonders" of compression.</p>

<p>In essence, the update shows&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>running as they arguably always should have done, and hopefully, this will convince more folks to love the games like I do. That story really shouldn't be missed.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-60fps-sneaking.jpg?itok=c3MI7LaO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-60fps-sneaking.jpg?itok=aRApZD4J 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet </em>(pictured here on the original Switch) will look much nicer on the Switch 2, and they'll run better too.</figcaption></figure><p>Not only will&nbsp;<em>Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>run smoother on the Switch 2, but they'll also look much sharper, if the Nintendo Today footage is anything to go by. If you haven't already checked the games out, it looks like Switch 2 will be the place to do it.</p>

<p><em>Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>are just two of the games getting <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-upgrades-switch-1" rel="nofollow">free Switch 2 performance patches</a> on the console's launch day (that's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">this Thursday</a>). Others include&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Link's Awakening</em>, as well as&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>,&nbsp;<em>Arms</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury</em>.</p>

<p>These updates are distinct from Nintendo's Switch 2 Edition initiative, which will charge you a fee to upgrade your game to a Switch 2-native version with more substantial visual and performance improvements.</p>

<p>Games getting Switch 2 Edition versions include&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-switch-2-500k-sales" rel="nofollow">Level-5's&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</em></a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-confirmed-sales</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-nightreign-duo-expeditions-confirmed-as-sales-top-3-5m.1205358/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-confirmed-sales<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer FromSoftware and publisher Bandai Namco have announced that one of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>'s most-requested features will be coming to the game at a later date, and that a new sales milestone has been reached as well.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1929780347576750367" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on X, the two studios celebrate&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>reaching 3.5 million sales across both its physical and digital versions, which means it's amassed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">another 1.5m sales in the last few days</a>.</p>

<p>Perhaps more importantly, however, in a <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1929780349380223096" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">followup message</a>, FromSoftware and Bandai Namco confirm that&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>will be getting duo expeditions at some point in the future. At the moment, it's only possible to play as a solo adventurer or in a group of three, unless one of your squad leaves partway through a run.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-sales-3.5m-duos-roundtable-hold.jpg?itok=vm578ufc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-sales-3.5m-duos-roundtable-hold.jpg?itok=VibhdlM_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Duos are finally on their way to&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as duos, FromSoftware has also confirmed that future&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>updates will add "enhanced fights against existing Nightlords starting this month", although the studio doesn't explain exactly what that will entail.</p>

<p>Of course, the game will also be getting DLC "later this year", and although we're not sure what that will include either, I'd be surprised if it didn't add new minibosses, new map locations, and new Nightlords to take down at the very least.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, it's a multiplayer spinoff of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-30m" rel="nofollow">wildly successful</a>&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>. The game takes the core combat of its bigger sibling and transposes it into a roguelike environment, where the goal is to gear up, level up, and fight bosses before taking down a bigger boss at the end of each run.</p>




<p>Updates to improve&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>'s gameplay and infrastructure are already underway. Just yesterday, FromSoftware <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-update-solo-revival" rel="nofollow">released an update for the game</a> that included the ability to revive during solo play, among other improvements.</p>

<p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2622380/ELDEN_RING_NIGHTREIGN/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/elden-ring-nightreign-deluxe-edition/9NDVX8HSXGLR" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.
