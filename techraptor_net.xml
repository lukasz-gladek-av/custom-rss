            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizard of the Coast's and Archetype Entertainment's <em>Exodus</em> TTRPG is now out. This tabletop adaptation of the AAA sci-fi game, announced with <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/upcoming-sci-fi-game-exodus-is-getting-official-ttrpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">limited info in 2024</a>, is shipping out, and it provides a spacefaring twist on the rules of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>.</p>

<h2>The Exodus TTRPG Release</h2>

<p>On their official webpage, Wizards of the Coast are selling two <em>Exodus</em> TTRPG books. The <em>Traveler's Handbook</em> contains rules for both players and Game Masters to help them get started. The <em>Exodus Encyclopedia</em> contains rules on alien creatures, beings that inhabit abandoned starships, and uncharted worlds.</p>

The game's creative head is James Ohlen, a game industry veteran whose work includes the original <em>Baldur's Gate</em>, <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em>, and <em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</em>. Aside from some pre-rendered trailers and an episode in the Prime Video anthology series, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/secret-level-brings-videogame-anthology-to-prime-video" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Secret Level</em></a>, not much else is known about its core gameplay or its setting.</p>

<p>The <em>Exodus</em> TTRPG helps shed some light in this regard. According to a deep dive <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/exodus/dnd-launch" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">by Wargamer</a>, players take on the role of Travelers. They are a community of space explorers who seek riches and advanced technology to bring back to their home world. The catch is that there is time dilation with FTL travel, meaning by the time they return home, years will have passed.</p>

<p>As for the RPG system at its core, it's <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Fifth Edition with some sci-fi tweaks. Gameplay caps at level 10 instead of level 20, but players' stats increase faster thanks to a Constellation tattoo mechanic. The game features four classes, each with two subclasses. Lastly, magic and magic items are replaced with substantive equipment, gear, augmentations, and spaceships.</p>

<p>The <em>Exodus</em> TTRPG is the latest part of a transmedia marketing approach to the Exodus game. This transmedia approach includes a novel, and the Star Heist actual play series.</p>

<p>The <em>Traveler's Handbook</em> is available at an MSRP of $28.55. The <em>Exodus Encyclopedia</em> is being sold for $35.99. Alternatively, the two-book bundle is available for $64.54.</p>
