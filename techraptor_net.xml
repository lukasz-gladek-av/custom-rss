            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bethesda and MachineGames have announced the&nbsp;<em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle&nbsp;</em>PS5 release date, with the legendary adventurer's latest jaunt coming to Sony's console next month.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://x.com/PlayStation/status/1904186452851994817" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the official PlayStation X account,&nbsp;<em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle&nbsp;</em>launches for PS5 on April 17th. The game is already available for PC and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

<p>We're not yet sure whether the PS5 version of <i>Great Circle&nbsp;</i>will feature any kind of DualSense haptic support, but given that the PS5 version of racer&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 5&nbsp;</em><a href="https://support.forzamotorsport.net/hc/en-us/articles/39144665637651-Forza-Horizon-5-on-PS5-FAQ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">does boast</a> some nice DualSense haptics, it wouldn't be unreasonable to expect something similar from MachineGames' latest.</p>

The first three - namely&nbsp;<em>Pentiment</em>,&nbsp;<em>Grounded</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Sea of Thieves&nbsp;</em>- were announced for PlayStation <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sea-of-thieves-grounded-and-pentiment-officially-announced-for-playstation-platforms" rel="nofollow">back in February last year</a>.</p>

<p>Following that, it was revealed that&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 5&nbsp;</em>would be coming to PlayStation, and rumors currently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-xbox-exclusive-games-coming-to-playstation/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">abound</a> that the&nbsp;<em>Gears of War&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>games could be about to get themselves PlayStation ports as well.</p>

<p>Just in case you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>, it's a first-person action-adventure game developed by&nbsp;<em>Wolfenstein: The New Order&nbsp;</em>studio MachineGames. The game casts you as (who else?) Indiana Jones, who's investigating a characteristically complex mystery involving a cat mummy.</p>

<p>As you'd expect from an&nbsp;<em>Indiana Jones&nbsp;</em>game, you'll be visiting some pretty exotic locations throughout the course of the game, including Vatican City, Thailand, and more places besides.</p>




<p>Gameplay-wise,&nbsp;<em>Great Circle&nbsp;</em>blends scrappy melee combat, stealth, and exploration, and it's spread across a series of hub levels with plenty of distractions and sidequests to pursue. If you haven't played this one yet, you're in for a treat.</p>

<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a> on April 17th, and it's also currently available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2677660/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Great_Circle/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/games/store/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/9n8fq28z6qx3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.
