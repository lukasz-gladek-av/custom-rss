            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom is releasing a new&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>update tomorrow (or today, depending on where you are!), and the studio has released the patch notes ahead of the update's launch, showing what kind of endgame content you can expect.</p>

<p>Back in late July, Capcom revealed that it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-endgame-august" rel="nofollow">bumping up</a> some of the monster-hunting RPG's endgame content to mid-August, seemingly in response to criticisms from players regarding the game's lack of same. According to the patch notes, that's exactly what you can expect, too.</p>

<p>The patch will run anywhere from 2GB to 6GB depending on which version of&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>you have, and it'll land tomorrow at 2:30am UTC (that's around 7:30pm Pacific or about 10:30 Eastern tonight).</p>

They'll take the form of nine-star quests, and you'll also find "regular and tempered versions of Rey Dau and Nu Udra" appearing in the Wounded Hollow if you reach that rank.</p>

<p>Monsters at HR 100 or higher have had their appearance rate adjusted, and standard monsters have had their appearance rate raised slightly. Not only that, but you'll find a new Glowing Stone appraisal item that will grant you "a talisman with random skill attributes" when appraised.</p>

<p>A number of other changes are coming as part of this update too, and if you want to see what those are, you can check out the <a href="https://info.monsterhunter.com/wilds/update/en-us/Ver.1.021.00.00.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">full patch notes right here</a>. It's worth doing so, as there are a number of improvements that could make your experience just a little bit better.</p>




<p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>is the latest game in the&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>series. Released <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-release-date" rel="nofollow">in February</a>, the game was initially a phenomenal success for Capcom, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-10m" rel="nofollow">selling 10 million copies</a> within the space of around a month and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-steam-player-record" rel="nofollow">breaking records for its developer</a> into the bargain.</p>

<p>Since then, however, sales have <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/monster-hunter/capcom-admits-monster-hunter-wilds-sales-are-soft-as-pc-issues-persist-but-really-theyve-plummeted-barely-beating-2021s-monster-hunter-rise-and-losing-to-8-other-old-games-including-devil-may-cry-5/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">slowed</a>, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">recent reviews</a> on Steam have dipped to Mostly Negative, with players decrying a lack of performance updates and simplified gameplay (although reviews seem fairly heavily weighted towards the former).</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Remedy "Unsatisfied" With FBC: Firebreak Launch Sales]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-fbc-firebreak-launch-sales-financials</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/remedy-unsatisfied-with-fbc-firebreak-launch-sales.1267914/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Control&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake&nbsp;</em>studio Remedy has released its financial statement for the first half of the 2025 fiscal year, and the company has admitted it's not happy with the launch sales of its latest game&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=6303448b-0b96-4d9c-a724-ca82e23faae5" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">statement</a>, Remedy CEO Tero Virtala says that despite a 43% increase in revenue over last year's first half, as well as "an initial accrual from subscription service agreements with Sony and Microsoft",&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>"underperformed" on Steam, which Virtala describes as "the primary consumer sales channel on PC" for the game.</p>

<p>According to Virtala,&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>'s underperformance is due to its "initial onboarding experience and mission structure", which, when taken together, "resulted in high early player drop-offs and an influx of negative reviews". These led to what Virtala calls a "rocky launch" for the game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fbc-firebreak-launch-sales-remedy-financials-shooting.jpg?itok=165J9pCp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fbc-firebreak-launch-sales-remedy-financials-shooting.jpg?itok=aqHnfjNJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>FBC: Firebreak</em>'s initial sales haven't impressed developer and publisher Remedy.</figcaption></figure><p>Despite these initial wobbles, however, Virtala says he believes that&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>is "a solid game to build on", and that the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fbc-firebreak-whats-next" rel="nofollow">major update coming in September</a>&nbsp;will serve as "the next key step" for the multiplayer shooter. Given that the game is currently <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2272540/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sitting at just 16 players</a> on Steam, with a 22-player 24-hour peak, let's hope Remedy can turn things around.</p>

<p>With regards to the studio's other upcoming games, Virtala says progress is brisk.&nbsp;<em>Control 2</em>, which Remedy says will move in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alan-wake-2-sales-control-2-action-rpg" rel="nofollow">a more action RPG-wards direction</a>, is "on track towards meeting its next milestones", Virtala says, with development currently focused on various core gameplay systems and world design elements.</p>

<p>As for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/max-payne-remakes-control-spinoff-remedy" rel="nofollow">upcoming&nbsp;<em>Max Payne&nbsp;</em>remakes</a>, they're still "in full production", and Remedy's collaboration with&nbsp;<em>Max Payne&nbsp;</em>IP holder Rockstar "remains close and productive", which is always nice to hear. Let's hope we get more info about those soon.</p>

<p>Remedy also says that sales for the original&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em>crossed the five million mark during this year's second quarter, following the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-control-franchise-rights" rel="nofollow">transferral of the franchise rights</a> from original owner 505 Games last year.</p>

You can also play it as part of a PS Plus or Game Pass subscription if you prefer.</p>
