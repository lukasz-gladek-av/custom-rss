            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p dir="ltr">As <em>Frosthaven</em>'s Digital Edition continues to move through the early access lifecycle, its latest update, Legacy of the Algox, brings with it three new heroes, an Algox storyline, a new pet, and all kinds of quality-of-life improvements. TechRaptor sat down with Snapshot Games' Game Director Hristo Petkov to discuss the update, see gameplay from the new expansion, and discuss how they've been reacting to fan-based feedback during the early access period.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Contents of the <em>Frosthaven </em>Update</h2><p dir="ltr">Jumping straight into the update, Petkov briefly highlighted each of the enhancements coming to the game. "What we're introducing in this patch is three new heroes; <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/frosthaven-all-advanced-classes-guide" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1fe9e70e-c0f4-441c-8fae-695d76f43e05" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">the total in the board game is 17</a>, and with this update, we'll be at 14."</p><p dir="ltr">Petkov also explained that with the three main branches of the <em>Frosthaven </em>story, "we're introducing the second. The third brand will be in the next update, which will be sometime in April, and the final chapter will be in the final release."</p><picture>

  </picture><p dir="ltr">What won't be releasing with the update, but shortly after, is an overhaul of the networking solution for <em>Frosthaven</em>. With a variety of tests, the team has created a more stable online experience using Epic Online Services.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><em>Legacy of the Algox</em></h2><p dir="ltr">The Legacy of the Algox story will follow the culture of the Algox and the warring between the two different clans of yeti-like creatures, the Snowspeakers and Icespeakers. "Both of these clans have their problems with each other, and you need to help them resolve these issues.</p><p dir="ltr">"There's decision-making from the side of the player on how to approach these problems. We used this to create replayability, as there are generally three ways to solve the problem, each with its own missions"</p><p dir="ltr">One of these decisions comes after Scenario 4 of the new campaign content, when you need to make a decision on which tribe you're siding with; whichever one you side with, you'll unlock that class as a playable one. The spoiler-free names for these classes are Snowflake and Fist.</p><p dir="ltr">For anyone worried about missing out on a character, Petkov immediately followed up to explain, "At the end of this campaign, you unlock the other class."</p><p dir="ltr">In terms of campaign content, this update is also bringing with it "a lot of new stuff. New side scenarios, items, and so on."</p><picture>

  </picture><h2 dir="ltr"><em>Frosthaven's </em>Infuser Is Powerful But Has A Learning Curve</h2><p dir="ltr">Getting to see one of the new classes getting added to the game, we jumped into a scenario with the Infuser as one of our party members. "The Infuser has persistent effects that stay for the whole battle. When she plays an infusion, it has a persistent effect and a trigger effect.</p><p dir="ltr">"The trigger effect triggers when you play it for the first time, but triggers every time you play a new infusion. If you play one of these effects, for example, 'Attack for 3,' but you play a second infusion that heals it, it also triggers the attack of the previous one. If you play a third infusion, it will activate itself and the previous two."</p><p dir="ltr">The important part of playing this class is learning the different combo effects that you can begin to chain together, and how to best layer those effects over one another.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir="ltr">Player Feedback for Better or Worse</h2><p dir="ltr">Throughout our discussion, one of the topics that continued to be highlighted was just how much the team at Snapshot Games was paying attention to their fanbase. <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/frosthavens-video-game-adaptation-creates-no-fuss-experience-at-sgf-2025" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2d7063e8-3c90-48be-a660-2a7afffa5e50" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">From playing it last year at SGF to today</a>, I could see how much added polish there was in the game. Petkov also highlighted a number of UI changes that had been made, and that there were still hundreds of icon improvements they had yet to implement.</p><picture>

  </picture><p dir="ltr">A constant theme of our discussion was all of the little ways that the game had been shaped with the input of the community. I was interested to learn how the team balances those community requests alongside the standard development roadmap, and when the community might be asking too much.</p><p dir="ltr">Petkov explained that they thought about these in a few categories. The first of which is when something is technically broken, or the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/frosthaven-review" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9f351387-1805-4afa-833a-e32039d2d562" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">mechanic doesn't work as it does in the board game</a>. In this case, "the community is right, they are the board game fans. They do want things to happen similarly, so the tricky part is to implement what they want without making the game extremely tedious."</p><p dir="ltr">Some examples of tedium that he brought up were players who want more control over the game, being allowed to move the enemies or calculate their AI, "but if we do that, the game will interrupt you all the time. Especially in multiplayer, this would be terrible."</p><p dir="ltr">An example of UI optimization that the team is working on for a future patch is how to reduce UI pop-ups when returning to the outpost and how to make sure what's contained on the screen is the distilled information necessary to the player.</p><p dir="ltr">"In some cases, our answer is obviously no."</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr">"I explained it multiple times to multiple players, but it's still getting asked."</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">What's important from the team at Snapshot Games is that they're communicative about their decisions as the game is continuing to be developed to make sure, even if the community might disagree at times, that they understand why.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/frosthaven-legacy-of-the-algox-07.jpg?itok=efhl-aX1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p dir="ltr">I nodded in agreement with their desire for clear communication. "If the community is made aware, then they would understand and not make a big deal out of it."&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">There was a momentary pause before Petkov responded, "Ahhh, yeah, but that's not always happening."</p><p dir="ltr">"One of the bigger problems we're having, and I have no solution for it, is people playing the board game wrong. Playing digitally, they think the game is bugged when it's not. Recently, we had a negative review, a person said they would change their review to be positive if you fix&nbsp;this card," Petkov said.</p><p dir="ltr">"The card is actually absolutely correctly implemented. It's a problematic card, and people playing the board game don't understand how it works, but we implemented it correctly, according to Isaac Childres and everyone, but we got downvoted because people don't know the rules."</p><p dir="ltr">Petkov took a moment to thank the active members of the community who are helping them convey corrections in these kinds of situations.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2 dir="ltr">The Puzzle Book Will Keep You On Track</h2><p dir="ltr">In the board game, Petkov advised that "the Puzzle Book is very polarizing because it's interesting as a side thing, but in the board game, it's locking you out of game progression. What we did is we kept a lot of the story it has and the requirements, but we made it in the form of a main quest."</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr">"The Puzzle Book is now leading your way, instead of locking your way."</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">As you progress through the Puzzle Book, for each page you reach, you'll get a checklist of scenarios to complete to gather the relevant information to solve the puzzle. If you're ever not sure what to do next, you can use the Puzzle Book as a way to prompt yourself forward.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, a Solve button has also been added for each of the Puzzle Book's pages. The team understands that if you're invested in the gameplay, the puzzles available in the Puzzle Book might not be your thing.</p><h2 dir="ltr">All Kinds Of Future Expansion Ideas Are Brewing</h2><p dir="ltr">Continuing the idea that people might play the game differently at home, the team at Snapshot Games is also looking at ways to implement different house rules, like being able to pool resources.</p><p dir="ltr">There are a variety of other game mode alterations that have been getting tested internally to appeal to a different kind of player. It's not entirely certain whether these will officially see the light of day, but I was fascinated to hear of the different testing going on.</p><ul><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1" data-list-item-id="ece340c588e691efd54abcceb0920b6a3">For new players, a mode was tested where two cards are selected for you automatically. This limits player options, but also lets players focus on a smaller number of cards when they're starting, which should speed up their entry into the game.</li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1" data-list-item-id="ee2def30d192d0b679404d100e4ab5d7f">For players who enjoy the strategy game, but not so much the resource management and city building segments, a mode has been investigated where the city will automatically get built in an efficient manner, leaving the player to not have to worry.</li></ul><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/frosthaven-legacy-of-the-algox-01.jpg?itok=XoxOkxqP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><h2 dir="ltr"><em>Frosthaven </em>Progress From Table To Screen</h2><p dir="ltr">The most exciting idea that I heard about from Petkov was that they're investigating making a save game creator. This wouldn't just be a way to give yourself access to all of the resources you need or unlock characters early, but instead would be a way that you could 'convert' your physical game status to the digital game.</p><p dir="ltr">An example was given of a group of players who live further apart, so can only play in person once a month. If they could 'import' their physical save into the game, then they could play remotely at different times, and then when they get back together to play physically, they can 'export' their progress back to their dining room table.</p><p dir="ltr">"A lot of the players are playing this board game for a couple of years, and they haven't finished it. They don't want to spoil themselves with the board game, but if they could do both, then that would be amazing.</p><p dir="ltr">"This is something we'll definitely do for the final release."</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Frosthaven's Legacy Of The Algox</em> update will be launching on Steam and the Epic Game Store on January 22. With the next update expected in April, it won't be too much longer until the game is fully released.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/frosthavens-new-expansion-brings-playable-characters-missions-and-fan-suggested]]></content:encoded>
