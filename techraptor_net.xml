These include the <em>Devil Summoner</em> series, which features strategic grid-based tactical gameplay, and the party-based <em>Digital Devil Saga</em>.</p>

Each entry focuses on a group of teenagers balancing mundane life with facing supernatural threats in alternate dimensions. It has become so popular it is less a spin-off of Shin Megami Tensei and more a sister series.</p>
