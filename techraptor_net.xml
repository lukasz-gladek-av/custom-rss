            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/promise-mascot-agency-voice-actors<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Paradise Killer&nbsp;</em>developer Promise Mascot Agency has announced some of the voice actors it's managed to score for new game&nbsp;<em>Promise Mascot Agency</em>, and the list of names is pretty crazy already.</p>

<p>In a Steam news <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2585830/view/514072769031307363" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, the studio reveals five of the actors that will be playing characters in the open-ended narrative adventure, and you'll almost certainly recognize some of the names on the list.</p>

<p>First up is Takaya Kuroda, who's best known for voicing&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon</em>'s Kazuma Kiryu. Kaizen says Kuroda "just turned up to the audition" and that the studio "didn't even dream to ask for him", but he's voicing player character Michi, which feels appropriate given Michi is a "stoic" ex-yakuza.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/promise-mascot-agency-voice-actors-dialogue.jpg?itok=pk0ldjki 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/promise-mascot-agency-voice-actors-dialogue.jpg?itok=EzgPv3n0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ex-yakuza Michi will be voiced by Takaya Kuroda, best known for voicing ex-yakuza Kazuma Kiryu.</figcaption></figure><p>The next big name on the list is&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>'s Ayano Shibuya, who voices Purah in both that game and its sequel&nbsp;<em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>. She's voicing assistant manager and "chaos goblin"&nbsp;Pinky in&nbsp;<em>Promise Mascot Agency</em>.</p>

<p>Bizarrely, industry legend Shuhei Yoshida, who <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shuhei-yoshida-leaving-playstation" rel="nofollow">recently left PlayStation</a> after 31 years with the company, will be voicing "resident veteran gamer and arcade owner" MonouGe. Yoshida did say he didn't want to vanish from the industry, but this was not on my bingo card.</p>

<p><em>Chainsaw Man</em>'s Eri Saito, who Kaizen says also voiced a member of&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid 4</em>'s Beauty and the Beast Unit, will join the cast as Matriarch Shimazu.</p>

<p>Rounding off the voice cast announcements for today is none other than&nbsp;<em>Deadly Premonition&nbsp;</em>auteur SWERY, whose real name is Hidetaka Suehiro. He'll be playing "reformed ex-biker-gang-member priest" Kannushi-kun.</p>




<p><em>Promise Mascot Agency&nbsp;</em>is the next game from<i>&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/paradise-killer" rel="nofollow">Paradise Killer</a>&nbsp;</i>developer Kaizen Game Works. Described by the developer as an "open-world narrative adventure", it sees disgraced ex-yakuza Michi running a mascot agency while trying to solve the mystery of his exile.</p>

<p>The game is set for release on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2585830/Promise_Mascot_Agency/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10008195" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/promise-mascot-agency/9p6gcj303k9b" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and Nintendo Switch sometime this year. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hyper-light-breaker-fixes-coming</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hyper-light-breaker-devs-promise-fixes-for-performance-and-accessibility.1082904/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hyper-light-breaker-fixes-coming<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Heart Machine's action roguelite&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>has officially launched in Early Access, and the developer has promised fixes for some of the game's most pressing issues by the end of the week.</p>

<p><em>Hyper Light Breaker</em>'s Steam review rating is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1534840/Hyper_Light_Breaker/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">currently sitting at Mixed</a>, with negative reviews often pointing to problems like accessibility restrictions and performance dips.</p>

<p>Now, in <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/heartmachine.bsky.social/post/3lfqn5mpqnk22" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a thread</a> on social media platform Bluesky, Heart Machine has promised that fixes for "performance issues and accessibility requests", such as mouse sensitivity options and the ability to invert the game's camera, will be introduced "by the end of the week".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hyper-light-breaker-fixes-characters.jpg?itok=M66FpfHv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hyper-light-breaker-fixes-characters.jpg?itok=80lHaCM1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Fixes are on the way for some of&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker</em>'s most pressing problems.</figcaption></figure><p>Addressing the Mixed review rating, Heart Machine says that Early Access games necessarily "take on the risk of negative early reviews and feedback" owing to different players' "expectations" for such a release.</p>

<p>The developer calls feedback received about&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker</em>'s performance and accessibility problems "extremely reasonable" and says that receiving "large quantities" of such feedback "actually helps us determine how to prioritize future updates".</p>

<p>In closing, Heart Machine says it's heartening (that's my cheap pun, not theirs) to see accessibility concerns being raised, as the studio was "already planning" to add these features and the fixes required are "straightforward".</p>

<p>A more specific timeframe hasn't been given for the fixes to these issues, but given that we're already on Wednesday, the end of the week is fast approaching. We'll likely see an update in the next few days.</p>




<p>If you're wondering what&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>is, it's the third game by Heart Machine, following on from 2016's&nbsp;<em>Zelda</em>-style action-adventure game&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hyper-light-drifter" rel="nofollow">Hyper Light Drifter</a>&nbsp;</em>and 2021's parkour platformer&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/solar-ash" rel="nofollow"><em>Solar Ash</em></a>.</p>

<p>Unlike its predecessors,&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>is a roguelite that's designed to be replayed, and it supports co-op play too. You'll traverse a variety of procedurally-generated worlds with "incredible freedom", slaying enemies and gathering loot to create unique loadouts.</p>

<p><em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1534840/Hyper_Light_Breaker/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>. You can check out our very own Austin's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/hyper-light-breaker-preview-journey-worth-taking" rel="nofollow">preview of the game right here</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Microsoft Hit by Yet More Layoffs Across Gaming and Other Divisions]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-layoffs-january-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-hit-by-yet-more-layoffs-across-gaming-and-other-divisions.1082865/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-layoffs-january-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yet another round of layoffs has hit Microsoft, affecting employees working at the tech giant's gaming division, as well as two of its other divisions.</p>

<p>A report by <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-layoffs-hit-security-devices-sales-gaming-2025-1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Business Insider</a> (which is paywalled; we're using additional reporting by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/microsoft-to-lay-off-unknown-number-of-staff" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GamesIndustry.biz</a>) cites a spokesperson as saying that a small number of Microsoft employees would be affected, although the spokesperson stopped short of saying how many constitutes that small number.</p>

<p>Given that Microsoft is a massive company that employs hundreds of thousands of people, a small number could refer to tens of employees, a few hundred, or even a few thousand; anything short of thousands and thousands of employees being laid off would likely be a drop in the ocean for Microsoft.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/microsoft-layoffs-january-2025-flight-sim.jpg?itok=0Vm9UEUt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/microsoft-layoffs-january-2025-flight-sim.jpg?itok=KUruUp6Q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Microsoft's latest round of layoffs affect employees in gaming, as well as other divisions.</figcaption></figure><p>In addition to the gaming division, the latest layoffs also affect employees in Microsoft's security and sales departments, although we don't know what proportion of employees were laid off across each division.</p>

<p>As noted by GI.biz, the spokesperson said that these layoffs weren't related to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/08/microsoft-confirms-performance-based-job-cuts-across-departments.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">performance-based job cuts</a> announced last week, so it doesn't sound like these employees are being let go because their performance is unsatisfactory (or not solely because of that, anyway).</p>

<p>Back in January last year, Microsoft apparently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">laid off almost 2,000 staff</a> solely from its gaming division, with Xbox head Phil Spencer reportedly claiming the cuts were part of reaching a "sustainable cost structure" to support Xbox's "growing business".</p>

<p>Of course, those layoffs didn't prevent CEO Satya Nadella from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-ceo-payrise-layoffs" rel="nofollow">scoring a payrise</a> to the tune of tens of millions of dollars. Perish the thought that the C-suite could perhaps absorb some of the cost when it comes to considering layoffs.</p>

<p>It'll feature looks at games like&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>South of Midnight</em>, as well as a reveal for a brand new game, although reports suggest that game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/oblivion-remake-reportedly-confirmed" rel="nofollow">won't be the long-rumored <i>Oblivion&nbsp;</i>remake</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League's Ending Is Really Dumb]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-ending-dumb</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-ending-is-really-dumb.1082832/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-ending-dumb<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rocksteady has released the final update for&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em>, and it looks like the joke's on you if you're still invested in the game's narrative for some reason.</p>

<p>Over on social media platform X, content creator Synth Potato <a href="https://x.com/SynthPotato/status/1879239456320032790" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">posted</a> the game's final cutscene in its entirety. It takes the form of a&nbsp;<em>Redfall</em>-style 2D animated storyboard cutscene, probably - as Synth Potato notes - "due to budget cuts".</p>

<p>The cutscene is narrated by Harley Quinn, who tells the story of how she and the Suicide Squad entered Brainiac's lair only to find Superman alive and well (and, notably, not Brainiac-possessed). It turns out that the evil Justice League wiped out in the main story were just clones. Of course.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-ending-superman.jpg?itok=-JFeShDJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-ending-superman.jpg?itok=0Phn5dIy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You can't scare me, Superman. You're just a clone.</figcaption></figure><p>The whole thing turns out to have been one of Batman's characteristically complex plans, although when Batman asks how the Suicide Squad knew the Justice League were clones, Quinn says they didn't. Ha, and indeed, ha.</p>

<p>Superman then says the Justice League needs to "atone" and put as many worlds right as it can, while Harley and the Suicide Squad get their collars shorted by the "wonder trio of Hack, Lawless, and Toyboy", pledging to go on a "road trip".</p>

<p>It's all exactly as abrupt and nonsensical as it sounds. I'll put my cards on the table and admit I didn't play&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em>, so I have no idea whether this is a satisfying ending to the story or not, but I'm going to hedge my bets and say that it isn't.</p>

<p>In case you need a reminder, Rocksteady <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-seasons-ending-in-january-offline-mode" rel="nofollow">announced back in December</a> that&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em>'s fourth season would be its last, and that an offline mode would be added in order to allow players to play without an online connection.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-harley-gang.jpg?itok=bZwP6Owb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-harley-gang.jpg?itok=KkqqP2ok 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em>'s ending is unlikely to have many fans.</figcaption></figure><p>This decision was almost certainly made due to&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em>'s terminally small player base, as well as the fact that its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-kill-justice-leagues-sales-disappointed-hogwarts-legacy-is-big-win" rel="nofollow">disappointing sales</a> contributed to a $200 million loss for publisher Warner Bros.</p>

<p>It seems to me that the best thing one can say about this ending is that it technically leaves the door open for another game in the&nbsp;<em>Batman: Arkham&nbsp;</em>series, although with longtime voice actor Kevin Conroy now sadly no longer with us, that might not be such a good idea. Stay tuned for more.</p>
