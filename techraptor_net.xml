            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/war-of-visions-final-fantasy-brave-exvius-shutting-down<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has announced that mobile tactical RPG&nbsp;<em>War of the Visions: Final Fantasy Brave Exvius&nbsp;</em>will shut down in May.</p>

<p>In August last year, it was revealed that&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy Brave Exvius&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-brave-exvius-shutting-down" rel="nofollow">would be ending service that October</a>, and now it's the turn of the&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>-inspired strategy RPG spinoff to do the same, according to a <a href="https://wotvffbe.com/notice/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">new announcement</a> on the game's official website.</p>

<p>According to Square Enix, while the studio attempted to "provide an enjoyable gaming experience" for&nbsp;<em>War of the Visions</em>' players, it's become "difficult to maintain a satisfactory app experience", hence the game's impending shutdown.</p>

<p>Service will fully shut down on May 29th at 11:59PM Pacific, so you'll have until then to do whatever you need to do in&nbsp;<em>War of the Visions&nbsp;</em>before the game disappears forever. It doesn't sound like you'll be able to play any kind of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-offline-december" rel="nofollow"><em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp</em>-style offline version</a>, either.</p>

<p>If you've got Google Play Points you want to exchange for items in&nbsp;<em>War of the Visions</em>, you'll be able to do so until April 30th, but any Visiore you've already got can be used right up until the game's service comes to an end.</p>

<p>Just in case you're not familiar,&nbsp;<em>War of the Visions: Final Fantasy Brave Exvius&nbsp;</em>is a tactical RPG spinoff of mobile RPG&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy Brave Exvius</em>. It combines the strategic gameplay of games like&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy Tactics&nbsp;</em>with&nbsp;<em>Brave Exvius</em>' gacha mechanics and general free-to-play mobile trappings.</p>




<p>During its operation, the game crossed over with several major&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>titles, including the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/war-of-visions-final-fantasy-brave-exvius-reveals-final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade" rel="nofollow"><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy X</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy V</em>.</p>

<p>You can still check out&nbsp;<em>War of the Visions: Final Fantasy Brave Exvius&nbsp;</em>for free right now on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.square_enix.android_googleplay.WOTVffbeww&amp;hl=en_GB" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/final-fantasy-be-wotv/id1484937345" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">iOS</a>. The game will be available until May 29th (or May 30th, depending on your time zone).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-update-157<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and Polyphony Digital will release a new update for&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>later today, and as ever, it's adding some new cars, one of which is a certified British classic.</p>

<p>Following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-update-156" rel="nofollow">last month's Update 1.56</a>, the aptly-named Update 1.57's first major addition to&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>is the Aston Martin Vantage '18, which Sony says has been referred to as "the best Aston Martin ever". It's the 2018 version of a car that became its own model line back in 2005.</p>

<p>Your second new car in this update is the&nbsp;Mazda CX-30 X Smart Edition ‘21, a crossover SUV designed to marry the best parts of sports utility vehicles with the convenience and compact nature of regular civvie cars.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mazda-cx-30-x-smart-edition-21-gran-turismo-7-update-1.57.jpg?itok=VPLPHh-2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mazda-cx-30-x-smart-edition-21-gran-turismo-7-update-1.57.jpg?itok=lP86IOP4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>Update 1.57 has some new cars for you to try out.</figcaption></figure><p>Finally, you can also drive the&nbsp;Renault Kangoo 1.4 ‘01 in this update. It's a "popular leisure activity vehicle that started life as a commercial van", according to Sony. It's not a powerful machine, but it should get you from A to B, at least.</p>

<p>This being a&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>update, you can also look forward to new events in the World Circuits mode, as well as new Sophy AI enhancements and more. You can read everything that's new in this update <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/03/26/gran-turismo-7-update-1-57-available-today/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>In case you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7</em>, it's the latest entry in Sony's long-running&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo&nbsp;</em>series of racing games. Like its predecessors, the game is a "simcade" racer, which means it balances realistic simulation with arcade-style accessibility and ease of use.</p>




<p><em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>is also the only&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo&nbsp;</em>game it's currently possible to play without resorting to the second-hand market; last year, Sony delisted the PS4's&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo Sport&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-sport-delisted" rel="nofollow">without warning</a>, although it's still possible to play the offline portions of the game.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/gran-turismo-7/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>. Update 1.57 lands at 10pm Pacific tonight (that's 1am the following morning in Eastern time).</p>
