There's continuous movement through this city, and I've heard about several new shifty characters coming through, and the other guard units have got some new recruits, which means we'll have to work harder to keep up, so chop chop. There's work to do, and rewards to be earned. Traitor's Toll doesn't sleep.</em></p><p><em>Guards of Traitor's Toll</em> was our <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/2025-techraptor-awards-tabletop-game-of-year" rel="nofollow">Tabletop Game of the Year 2025</a> because of its brilliant semi-cooperative campaign system that really captures the feel of a bustling fantasy city. On release, <em>Guards</em> had a starter set and its first expansion, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/guards-of-traitors-toll-and-busy-streets-expansion-review" rel="nofollow">Busy Streets,</a> which added extra options and gameplay. Expanding even further on its success, Grey For Now Games has released 2 more expansions, Sinister Citizens and Guardhouse Heroes, another miniatures pack, and a hardback rulebook. In this article, we check out all 4 of these new releases to see what they add to your games.</p><p>If you want to know more about <em>Guards of Traitor's Toll</em>, the Busy Streets expansion,<em> </em>and how they play, you can check out our review <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/guards-of-traitors-toll-and-busy-streets-expansion-review" rel="nofollow">here</a>. We've been fans of Grey for Now Games and Graham Davey's work since we first tried <em>Test of Honour</em> under Warlord Games, and then the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/test-of-honour-2nd-edition-gaming-set-review" rel="nofollow">2nd Edition</a> when Graham took it under his own company.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>You Have To Pay The Toll</h2><p><em>Guards of Traitor's Toll</em> is a fantasy semi-cooperative campaign game set in the city of Traitor's Toll, an independent city blocking a mountain pass that connects 2 Kingdoms. The city built up over time on the riches of the tolls paid by those wishing to use the pass to the point where now, an entire ecosystem supports the collection of those taxes. The Baron oversees all of it, supported by his Lord and Lady sons and daughters, who each control a different element of the city, and the guards they have to enforce it.</p><p>That's where you come in. You are a Guard Captain looking after a shift of guard constables in support of one of Baron's children. Keep the peace, ensure the taxes are collected, and maybe make a bit of extra coin for yourself while you're there.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Guards of Traitor's Toll Hardback Rulebook</h2><p>The new Guards of Traitor's Toll hardback rulebook is an upgraded version of the one from the starter set (or digital download). This one is in a larger format, nearly A4-sized, and in a robust hardback. It contains updated rules, new photos, along with errata and clarifications incorporated into the rules. It also features 32 extra pages, including original design work and 5 short stories set in Traitor's Toll that bring the city to life.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Guards of Traitor's Toll New Recruits</h2><p>Releasing with the hardback rulebook is the New Recruits expansion, which, unlike the other 2 we cover in this article, contains only miniatures. New Recruits contains a Halfling Guard, a Dwarf Guard, and a Guard with Attack Dog. All 3 miniatures are single-piece resin miniatures that only require sticking to the base, rather than the multipart miniatures found in the Starter Set.</p><p>The stat cards for these miniatures can be either a standard guard recruitment and an appropriate trait card for the halfling and dwarf, from the Starter Set, or the Diminutive Guard card from the Guardhouse Heroes set (which we look at below). The stat card for the guard with attack dog is also in the Starter Set.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>If you want some extra depth in your games, Sinister Citizens includes 5 new major plots with ongoing multicard plots and a new permanent trader with their own plot cards.</p><p>The <em>Guards of Traitor's Toll</em> Sinister Citizens expansion includes:</p><ul><li data-list-item-id="e35e08d6c66583246e67aeb87cee12b19">6 resin figures (Clumsy Apprentice, Little Lost Child, Pale Handsome Stranger, Kai-an the Assassin, Spectral Soldier, and Polly the Pie Maker)</li><li data-list-item-id="e66b7bcdc7311563f35bc738793f95cc7">36 Gaming Cards (1 Rules card, 5 Major Plots, 18 Secrets, and 12 Plots)</li></ul><p>The 5 new major plot cards can be used in the Patrol Duty mission, and once played through, a separate standalone plot card goes into the regular plot that can then come up during other games, and the unique miniature is added to the roster of regular civilians. Polly the Pie Maker doesn't have a major plot, and her plot cards are shuffled straight into the others, and her miniature is added to the table for use when her plot cards come up. The expansion also includes 4 new standalone plot cards and 3 associated secret cards to add some extra variety to games.</p><p>Sinister Citizens is a great expansion, which delivers a lot of playtime across the 5 new major plots and with the addition of extra normal plot cards and a new named NPC. I love the normal plot cards that fit into the game after playing through the major plots, so the story doesn't feel over when they appear again. You also sometimes get random instances where their miniature is on the board, and you can create a tie in narrative for them again in a normally unrelated plot.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Guards of Traitor's Toll Guardhouse Heroes</h2><p>The Guardhouse Heroes expansion specifically adds new recruitment options to <em>Guards of Traitor's Toll</em>, including named characters, unnamed guard varieties, and new traits and advances.</p><p>The <em>Guards of Traitor's Toll</em> Guardhouse Heroes expansion includes:</p><ul><li data-list-item-id="ee9a5afe525c1453964b29dd78a130cec">4 resin figures (Captain Bellough, Sergeant Krustin, Perricule - Gnome Guard, and Lug - Ogre Guard)</li><li data-list-item-id="e839e64ba08d499079ef5028d23dc97fc">36 Gaming Cards (8 Recruitment, 6 Traits, 1 Plot, 1 Secret, 20 Advances)</li></ul><p>The 4 miniatures in this expansion all come with unique recruitment cards for them. Bellough can inspire a nearby guard to copy their action, the mounted Krustin gets a bonus to seize and subdue if they move 6 inches, and Perricule the gnome and Lug the ogre come on separate stat cards, but have linked abilities with Perricule being able to use Lug's brawn to intimidate, and Lug rushing in to help Perricule if they're attacked.</p><p>The expansion also includes 2 diminutive and 2 oversized recruitment cards, which can be used for other larger/smaller guards, or the halfling and dwarf from the New Recruits set. The 6 new traits offer more unique ways to add flavor to your guards, like zealous and brutish, and the 20 new advances add extra abilities to your force as they develop. My favorite is the Forceful Leader, which lets your captain order a rival guard to make a close or ranged action, which always feels thematic when they shout a command with such conviction that a rival guard simply responds. There is also a new plot card to be shuffled into the deck that gives a unique mission to one of the players.</p><p>Guardhouse Heroes adds a lot of extra depth to your guard forces. The extra advances and traits are especially welcome and help to bring your individual guards to life. The named characters, while a little more expensive, are worth the cost, and if you can afford both Lug and Perricule, they are fun to operate together.</p><h2>Guards of Traitor's Toll Sinister Citizens and Guardhouse Heroes Final Thoughts?</h2><p>The extra depth that both Sinister Citizens and Guardhouse Heroes add to your games of <em>Guards of Traitor's Toll</em> makes them easy purchases. The time to tabletop for the Starter Set does take some investment for learning the rules, then assembling the miniatures and scenery, but both of these expansions include miniatures with limited hobby time required, and the rules fit straight into your existing games. The new Sinister Citizens major plots are fun and rewarding, and the new variation and named guards with Guardhouse Heroes is very welcome.</p><p>The new hardback rulebook is great if you like physical rules and want the extra stories, but the digital rules serve just as well if you play that way, and I like that the New Recruits miniatures weren't forced into a pack, but can be purchased separately if you want to include those in your guard force.</p><hr><p><em>The copy of</em>&nbsp;<strong>Guards of Traitor's Toll Sinister Citizens and Guardhouse Heroes</strong>&nbsp;<em>used to produce this review was provided by Grey for Now Games.</em></p></div><div><p><span><div>

</figure>
<p>The new project's music will be composed by legendary Japanese violinist and composer Taro Hakase, whose "dexterous...violin" helped to "kick-start the project", according to CyberConnect2.</p><p>Outside of these details, we don't know too much about <em>.hack//Z.E.R.O.</em>, but we do know it'll be the first full <em>.hack </em>RPG since 2010's <em>.hack//Link</em>, which was released for the PSP (which should tell you just how long it's been).</p><p>In the interim, a fighting game, <em>.hack//Versus</em>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hackgu-last-recode-hits-north-america-on-november-3rd" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a8c65b9d-94a0-406f-9822-3dd79877c7ec" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">a remaster</a> of the <em>.hack//GU </em>trilogy have been released, but <em>.hack </em>fans have been waiting quite some time for the continuation of the core series.</p><p>If you're not familiar with the <em>.hack </em>series, the games revolve around a game-within-a-game known simply as <em>The World</em>. It's not dissimilar to anime and manga properties like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/solo-leveling-arise-overdrive-release-date" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2cb237f6-edfc-48d7-83cb-b6bc1d2f5bf9" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Solo Leveling</em></a><em> </em>and <em>Sword Art Online</em>, although it predates both.</p>
<p>We don't yet know when we can expect <em>.hack//Z.E.R.O. </em>to launch, although if the game wants to arrive in time for CyberConnect2's 30th anniversary, then a release this year would probably be advantageous. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

He's been fighting the illness for some time, according to Foffy's translation.</p><p>If you don't know Iida by name, you'll almost certainly know him from his work; he served as a programmer on several <em>Castlevania </em>titles, including iconic games like <em>Aria of Sorrow </em>and <em>Portrait of Ruin</em>, as well as working as a level designer on <em>Castlevania: Harmony of Despair</em>.</p><figure role="group">

<p>As well as the <em>Castlevania </em>games, Iida also worked on <em>Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain </em>and its demo-sized predecessor <em>Ground Zeroes </em>as a programmer; he appears to be a big part of why the enemy AI in those games is so solid, as it were.</p><p>After working at Konami, Iida joined former <em>Castlevania </em>producer Koji Igarashi to work on 2019's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/bloodstained-ritual-of-night-review-iga-to-please" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="562798e1-8db8-47e0-a4db-1e081d708785" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">excellent</a> <em>Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night</em>, on which he served as director, with Iga occupying the role of producer.</p><p>Iida was due to lead the upcoming followup <em>Bloodstained: The Scarlet Engagement </em>as well. According to an <a href="https://artplay.co.jp/news/shutaro" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">official statement</a> by Igarashi on the website of his studio ArtPlay, development on that game is "now at its final stages".</p><p>The franchises on which Iida worked live on, too; during the most recent PlayStation State of Play presentation, it was announced that a brand new <em>Castlevania </em>game is in the works, and that a second <em>Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection </em>will be released.</p><figure role="group">
