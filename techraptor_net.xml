The tabletop publisher has a tradition of releasing Christmas novelty miniatures for Warhammer 40,000, and this year's miniature continues it proudly, sporting a red coat and a snowman with a deadly surprise.</p>

<h2>Da Red Gobbo 2024 Announcement</h2>

<p>In an official <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/uzmeyw69/have-a-blast-with-the-red-gobbo-in-this-years-christmas-commemorative-miniature/">Warhammer-Community post</a>, Games Workshop shows off photos and features of Da Red Gobbo 2024. Referred to as the A-Bomb-inable Snowman, the miniature, much <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/da-red-gobbo-returns-this-holiday-season" rel="noopener" target="_blank">like last year's</a>, is a gretchin unit for the Ork army.</p>

<p>That snowman contains a surprise. You can pop the snowman's head off, revealing the snowman's body is built around a gigantic bomb. This destructive mischief is compounded with a pile of snowballs next to the gobbos. Snowballs that are barely concealing what appear to be live grenades.</p>

<p>Da Red Gobbo 2024 is a great continuation of the Ork's farcical nature in the world of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000</em></a>. The grimdark sci-fi setting is mostly characterized by the bleak and grotesque. Interdimensional demons, torturous death cults, fascistic authoritarian states enforced by religious zealots.</p>

<p>By contrast, the Orks are inherently absurd creatures. Battle-obsessed meathead warriors whose simplistic reductive perspective, referred to by the fans as "Ork logic," can subtly break physical reality.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/da-red-gobbo-2024-snowball-grenades.jpg?itok=eqiDtNZW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/da-red-gobbo-2024-snowball-grenades.jpg?itok=HlZbD186 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Battle vehicles can drive through a warzone despite having no engine or fuel. Guns that fire hundreds of rounds despite being just twisted pieces of metal. A giant hunk of space junk becomes space-worthy because Orks drew red spikes on them. The list goes on.</p>

<p>In that context, a gretchin unit showing up with snowball grenades and an explosive snowman is absurd, but does remain in line with the lore of the setting and its maximalist design sensibilities.</p>
