            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p dir="ltr"><em>Men In Black</em> was an absolute highlight of the 90s and early 2000s entertainment. Threading the needle perfectly between pop culture, conspiracy, and digital and practical effects, it was a world that felt believable because it was just close enough to our own with a bit of fantasy. Coatsink has sought to bring back that magic with <em>Men In Black: Most Wanted</em>, an <em>MIB </em>VR adventure set in the 90s as you take on the role of Agent I, working to stop a new alien threat coming to earth.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Agent 'I Don't Remember'</h2><p dir="ltr"><em>Men In Black: Most Wanted</em> opens as you come to consciousness, having accidentally neuralyzed yourself. Being quickly surrounded by aliens, you have to quickly make your way back to your car, and the MIB headquarters to be debriefed.</p><picture>

  </picture><p dir="ltr">Here, you learn of a plot for Aliens to slowly invade the Earth, while you know that there's a grander conspiracy. At this time, the only activity you've heard of is some small-time smugglers. The plot thickens further as you're told that the only way you could have been ambushed in the way you were… would be if there was a mole in the MIB.</p><p dir="ltr">Armed with the knowledge of an alien to track down at a Motel, and the common sense to keep your mission a secret, you head out to begin your mission to topple this alien invasion.</p><p dir="ltr">From here, your adventure takes you to a variety of interesting locations, such as a dockyard or office building, where you enter under the guise of an inspector or someone with a meeting before uncovering the aliens hiding in plain sight.</p><p dir="ltr">I was a huge fan of the mission formula. Each mission takes you through investigation segments, where you explore the environment, stay away from suspicious eyes, and make your way deeper into any of the facilities. You'll normally be searching for clues related to alien activity, access cards, or solutions to other smaller puzzles to make your way deeper in.</p><picture>

  </picture><p dir="ltr">The exploration sections weren't difficult; they reminded me of action-adventure games from the PS2 era, but getting to complete them in VR added a new sense of fun. Something that would feel basic in a 2D video game, like opening a few drawers without being spotted for a keycard, added a new sense of tension when you had to physically spin around to check and make sure the coast was clear.</p><p dir="ltr">Once you've completed some puzzles, you'll ultimately end up in an alien base where you'll be ducking energy blasts and taking out aliens before they take you out. There are all of the classic hallmarks of an arcadey shooter, with ways to take out enemies from stealth and giant red barrels to shoot, all culminating in some kind of boss encounter.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Walk Like An MIB Agent</h2><p dir="ltr">The controls for <em>Men In Black: Most Wanted</em> are nice and intuitive. Moving with the left stick and pivoting with the right, your health bar is on your wristwatch, and at any time, you can pull up your mission status by bringing your left hand to your temple.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/men-in-black-most-wanted-bug-view.jpg?itok=LccTuDbQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1076" height="1079">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/men-in-black-most-wanted-bug-view.jpg?itok=Ve8nUxxE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1076" height="1079">
                  

  </picture><p dir="ltr">Your wristwatch is also where you can pull out and store your equipment. The stowing of items is partially to help keep everything in a single place to pull from, but it also adds to the gameplay, as MIB tech will be investigated by onlookers. Keeping it stowed means more effort to get out, but you fly under the radar.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Men In Black: Most Wanted</em> really lets you go through the whole experience of a MIB agent, showing up to a location with some made up name and agency, lets you investigate for clues, and if an onlooker gets too suspicious, you get to neuralize them.</p><p dir="ltr">Quite nicely, each level is also only ~40-50 minutes, depending on how stumped you get by the puzzles. I found that this was the perfect length for me for a single session before I started feeling any kind of adverse effects from so much running, ducking, and shooting in VR.</p><h2 dir="ltr">An Agent Is Only As Good As His Tools</h2><p dir="ltr">As you progress through each level, you earn more and more tools that become relevant to the next mission. Early on, I was unsurprised by the abilities I got, like a glove that let me move metal objects around regardless of their weight. This leans heavily into VR-friendly object movement as you just raise a hand and grip to move a metal box or vent grate off the wall.</p><picture>

              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/men-in-black-most-wanted-gun-combat.jpg?itok=7itPTuyS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1072" height="1079">
                  

  </picture><p dir="ltr">The tool that I loved the most was the spider-like robot that can walk on walls and short-circuit electricity. You can pluck it from your inventory and lob it in any direction or through an appropriately sized gap. Once the robot sets itself up, you raise your right hand to your head to swap control to the robot. Another fantastic way to make what could be a complicated button combination incredibly easy to perform in VR.</p><p dir="ltr">As the robot, you can also leap on walls, twisting your perspective of the world and opening up new avenues for puzzle solving.</p><p dir="ltr">As you progress through the game, you can also upgrade the weapons you get by spending collectible points on them. You can modify weapons to have charged blasts or fire ricochet bullets to change up how you're playing the game.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2 dir="ltr">A Cartoon Look, But Not THE Cartoon Look</h2><p dir="ltr"><em>Men In Black: Most Wanted</em> has a fun art style that's a mix of what you'd expect from a comic or a '90s cartoon. That being said, it's not as stylized as the old cartoon, which is a bit of a shame.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Most Wanted</em> falls into that really good level of graphics for mobile VR that's showing you something that you can accept and be a part of the world as, without trying to push too hard for a level of realism that would leave the user stuck in an uncanny universe.</p><p dir="ltr">This cartoonish style also lends itself fantastically to the big pops of color that separate the mundane and boring world of the city with alien artifacts and blood.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2 dir="ltr">Invasion Mode Is VR Horde Mode</h2><p dir="ltr">When you're done playing the 8-10 hour campaign, you can take on the Invasion mode on your own or with others online. Invasion Mode is as you'd expect, you take on waves of enemies with a variety of different objectives and try to make it as far as you can on a single life.</p><p dir="ltr">After each round, you can purchase an upgrade for yourself or your weapons or consumable items. The points you spend are earned by defeating enemies. Each enemy I killed rewarded me with a different amount of points; I couldn't quite tell what was determining that amount or if it was mostly random.</p><p dir="ltr">On top of killing aliens, you might also be searching the arena for objectives like power sources to place in receptacles around the arena.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/men-in-black-most-wanted-worms.jpg?itok=FjkFrX0Z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1071" height="1077">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/men-in-black-most-wanted-worms.jpg?itok=h1AN9VKo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1071" height="1077">
                  

  </picture><p dir="ltr">The purchases expand even further past upgrades, as you can also buy arena obstacles and turrets. These items let you reshape the terrain and add a bit of random/uniqueness, but in your favor.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><em>Men In Black: Most Wanted</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2><p dir="ltr"><em>Men In Black: Most Wanted</em> from start to finish felt like discovering a classic Action Adventure title from the ~PS2 era of gaming. The gameplay is a fun mix between some engaging problem-solving and sleuthing before it moves into frantic shootouts against colorful aliens.</p><p dir="ltr">Coatsink has done a fantastic job crafting a mission-based story to lead you through the alien underground, pulling the threads of a conspiracy for a fun and engaging payoff.</p><p dir="ltr">Coupled with easy to learn and dynamic VR controls, an art style that fits the subject well and welcomes you to the world, and a reasonable play session time matched to the story beats of a mission whether you're a massive fan of <em>MIB</em>, or are just looking for a great action adventure title to play on your Quest next I'd definitely recommend this.</p><hr><p><em><strong>Men In Black: Most Wanted </strong>was reviewed on Meta Quest 3 with a copy provided by the Developer over the course of 9 hours of gameplay - all screenshots were taken during the process of review.</em></p></div><div><p><span><div>
