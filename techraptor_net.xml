            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has announced that pre-orders are live for their latest starter set. The <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Heroes of the Borderlands</em> starter set is their largest set to date, packed with everything a new play group needs. It is also their priciest.</p>



<p>In the new <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Heroes of the Borderlands</em> starter set, players will get everything they need to start playing <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> right out of the box.

This includes creating memorable characters, navigating D&amp;D's various settings, progressing through epic quests, fighting monsters, and more. Lastly, the set contains three booklets. Each booklet will contain a quick, hour-long adventure. No prior experience needed.</p>

<p>The <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Heroes of the Borderlands</em> starter set is an update on one of the oldest, most enduring modules in the game's history. It is based on <em>The Keep on the Borderlands</em>, written by Gary Gygax and published in 1979. It was also designed to introduce new players to the game, packed full of rules and sage advice.</p>

<p>This adventure has a special place in the game's history. It has been reprinted several times throughout various editions of the game. It's even been reprinted by OSR-focused developer Goodman Games under the title <em>Into The Borderlands</em>, which contained scans of the original adventure, a <em>D&amp;D 5e</em> conversion, and testimonials from various designers and players.</p>

<p>Notably, the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Heroes of the Borderlands</em> starter set is the most expensive starter set to date. On D&amp;D Beyond, a physical copy of the set is $49.99. A digital copy on the platform is $14.99. And there is the Ultimate bundle, which gives you access to both at $54.99. The starter set will release September 16.</p>
