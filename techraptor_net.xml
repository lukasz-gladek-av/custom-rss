            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This week sees another new batch of <em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar </em>releases riding upon winds of ethereal magic, with Battletomes for the Disciples of Tzeentch and the Lumineth Realm Lords, as well as new models, hitting pre-order. Games Workshop sent us a sampling from each army to check out, so follow along as I jump in on my <em>Warhammer AOS</em> new release review!</p><h2><em><strong>Warhammer AOS</strong></em><strong> Lumineth Realm-Lords - New Battletome</strong></h2><p>The new Battletome for the Lumineth Realm-Lords brings this army into the modern era of <em>Warhammer AOS</em>, with updated lore, faction rules, and Warscrolls, along with Spearhead, Path to Glory, and Army of Renown rules. I won’t cover everything here, but I’ll highlight a few key points that stood out to me.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>Lore-wise, this book does a wonderful job of setting the scene for the Lumineth, with over 30 pages dedicated to the history of the Lumineth (as is to be expected with these Battletomes).&nbsp;</p><p>There’s not a lot of time spent in the present, with the Vermindoom gnawing through the fabric of reality, but what little is there teases out the trouble the perfection-seeking Lumineth find themselves in.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>As we jump into the rules, the first thing we see is the Lumineth’s Depict Rune battle trait. Once per round, you choose a rune to inscribe on the battlefield.&nbsp;</p><p>These runes give small bonuses like adding 1 to the run and charge roles of select units, or subtracting 1 from hit rolls by enemy units. But where it gets immediately interesting is how these combo with each other.&nbsp;</p><p>While only one rune is active at a time, these runes gain conditional bonuses if you’ve used <em>other</em> specific runes so far in the game.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>Also known for their spellcasting, the Lumineth boast some spicy spells, with most of them handing out mortal wounds like pieces of Lembas bread (sorry, mixing mythologies here).</p><h2><em><strong>Warhammer AOS</strong></em><strong> Lumineth Realm Lords - New Model</strong></h2><picture>

  </picture><p>Along with the new Battletome, we also got to check out the new model releasing for the army, the Vasari Lord Regent.</p><p>With two optional builds, this Lumineth stands tall and proud no matter how you choose to assemble him. His stats are as follows: Move 6”, Save 4+, Control 2, Health 5. And his weapon, the Regent’s Sword has the <strong>Crit (Mortal)</strong> keyword, Attack 5, Hit 3+, Wound 4+, Rend 1, and Damage 2. Not too shabby, but his abilities really stand out.</p><p>His passive ability, <strong>Shining Example</strong>, states that each time a friendly Lumineth Realm-Lords unit wholly within 12” of him uses the ‘Rally’ command, you can make 3 additional rally rolls of D6. Imagine scoring even one extra six off this ability, the impact would be huge.</p><p>He also has the situational but impressive <strong>Wall of Blades</strong> ability (though, I suppose it’s not situational if you build around it) which allows you to pick a friendly Vanari Auralan Wardens unit wholly within 12” of him and select them to be the Wall of Blades, then choose an enemy unit in combat with the Wall to be the target. You roll a die for each model in combat with the target enemy unit, and on a 5+ you inflict 1 mortal damage on the target.</p><p>I love the flavor of this, here’s this regal, imperious general who can sweep into the battlefield, rally his troops not with screams and shouts but his own glittering, inspiring presence, then with a word turn a unit in the heat of battle into a slicing, precise wall of death. So fun and flavorful!</p><p>Now, if you’ve had just about enough of all this orderly Lumineth business, let’s get weird…</p><h2><em><strong>Warhammer AOS</strong></em><strong> Disciples of Tzeentch Battletome</strong><picture>

  </picture></h2><p>If you had to pick one army in all of <em>Warhammer</em> <em>AOS</em> to serve as the complete opposite of the Lumineth Realm-Lords, I don’t think you could do much better than the Disciples of Tzeentch. Bathed in the&nbsp; kaleidoscopic colors of Tzeentch, the Chaos God of change, the Disciples thrive on unrest and scheming, hoping to serve their god to bring about a great crystalline freakout.</p><p>As with the Lumineth Battletome, the Tzeentch Battletome is full of incredible lore - and I would argue paints an even better picture of the army, their beliefs, and how this varied group comes together for a greater (impossible to comprehend) purpose. There’s even a section of the Jade Obelisk, a <em>very</em> cool-looking Chaos <em>Warcry</em> army.</p><p>Shifting over to the rules, we see a bevy of Battle Traits the army starts with. These include <strong>Eldritch Illusions</strong>, allowing you to set up three units in reserve during deployment, <strong>Smoke And Mirrors</strong>, which allows you to swap a unit for one of your units in reserve, and <strong>Silver Simulacrum</strong>, which lets you set up a second Argent Shard during deployment (vs. when you’d normally be able to, during faction terrain setup).</p><p>There’s also <strong>All Part of the Plan</strong>, which lets you gain Fate points whenever (to put it simply) certain things go <em>wrong</em> for your army, <strong>Destined to Serve</strong>, <strong>Destined Arcana</strong>, and <strong>Destined for Battle</strong> which let you spend said Fate points to remove damage, boost casting rolls, and add to your charge rolls, respectively.</p><p>This creates an incredibly malleable and, what I would call, “slippery” army that’s hard for your opponent to wrap their arms around (just as Tzeentch intended).</p><h2><em><strong>Warhammer AOS</strong></em><strong> Disciples of Tzeentch New Models</strong><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-aos-disciples-of-tzeentch-fatemaster.jpg?itok=eYyd0_TK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-aos-disciples-of-tzeentch-fatemaster.jpg?itok=qqYIAKCw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture></h2><p>Now let’s close out this review with a quick look at some of the new models coming up for preorder today. First up is the Fatemaster.</p><p>This military mastermind comes out swinging with the following stats: Move 5”, Save 4+, Control 2, Health 6. His weapon, the Cursewrought Glaive, sports Attack 4, Hit 3+, Wound 4+, Rend 2, Damage 2. Which is fine for a single model unit, but his abilities are what really make him shine.</p><p>First, there’s <strong>Long in the Planning</strong>, a once per turn Activation during the Enemy Hero Phase that let’s you spend 2 fate points to simply remove a friendly unit with 12” from the battlefield if an enemy unit charges them and gets within 3”. Again… slippery!</p><p>Then there’s the <strong>Bound Retinue</strong> ability, which you can trigger once per turn on your movement phase. This one’s so interesting, and could be a real doozy! If it is masked by illusion (i.e. set up in reserve, as described above), you can pick it <em>and another unit </em>masked by illusion, and set them both up just about anywhere on the battlefield (the only restriction being they need to be more than 9” from an enemy unit). What!?</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-aos-disciples-of-tzeentch-argent-shards.jpg?itok=B8DG0SFr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p>Finally, we have the new faction terrain Argent Shards. I love the look of these bizarre shards of crystal and eyeballs, and their abilities aren’t too shabby either. There’s the <strong>Magical Focus</strong> ability, which allows a shard to act as a magical foci, meaning your spell casters can use its position instead of the position of the spell caster for measuring and determining line of sight on their spells.</p><p>The Shards also have the <strong>Magical Duplication</strong> special ability, which says once per turn during any movement phase you can either set up an additional Argent Shard (if only one is on the battlefield), or remove it from the battlefield and set it up again in another spot on the battlefield. Talk about keeping your enemies on their toes!</p><h2><em><strong>Warhammer AOS</strong></em><strong> Disciples and Lumineth - Final Thoughts</strong></h2><p><br>To wrap it all up, I think these are two strong releases for <em>Warhammer AOS</em>, though I do have to admit I’m more drawn to the Disciples. Maybe it’s just the flavor of raging chaos vs. stately order, but I feel like the lore, new rules, and new models for Tzeentch are just stronger than the Lumineth.</p><p>Are you going to be updating your Lumineth or Tzeentch armies with these new releases? Are you excited about the new models?

Now, we can confirm that it was indeed Games Workshop that filed the <em>Void War</em> DMCA as Tundra Interactive has told us more about this story, and how <em>Void War</em> is back up on Steam now.</p><p>After failing to communicate with Tundra Interactive for a week, Games Workshop finally replied, and confirmed that the <em>Void War</em> DMCA was on their behalf. That means that Games Workshop does employ a lawyer named Mal Reynolds, despite how unlikely that seemed, and it is a deeply ironic name given the <em>Firefly</em> character with the same name. Tundra Interactive explains what issue Games Workshop had with <em>Void War</em>:</p><blockquote><p>They said their concern was limited to a specific shot from one of the trailers on the store page, arguing that certain elements could create the mistaken impression that Void War is associated with Games Workshop, specifically what they described as “the oversized convex shoulder pads with a metallic rim.”</p></blockquote><p>Tundra Interactive emphasizes that all the artwork in the trailer for <em>Void War</em> was original work created by their artists. Despite that, in the goal of a fast resolution, they have removed the story trailer that had the offending image. With that done, they were able to get the game back up on Steam. Tundra Interactive stated, "We may re-upload an updated version later after we find time to adjust that shot, but for now our priority is shipping content and finishing multi-language font support so we can finally deliver proper translations." saying that new versions of the trailer may come.</p><p>It is possible to view the trailer via a <a href="https://video.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_trailers/257147370/movie_max.mp4" rel="nofollow">link from SteamDB</a> which has an image at 34 seconds which match the description given by Games Workshop, as well as confirmed by Tundra Interactive that it is the offending image.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>Games Workshop has a history of being... very protective of its IP, dating back to actions like trying to trademark the term <a href="https://gizmodo.com/games-workshop-is-still-claiming-to-own-the-trademark-t-5982201" rel="nofollow">Space Marine</a>, to the contentious relationship with fans over things like fan animations that they <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games-workshop-is-trying-to-shut-down-fan-animations/" rel="nofollow">took steps to ban</a>.</p><p>We previously reached out to Games Workshop, but they did not reply regarding whether they had filed the DMCA against Tundra Interactive.&nbsp;</p><p>Hopefully, all's well that ends well and Tundra Interactive can get back to making their game without further legal hurdles. <em>Void War </em>is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2853590/Void_War/" rel="nofollow">available on Steam </a>and also <a href="https://tundra-interactive.itch.io/void-war" rel="nofollow">on Itch.Io</a>, which will also provide a Steam key.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/echoes-of-elysium-preview-more-sandbox-than-survival-but-all-airship</link>
            <guid>1428622</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Echoes of Elysium</em> is the brainchild of Loric Games, a group of former Mythic Entertainment employees with a smattering of Bethesda developers mixed in. Having worked on titles such as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinion/endurance-star-wars-old-republic" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b37f30ad-c8cb-4f8d-a44b-58b67d95bb81" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Star Wars: The Old Republic</em></a> and <em>Dark Age of Camelot</em>, the studio has taken their extensive experience to head into uncharted territory with their debut title. Learn how Loric Games is approaching Early Access, and whether the sandbox survival airship RPG is for you with our <em>Echoes of Elysium</em> preview.</p><h2>Colorful, Carefree, and Calming</h2><p>Set as a sandbox RPG with survival elements thrown in, <em>Echoes of Elysium</em> takes a different path than other games in the survival genre. You’ll find a bright blue sky, fluffy clouds, bright rooftops, and vivid flowers throughout the world’s floating islands. For the land of the dead, it is quite cheerful. Combined with the atmospheric music, the title can even be labeled calming.</p><p>The art is the main reason I became interested in the game. Survival games typically evoke an apocalyptic style with darker colors, dreariness, and an overbearing sense of despair. With a color scheme that deviates from the norm, it's easy for <em>Echoes of Elysium</em> to stand out in the crowded survival genre.<picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/using-a-harpoon-echoes-of-elysium.jpg?itok=J0UTlEBf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture></p><p>While there are some survival aspects to the game, the title absolutely feels like a sandbox airship builder. You need to harvest rocks, trees, plant fiber, and fuel. You build your airship, which acts as a flying base. There’s food to forage and inventory to manage, but items don't spoil, and basic resources are easy to gather.</p><p>You don’t have any thirst or hunger, and your stamina mainly comes into play when gliding across the open expanse or fighting. Instead of having to track down your items, which you still have to do if you were away from your ship when you perished, you’ll be cursed with a debuff. When you die and respawn, you’ll need to find food that cures your new status or wait until the buff wears off.</p><p>I enjoyed gliding through the air, seeing the different islands, and finding new items to harvest. However, there’s not much else to do aside from that. The narrative, which is an element the team is still working on, is barely there, at best.</p><p>You get a story in the opening cutscene, are introduced to an NPC that aids you, and receive a quick tutorial. Once you capture your first Dry Dock, however, you can spend hours wandering the vast expanse without discovering another snippet of story. It’s even possible to skip part of the story if you find the boss’s den by accident.<picture>

  </picture></p><p>During a preview presentation with Loric Games, it was admitted that the narrative doesn’t rank as high on the list of important items. Making airships into flying bases and nailing the associated mechanics are the focuses and stars of the game. The story will be coming, but it may not be as extensive or featured as prominently as some survival or RPG players will want.&nbsp;</p><p>As a survival title, <em>Echoes of Elysium</em> misses the mark. There’s no pressure to actually survive. If you don’t die, you never need to eat or drink. There are no elements affecting your mood. Aside from falling out of the air and the scattering of enemies you can encounter, death is far from a concern.</p><p>As a sandbox builder, the title hits the main points, making it far more successful in that regard. You can build beautiful airships without having to worry about your skill as a builder, thanks to the rounded walls. Weight isn’t even an issue as long as you have enough propellers, allowing you to truly get creative with your build.<picture>

  </picture></p><p>The biggest downfall of <em>Echoes of Elysium</em> is the somewhat grindy nature of the game when it comes to advanced resources, especially fuel, and the time it takes to travel from one island cluster to another. I often abandoned my airship to traverse with my glider. Even over large expanses, it was my preferred method of travel. While airships aren’t as slow as the ships in Skull &amp; Bones, it’s still a time investment to make your way around the map looking for resources.</p><p>On top of that, the game crashes, there can be glitches causing enemies to become invincible, and items can fall out of the sky, making them inaccessible. At first, I experienced quite a bit of lag that made playing almost impossible. That has vastly improved, but people with older machines may experience what feels like never ending lag.</p><p><em>Echoes of Elysium</em> has great bones and some great potential, it just needed more time in the oven. More narrative would add some structure to the experience. Additional resources, more concrete ways to find said resources, and more mechanics to craft items easily would ensure everyone who plays the title understands how to advance.<picture>

  </picture></p><h2><em>Echoes of Elysium</em> Preview | Final Thoughts</h2><p>Even though there are issues, Loric Games’ outlook on Early Access assures fans they will continue working on the title. Taking a stance, a few years old, the studio will be listening to player feedback and furthering development through the EA phase, with the player base in mind. While this was how EA originally started for many games in the past, this hasn’t been the modus operandi for the majority of current EA releases. If you’re interested in the growth of the game and impacting how the world evolves, <em>Echoes of Elysium</em> will be a great fit for you.
