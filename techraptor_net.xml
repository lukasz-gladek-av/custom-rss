            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dimension-20-dungeons-drag-queens-season-2-sashays-onto-dropout-in-january<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The drag queens are back in the latest trailer from Dropout announcing that Season 2 of Dungeons &amp; Drag Queens will be releasing on January 8th on Dropout.tv. The announcement trailer shows off the returning case from the original season, updated character art, and plenty of teases as to what is to come in the upcoming season.</p>


<p>Returning from the first season are drag queens&nbsp;Monét X Change as Troyánn (Triton/Arcane Archer Fighter), Bob the Drag Queen as Gertrude (Tiefling/Shadow Magic Sorcerer), Jujubee as Twyla (Fairy/Gloomstalker Ranger) and Alaska Thunderfuck as Princess (Orc/Berserker Barbarian). In the first season, we saw this group of level 5 adventurers head into the underworld to help Princess attempt to bring her family back to life.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"It's nice to be reunited with Gerty" - Bobb the Drag Queen</p>

<p>Over the course of the trailer, we're treated to reintroductions of each of the characters, including portions of updated character artwork, as well as full reveals for the character minis.</p>

From behind the scenes photos we get a better look at the frozen fortress map as well as a battle map not featured in the trailer showing off a massive octopus monster and crashing wave.</p>
