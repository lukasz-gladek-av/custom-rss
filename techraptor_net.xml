            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Furi&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Haven&nbsp;</em>studio The Game Bakers has announced that it'll be delaying its upcoming survival-climbing sim&nbsp;<em>Cairn&nbsp;</em>to the first quarter of next year, although the demo is getting an update by way of some good news.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1588550/view/525355229451912425" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news update</a> on Steam, The Game Bakers reveals that&nbsp;<em>Cairn&nbsp;</em>will now be arriving in Q1 2026 so that the studio can "spend a bit more time on debug and optimization" and to "ensure that [the game] launches at its best".</p>

<p>While&nbsp;<em>Cairn&nbsp;</em>is "truly special", according to The Game Bakers, the studio can "see the improvements [it] can still make to give you the best game [it] can", and the developer doesn't want to "rush" to the finish after five years of work.</p>

<p>The update will allow you to see other players' ghosts, including "speedrunners, community members, and the dev team", according to The Game Bakers. This way, you can look out for techniques other players are using to give them the edge, or just bask in the sense of distant camaraderie.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Cairn&nbsp;</em>is, it's the next game from The Game Bakers, the French studio responsible for boss rush bullet hell game&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/furi" rel="nofollow">Furi</a>&nbsp;</em>and co-op RPG&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/haven" rel="nofollow"><em>Haven</em></a>.</p>

<p>Your goal is to climb the imposing Mount Kami, managing resources like pitons, food, and other necessities as you ascend. You'll need to plan your route carefully if you want to make it to the summit.</p>




<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Cairn&nbsp;</em>when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1588550/Cairn/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/cairn/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a> early next year. Stay tuned for more.</p>
