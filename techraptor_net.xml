            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher AdHoc Studio has revealed that its episodic adventure game-slash-management sim&nbsp;<em>Dispatch&nbsp;</em>has reached a major sales milestone within its first ten days on release.</p>

<p>Over on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:zeyme7h7gsicdx2zt2mjwlu5/post/3m4r2a5kiww23" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>, the studio begins by saying that selling "80 million copies" in the space of two days "would've been nice", but that managing to sell a million within ten days is "still pretty good".</p>

<p>That's likely including sales on both PC and PlayStation 5, where the game's first four episodes are currently available. Episodes 5 and 6 will launch tomorrow, while the concluding Episodes 7 and 8 will arrive next week.</p>

The studio also incorporates former personnel from studios like Ubisoft and&nbsp;<em>Oxenfree</em>'s Night School.</p>

<p>As the name suggests,&nbsp;<em>Dispatch&nbsp;</em>sees you playing as a dispatcher who must send superheroes around the city to combat crime. It's up to you to decide which hero's power set and personality best match each crime as it comes up.</p>

<p>Of course, this being a game created by former Telltale staffers, there's also a choice-based adventure element in which you'll buld relationships, learn more about your colleagues, and make decisions that affect the way the story progresses.</p>

<p><em>Dispatch&nbsp;</em>boasts a pretty prestigious voice cast as well as its all-star development team; actors like&nbsp;<em>Breaking Bad</em>'s Aaron Paul,&nbsp;<em>Hades II</em>'s Erin Yvette, and <i>The Last of Us II</i>'s Laura Bailey are part of the cast, among other big names.</p>




<p>You can grab&nbsp;<em>Dispatch&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2592160/Dispatch/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10013259" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, where the first four episodes are waiting for you.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has released its financial statement for the second quarter of the 2025-26 fiscal year (as well as the first half of the year as a whole), and it looks like Switch 2 games like&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>are selling pretty well.</p>

<p>As part of its <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251104_4e.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">fiscal results</a>, Nintendo has revealed sales numbers for games released within the last few months, and&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>is currently sitting pretty at 9.57 million sales. Given that the Switch 2 itself has sold just over 10 million units to date, that's a pretty high adoption rate for the racer.</p>

<p>3D platformer&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, meanwhile, has racked up 3.49 million sales for itself, and given that&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong&nbsp;</em>is perhaps not quite as powerful an IP as&nbsp;<em>Mario&nbsp;</em>when it comes to moving units (although there's a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/donkey-kong-bananza-super-mario-odyssey-team" rel="nofollow">developer in common</a> in this case), that's not bad at all.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-financials.jpg?itok=GuYQhjjn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-financials.jpg?itok=eNCRXiI2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sales of&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>have been pretty strong so far.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, in the same period, <i>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&nbsp;</i>still managed to rack up 1.37 million sales, and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/super-mario-party-jamboree-whole-party-and-then-some" rel="nofollow">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a>&nbsp;</em>wasn't far behind, likely boosted by the Switch 2 Edition that launched back in July.</p>

<p>This quarter saw Nintendo's sales and operating profit leap when compared to the same period last year, as you'd probably expect given that the Switch 2 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">was released in June</a> (which technically sits in the first quarter of the year).</p>

<p>According to Nintendo, sales slowed slightly during this quarter "compared to the high demand seen immediately following" the Switch 2's launch, but the console still managed to shift 4.54 million units between July and September.</p>

<p>All told, it's more good news for Nintendo, and it suggests the company might well have been justified in reportedly asking for 25 million Switch 2 units to be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-25m-production-report" rel="nofollow">manufactured by March next year</a>.</p>

We'll have to wait and see how they affect the company's third-quarter financials.</p>
