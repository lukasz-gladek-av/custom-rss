            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fanatical-movember-charity-bundle<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Fanatical has a new charity bundle up for grabs, and for just $12 (or more if you choose), you'll get a ton of pretty big games and support the Movember charity initiative into the bargain.</p>

<p>The Movember Game 'Stache Charity Bundle is, per Fanatical, "the first bundle to join the Movember mustache movement", and it's got a whopping 15 games to offer, including Owlcat's well-received CRPG&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader"><em>Warhammer 40k: Rogue Trader</em></a>.</p>

<p>Other games you'll get as part of this bundle include truckin' sim&nbsp;<em>American Truck Simulator</em>, city-builder&nbsp;<em>SteamWorld Build</em>, and goopy action-adventure game&nbsp;<em>The Gunk</em>, among several others.</p>

<p>Additionally, 100% of the proceeds go to the Movember charity initiative, so you don't need to choose how much you want to go to Fanatical itself; you're supporting Movember all the way if you pick this one up.</p>

<p>Here's a full list of the games available as part of the Fanatical Movember Game 'Stache Charity Bundle. All of these games activate via Steam, and many of them are either Playable or Verified on Steam Deck as well.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-q3-financials-alan-wake-2</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/remedys-revenue-is-up-as-alan-wake-2-inches-towards-profitability.1025346/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-q3-financials-alan-wake-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em>developer Remedy has announced its financial results for the third quarter of its fiscal year, and things are looking a little rosier for the Finnish studio.</p>

<p>In Remedy's <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/inderes-widgets-prod-assets/remedy/attachments/1ef581e9-5f40-4a92-ab0f-0d15844717cd/remedy-q3-2024-business-review.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">financial report</a>, the studio says its revenue has jumped 128.6% over the same period from the previous year. Between July and September this year, Remedy raked in&nbsp;€17.9 million in revenue, and its operating profit was&nbsp;€2.4 million, up from a&nbsp;€5.5 million loss in Q3 2023.</p>

<p>The studio also says that while&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alan-wake-2-budget-remedy-financials">still isn't profitable</a>, the game had recouped "most of its development and marketing expenses" by the end of the quarter, which means that it may well be profitable within the next couple of quarters.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/alan-wake-2-remedy-financials-lake-house.jpg?itok=VdDMC3Qy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/alan-wake-2-remedy-financials-lake-house.jpg?itok=VJ0dMg8C 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</em>isn't profitable yet, but it seems to be getting there.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Remedy, full production on&nbsp;<em>Control 2&nbsp;</em>is scheduled to start in 2025, with the sequel currently progressing "well in the production readiness stage". Many of the game's "critical features" have been implemented, Remedy says, and it's currently testing "workflows and pipelines" for full production.</p>

<p>Similarly, the&nbsp;upcoming&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/max-payne-remakes-control-spinoff-remedy"><em>Max Payne&nbsp;</em>remakes</a> are "making steady progress", and Remedy says it's "gradually reaching important milestones" in development on the projects.</p>

<p>For the rest of 2024, Remedy expects its revenue to "increase from the previous year", and it also expects its "operating profit to improve", so it looks like Remedy will likely have a better time in 2024 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-financials-2023">than in 2023</a>.</p>

<p>The report also looks ahead to Remedy's upcoming projects, including the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Control 2&nbsp;</em>and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fbc-firebreak-control-spinoff-announced">recently-revealed&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em></a>, a multiplayer&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em>spinoff set to launch sometime next year.</p>




<p>While Remedy is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-annapurna-control-2-tv-movies">teaming up with Annapurna</a> (even amidst that company's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/annapurna-interactive-staff-resign-after-company-spin-off-talks-fail">recent turmoil</a>) for&nbsp;<em>Control 2</em>, the Finnish developer will be self-publishing the game, as it will with&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>.</p>

<p>Here's hoping Remedy's fortunes continue to improve in the coming months. Stay tuned for more on all things Remedy-related.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dayz-creator-kerbal-space-program-killer-ksa</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dayz-creator-reveals-kerbal-space-program-killer-ksa.1025283/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dayz-creator-kerbal-space-program-killer-ksa<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>DayZ&nbsp;</em>creator and RocketWerkz head Dean Hall has announced he and his team are working on a "<em>Kerbal Space Program&nbsp;</em>killer" by the name of&nbsp;<em>KSA</em>, or&nbsp;<em>Kitten Space Academy</em>.</p>

<p>Announcing the game <a href="https://x.com/rocket2guns/status/1851832821020790791" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Hall says he's working on&nbsp;<em>KSA&nbsp;</em>with RocketWerkz alongside "former members of the&nbsp;<em>Kerbal Space Program&nbsp;</em>team and amazing modders".</p>

<p>Right now, the game looks to be in its early stages; the footage Hall showed off in his post simply shows a moon's surface, then zooms out (albeit seamlessly) to reveal a galaxy of planets, all soundtracked by some appropriately moody synth music.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ksa-kerbal-space-program-killer-dean-hall.jpg?itok=d5xCeo72 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ksa-kerbal-space-program-killer-dean-hall.jpg?itok=QwKZf6qu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Dean Hall and RocketWerkz are currently working on a "<em>Kerbal Space Program&nbsp;</em>killer" called&nbsp;<em>KSA</em>, or&nbsp;<em>Kitten Space Academy</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1gg5106/comment/lun0vsl/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Reddit post</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1gg5106/comment/lun0vsl/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" rel="noopener" target="_blank">accompanying comment</a>,&nbsp;Hall goes into more detail regarding RocketWerkz's new project, as well as his own efforts to pitch Private Division on a&nbsp;<em>Kerbal Space Program&nbsp;</em>sequel.</p>

<p>Hall says that his studio was in "the top three bids" to work on&nbsp;<em>Kerbal Space Program 2</em>, but that because his team's pitch focused on the technical side of things and didn't contain any art, his studio wasn't chosen.</p>

<p>However, Hall says that for&nbsp;<em>Kitten Space Agency</em>, he and RocketWerkz have employed several developers who worked on both&nbsp;<em>Kerbal Space Program&nbsp;</em>and its sequel, as well as a mystery "key person" who is a "key individual in our industry".</p>

<p>There's also a little more nerdy technical information contained within Hall's comment, including how the video footage's seamless movement is achieved, how the team deals with floating point precision loss, and more.</p>




<p>If you're wondering why exactly a&nbsp;<em>Kerbal Space Program&nbsp;</em>killer would be needed, look no further than Take-Two's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/intercept-games-shut-down-kerbal-space-program-2">apparent shutdown</a> of&nbsp;<em>Kerbal Space Program 2&nbsp;</em>developer Intercept Games (although Take-Two itself <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-denies-roll7-intercept-closure">denies closing that studio</a>).</p>

<p>Reportedly, Take-Two is also <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-two-reportedly-planning-to-close-or-sell-private-division" rel="noopener" target="_blank">looking to close down or sell</a> its indie label Private Division, so despite the company's claims to the contrary, <i>Kerbal Space Program 2&nbsp;</i>might not be a going concern for much longer.</p>

<p>There's a niche a mile wide, then, for someone like Hall to slide in with a game that's similar enough to&nbsp;<em>Kerbal&nbsp;</em>that people take interest while also being different enough to carve out a niche for itself.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see whether RocketWerkz achieves this, but in the meantime, you can join the project's <a href="https://discord.com/invite/aCwHR7HJ4W" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Discord server</a> if you want to keep up with things as they happen.</p>
