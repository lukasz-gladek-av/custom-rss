<figcaption><em>Helldivers 2</em>'s new update tasks you with taking down the Cyborg legions.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You'll be facing these new enemies in <em>Helldivers 2</em>'s new Cyberstan factory cities map, where you'll be battling through "industrial complexes that are heavily defended with hazards around every corner".</p><p>A new mission type, in which you'll be stopping Cyborg production and compromising Automaton defenses, is now available as part of this update, and new objectives include tearing down Cyborg statues anddestroying mega-factories.</p><p>Throughout the Machinery of Oppression campaign, <em>Helldivers 2 </em>will track the total number of player deaths, and if the new Galactic Reinforcement Counter reaches zero, then the Battle for Cyberstan has been lost (and, presumably, you won't get any of the fun goodies associated with it).</p><p>All of this follows on from the release of the latest <em>Helldivers 2 </em>Warbond, Siege Breakers, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-siege-breakers-warbond" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5707f6d2-689f-47a5-99b1-93eca6b7efc0" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">launched earlier this month</a>. You can pick that Warbond up now via the game's store if you want to.</p>

As such, it stands to reason that the next big update for <em>Helldivers 2 </em>will probably pit you against the Illuminate. You have been warned.</p><p><em>Helldivers 2</em>'s Machinery of Oppression update is available across all platforms now. You can grab the game on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/helldivers-2/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/helldivers-2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and you can read <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/helldivers-2-review-fighting-for-managed-democracy" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5a16fadb-7c1f-45fc-a180-c4fd53fd4ea1" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">our review of it right here</a>.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remedy has released its financial statement covering the 2025 fiscal year (which, unlike many other companies, actually spans January through December), and revenue is up just in time for the studio's new CEO to take the reins.</p><p>In its latest <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/?publicationId=e31c174f-9768-44d4-bf60-885d2a016ae3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">financial results summary</a>, Remedy says revenue has increased by 17.5% when compared to last year, although profit has fallen. It's a similar story for the final quarter of the year; revenue is up, but profit is down.</p><p>Interim CEO Markus Mäki says that Remedy's revenue jump in the fourth quarter can mainly be explained by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alan-wake-2-profitable-sales-2m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="970912fc-80d4-4e9c-8bef-ae9633225b34" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Alan Wake 2</em></a><em> </em>and <em>Control </em>sales, with the former also generating "meaningful royalties" throughout the year as a whole.</p><figure role="group">

<p><em>Control</em> has also done pretty well for itself; the game sold over a million copies in 2025 alone, likely driven at least in part by the announcement of sequel <em>Control Resonant </em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-game-awards-2025-recap" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7f71e644-2289-45c0-a1c9-dc56c3797e8a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">at December's Game Awards</a>.</p><p>Of course, it hasn't been an entirely positive year for Remedy. In June, the studio released <em>FBC: Firebreak</em>, its multiplayer shooter set in <em>Control</em>'s Oldest House, and in August, the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-fbc-firebreak-launch-sales-financials" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6847b7cf-34a2-4aec-ac18-8271f49e62c9" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">admitted it was "unsatisfied"</a> with the game's sales to that point.</p><p>Indeed, in October, Mäki said Remedy was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-fbc-firebreak-financials-q3-2025" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="89020d81-5dd2-41cc-bbd0-73fab64dcbd5" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">moving development resources away</a> from <em>FBC: Firebreak </em>and towards other in-development titles, although he also said the studio would "respect [its] communicated roadmap" for the shooter.</p><p>Remedy's latest financial statement comes just a day or so after the studio <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/?publicationId=c86bbf74-7d56-4b1e-bc4d-56f406fc8258" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">announced</a> the appointment of its new CEO, Jean-Charles Gaudechon, who says he wants to both "protect what makes [Remedy] special" and "scale [the studio] in a way that builds lasting value".</p><figure role="group">

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Riot Games has laid off a number of employees working on the team-based fighting game <em>2XKO</em>, with the <em>League of Legends </em>and <em>Valorant </em>studio claiming that the game hasn't found an audience big enough to sustain its current team size.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/an-update-on-2xko" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">news update</a> on its official website, Riot says the decision to reduce <em>2XKO</em>'s team size was made "after a lot of discussion and reflection", and that a "smaller, focused team" will allow Riot to "dig in and make key improvements to the game".</p><p>Riot says that <em>2XKO</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/2xko-console-versions-due-in-january-apparently" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2eb90af4-d13f-41bc-92fe-ceb74ecc10fc" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">expansion from PC to console</a> allowed it to examine "consistent trends in how players were engaging" with the game, and that while a "passionate core audience" loves <em>2XKO</em>, "overall momentum hasn't reached the level needed" to support the current number of employees.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Somehow, I'd like to say this is Teemo's fault.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>With regard to the game's direction, Riot says its plans for the 2026 Competitive Series, at least, are "unchanged", and that it will continue to support "events and organizers that already power the FGC (fighting game community)".</p><p><em>2XKO </em>isn't shutting down or being canceled; rather, Riot says these layoffs will allow it to give the game "a more sustainable path forward", and that the studio intends to "continue communicating about how things are progressing".</p><p>As to the employees being laid off, Riot says it's provided "a minimum of six months of notice pay and severance" to employees for whom other positions within the organization couldn't be found.</p><p>Riot is far from the only studio to lay off employees in recent months. Others include the likes of <em>Ashes of Creation</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ashes-of-creation-layoffs-canceled-report" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1b59358e-2c0a-4543-a759-154075e27078" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Intrepid Studios</a>, <em>Tomb Raider </em>outfit <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crystal-dynamics-layoffs-november-2025" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9d6386f8-4642-4532-8c75-667f88869d6e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Crystal Dynamics</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-world-development-ending-amazon-layoffs" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="96fc63cd-c591-42ec-8af0-59f8445fa07b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Amazon Games</a>, to name but a few.</p>
<p>Indeed, these layoffs follow <em>League of Legends </em>staff cuts <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/riot-games-league-of-legends-layoffs" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c5ba3b27-ed4f-4082-a58d-666d9b21c396" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">back in late 2024</a>, so it's not like Riot itself is stranger to letting employees go, even those working on its more successful endeavors.</p><p>As for <em>2XKO</em>, if you'd like to check the fighting game out, you can do so <a href="https://2xko.riotgames.com/en-gb/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">for free right now</a> on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.
