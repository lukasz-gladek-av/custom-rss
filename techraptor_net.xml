            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/massive-darkness-dungeons-of-shadowreach-brings-improved-co-op-action-alongside-dd<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new <em>Massive Darkness</em> board game campaign is coming. CMON Interactive has announced the latest iteration of the co-op dungeon-crawling experience, <em>Massive Darkness: Dungeons of Shadowreach, </em>and an official TTRPG supplement based on the setting.</p>



<p>According to the Gamefound campaign page, <em>Massive Darkness: Dungeons of Shadowreach</em> will build upon the gameplay foundation of the previous Massive Darkness board games.</p>

<p>It is a standalone experience; you do not need any previous entry in the <em>Massive Darkness</em> series to play it. The game does not require a Game Master. You just need a group willing to work together, surviving twisted caverns, fighting monsters, and toppling mighty bosses.</p>

<p>Much like a fantasy RPG, pulling off such feats involves finding treasure, powerful magic items, and leveling up your party. The higher the level, the better loot they can acquire.</p>

<p>If you backed previous <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/massive-darkness-2-hellscape-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Massive Darkness</em></a> games, backing <em>Massive Darkness: Shadows of Dungeonreach </em>will provide you with some extra. A Gamefound exclusive Fire Giant roaming monster will be added to your pledge at no additional cost.</p>

A Bestiary and an Adventure Book using the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> 2014 ruleset. Given the series' grotesque and creative monster designs, these books can be valuable resources for GMs at their tables.</p>

<p>For those curious, the campaign page does have a work-in-progress guidebook for the board game that is free to download. Alternatively, the TTRPG has a freely available Quickstart Guide. It contains new lore, a prewritten adventure, premade characters, monsters, magic items, and more.</p>

<p>The <em>Massive Darkness: Shadows of Dungeonreach</em> campaign goes live tomorrow. At time of writing, there are no details regarding pledge levels or the MSRP of the game or the TTRPG books.</p>
