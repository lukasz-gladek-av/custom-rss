            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has revealed who's going to be looking after the <em>Assassin's Creed </em>franchise from now on, and three figures with plenty of past experience with the series will be taking the reins.</p><p>The announcement, which was made <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1rclibk/an_update_on_the_future_of_assassins_creed_meet/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">via Reddit</a> earlier today, names Martin Schelling as <em>Assassin's Creed</em>'s new "Head of Brand". Schelling will "lead the franchise team, as well as the overall strategy", according to Ubisoft. He's previously served as producer on games like <em>Black Flag </em>and <em>Valhalla</em>.</p><p>Joining Schelling at the helm of <em>Assassin's Creed </em>is Jean Guesdon, who was creative director on both <em>Black Flag </em>and <em>Origins</em>. He'll now be serving as "Head of Content", which will see him leading the franchise's "creative direction" and shaping its future "while ensuring it remains true to its DNA".</p><figure role="group">

<p>The final new <em>Assassin's Creed </em>appointment is Francois de Billy, who will serve in the rather oddly-named role of "Head of Production Excellence".</p><p>Apparently, it'll be de Billy's responsibility to "strengthen production practices and execution across the franchise". He was <em>Origins </em>and <em>Valhalla</em>'s Production Director, and he's also worked on "several major <em>Assassin's Creed </em>titles", including <em>Black Flag </em>and <em>Revelations</em>.</p><p>Between them, these three men will form <em>Assassin's Creed</em>'s new franchise leadership team, and Ubisoft says they'll "bring their expertise, knowledge, and passion to guide <em>Assassin's Creed </em>into its next chapter".</p><p>News of this team's formation comes after longtime <em>Assassin's Creed </em>boss Marc-Alexis Côté <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-boss-leaves-ubisoft-report" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bedd26ab-2db9-443d-9a58-5d57561ce134" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">departed Ubisoft back in October</a>, with Côté <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-assassins-creed-boss-suing-ubisoft" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="da42bb57-e4f1-4a65-91eb-9ce61dfcfee5" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">subsequently suing Ubisoft to the tune of more than $1.3 million</a> and claiming "constructive dismissal".</p><figure role="group">
