            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Steam has introduced age verification for UK users, with mature pages on the storefront now requiring valid credit card details showing that you're 18 or over to access.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/292B-3DA3-CFC8-97F6" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">new FAQ</a>, Steam's new UK age verification process has been introduced in order to comply with the country's new Online Safety Act, which has also affected other gaming-related websites <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nexus-mods-age-verification-uk-eu" rel="nofollow">like Nexus Mods</a>, as well as various key sellers.</p>

<p>In order to access mature content on Steam, you'll now need to provide valid credit card information, and your account will be "considered age verified" for as long as that information is stored. If you delete it, you'll need to add another one in order to access mature pages again.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steam-age-verification-uk-storefront.jpg?itok=9R1luE50 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steam-age-verification-uk-storefront.jpg?itok=-wPvY87Q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Steam will now require you to verify your age to access mature content if you're in the UK.</figcaption></figure><p>If you haven't added a card to your Steam account yet, you can do so via the Account Details page's "add a payment method to this account" option. The process is fairly straightforward; once you've been through it, you can change your store preferences to allow mature content.</p>

<p>Valve says it's using this particular method of verification because it "preserves the maximum degree of user privacy"; the data processed through verification is "identical to that of the millions of other Steam users who make purchases", according to Valve.</p>

<p>If you're concerned about not owning a credit card, I was able to add a valid debit card in order to verify my age, but it's possible that this isn't an intended verification method; in its own FAQ, Valve says individuals must be 18 to obtain a credit card, but in the UK, debit cards can be used by those as young as 16.</p>

<p>If Steam does indeed require users to specifically add a credit card to verify their age, that feels like an unfortunate oversight for the <a href="https://www.money.co.uk/credit-cards/credit-card-statistics" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">roughly 36%</a> of UK adults who don't have credit cards (myself included).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nexus-mods-steam-uk-age-verification.jpg?itok=Fzh6IRuC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nexus-mods-steam-uk-age-verification.jpg?itok=FpinpH_3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Other sites, like Nexus Mods, now also require age verification for UK users.</figcaption></figure><p>It looks like pages for games with mature content, like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-release-date-leak-playstation" rel="nofollow">recent release&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em></a>, aren't affected; this age verification system appears only to apply specifically to adult content on Steam. That may change in the future, however.</p>

<p>It's also worth noting that this new system only applies to UK users; if you're in the US, or anywhere else that doesn't have a similar law to the Online Safety Act, then you can continue using Steam just as you have been.</p>

<p>The Online Safety Act is likely to mean that more and more gaming-related sites and platforms incorporate age verification for UK users, so if you're based in the UK, you can expect this kind of thing to become more common as time goes by. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-luna-i</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/genshin-impact-version-luna-i-kicks-off-a-year-long-event-in-september.1284093/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has revealed the release date for&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version Luna I, a brand new update that's kicking off a year-long series of events themed around the moon.</p>

<p>Version Luna I, also known as "Song of the Welkin Moon: Segue", breaks with&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>tradition by eschewing the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-58-july" rel="nofollow">numbered designations</a> of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-57-release-date" rel="nofollow">previous updates</a>. It's due to land on all platforms on September 10th.</p>

<p>First off, Version Luna I introduces the new region of Nod-Krai, where you'll "become entangled in rising conflicts between factions", as well as meeting three new Nod-Krai natives who you'll have a chance to recruit for your team.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/genshin-impact-version-luna-i-release-date-enemies.jpg?itok=9q3Eepz4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/genshin-impact-version-luna-i-release-date-enemies.jpg?itok=Ikpz3ZbA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version Luna I will bring new enemies for you to fight and more.</figcaption></figure><p>The new region will bring new enemies and boss encounters for you to take on, as well as a new elemental lifeform that acts as a way to explore Nod-Krai and surmount its traversal puzzles.</p>

<p>Of course, it wouldn't be a&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>update without new characters to recruit, and the first of three new warriors for your team in this update is Lauma, a five-star Catalyst wielder who can boost Bloom damage and transform into a new half-human, half-deer form.</p>

<p>Joining her is Flins, a five-star Electro polearm user who can unleash powerful Lunar-charged strikes and "hear the whispers of the Wild Hunt during exploration". Lastly, Aino, a four-star Hydro Claymore user, adds "playful new interactions" to&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact</em>, and you can recruit her for free.</p>

<p>We also got some more information about&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact</em>'s user-generated content system, otherwise known as the Miliastra Sandbox, which will allow you to create your own experiences within the game,&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>-style. It's coming as part of the next update after this one.</p>




<p>As always, news of the new&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>update also came alongside codes you can use to get yourself some free goodies in the game, and here they are!</p>

<ul><li>LunaI0910 - 100 Primogems, 10 Mystic Enhancement Ore</li>
	<li>LaumaNodKraiFlins - 100 Primogems, 5 Hero's Wit</li>
	<li>HiFiveTraveler - 100 Primogems, 50,000 Mora</li>
</ul><p>News of&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact</em>'s latest update comes after developer HoYoverse announced it will <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-ps4-support-ending" rel="nofollow">stop supporting the PS4 version</a> of the gacha RPG next year.</p>

<p>The date of Version Luna I is also the day on which you'll no longer be able to download&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>on Sony's last-gen machine if you've never done so before, but don't worry; you can still play if you've downloaded it already, and what's more, the PS5 version will be unaffected by this change.</p>
