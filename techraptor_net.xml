            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-gamecube-switch-2-online<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has revealed that GameCube games are coming to Nintendo Switch Online as part of the Expansion Pack addon, but only if you've got a Switch 2.</p>

<p>The service, which already allows you to play the likes of SNES, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/game-boy-and-game-boy-advance-titles-are-finally-coming-to-nintendo-switch-online" rel="nofollow">Game Boy Advance</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/38-nintendo-switch-online-n64-games-are-planned-dataminer-says" rel="nofollow">N64</a> games, will be getting GameCube games on the same day as the Switch 2's launch, which, in case you missed it, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">is June 5th</a>.</p>

<p>Several GameCube games will be available for the service at launch, including&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</em>, fighting game&nbsp;<em>SoulCalibur 2&nbsp;</em>(complete with Link's cameo, of course), and racer&nbsp;<em>F-Zero GX</em>. See? Nintendo hasn't completely forgotten the franchise!</p>

<p>Other games being added in the future include the likes of&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Sunshine</em>,&nbsp;<em>Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</em>,&nbsp;<em>Pokemon XD: Gale of Darkness&nbsp;</em>(and <em>Pokemon Colosseum</em>),&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Strikers</em>,&nbsp;<em>Chibi-Robo</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Luigi's Mansion</em>.</p>

<p>Notable by its absence is&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</em>, so hopefully, Nintendo is planning to release an updated version of that game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metroid-prime-remastered-announced-and-available-today" rel="nofollow">along the lines of 2023's&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime Remastered</em></a>. A man can dream, right?</p>

<p>A dedicated GameCube controller designed in the same way as the original peripheral is also being released, and that, too, will be available on the same day as the Switch 2. You'll need to be a Switch Online member if you want to pick it up, though.</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5th. Its GameCube lineup, and GameCube controller (if you're a Switch Online member), also launch on the same day.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-announced.1152243/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced the Nintendo Switch 2 release date, and the console is coming in summer, just as many people predicted prior to today's Nintendo Direct show.</p>

<p>As revealed during the presentation, the Switch 2 will be launching on June 5th. That fits with accessory maker <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-release-april-september-nacon" rel="nofollow">Nacon's prediction</a> that the console would launch sometime between April and September (although that wasn't a particularly out-there prediction in the first place).</p>

<p>When it launches, the console will arrive with a 1080p screen, a 4K-supporting dock (for certain games), and 256GB of internal storage, and launch games like&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour&nbsp;</em>will be available alongside the machine.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-welcome-tour.jpg?itok=3ItutcNe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-welcome-tour.jpg?itok=DiBUZ16z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour&nbsp;</em>is one of the launch games that will be available for Switch 2 when it arrives in June.</figcaption></figure><p>As <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-specs-revealed" rel="nofollow">revealed earlier in the show</a>, the Switch 2 will also boast a built-in fan for its dock that allows you to cool the system in TV mode, as well as HDR support for both handheld and TV modes. It'll also support 4K resolution and up to 120fps for certain games.</p>

<p>The console will be able to play both Switch 2 games and original Switch games, although it doesn't look like it'll feature any kind of upscaling for the latter, unfortunately. 4K and 120fps won't be available for Switch 1 games, either, it seems.</p>

<p>Although that may be the case, "some games" that came to Switch will receive "upgraded versions" with improved visuals and more.&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Party Jamboree&nbsp;</em>was the first such game announced during the show.</p>

<p>The Switch 2 version of&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Party Jamboree&nbsp;</em>will "expand on the base game" and add features like mouse controls, audio recognition, "more expressive rumble", and support for the Nintendo Switch 2 Camera peripheral.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-super-mario-party-jamboree.jpg?itok=pDOSGW12 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-super-mario-party-jamboree.jpg?itok=Ib-5uGQd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Certain Switch games will receive updated versions for Nintendo Switch 2.</figcaption></figure><p>Other games under the new "Switch 2 Edition" banner include&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, both of which will get enhanced resolution and frame rates on Switch 2, as well as HDR support.</p>

<p><em>Kirby and the Forgotten Land&nbsp;</em>and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metroid-prime-4-beyond-2025" rel="nofollow">upcoming&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metroid-prime-4-beyond-2025" rel="nofollow">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>&nbsp;</em>will also be getting Switch 2 Edition releases, as will&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-a-announced" rel="nofollow"><em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em></a>, which is due out in the fall. If you already own the Switch versions of these games, you can buy an "Upgrade Pack" to change to the Switch 2 version.</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Switch 2 Specs Revealed During Today's Direct]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-specs-revealed</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-specs-revealed-during-todays-direct.1152240/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-specs-revealed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo revealed the specs for the Switch 2 during today's Nintendo Direct presentation, and it looks like the machine will bear many improvements over its predecessor.</p>

<p>First, Nintendo <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">unveiled&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em></a>, one of the system's launch titles, and following that, we got to see some of the new features and specifications the console will boast.</p>

<p>The Switch 2 will sport a 7.9-inch screen, but it'll maintain the original Switch's thickness. That screen will display up to 1080p resolution, and the system will support up to 120fps as well, although only "supported titles" will be compatible with that feature.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-direct-specs-handheld.jpg?itok=PZUjEYPG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-direct-specs-handheld.jpg?itok=04jSSREQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Nintendo Switch 2 looks like a pretty beefy machine compared to its predecessor.</figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo is promising "double the pixels" of the original Switch's screen for a sharper image, and the display will also support HDR for sharper contrast between colors. This mode will be supported in both handheld and TV mode.</p>

<p>Docking the Switch 2 allows you to play games in up to 4K resolution, although just like 120fps, only certain games will support this resolution. I'm assuming old-school Switch 1 games won't be compatible, sadly.</p>

<p>As was previously rumored, the Joy-Con 2 controllers will dock magnetically, and they'll also support mouse-style control; both Joy-Cons will be able to take advantage of this feature in "compatible games" (which is fast becoming a refrain, eh?).</p>

<p>The Switch 2 will feature 256GB of storage, and it'll also boast two USB-C ports: one on the bottom and one on the top. It looks like both ports will be able to support either chargers or additional accessories.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-direct-specs-usb-c-ports.jpg?itok=cZYdDS0F 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-direct-specs-usb-c-ports.jpg?itok=65V2iwbq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Switch 2 will boast two USB-C ports.</figcaption></figure><p>The dock will also feature a built-in fan to help your system cool down during more heated gameplay sessions, a feature that the original Switch's dock notably lacked.</p>

<p>During the Switch 2 Direct, we also got a look at the new GameChat feature, which is the purpose for the right Joy-Con 2's C button; it allows you to chat with your friends and access other social features during gaming.</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 Camera, an extra peripheral that lets you video chat with your friends, was also revealed. It'll launch on the same day as the Switch 2.</p>
