            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Free League has launched a new TTRPG crowdfunding campaign. The new game, <em>Twilight Sword</em>, is inspired by classic videogame RPGs and is the latest collaboration between the publisher and the developers of the high-octane experience, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/free-league-announces-publishing-partnership-for-cinematic-ttrpg-outgunned" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Outgunned</em></a>.</p>

<h2>The <em>Twilight Sword</em> Backerkit Announcement</h2>

<p>According to its Backerkit <a href="https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/two-little-mice/twilight-sword" rel="nofollow">campaign page</a>, <em>Twilight Sword</em> is a fantasy TTRPG that draws heavy inspiration from <em>Legend of Zelda</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-preview-return-to-eden" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dragon Quest</em></a>, and the art style of Studio Ghibli. The game has players exploring the world of Radia, a land that is under attack by the forces of evil and despair. Heroes will do this not just by fighting monsters, but by rekindling hope through acts of courage and selflessness.</p>

The Core Rulebook contains the rules for both players and GMs to play. <em>The Lands of Radia</em> book fleshes out an original fantasy setting full of monsters, villains, and quests for players to undertake. Lastly, there is a starter set for people curious about the game but don't have much time or money to commit to a full purchase.</p>

<p><em>Twilight Sword</em> uses an original gameplay system called CAT, or Created at Twilight. Skill rolls are resolved with a d12 roll tied to one of a character's eight skills. If the d12 result is equal to or lower than that skill's number, you succeed. Natural 1s are critical successes; natural 12s are critical failures.</p>

<p>Other features of the game include a Hope/Despair mechanic. Hope is built up when characters perform selfless or kind acts, which can dispel Despair, which protects strongholds controlled by the bad guys.</p>

<p>In addition, it will include a high level of character customisation. Each character picks one of two Ways, which gives them unique perks and feats, and one of five playable Kin, such as human, catperson, and penguin.</p>
