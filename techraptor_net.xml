            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lego-pokemon-announced-2026<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Lego and The Pokemon Company have announced that a Lego&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>collaboration is coming in 2026, although details about the collaboration are fairly scant right now.</p>

<p>The collaboration was <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/themes/pokemon/about" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> on the official Lego website today, accompanied by a single teaser image that shows both the Lego and&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>logos, as well as what appears to be a Pikachu's tail rendered in Lego form.</p>

<p>As such, we can probably expect to see Pikachu making an appearance in the Lego sets, but considering that the little electric mouse is easily the most popular Pokemon in the world, that shouldn't come as too much of a surprise.</p>

<p>The company goes on to describe its&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>crossover as "a real Lego&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>adventure", so it sounds like it'll be more than just some sets you can build with bricks; we can, perhaps, expect some interactive elements along the lines of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/build-real-life-mario-courses-with-lego-super-mario" rel="nofollow">the Lego&nbsp;<em>Mario&nbsp;</em>sets</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to keep up to date with the Lego <i>Pokemon&nbsp;</i>collaboration, you can do so by signing up to the Lego Insiders <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/insiders" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">newsletter program</a>, which will keep you informed about everything to do with the crossover going forward.</p>

<p>Of course, this won't be the first collaboration between Nintendo and Lego; the two have crossed over on the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Mario&nbsp;</em>Lego sets, as well as sets for&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-ever-lego-mario-kart-sets" rel="nofollow"><em>Mario Kart</em></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lego-animal-crossing" rel="nofollow"><em>Animal Crossing</em></a>.</p>

<p>The presentation also revealed a new battling game by the name of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Champions</em>, as well as several updates to existing&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>titles. It's all go for the world's biggest media franchise.</p>
