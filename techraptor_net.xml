            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crashlands-2-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Butterscotch Shenanigans has announced the&nbsp;<em>Crashlands 2&nbsp;</em>release date, with the hotly-anticipated crafting RPG sequel (crash) landing on PC and mobiles in a couple of months.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Crashlands 2&nbsp;</em>arrives on April 10th. It'll serve as the sequel to 2016's much-loved&nbsp;<em>Crashlands</em>, which Butterscotch Shenanigans says has amassed "more than 1.8 million downloads" since being released back in 2016.</p>

<p><em>Crashlands 2&nbsp;</em>will once again take you to the planet of Woanope, and you'll once more play the role of "intergalactic trucker and disgruntled corporate employee" Flux Dabes, so this sequel will feel like a real homecoming if you enjoyed the original.</p>

Before the vacation starts, however, a "mysterious blast" from Woanope's surface sends Dabes crashing to its surface once more.</p>

<p>From there, you must venture into what Butterscotch Shenanigans calls "a beautiful living wilderness" complete with its own alien ecosystem. You'll need to learn how that ecosystem works and exploit it to your advantage in order to survive.</p>

<p>While&nbsp;<em>Crashlands 2&nbsp;</em>carries the same sense of intrepid exploration as its predecessor, it's also an altogether more cozy affair. You'll be able to build your very own comfy quarters on the surface of Woanope, filling it with "all the pets, friends, and trophies you collect along the way".</p>

<p>That's not to say there isn't a story to discover. Butterscotch Shenanigans says that "something's not quite right" on the planet of Woanope, so together with new friends and allies, you must unite the planet's factions to restore balance.</p>




<p>Butterscotch Shenanigans CEO Adam Coster says it knows the original&nbsp;<em>Crashlands&nbsp;</em>was "an important part" of many players' childhoods (way to make me feel old, Adam). As such,&nbsp;<em>Crashlands 2&nbsp;</em>has "grown up as much as they have".</p>

<p><em>Crashlands 2</em>, er, lands on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1401730/Crashlands_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and mobile devices on April 10th.</p>
