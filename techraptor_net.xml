<p>If you're not familiar with <em>Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot</em>, it is, as you've probably already surmised, an action RPG based on the long-running <em>Dragon Ball </em>series (the creator of which, Akira Toriyama, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-akira-toriyama-dies-at-68" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="8ae39a53-9e74-423d-ab8a-749d419a6fa3" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">sadly passed away in March 2024</a> aged just 68).</p><p>The game follows the events of the <em>Dragon Ball Z </em>anime series and includes four major arcs as part of its base offering, namely the Saiyan, Frieza, Cell, and Buu Sagas. Originally available on last-gen machines, it netted itself a PS5 and Xbox Series X|S release <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-z-kakarot-comes-ps5-xbox-series-next-year" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="cea9dab9-2fc1-4b67-a605-60c63a5ed2e2" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">in 2023</a>.</p><p>Extra storylines from other <em>Dragon Ball </em>media, including the likes of <em>Dragon Ball Super </em>and <em>Dragon Ball Daima</em>, are available as DLC, with the latest expansion taking players to <em>Daima</em>'s Demon Realm.</p><p>The first part of said DLC is already out for you to try, and the second part will be arriving in just a few days, so you won't have to wait too long to witness its conclusion.</p>
