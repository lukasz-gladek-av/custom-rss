            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/half-life-2-steam-player-count-record<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Half-Life 2&nbsp;</em>player numbers on Steam have shot up following an anniversary update released last week, resulting in the game reaching its highest concurrent Steam player count since its release.</p>

<p>A quick look at&nbsp;<em>Half-Life 2</em>'s <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/220/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB charts</a>&nbsp;shows that the game managed to reach 64,085 players around 21 hours ago (at time of writing), which is its highest total of all time on the platform.</p>

<p>At time of writing, 45,121 players were still enjoying Gordon Freeman's second major adventure, so&nbsp;<em>Half-Life 2&nbsp;</em>is still riding that wave of renewed popularity. Who knows for how much longer it will last? Let's hope a while, at least.</p>

<p>The update adds both Episode One and Episode Two to the base&nbsp;<em>Half-Life 2&nbsp;</em>game, so if you somehow own&nbsp;<em>Half-Life 2&nbsp;</em>but not its expansions, then you can now enjoy those at no additional cost. They're well worth it!</p>

<p>You'll also now find developer commentaries for the original game included in the Steam package, as well as Steam Workshop support to make modding a little easier. Several visual bugs have been fixed, and new graphics options have been added to "push the visual fidelity of&nbsp;<em>Half-Life 2</em>".</p>

<p>If you want to know how&nbsp;<em>Half-Life 2&nbsp;</em>was made, then you'll also probably find the new documentary, created by the folks behind a similar project for the original&nbsp;<em>Half-Life</em>'s&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/half-life-update-by-valve-available-now-with-steam-deck-support" rel="nofollow">25th anniversary</a>, entertaining and interesting.</p>

The game is currently being given away <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/220/HalfLife_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">for free on Steam</a>, with the giveaway running until 10am Pacific today (that's 1pm Eastern). Grab it if you haven't already.</p>

<p>This&nbsp;<em>Half-Life 2&nbsp;</em>update arrives not long after the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/project-white-sands-codename-half-life-rumor" rel="nofollow">discovery of something codenamed&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/project-white-sands-codename-half-life-rumor" rel="nofollow">White Sands</a>&nbsp;</em>once again set off speculation around a new <i>Half-Life&nbsp;</i>game earlier this year. Just in case you need reminding, White Sands is the name of a location in New Mexico, which is also where&nbsp;<em>Half-Life</em>'s Black Mesa is located.</p>
