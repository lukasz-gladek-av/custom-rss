            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/spooky-palworld-halloween-skins<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Pocketpair has released a set of seriously spooky&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>Halloween skins, with four of the game's Pals getting terrifying new looks just in time for tomorrow's scarefest.</p>

<p>The update sees Cattiva, Croajiro, Katress, and Pengullet getting different Halloween-themed looks, although in the case of Pengullet, the new skin might be stretching the definition of Halloween a touch.</p>

<p>Cattiva gets a new pumpkin-themed skin, while Croajiro gets an adorable-looking witch outfit. Katress gets some fetching spectacles to complement its already-Halloweeny look, and Pengullet gets a pirate costume. I guess pirates are sort of scary!</p>

Aww.</figcaption></figure><p>All four of these skins are completely free of charge, and you should receive them the next time you boot up&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>, although naturally, you will need to have at least one of the Pals the skins are for in order to reap the benefits.</p>

<p>It's not just the Halloween skins that are coming as part of this update, either. The multiplayer text chat character limit has been "significantly relaxed", so you can now type longer messages to your friends.</p>

<p>Bug fixes, including memory leak patches and a fix for a strange PS5-specific issue wherein a tree would respawn inside a structure that's built over it, have also been implemented. The update is free to download now, so make sure you check it out.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>, it's an open-world survival game with a focus on creature-collecting and base-building.</p>

<p>Developed by Japanese studio Pocketpair, the game was released earlier this year to massive success, passing <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-25-million-players-matching-pokemon-scarlet-violet">the 25 million player mark</a> just a month or so after its release (although a day-one Game Pass release certainly didn't hurt those numbers).</p>

<p>The game has been remarked upon for its creatures' apparent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-palworld-trailers-show-more-pokemon-like-mayhem-how-you-cook-them">resemblance to Nintendo's&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>franchise</a>, and Nintendo itself has also apparently been taking notice; the gaming giant <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-palworld-pocketpair-lawsuit">is suing Pocketpair</a>&nbsp;for "patent infringement".</p>

<p><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/palworld-game-preview/9NKV34XDW014" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10011027" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and you can play it as part of Xbox Game Pass if you're a subscriber. A <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-mobile-version-krafton">mobile version is also apparently in development</a> at&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>publisher Krafton.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[EA Enjoys Record Q2 Thanks to Live Service Games]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-q2-2025-financial-results</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-enjoys-record-q2-thanks-to-live-service-games.1023033/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-q2-2025-financial-results<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has enjoyed its most successful second quarter in history, largely thanks to the performance of the company's sports games portfolio.</p>

<p>According to the company's latest <a href="https://s204.q4cdn.com/701424631/files/doc_financials/2025/q2/Q2-FY25-Earnings-Slides-FINAL.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">financial results presentation</a>, the $2.1 billion in net bookings EA raked in this year sets a record for Q2, with live service games like&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC 25&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/us-sales-data-july-circana">driving 74%</a> of those bookings.</p>

<p>The studio notes that its American football offerings are "on track to exceed $1 billion in net bookings" for this fiscal year, demonstrating just how savvy a decision it was for EA to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-sports-college-football-deal-covers-4-games">get back into the college football gaming space</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ea-sports-college-football-25-dive.jpg?itok=zZkZ3aR_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ea-sports-college-football-25-dive.jpg?itok=-SSBYdR6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>EA is having a pretty good year so far, and it has its sports offerings to thank for that.</figcaption></figure><p>It's not just sports games, though;&nbsp;<em>The Sims 4&nbsp;</em>is also part of what's made the year so successful for EA so far.</p>

<p>The free-to-play life sim has apparently drawn in more than 15 million players over the past year, although EA doesn't go into detail about how many of those players stuck around or bought anything within the game with real-world cash.</p>

<p>Still, those numbers will likely give EA a good reason to be proud of its decision <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-no-plans-the-sims-5">not to pursue&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-no-plans-the-sims-5">The Sims 5</a>&nbsp;</em>and to focus on development on&nbsp;<em>The Sims 4&nbsp;</em>instead.</p>

<p>It's also no surprise that it's mostly live service offerings that are driving EA's success so far this fiscal year. Since the beginning of April, EA has released precisely one non-live service game,&nbsp;<em>Tales of Kenzera: Zau</em>, and that clearly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-of-kenzera-zau-developer-redundancy-notice">hasn't had the impact</a> the publisher had hoped it would.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-kenzera-zau-ea-financials.jpg?itok=IVWA_k27 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tales-of-kenzera-zau-ea-financials.jpg?itok=JKu0qDwd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>EA has released one non-live service game so far this fiscal year, and it doesn't seem to have done much to contribute to revenue.</figcaption></figure><p>It's also worth noting that the reporting period for this fiscal presentation ends on September 30th, which means that whatever sales&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-release-date-leaked-trailer"><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>manages to achieve</a> will be counted in the figures for the third quarter.</p>

<p>EA's record quarter comes after the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/electronic-arts-to-lay-off-5-of-its-workforce-amid-refocus-on-owned-ip-and-sports-games">laid off around 5% of its workforce</a> back in February (which technically falls under last fiscal year), cancelling a&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>first-person shooter in development at Respawn in the process.</p>

<p>Those layoffs didn't stop CEO Andrew Wilson from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-ceo-25-million-income-layoffs">making more than $25 million</a> last year, but given today's results, I guess we now know why EA's board is so keen on Wilson.</p>
