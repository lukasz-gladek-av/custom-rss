            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bungie CEO Pete Parsons has announced he's stepping down after over 20 years with the company, and he'll be handing his responsibilities over to another long-time Bungie staffer.</p>

<p>In an announcement on the official Bungie <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/passing_the_torch" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, Parsons says he's "decided to pass the torch" and that now is the "right time for a new beginning", but he doesn't elaborate on his reasons for leaving any further than that.</p>

<p>Parsons will be handing his CEO role over to Justin Truman, who previously served as&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>'s General Manager and the chief development officer of Bungie as a whole. It sounds as though the transition will be instantaneous, since no other date is given.</p>

<p>He's also been helping Bungie to develop&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>, so it's fair to say he's been across everything the studio has worked on for the last ten years or so. It's easy to see why Parsons picked Truman for a successor.</p>

<p>Truman inherits a Bungie that is, to put it charitably, struggling somewhat.&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>'s rollout isn't exactly going smoothly; the game was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marathon-release-date-gameplay-revealed" rel="nofollow">due to launch in September</a>, but was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shocking-no-one-bungies-marathon-delayed" rel="nofollow">delayed to an unspecified point in the future</a> following lackluster feedback from the first closed alpha test.</p>

<p>The extraction shooter also found itself in hot water back in May, when it was revealed that artwork used in the game had been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-marathon-art-stolen" rel="nofollow">taken from an online artist</a> without permission or compensation (which, incidentally, is <a href="https://x.com/elementj21/status/1671281580831297536" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">not the first time</a> Bungie has been caught doing something like this).</p>

We'll have to wait and see whether he achieves that goal.</p>
