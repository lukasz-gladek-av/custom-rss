            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-marathon-art-stolen<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>developer Bungie has acknowledged that some of the art featured in the game was stolen from an artist who didn't work on the game, promising a "thorough review" of&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>'s "in-game assets" as a result.</p>

<p>For context, artist Antireal <a href="https://x.com/4nt1r34l/status/1923067988871147605" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">alleged</a> yesterday that&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>'s environments are "covered with assets lifted from poster designs [she] made in 2017", posting a number of examples of areas in which&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>'s art was lifted from her own&nbsp;as proof.</p>

<p>In response to Antireal's allegations, Bungie, <a href="https://x.com/MarathonDevTeam/status/1923217324384903262" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">posting</a> on the&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>development team's account, confirmed that "a former Bungie artist included [Antireal's designs] in a texture sheet that was ultimately used in-game".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bungie-marathon-artwork-stolen-antireal.jpg?itok=tf1fookp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bungie-marathon-artwork-stolen-antireal.jpg?itok=OY9DC327 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>has a pretty distinctive art style, but not all of that style is Bungie's, it seems.</figcaption></figure><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/MarathonDevTeam/status/1923217325722874199" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">thread</a>, Bungie says its current art team didn't know about the artwork's theft, and that the studio is "still reviewing how this oversight occurred".</p>

<p>As a result of the stolen artwork's discovery, Bungie says it will now conduct a "thorough review" of&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>'s asset pool, specifically assets created or contributed by the former artist in question (who isn't named, for obvious reasons).</p>

<p>Additionally, Bungie says it will be "implementing stricter checks to document all artist contributions", although I'm honestly pretty shocked those checks weren't in place to begin with and that something so egregious could get through unnoticed.</p>

<p>The studio says it's "reached out" to Antireal to talk about the issue and is "committed to do right by the artist", as well as by "all artists who contribute" to Bungie's games.</p>




<p>Bungie's lax security when it comes to spotting stolen artwork is even more upsetting given that this isn't the studio's first time being accused of stealing from fans. In 2021, Bungie <a href="https://x.com/Cozmo23/status/1442534201165635587" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">used a fan depiction</a> of one of its characters in promo material, subsequently apologizing and crediting the correct artist.</p>

<p>After that incident, in 2023, a&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2&nbsp;</em>fan claimed Bungie had stolen their art for an in-game cutscene, an allegation that Bungie itself subsequently <a href="https://x.com/Destiny2Team/status/1671927000498597888" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">confirmed was true</a>. Then, in 2024, artist Tofu <a href="https://x.com/Tofu_Rabbit/status/1833851336607101076" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">accused</a> Bungie of stealing a weapon design they had made in 2015, and again, Bungie copped to doing so.</p>

<p>I don't want to cast aspersions, but I also don't know how many times something has to happen before it can be considered a pattern. Let's just say I wouldn't be surprised if Bungie was caught out for stealing fan artwork again before&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>is released.</p>

<p>If this whole thing hasn't left a bad taste in your mouth and you still want to check out&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>, you can do so when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3065800/Marathon/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/marathon/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/marathon/9pb32dkqkzdq" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on September 23rd.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/industry-veteran-jade-raymond-leaves-fairgame-developer-haven-studios.1191252/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/jade-raymond-leaves-haven-studios<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Industry veteran Jade Raymond has departed Haven Studios, the studio she co-founded back in 2021. The studio is ostensibly currently hard at work on live-service heist shooter&nbsp;<em>Fairgame$</em>.</p>

<p>According to a (paywalled) Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-15/playstation-executive-jade-raymond-leaves-studio-she-founded" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">article</a>, Sony didn't give a reason for Raymond's departure to Haven staffers, but Bloomberg, citing "people with knowledge of the matter", says her departure comes after an external test of&nbsp;<em>Fairgame$&nbsp;</em>about which Haven developers were "concerned".</p>

<p>Specifically, Haven's workers are said to have been worried about&nbsp;<em>Fairgame$</em>' development progress, as well as its reception during the external test. It sounds like another one of Sony's live-service gambles might be in trouble.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fairgame-heist-jade-raymond.jpg?itok=FAVNdBo- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fairgame-heist-jade-raymond.jpg?itok=0EfyB301 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Jade Raymond has departed&nbsp;<em>Fairgame$&nbsp;</em>developer Haven.</figcaption></figure><p>In a statement given to Bloomberg, Sony describes Raymond as "an incredible partner and visionary force" for Haven. The studio says it wishes Raymond "all the best in her next chapter", and that it is "committed" to supporting Haven and its new co-leads Marie-Eve Danis and Pierre-Francois Sapinski.</p>

<p>No update is provided on the progress of&nbsp;<em>Fairgame$</em>, which was initially <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-showcase-here-are-all-trailers-announcements" rel="nofollow">revealed all the way back in 2023</a>. That means it's been almost two years since Haven or PlayStation provided any kind of information about the project.</p>

<p>According to Bloomberg,&nbsp;<em>Fairgame$&nbsp;</em>was originally slated to launch in fall 2025, but the publication's sources say that the game has been delayed to spring next year. No official release window has been revealed by Sony yet.</p>

<p>If&nbsp;<em>Fairgame$&nbsp;</em>has indeed been delayed, it'll be another setback for Sony's live-service slate, which has so far arguably failed to produce a compelling result beyond <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-financials-helldivers-2-sales" rel="nofollow">last year's&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em></a>, although it has managed to produce one catastrophic failure <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds" rel="nofollow">in the form of hero shooter&nbsp;<em>Concord</em></a>.</p>




<p>As well as&nbsp;<em>Fairgame$</em>, Sony's upcoming live-service slate includes Bungie's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marathon-release-date-gameplay-revealed" rel="nofollow">extraction shooter&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em></a>&nbsp;and an as-yet-untitled <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/teamlfg-playstation-studios-ex-bungie" rel="nofollow">project from teamLFG</a>, a studio made up of ex-Bungie staffers.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen whether these two projects - or, indeed,&nbsp;<em>Fairgame$</em>&nbsp;- can provide the live-service hit Sony so badly wants. In the meantime, though, the studio will just have to fall back on its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-sales-pass-548-milion-units-marvels-spider-man-2-has-sold-10-million-copies" rel="nofollow">slate</a> of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/horizon-forbidden-west-sales" rel="nofollow">ludicrously successful</a> single-player <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/god-of-war-ragnarok-sold-11-million-copies" rel="nofollow">titles</a>. There are worse fates.</p>
