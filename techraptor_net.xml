            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has officially revealed&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest Smash/Grow</em>, a mobile roguelite RPG that features classic&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest&nbsp;</em>enemies and aesthetics, and you could get a chance to try it out soon.</p>

<p>According to the game's new <a href="https://smashgrow.dragonquest.com/en/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official website</a>,&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest Smash/Grow&nbsp;</em>is a game in which you'll "smash your way through hordes of monsters", using "<em>Dragon Quest</em>'s signature Coup de Grace attacks" to deal huge damage to them.</p>

<p>Each run will bestow random Blessings on you to augment certain parts of your playstyle, so you'll need to "adapt your battle strategy to match an ever-changing tactical situation", according to Square Enix. The studio says that "no quest is ever the same" in the game.</p>

<p>Since&nbsp;<em>Smash/Grow&nbsp;</em>is a roguelite, it's likely that there will be some element of permanent progress as well; perhaps you'll unlock new Blessings for future runs, or maybe you'll progress through a story as each run concludes.</p>

<p>Either way, you may well get a chance to try the game out sooner than later, because a closed beta test is taking place between October 14th and October 21st. Since it's a closed beta, though, you'll need to <a href="https://smashgrow.dragonquest.com/en/cbt/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">apply to enter</a>.</p>

<p>The test will require you to have either an iOS device that's equivalent to the iPhone XR or later or an Android device with a Snapdragon 855 SoC (or better, of course). There are 30,000 places available, so make sure to get your application in quickly!</p>




<p>It's all go for&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest&nbsp;</em>right now. During <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-september-2025-recap" rel="nofollow">last week's Nintendo Direct show</a>, Square Enix announced a full 3D remake of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest VII</em>, and work is apparently <a href="https://gamerant.com/dragon-quest-12-update-may-2025/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">continuing</a> on&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest XII</em>, although we still don't know too much about the game.</p>

<p><em>Dragon Quest Smash/Grow&nbsp;</em>is set to come to Android and iOS devices sometime next year, and the closed beta is scheduled to take place in October. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Twilight Imperium Digital Brings the Legendary Tabletop Game to PC]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Red Square Games and Asmodee have announced&nbsp;<em>Twilight Imperium Digital</em>, and it is, as you've probably already guessed, a Steam version of the popular (if extremely weighty) tabletop game.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://x.com/RedSquare_Games/status/1967984321970540682" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement post</a> on social media, Red Square says the digital version of&nbsp;<em>Twilight Imperium&nbsp;</em>has been made "with love by fans at Red Square Games and Asmodee", and that the game is for both "the old guard" and "the new heirs".</p>

<p>The game's Steam page describes it as an adaptation of what the two studios call a "legendary board game of galactic conquest" which has been "reimagined for digital play", so there should be a few concessions to make it a little more streamlined on Steam (steamlined?).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/twilight-imperium-digital-board.jpg?itok=FWy1wyn4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/twilight-imperium-digital-board.jpg?itok=K9xAsUQn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Twilight Imperium Digital&nbsp;</em>adapts the legendary strategy game for Steam "soon".</figcaption></figure><p>If you're familiar with&nbsp;<em>Twilight Imperium</em>, you'll probably know how this one's going to play out. Expect a vast game of diplomacy, combat, and exploration in which you'll need to decide whether to trade peacefully with your other players or dominate them with military might.</p>

<p><em>Twilight Imperium Digital&nbsp;</em>will offer 17 unique factions, each of which boasts "asymmetric powers and playstyles", and it also promises "massive replayability" thanks to its randomized galaxies and objectives.</p>

<p>If you can't convince anybody else to play this one with you, there's a solo mode in which you can take on a computer opponent, but naturally,&nbsp;<em>Twilight Imperium Digital&nbsp;</em>will thrive best in multiplayer. The game also supports hotseat and asynchronous play so you can enjoy it "at your own pace".</p>

<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Twilight Imperium Digital</em>, which should give you a decent sense of how the game will play out in comparison to the tabletop experience, right here.</p>




<p><em>Twilight Imperium Digital&nbsp;</em>doesn't have a release date yet, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3669430/Twilight_Imperium_Digital/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wishlist it on Steam right here</a>. Hey, who knows? Maybe this will lead to a digital version of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/twilight-imperium-spinoff-twilight-inscription-announced" rel="nofollow">spinoff&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/twilight-imperium-spinoff-twilight-inscription-announced" rel="nofollow">Twilight Inscription</a>&nbsp;</em>somewhere down the line.</p>
