            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Over the weekend at GenCon, Wizards of the Coast dropped new information on their upcoming <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> Forgotten Realms supplements. They outlined what players can expect when returning to the most iconic setting in the enduring fantasy TTRPG.</p>

<h2>The Dungeons &amp; Dragons Forgotten Realms Supplement Preview</h2>

<p>As archived in a post on <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/2032-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-new" rel="nofollow">D&amp;D Beyond</a>, Wizards of the Coast has announced that the new <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Forgotten Realms supplement will be broken up into two books: <em>Forgotten Realms: Heroes of Faerun</em> and <em>Forgotten Realms: Adventures in Faerun</em>. Both of these supplements are for <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-player-handbook-review-mixed-messaging-around-strong" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024</a>, also referred to as 5.5 Edition by the community.</p>

The book will include information on regional factions like The Harpers and the Zhentarim, an overview of various locales for player backstories, and a bunch of new backgrounds feats, and subclasses like the Bladesinger Wizard and the Scion of the Three Rogue. The subclasses are notable since they appeared in <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/latest-dungeons-dragons-2024-unearthed-arcana-revisits-arcane-subclasses" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Unearthed Arcana</a> back in June.</p>

<p>Curiously, this new book includes a new mechanic called Circle Magic. The overview is brief, referring to it as "cooperative casting magic," but it does invite speculation.</p>

<p>The second <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Forgotten Realms book, Forgotten Realms: Adventures in Faerun, is all about DM materials. It will contain over 50 prewritten adventures for levels 1-15, five gazetteers on key areas of Faerun like Icewind Dale or Baldur's Gate, over 50 quickplay maps, new monster and villain statblocks, and new magic items and bastions.</p>

<p>Wizards of the Coast has also included some digital exclusives with these books. Three digital supplements are being sold at an MSRP of $14.99. <em>Astarion's Book of Hungers</em>, which will include vampiric rules, an updated Dhampir player option, and a prewritten adventure featuring the titular vampire from <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/baldurs-gate-3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a>.</p>

The details on the third book are yet to be announced.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Forgotten Realms books are available for pre-order. Both <em>Heroes of Faerun</em> and <em>Adventures in Faerun</em> are available in physical (MSRP $49.99), digital (MSRP $29.99) and physical and digital (MSRP $ 59.99) bundles. In addition, there is an Ultimate Bundle that includes digital and physical copies of both books, the digital expansions, and digital dice and maps for D&amp;D Beyond (MSRP $159.99).</p>

<p>The books are expected to release November 11.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Larian Studios is celebrating&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>'s second anniversary, and as part of those celebrations, the developer has released some fun statistics about the celebrated CRPG, including which of the game's cast is the most-respecced character and more.</p>

<p>As part of&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>'s Community Update 35 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/538860954058754131" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on Steam</a>, Larian reveals that the cleric Shadowheart is the game's most-respecced character, which, if you're new to CRPGs, means she's the one whose class or subclass players have changed the most.</p>

<p>According to Larian, Shadowheart was most often switched to either the Life Domain or Death Domain subclasses, so while players aren't changing her overall class, they're clearly split on which cleric path Shadowheart should follow. That makes sense, given her personal storyline.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/baldurs-gate-3-most-respecced-character-party.jpg?itok=l6VTBt82 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/baldurs-gate-3-most-respecced-character-party.jpg?itok=mx03uKYn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Shadowheart is&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>'s most-respecced character.</figcaption></figure><p>Wyll and Gael are in second and third place respectively, which, again, makes sense; I never quite found a place for Wyll in my party, so I turned him into a paladin, although that might fly in the face of the predicament in which he finds himself in the game.</p>

<p>Some other fun&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>stats include the 4,647 players who managed to beat the game's Honour Mode at level one, as well as the 350 players who decided that returning character Minsc would be better served as a Death Domain cleric. Hmm.</p>

<p>You can also see a bunch of fun photo mode creations that players have put together in the Steam post, as well as some info about what Larian is up to over the next few months (although that probably doesn't involve the studio announcing its next game, unfortunately).</p>




<p>The final major&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>update <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-major-baldurs-gate-3-update-patch-notes" rel="nofollow">was released back in April</a>, bringing features like a photo mode, crossplay between platforms, and cross-platform progression to allow you to continue your save across PC and console.</p>
