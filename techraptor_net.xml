            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>NetEase has released the first trailer for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>Season 3, and while it's just an animated teaser, it does reveal who the next two playable characters to join the roster will be.</p>

<p>The trailer sees none other than Phoenix, also known as Jean Grey, battling a "new queen" awakened by the symbiotic supervillain Knull. The story for the season will see Grey and the Phoenix Force battling "the god of the symbiotes".</p>

<p>However, she won't be able to do battle with Knull alone, according to NetEase. She's going to need the help of "a warrior of two worlds who lives to fight against the tide of night", which, if you haven't guessed yet, refers to the vampire hunter Blade.</p>

<p>Phoenix and Blade's presence won't come as a surprise to anyone who's been paying attention to the discourse; both characters were <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/comments/1lml6bd/twitch_leaked_the_next_two_marvel_rivals/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">leaked</a>, along with their full movesets, a few days ago.</p>

<p><em>Marvel Rivals</em>' third season, also called The Abyss Awakens, is set to arrive on July 11th, bringing the aforementioned two playable characters with it. If <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-season-2-emma-frost-ultron" rel="nofollow">previous</a>&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-modding-clampdown" rel="nofollow">seasons</a> are anything to go by, there will probably be a host of balance changes too.</p>




<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>itself, it's an<i>&nbsp;Overwatch</i>-style hero shooter that features a roster full of Marvel characters, some of whom are more obscure than others.</p>

<p>On the one hand, favorites like the aforementioned Iron Man and Black Widow, as well as others like Spider-Man and Thor, are present, but you'll also find more off-the-beaten-path characters like Magik and Jeff the Land Shark here.</p>

<p><em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>is available to play for free right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2767030/Marvel_Rivals/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/marvel-rivals/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/marvel-rivals/9n8pmw7qmd3d" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.
