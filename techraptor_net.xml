            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco and FromSoftware have announced when you can expect the&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>duos update to land, and it's not too far away at all, so get ready to revisit Limveld with your buddy.</p>

<p><i>Elden Ring Nightreign</i>'s duos mode was first <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-confirmed-sales" rel="nofollow">revealed in early June</a>, but now, the two studios have <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1948745061984014727" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">unveiled</a> the date on which you'll be able to tackle Limveld's dangers with just one other person: July 30th.</p>

<p>The ability to play in a duo will be added as part of patch 1.02, which will also bring new ways to sort relics, hopefully making organizing your favorite loadouts a little easier.</p>

At launch, the game only supported solo play or squads of three, and players quickly began requesting a duo mode, which FromSoftware was evidently happy to implement.</p>

<p>After release,&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>received a number of updates, adding features like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-adel-upgraded-update" rel="nofollow">new superpowered versions</a> of the Nightlord bosses to take on, plus new quality-of-life improvements and more.</p>

<p>News of the duos update's release date comes shortly after&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-nightreign-sales" rel="nofollow">reached five million sales</a>&nbsp;earlier this week, with&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>DLC currently sitting at ten million. Those are some pretty encouraging numbers for Bandai Namco, I'm sure.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, it's a multiplayer-focused spinoff of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>that sees players descending on a randomly-generated map in order to kill minibosses, loot gear, and get strong enough to take on a boss at the end of each run.</p>




<p>The game is one of two major multiplayer-oriented titles in FromSoftware's slate for the next couple of years; the other is&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods</em>, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-duskbloods-fromsoftware-nintendo-switch-2" rel="nofollow">Switch 2-exclusive PvPvE game</a> set to launch sometime next year.</p>
