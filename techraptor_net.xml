Their debut title, <em>Terrible Influence</em>, is described as a satirical board game with comedian Mark Cope as its lead designer.</p>



<p>According to an official press release, the first public demo for <em>Terrible Influence</em> will be made available at PAX Unplugged 2024 in the Forever Stoked booth at the Pennsylvania Convention Center. The convention begins Friday, December 6 and ends Sunday, December 8.</p>

The goal is to draw in an audience of passionate (and possibly deranged) fans and accrue as much wealth as possible, triggering juicy scandals along the way. You'll need that money and influence to avoid the consequences of Leaked DMs, Internet Trolls, and various Cancel cards. After all, if you're famous and rich enough consequences just go away.</p>

<p>The different online superstars in <em>Terrible Influence</em> include a funny podcaster, a vlogger with actual talent, a marketing-savvy reality TV show star, and many others. Players can gain valuable skill cards like Good Looking or Great Personality, and can role-play lucrative scenarios like sponsor ads or acceptance speeches to earn more money.</p>

To become President, naturally.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The game is a comedic and frankly cynical journey through our modern society, where players try to earn as much money and fame as possible in order to win the game and become President” said Mark Cope, Creator and Lead designer of Terrible Influence. “The real humor comes from the wild bonuses and absurd scandals throughout the game, and if I’m honest, those are pulled more from real life than satire.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cope has over 15 years of film and TV experience, including the stop-motion series <em>The Most Popular Girls in School</em> and <em>Dr. Havoc's Diary</em>. Cope has also helped create shows and branded campaigns for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-sales-30m" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Harry Potter</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/mattel-committing-to-board-game-accessibility-going-forward" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Mattel</a>, and TruTV.</p>

<p><em>Terrible Influence</em> will launch on Kickstarter in 2025.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nes-tetris-coming-to-nintendo-switch-online-new-tetris-the-grand-master-game-announced.1050615/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tetris-nintendo-switch-online-the-grand-master<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced another new NES addition to the Nintendo Switch Online library, and you're bound to get along with this one if you like classic old-school puzzle games.</p>

<p>None other than the NES version of legendary block-arranging puzzler&nbsp;<em>Tetris&nbsp;</em>is heading to Switch Online next week; it'll be added to the service's lineup on December 12th, and you'll be able to play it as long as you have an active Switch Online subscription.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that this isn't the first version of&nbsp;<em>Tetris&nbsp;</em>to land on Switch Online. The iconic Game Boy version has been available on the service <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/game-boy-and-game-boy-advance-titles-are-finally-coming-to-nintendo-switch-online" rel="nofollow">since 2023</a>, and if you count&nbsp;<em>Panel de Pon&nbsp;</em>as a&nbsp;<em>Tetris&nbsp;</em>game (since it was localized as&nbsp;<em>Tetris Attack&nbsp;</em>in 1996), then that's been on Switch Online <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-getting-new-snes-and-nes-games" rel="nofollow">since 2020</a>.</p>

Screenshot courtesy of YouTube channel World of Longplays and Spikestuff.</figcaption></figure><p>This is Nintendo's version of&nbsp;<em>Tetris&nbsp;</em>as opposed to the short-lived Atari version released earlier in 1989; that version was pulled from sale pretty quickly after its release, and you won't even find it on the recent&nbsp;<em>Tetris Forever&nbsp;</em>collection.</p>

<p>Still, it's nice to get to enjoy another version of this classic puzzler on Switch Online, even if <a href="https://www.ign.com/lists/top-100-nes-games/48" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">many</a> do seem to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/12/feature_how_nintendo_killed_the_best_version_of_tetris" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">regard</a> the Atari version as technically superior.</p>

<p>That's not all that's happening in the world of&nbsp;<em>Tetris</em>, either. Earlier today, developer Arika announced a new installment in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Tetris the Grand Master&nbsp;</em>series, and it's scheduled for release next year.</p>

<p>The appropriately-named&nbsp;<em>Tetris the Grand Master 4: Absolute Eye&nbsp;</em>will land on PC via Steam "by the end of March 2025", according to Arika. There's no word yet on whether it's getting a console release, but it will be an "offline game", Arika says.</p>

<p><em>Tetris&nbsp;</em>lands on Nintendo Switch Online on December 12th.&nbsp;<em>Tetris the Grand Master 4: Absolute Eye&nbsp;</em>is set to come to Steam next year. Stay tuned for more.</p>
