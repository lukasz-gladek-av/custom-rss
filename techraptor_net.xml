            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rebellion has announced&nbsp;<em>The Red Strain</em>, a brand new DLC expansion for&nbsp;<em>Atomfall&nbsp;</em>that's launching next month, although the studio is keeping its cards close to its chest regarding what you can expect for now.</p>

<p><em>The Red Strain&nbsp;</em>was announced earlier today via a brand new teaser trailer, and "teaser" really is the word; the trailer reveals the name of the expansion, as well as a C.O.R.E. robot standing in front of some kind of red growth (presumably the Red Strain of the title).</p>

<p>What we do know is that this will be&nbsp;<em>Atomfall</em>'s second major story expansion, following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atomfall-wicked-isle-dlc-release-date" rel="nofollow">June's&nbsp;<em>Wicked Isle</em></a>, which introduced a brand new area and other goodies to Rebellion's open-ended shooter.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/atomfall-the-red-strain-dlc-wicked-isle.jpg?itok=jb20XuWE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/atomfall-the-red-strain-dlc-wicked-isle.jpg?itok=W7D_8oYR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Red Strain&nbsp;</em>will be&nbsp;<em>Atomfall</em>'s second story DLC, following on from&nbsp;<em>Wicked Isle</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>While Rebellion hasn't revealed exactly what will be introduced as part of&nbsp;<em>The Red Strain</em>, the studio does say you can expect "a highly confidential new location", as well as "plenty more mysteries to uncover". That sounds about right for an&nbsp;<em>Atomfall&nbsp;</em>expansion.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Atomfall&nbsp;</em>itself, it's an open-ended first-person shooter developed by&nbsp;<em>Sniper Elite&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Zombie Army&nbsp;</em>studio Rebellion. It's set in a 1960s England that was a lot more heavily impacted by the Windscale nuclear disaster than the one in real life was.</p>

<p>At the outset of&nbsp;<em>Atomfall</em>, you awaken in a bunker with amnesia, and it's up to you to explore the Windscale plant and its surroundings in order to discover the truth behind Windscale and why a mysterious voice is telling you that a being known as Oberon "must die".</p>




<p>Somewhat unusually for modern games,&nbsp;<em>Atomfall&nbsp;</em>essentially allows you freedom in how you pursue your objectives; you'll have several leads to follow at any given time, and the order in which you chase those leads is largely up to you.</p>

<p><em>Atomfall&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/801800/Atomfall/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/atomfall/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/atomfall/9NC4WDL5KZBL" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and it's also a day one Game Pass title. You can read our very own Erren's review of the game to find out what she thought of it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/atomfall-review-british-invasion" rel="nofollow">right here</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Mega Hawlucha Officially Revealed for Pokemon Legends: Z-A]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mega-hawlucha-pokemon-legends-z-a</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mega-hawlucha-officially-revealed-for-pokemon-legends-z-a.1282863/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has announced a brand new Mega Evolution for the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>, and unlike the last two reveals, this one is a bona fide Generation VI native.</p>

<p><em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-release-date-pokemon-presents" rel="nofollow">set to launch on October 16th</a>, and the first major new Mega Evolution revealed for the game was Dragonite, with Grass/Poison-type plant <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mega-victreebel-revealed-pokemon-legends-za" rel="nofollow">Victreebel following earlier this month</a>. Be sure to check out Mega Victreebel's horror-inflected announcement trailer if you haven't already.</p>

<p>Now, a brand new Mega Evolution has been revealed for the game, and it's none other than the Fighting/Flying-type luchador bird Hawlucha, which will transform into an even more magnificent form if you choose to Mega Evolve it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mega-hawlucha-announced-trailer.jpg?itok=kSFPRTR0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mega-hawlucha-announced-trailer.jpg?itok=xl4KvUbx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hawlucha is the latest Pokemon to get the Mega Evolution treatment.</figcaption></figure><p>The trailer in which Mega Hawlucha is revealed is a pretty heartwarming one; the luchador steps into the ring with Machamp, and the latter proves to be a tough opponent until Hawlucha draws on its memories of its trainer and steps it up a notch.</p>

<p>I would say that I won't spoil what happens next, but given that this is a trailer specifically announcing the existence of Mega Hawlucha, I'm sure you can put two and two together. Suffice it to say Hawlucha's trainer is delighted with the outcome.</p>

<p>You can check out the full trailer announcing Mega Hawlucha below; it essentially takes the form of a full wrestling match between the two Pokemon, complete with the kind of dramatic twists and turns you'd expect from a WWE bout.</p>




<p><em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>is set to debut on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition-switch-2/" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/Pokemon-Legends-Z-A-2533423.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">original Switch</a> on October 16th. Set entirely in Lumiose City in the Kalos region, the game sees players undertaking an urban redevelopment project by day and participating in an exciting battle tournament by night.</p>

<p>The game will also feature a more action-oriented battle system that will require players to physically dodge certain moves, as well as a number of new Mega Evolution forms, of which we've only seen a few. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Solo Leveling: Arise Overdrive Release Date Set for November]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/solo-leveling-arise-overdrive-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/solo-leveling-arise-overdrive-release-date-set-for-november.1282791/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Netmarble has announced the release date for upcoming anime action RPG&nbsp;<em>Solo Leveling: Arise Overdrive</em>, which, contrary to what you might think from the title, is not the same game as mobile gacha RPG&nbsp;<em>Solo Leveling: Arise</em>.</p>

<p>First revealed during the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">Xbox showcase back in June</a>,&nbsp;<em>Solo Leveling: Arise Overdrive&nbsp;</em>is set to launch on PC on November 17th, with a current-gen console version due to follow sometime next year (although not for Switch 2, unfortunately).</p>

<p>Despite what the name might have you believe,&nbsp;<em>Solo Leveling: Arise Overdrive&nbsp;</em>has nothing to do with&nbsp;<em>Solo Leveling: Arise</em>; Netmarble says it's an "entirely different game, developed as an independent project by a separate team".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/solo-leveling-arise-overdrive-release-date-steps.jpg?itok=IZY8clYy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/solo-leveling-arise-overdrive-release-date-steps.jpg?itok=XljdX6pU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Solo Leveling: Arise Overdrive&nbsp;</em>is set to come to PC in November.</figcaption></figure><p>It sounds like <i>Arise Overdrive&nbsp;</i>won't be a gacha game, either; according to development producer Kim Gwang-Hoon, there will be no "randomness when recruiting Hunters or crafting weapons", allowing players to "feel a true sense of achievement" through "effort and strategy".</p>

<p>You'll also be able to use boss materials in order to craft weapons, so there won't be any kind of gacha mechanic for obtaining those materials or for crafting the gear you can get from them either, it seems.</p>

<p>You can also expect sharper controls than&nbsp;<em>Solo Leveling: Arise</em>, as well as higher-fidelity backgrounds that Kim Gwang-Hoon says will "bridge the gap between comic and realism". The backgrounds are still based on the original&nbsp;<em>Solo Leveling&nbsp;</em>webtoon, though, so you'll recognize them if you're a fan.</p>

<p>If you want to see&nbsp;<em>Solo Leveling: Arise Overdrive&nbsp;</em>in action, then you can check out Netmarble's new release date trailer for the game right here.</p>




<p><em>Solo Leveling: Arise Overdrive&nbsp;</em>is set to launch on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2373990/Solo_Leveling_ARISE_OVERDRIVE/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a> and the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/solo-leveling-arise-overdrive/9MVHCQ7CJX01" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox app</a> on November 17th. A version of the game is also due for release on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S in 2026, so stay tuned for more on that.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Crystal Dynamics Hit by Layoffs, Tomb Raider "Unaffected"]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crystal-dynamics-layoffs</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/crystal-dynamics-hit-by-layoffs-tomb-raider-unaffected.1282761/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>studio Crystal Dynamics has announced that it's been hit by layoffs, but the developer says that work on the next game in the aforementioned action-adventure series remains "unaffected".</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7366524687985594369/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on LinkedIn, Crystal Dynamics says it has "made the very difficult decision to part ways with a number of [its] talented colleagues", blaming "evolving business conditions" for the decision. The studio stops short of revealing how many employees have been let go.</p>

<p>Crystal Dynamics goes on to say that while its decision was not "made lightly", it was "necessary...to ensure the long-term health of [the] studio and core creative priorities in a continually shifting market".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider-crystal-dynamics-layoffs.jpg?itok=a9edtL6I 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider-crystal-dynamics-layoffs.jpg?itok=9WvQuSUE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Crystal Dynamics has been hit by layoffs, but&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>is "unaffected", the studio says.</figcaption></figure><p>In closing, Crystal Dynamics thanks its "teams, players, and partners" for helping it to "build a creative, sustainable, and resilient tomorrow". That, the studio says, "includes the future of&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider</em>, which remains unaffected" by the layoffs.</p>

<p>It's been five years since Crystal Dynamics' last original game, namely 2020's&nbsp;<em>Marvel's Avengers</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvels-avengers-ending-development-support" rel="nofollow">ended service in January 2023</a>. Other than that, the studio has also worked alongside Aspyr on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tomb-raider-i-ii-iii-remastered" rel="nofollow">remasters</a> of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tomb-raider-4-6-remastered-announced" rel="nofollow">first six</a>&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>games and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/soul-reaver-remasters-leaked-psn" rel="nofollow">first two titles</a> in the&nbsp;<em>Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver&nbsp;</em>sub-series.</p>

<p>Technically speaking, a new game in the&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>series is in development, although Crystal Dynamics and publisher Amazon Games have revealed nothing about the new project yet. It's likely to be a while before we learn exactly what direction the studios intend to take with the property in future.</p>

<p>Still, even without a flagship game announcement, the&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>franchise remains active. Last year, an animated series by the name of&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft&nbsp;</em>debuted on Netflix, and a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tomb-raider-live-action-series" rel="nofollow">live-action series is also in the works</a>.</p>




<p>Crystal Dynamics' decision to lay off employees may well be connected to the fact that in July, Xbox <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">canceled its&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</em>reboot</a>, on which Crystal Dynamics was serving as a co-development studio alongside The Initiative.</p>
