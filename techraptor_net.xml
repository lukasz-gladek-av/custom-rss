            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ravensburger has teased a potential <em>Horrified: Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> expansion. The tabletop studio's most recent social media posts hint at new horrors to overcome in the cooperative board game. Horrors that may come straight from the cursed lands of Ravenloft.</p><h2>The <em>Horrified: Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Expansion Tease</h2><p>Ravensburger's tease of the next <em>Horrified: Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> expansion came from a social media post <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ravensburgerglobal/p/DUDpTJ_DPZz/?hl=en" rel="nofollow">on Instagram</a>. The post is enigmatic, showing the board game's logo, the tagline, "something new is coming in Fall 2026" and artwork of a creepy jester puppet holding a needle.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>It is an interesting choice of monster to showcase. The original <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-details-on-horrified-dungeons-dragons-emerge-from-dungeons-deep" rel="nofollow"><em>Horrified: Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> game already featured monsters so iconic they are pop culture staples. The Beholder. The Mimic. The Red Dragon. By contrast, this figure is more obscure.</p><p>However, based on the appearance, artwork, and weapon, it is clear this monster is from Ravenloft, <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons'</em> gothic horror setting. The creature is a Carrionette, first featured in the fifth edition supplement, <em>Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft</em>. Carrionettes are toys gifted sentience by the loving craft of their maker.&nbsp;</p><p>The horrifying twist is they crave a mortal life. So much so they will ambush unsuspecting people, pull out their soul with a golden needle, and then take over their body. If you can imagine a creepy Pinocchio or a fantasy version of the serial killing doll Chucky, you have an idea to the danger the Carionette holds.</p><p>With this in mind, it's a strong possibility other Ravenloft residents may show up in this Horrified: Dungeons &amp; Dragons expansion. A mummy lord from the deserts of Har'Akir. The life-force stealing Jiangshi from the liminal city of I'Cath. Bluetspur's resident Vampire Mindflayers.</p><p>For <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> diehards, there is the possibility the expansion may include it's most iconic monster: the First Vampire, Strahd Von Zarovich. That may be wishful thinking for two reasons.&nbsp;</p><p>One, if Strahd was in the expansion, he would be on the box. It would just be savvy marketing given his long storied history with the fantasy RPG. Second, the Horrified series centers on regular people escaping monsters, and the Dark Lord of Barovia has been slaughtering larger-than-life heroes for centuries. It would be a bit much.</p><p>At the time of writing, further information on the <em>Horrified: Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> expansion is minimal. Since the release isn't until Fall, there is plenty of time for Ravensburger to provide more info.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
