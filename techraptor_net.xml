            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pacific-drive-tv-series-rights-james-wan<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>James Wan's production company Atomic Monster has acquired the rights to turn indie driving survival game&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>into a TV show.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/pacific-drive-tv-series-game-james-wan-1236251563/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Variety</a>, Wan, best known as the creator of the&nbsp;<em>Saw&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Insidious&nbsp;</em>franchises (as well as the director on movies like&nbsp;<em>Furious 7&nbsp;</em>and both&nbsp;<em>Aquaman&nbsp;</em>films), will serve as an executive producer alongside Michael Clear and Rob Hackett, also Atomic Monster execs.</p>

<p>They'll be joined by Jeff Ludwig, who will, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4906983/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">according to IMDb</a>, also serve as an executive producer on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-annapurna-control-2-tv-movies" rel="nofollow">Annapurna and Remedy's upcoming&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake&nbsp;</em>TV series</a>. He's also worked alongside movie and TV production studio Story Kitchen on a&nbsp;<em>Sifu&nbsp;</em>live-action adaptation, which has yet to see the light of day.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pacific-drive-tv-show-rights-driving.jpg?itok=viI5n6hF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pacific-drive-tv-show-rights-driving.jpg?itok=wt8ZwQ0Y 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>could well be getting itself a TV adaptation.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that, as Variety points out, Wan and his production company have only acquired the rights to&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive</em>, which is essentially the first step towards a full&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>TV show.</p>

<p>However, since the project doesn't yet have any creative personnel attached to it (not to mention a streaming platform), it's likely that we're still very early on in production, so it could be a very long time indeed before we hear anything about this one.</p>

<p>If you aren't familiar with&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive</em>, it's a "driving survival adventure" developed by Ironwood Studios and published by Kepler Interactive. The game is set in the fictional Olympic Exclusion Zone, which may be in the Pacific Northwest but which owes more than a small debt to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-a-life-20-gsc-game-world" rel="nofollow">the likes of&nbsp;<em>Stalker</em></a>.</p>




<p>Your goal in&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>is to explore the Zone, scavenge resources to build yourself better equipment and upgrade your car, and uncover the area's "mystery".</p>

<p><em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>is just the latest game to come into non-interactive media's crosshairs. Major successes in recent years include <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kaitlyn-dever-last-of-us-season-2" rel="nofollow">HBO's&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kaitlyn-dever-last-of-us-season-2" rel="nofollow">The Last of Us</a>&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-prime-video-100-million-viewers" rel="nofollow">Amazon's&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>show</a>, although as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paramount-cancels-halo-series" rel="nofollow">Paramount and its&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>show</a> can no doubt tell you, these experiments don't always pan out.</p>

<p>If you want to check out&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>to get yourself ready for a potential streaming series, you can do so right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1458140/Pacific_Drive/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/pacific-drive/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[Borderlands 4 Will Have Less "Toilet Humor", Narrative Director Says]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/borderlands-4-toilet-humor-narrative-director</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/borderlands-4-will-have-less-toilet-humor-narrative-director-says.1063446/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/borderlands-4-toilet-humor-narrative-director<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Borderlands 4</em>&nbsp;narrative director Sam Winkler has revealed that he intends to tone down what he identifies as an "overabundance of toilet humor" in the series' previous game.</p>

<p>Speaking <a href="https://x.com/ThatSamWinkler/status/1868741632449036648" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">to a follower</a> on social media platform X, Winkler says that while he's "not at liberty" to discuss the narrative content of&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>at the moment, he remains "firm" in his "criticism of&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 3</em>'s overabundance of toilet humor".</p>

<p>Another&nbsp;<em>Borderlands&nbsp;</em>fan then humorously asks Winkler if they'll be able to "use the poop poop farty 4000" to "clean up porta-potties with my companion skibidi toilet", which is a sentence that physically hurt me to write, even though I'm quoting someone else's sarcastic observation.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/borderlands-4-toilet-humor-narrative-director-psycho.jpg?itok=Ey-BmeCK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/borderlands-4-toilet-humor-narrative-director-psycho.jpg?itok=wbmQTnEb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>will focus less on "toilet humor", its narrative director says.</figcaption></figure><p>In response to this painfully-worded question (for which props must begrudgingly go to the post's writer Moxsy), Winkler says that while he can't guarantee there will be "no toilets", he'll "cry real tears" if "the word skibidi ships in the game".</p>

<p>He goes on to say that writer Paul Tassi joked&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>would feature a gun called "Hawk 2A" (a reference to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2024/06/28/hawk-tuah-meme-explained-how-woman-in-viral-interview-made-a-reported-65000-and-prompted-tiktok-craze/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the famous Hawk Tuah meme</a>) and that this suggestion prompted a fellow dev to ask if that gun was real.</p>

<p>That question, Winkler said, made him want to "put [his] hand down the sink grinder", so it sounds like&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>will also de-emphasize the kind of meme humor for which the series has become known.</p>

<p>With all of that said, the thread originally began with Winkler praising&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em>'s contract writers as "some of the funniest people [he knows]", so the game definitely won't be a serious grimdark take on the series.</p>




<p>The first gameplay trailer for&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>was revealed during this year's Game Awards, alongside the likes of an&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/okami-2-hideki-kamiya" rel="nofollow"><em>Okami&nbsp;</em>sequel</a>, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-2025" rel="nofollow">co-op survival spinoff of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em></a>, and Naughty Dog's new game&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/naughty-dog-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet" rel="nofollow"><em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</em></a>.</p>

<p>Gearbox describes the game as a "mayhem-fueled looter shooter" packed with "billions of weapons, outrageous enemies, and intense co-op action", which sounds about right for the&nbsp;<em>Borderlands&nbsp;</em>series.</p>

<p><em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>is set to come to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/borderlands-4/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/borderlands-4/9MX6HKF5647G" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> next year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-dark-souls-enemies-confirmed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>will, in fact, pit you and your friends against&nbsp;enemies from the&nbsp;<em>Souls&nbsp;</em>series, game director Junya Ishizaki has confirmed.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202412/27477" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Famitsu interview</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-will-feature-enemies-from-dark-souls-director-confirms" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>), Ishizaki says that some&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls&nbsp;</em>enemies will appear to fight you in&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, although it seems like there won't be too many; the game's enemy roster will largely be made up of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>enemies, Ishizaki says.</p>

<p>He goes on to say that he got permission from&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls&nbsp;</em>creator Hidetaka Miyazaki and&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls 2&nbsp;</em>director Yui Tanimura to include enemies from their respective works in <i>Nightreign</i>, so it looks like you can expect&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls 2&nbsp;</em>enemies alongside iconic foes from the other two games.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-dark-souls-enemies-combat.jpg?itok=cMqza9I9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-dark-souls-enemies-combat.jpg?itok=4l-M7hwg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>will feature&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls&nbsp;</em>enemies, as well as those found in the original&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Eagle-eyed observers had already spotted&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls 3</em>'s Nameless King boss in the&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>debut trailer, as well as a boss that looked suspiciously like&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls</em>' Centipede Demon, and now it looks like those won't be the only&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls&nbsp;</em>callbacks in the game.</p>

<p>Ishizaki doesn't mention whether any&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls&nbsp;</em>enemies will be appearing in&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>, but given that the&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls&nbsp;</em>IP is owned by Sony and not by FromSoftware or Bandai Namco, it's unlikely.</p>

<p>As for why&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls&nbsp;</em>enemies turn up in&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>, Ishizaki's answer is rather amusing; he puts it down to the influence of the game's villain, the Night King, which rather smacks of "a wizard did it" to me.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, it's an upcoming co-op survival action game created by FromSoftware and based on the 2022 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-25-million" rel="nofollow">smash hit</a>&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>.</p>




<p>Announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-2025" rel="nofollow">during the Game Awards ceremony last week</a>,&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>eschews FromSoftware's typical Soulslike formula, opting instead for a sort of&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter</em>-inspired roguelite approach that sees players banding together to survive three days and nights of increasingly difficult encounters.</p>

<p>The game's announcement came less than two weeks after FromSoftware head Hidetaka Miyazaki <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-2-not-happening-fromsoftware" rel="nofollow">said there were no plans</a> to expand the&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>IP in the future, but then his games are well-known for featuring duplicitous or obscure NPCs, so perhaps we shouldn't be surprised.</p>

<p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>launches next year for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2622380/ELDEN_RING_NIGHTREIGN/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10010877" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and Xbox.</p>
