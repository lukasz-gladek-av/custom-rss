            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/as-we-descend-delayed-may<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Roguelike deckbuilder&nbsp;<em>As We Descend&nbsp;</em>has been delayed until May, but a concrete release date for the game has been revealed, so it won't be too much longer until you get to play it.</p>

<p>Back in February, it was announced that&nbsp;<em>As We Descend&nbsp;</em>would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/as-we-descend-early-access-release-date" rel="nofollow">arrive in Early Access in March</a>, but Kevin Chang, director of developer Box Dragon, says the game needs "a little more time in the oven" before it's ready.</p>

<p>As a sweetener, though, the game's demo, which is currently available on Steam, has been localized into 11 languages, including French, German, and Ukrainian, so more folks around the world can check it out before deciding to make a purchase.</p>

He goes on to say that the game's Early Access launch is "just the beginning".</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>As We Descend</em>, it's a roguelike deckbuilder set in a post-apocalyptic world "where resources are scarce and monsters threaten humanity’s very existence". Well, it wouldn't be much of a post-apocalyptic world without life-threatening danger.</p>

<p>Gameplay-wise,&nbsp;<em>As We Descend&nbsp;</em>is split between its card-battling combat and its diplomacy systems, which will see you building relationships with key figures in order to stave off crises and make critical alliances.</p>

<p>According to Box Dragon, you can expect&nbsp;<em>As We Descend</em>'s setting to offer a "desperate city that evolves and crumbles in unique ways based on the player’s decisions", so it sounds like you'll need to be careful what you choose during conversations.</p>




<p><em>As We Descend&nbsp;</em>is coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1769830/As_We_Descend/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on May 28th, and a demo is available to try out right now if you want to see whether the game is your cup of (presumably poisoned) tea or not.</p>
