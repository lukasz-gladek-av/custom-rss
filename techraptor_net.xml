            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-release-date-pokemon-presents<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has announced the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>release date, and we also now know when the next Pokemon Presents showcase is set to air.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://press.pokemon.com/en/releases/Release-Date-for-Pokemon-Legends-Z-A-Revealed-and-Pokemon-Presents-Vid" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a>,&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>, which had already been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-presents-february-2025-all-reveals-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">slated for a late 2025 launch</a>, will be arriving on October 16th. Pre-orders for the game will be opening on June 5th, which is the same <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">day of the Switch 2's launch</a>.</p>

<p>As a reminder,&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>will be available on both the Switch 2 and the original Switch, and if you buy it on the older machine, you'll be able to pay to upgrade your version to the Switch 2 Edition of the game.</p>

<p>There's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-presents-august-2023" rel="nofollow">often</a> a Pokemon Presents <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everything-from-pokemon-presents-about-arceus-and-gen-4-remakes" rel="nofollow">show</a> during the summer, and this year's is set to air on July 22nd, with The Pokemon Company promising to reveal "the latest news and updates from the world of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>".</p>

<p>I'd be very surprised indeed if we didn't get at least a hint about the next generation of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games, which will almost certainly be exclusive to the Nintendo Switch 2. Expect more info about&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>prior to its release as well.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>, it's the second game in the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends&nbsp;</em>sub-series, following on from 2022's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/pokemon-legends-arceus" rel="nofollow"><em>Pokemon Legends: Arceus</em></a>.</p>




<p>While&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Arceus&nbsp;</em>took place during the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>world's past,&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>will instead be set in the present day. It'll take place entirely inside Lumiose City, which is currently in the midst of an urban redevelopment plan.</p>

<p><em>Pokemon Legends: Arceus&nbsp;</em>is set to launch on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/pokemon-legends-z-a-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/Pokemon-Legends-Z-A-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2827849.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Switch 2</a> on October 16th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Kingmakers Early Access Release Date Revealed for October]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingmakers-early-access-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher tinyBuild and developer Redemption Road have finally announced the&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>Early Access release date, although the game will be landing perhaps a little later than you might have expected.</p>

<p>As revealed in a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2109770/view/516336614597722796" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>,&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>will be launching on October 8th. Redemption Road acknowledges that some may have been "expecting it sooner", and that the game didn't make its previously-announced Q2 release window.</p>

<p>However, the studio says that "building a game where time-traveling mercs drop air strikes on medieval knights takes a hell of a lot of toiling", and that the aim is to give players "a game that hits hard and holds up", a goal for which the devs are currently "grinding".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingmakers-early-access-release-date-castle.jpg?itok=OOLGts7e 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingmakers-early-access-release-date-castle.jpg?itok=_IVAaUR9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kingmakers</em>' ambitious mix of third-person shooting and medieval strategy is coming to Early Access in fall.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>was first announced back in February last year, attracting attention for its&nbsp;<em>Darkest of Days</em>-style blend of modern military aesthetics with a medieval setting.</p>

<p>The game quickly began accruing wishlists and followers on Steam, with publisher tinyBuild announcing last year that a&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingmakers-movie-announced" rel="nofollow">movie is in development</a>, despite the fact that the game didn't have anything approaching a release date at that point.</p>

<p>Following that announcement,&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingmakers-delayed-q1-2025" rel="nofollow">delayed to 2025 in December</a>, and while Redemption Road promised the game would arrive in the first quarter of the year, it was subsequently pushed back again to the second quarter (and then again to October).</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers</em>, Redemption Road describes it as an "epic action/strategy sandbox" in which you must "change the course of history and save the future" by traveling back in time with your "vast arsenal of modern weapons".</p>

<p>You'll switch between hitting the ground as a soldier equipped with modern military tools and issuing orders to your troops strategy-style, and you'll need to build fortifications to keep your troops safe as well.</p>

<p><em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>launches on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2109770/Kingmakers/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam Early Access</a> on October 8th. Stay tuned for more.</p>
