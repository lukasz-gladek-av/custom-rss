            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Trails Beyond the Horizon</em>, the latest game in the long-running JRPG series' Calvard arc, has finally received a Western release date, and it won't be too long before you can check this one out.</p>

<p>As revealed in a brand new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Trails Beyond the Horizon&nbsp;</em>(or, to give it its full title,&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Heroes: Trails Beyond the Horizon</em>) will be arriving across PC, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch consoles on January 15th.</p>

<p>The game will follow on from the previous titles in the Calvard arc, namely&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/legend-of-heroes-trails-through-daybreak-release-date" rel="nofollow">Trails through Daybreak</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/trails-through-daybreak-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">its sequel</a>. You'll play as three protagonists with intertwining stories:&nbsp;<em>Trails of Cold Steel</em>'s Rean Schwarzer,&nbsp;<em>Daybreak</em>'s Van Arkride, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/legend-of-heroes-trails-in-sky-3rd" rel="nofollow"><em>Trails in the Sky the 3rd</em></a>'s Kevin Graham.</p>

Rean, Kevin, and Van are drawn into intrigue when Marduk invites them to "co-operate in a high-tech training exercise", setting them on a "collision course with the secrets that lay at the very core of Zemuria".</p>

<p>The game will feature an adapted and enhanced version of&nbsp;<em>Trails through Daybreak</em>'s battle system, allowing you to swap between the action-based Field Battle mode and the more strategic Command Battle system.</p>

<p>New features include the ability to slow time with the Z.O.C. system, boosting your damage and allowing for devastating chain attacks, as well as new Shard Commands to grant your party "a range of benefits during battle".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Techland has announced that upcoming zombie sandbox parkour-'em-up&nbsp;<em>Dying Light: The Beast&nbsp;</em>has been delayed by a few weeks in order to ensure additional polish.</p>

<p>While the game was originally intended to launch on August 22nd, Techland now says it needs extra time "to make&nbsp;<em>Dying Light: The Beast&nbsp;</em>the best&nbsp;<em>Dying Light&nbsp;</em>game [it's] ever released", which is why the latest title in the series will now be launching on September 19th.</p>

<p>Techland says it understands the delay "may be disappointing", but that its "experience has shown how important the first impression is", and that four extra weeks of development will help the studio "address final details that make all the difference between good and great".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dying-light-the-beast-delayed-parkour.jpg?itok=Y6RIMyVL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dying-light-the-beast-delayed-parkour.jpg?itok=FaYlAqVJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dying Light: The Beast&nbsp;</em>needs a few more weeks before it can be unleashed.</figcaption></figure><p>Areas that Techland will be working on between now and the new September release date include gameplay balance, "clarity of UI", physics quality, and animation tweaking, as well as the addition of "last little details".</p>

<p>Additionally, Techland will be releasing more information about&nbsp;<em>Dying Light: The Beast&nbsp;</em>regularly until September, so if you're disappointed you won't be able to play the game in August, the new reveals should tide you over.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Dying Light: The Beast</em>, it's a standalone followup to 2022's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dying-light-2-stay-human" rel="nofollow"><em>Dying Light 2: Stay Human</em></a>&nbsp;in which you'll once again take on the mantle of Kyle Crane, the protagonist of the original&nbsp;<em>Dying Light</em>.</p>

<p>The game was <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/turns-out-dying-light-the-beast-started-out-as-leaked-dying-light-2-dlc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">originally intended</a> to be a DLC expansion for&nbsp;<em>Dying Light 2</em>, but after plot details for that DLC were leaked by hackers in 2023, Techland decided to turn&nbsp;<em>The Beast&nbsp;</em>into a full standalone followup instead.</p>




<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Dying Light: The Beast&nbsp;</em>when it launches on September 19th for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3008130/Dying_Light_The_Beast/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10011468" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/dying-light-the-beast/9p7zg9mqkkln" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.
