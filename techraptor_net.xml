            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-h1-2024-25-fiscal-results<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has released its financial results for the first half of the fiscal year, and if you've been following the company's fortunes recently, then it probably won't come as a shock to you to learn that things aren't looking good.</p>

<p>In its <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/5kn4pUVx6Vtb1Hir4vpqvq/fe35b53a1514635b0257418d1409d9e1/Ubisoft_FY25_H1_Earnings_PR_vFinal.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">financial summary</a>, Ubisoft reveals that it's effectively hemorrhaging money right now; the company lost&nbsp;€271.8 million in the period between April and September this year, and it's currently staring down the barrel of around&nbsp;€1 billion's worth of debt.</p>

<p>In addition, net bookings are down 22% year-on-year, while digital revenues have fallen 27% and player spending (although Ubisoft uses the somewhat ghoulish term "recurring investment") has fallen 39% compared to the same period last year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-outlaws-ubisoft-financials.jpg?itok=g7fbpxOf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-outlaws-ubisoft-financials.jpg?itok=luABiqCE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>High-profile flops like&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>have driven poor performance for Ubisoft in the first half of the 2024-25 fiscal year.</figcaption></figure><p>These doomy numbers are likely driven largely by the apparent failure of&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, which Ubisoft has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-february">admitted didn't perform according to its expectations</a>, although the company doesn't mention the game in these latest financial results, nor does it give official sales numbers.</p>

<p>Rather cunningly, Ubisoft refers to its "unique player" count rather than its sales in an <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/5XbTPPv7a94dZmmmhSwtDA/c091b601b2b467f5829465c26d0b8551/Ubisoft_H1_FY25_Slideshow_vFinal.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">accompanying presentation</a>, declaring that "more than 30 million unique active players" played&nbsp;<em>Rainbow Six Siege&nbsp;</em>and the&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>franchise over the last twelve months.</p>

<p>The company also says its cost reduction plan is "well on track", with its "total headcount" dropping by over 2,000 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-lays-off-124-people-to-streamline-operations-and-enhance-collective-efficiency">over the past 24 months</a>.</p>

<p>All in all, the presentation and its accompanying slideshow paint a pretty grim picture for Ubisoft, and that's probably a result the company doesn't feel it needs after a prolonged period of turmoil.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft.jpg?itok=BBb3O36u 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft.jpg?itok=6iwePV2G 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ubisoft is releasing&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>next year.</figcaption></figure><p>Ubisoft's&nbsp;<em>annus horribilis&nbsp;</em>arguably began with the launch of&nbsp;<em>Skull and Bones&nbsp;</em>back in February, with <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/16299/skull-and-bones" rel="noopener" target="_blank">critics</a> and players alike responding to the long-awaited pirate game with a resounding "eh".</p>

<p>Following that, a prominent investor in the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activist-ubisoft-investor-open-letter-change">called for "strategic and structural change"</a> in September, calling out perceived failures in management and company policy on the part of Ubisoft's owners the Guillemots.</p>

<p>Major release <i>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</i>was subsequently delayed to February 2025, alongside which Ubisoft revealed that&nbsp;<em>Outlaws&nbsp;</em>had underperformed and confirmed a return to day-one Steam releases for its PC games, as well as the abandonment of the traditional season pass model for DLC.</p>

<p>More investor threats followed, alongside a declaration of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-strike-investor-letter">employee strike action</a> over return-to-work policies and poor pay. All of that is in addition to a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-lawsuit-data-policy">data policy lawsuit</a> that Ubisoft is currently facing.</p>

<p>Of course, none of these issues stopped Ubisoft <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-nft-game">releasing a rather oddly-timed NFT game</a>&nbsp;last week. One rather suspects this isn't the sort of strategy Ubisoft needs to get back on track, but I suppose we'll have to wait and see.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Valve Now Requires Devs to Disclose Kernel-Level Anti-Cheat Measures on Steam]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valve-steam-anti-cheat-disclosure</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/valve-now-requires-devs-to-disclose-kernel-level-anti-cheat-measures-on-steam.1024146/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valve-steam-anti-cheat-disclosure<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Valve has announced that developers who want to put their games on Steam will need to disclose whether those games are using any kind of kernel-level anti-cheat software going forward.</p>

<p>Announcing the changes via the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/4547038620960934857" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steamworks community page</a>, Valve says this is a change that's been requested by both developers and players; devs want better options to "share anti-cheat information" with players, while players are requesting more anti-cheat "transparency".</p>

<p>To that end, a new field has been added in which developers can indicate the anti-cheat software that comes with their game. If a developer's game contains kernel-level and client-side anti-cheat measures, then those measures must be disclosed via this new field.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/apex-legends-anti-cheat-valve-steam.jpg?itok=8kk1YJzE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/apex-legends-anti-cheat-valve-steam.jpg?itok=0MDDgsSn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Online games like&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends&nbsp;</em>often use anti-cheat software to prevent hacks and other exploits.</figcaption></figure><p>This also applies to games that are already on Steam, so developers who are currently using kernel-level anti-cheat solutions will need to add this disclosure to their games' Steam pages.</p>

<p>If games are using anti-cheat that isn't kernel-based or is server-side, then their developers aren't technically required to disclose this information, but Valve says it thinks that letting players know about this would be beneficial on both sides.</p>

<p>If you're a Steam developer, you can find this new option in your Steamworks landing page, under the "Edit Store Page" heading. A new "Anti-Cheat" option will be available, and Valve says it's made a list of the most common software providers so you can easily fill out the field.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that even if a Steam page already discloses its measures somewhere else in its text, then that information should now be migrated to the new field and removed from the existing area.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/genshin-impact-anti-cheat-valve-steam.jpg?itok=BfMLwYiM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/genshin-impact-anti-cheat-valve-steam.jpg?itok=EomXAilH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some games, like&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact</em>, have been the subject of controversy thanks to anti-cheat software.</figcaption></figure><p>Plenty of games use kernel-level anti-cheat measures, with big guns like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/halo-infinite-march-update-preview"><em>Halo Infinite</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sea-of-thieves-getting-easy-anti-cheat-and-removing-game-pass-requirement-for-solo"><em>Sea of Thieves</em></a>, and more incorporating it into their online components.</p>

<p>However, some games have been the subject of controversy due to their anti-cheat measures.</p>

<p>Back in 2022, for instance, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-anti-cheat-vulnerability-discovered">vulnerability was discovered</a> in&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact</em>'s anti-cheat protocols potentially allowed hackers to bypass users' virus protection, and the game didn't even need to be installed for players to be susceptible.</p>

<p>In July that same year, VR social platform<em>&nbsp;VRChat&nbsp;</em>implemented Easy Anti-Cheat, one of the most popular anti-cheat solutions, thereby also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vrchat-mods-ban-by-easy-anti-cheat-addition-sparks-community-outrage">banning the use of mods</a> for the platform, a decision that wasn't exactly received well by the&nbsp;<em>VRChat&nbsp;</em>community.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-music-app-announced</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-announces-bespoke-music-streaming-app-nintendo-music.1024095/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-music-app-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced the aptly-named Nintendo Music, a streaming app that allows you to listen to a selection of Nintendo tunes via your smartphone.</p>

<p>You'll have to be a Switch Online member to use it, although unlike <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-n64-halloween">N64 games</a> or the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mysterious-nintendo-switch-online-playtest-leaks">rather strange playtest</a> that popped up recently, you won't need the Expansion Pack addon. There's no option to use the app if you're not a Switch Online member, unfortunately.</p>

<p>If you do have an active Switch Online membership, though, you can expect an app that offers music from the likes of <i>Mario</i>,&nbsp;<em>Zelda</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Metroid</em>, as well as&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing&nbsp;</em>and more. The app lets you listen either to individual songs, full soundtracks, or playlists, and you can also create your own playlists if you like.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-music-app-view.jpg?itok=lQw9fTDn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-music-app-view.jpg?itok=5VAxku2g 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nintendo Music lets you listen to all kinds of Nintendo tunes.</figcaption></figure><p>Essentially, Nintendo Music works like a Nintendo-exclusive version of apps like Spotify. As you listen, the app will learn your tastes, and it'll start recommending music to you based on what you've listened to before.</p>

<p>Additionally, new music will continually be added to Nintendo Music over time, so if a soundtrack you love isn't on there yet, there's a good chance it will be at some point in the future.</p>

<p>Since this is a gaming music-exclusive app, it's also got a couple of fun features that other streaming apps don't have, like the ability to extend certain tracks "to run for up to an hour" or even the ability to block spoilers by hiding specific soundtracks.</p>




<p>As the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation">wait for the Nintendo Switch 2 continues</a>, it's fair to say Nintendo doesn't seem to be in much of a rush to announce the new console, or even to tease more news about it.</p>

<p>That said, the gaming giant did technically announce new hardware earlier this month...in the form of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-alarmo-interactive-alarm-clock">alarm clock Alarmo</a>, which plays Nintendo-themed sounds and visual scenes to help you wake up in the morning.</p>

<p>In any case, Nintendo Music is available right now on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nintendo.znba" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nintendo-music/id6466376604?l=en-GB" rel="noopener" target="_blank">iOS</a>. You'll need a Nintendo account and a Switch Online membership to use it.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nightingale-developer-inflexion-games-layoffs</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nightingale-developer-inflexion-games-lays-off-staff-and-closes-uk-studio.1024056/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nightingale-developer-inflexion-games-layoffs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Nightingale&nbsp;</em>developer Inflexion Games has become the latest studio to be hit by layoffs, with the developer blaming what it calls "the stark realities of the industry".</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/PlayNightingale/status/1851671600078143563" rel="noopener" target="_blank">statement on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Inflexion CEO Aaryn Flynn says that his studio has explored "every possible option" to lift itself out of an "incredibly challenging" situation, but that he has had to "make the difficult decision to let go some of our remarkable and talented team members".</p>

<p>Separately, an Inflexion employee <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/dozens-of-staff-laid-off-at-inflexion-as-part-of-restructuring" rel="noopener" target="_blank">confirmed to GamesIndustry.biz</a>&nbsp;that the number of layoffs is at least 22, based on internal company communications that employee apparently has access to.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/inflexion-games-nightingale-layoffs-umbrellas.jpg?itok=Y3M0UxRc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/inflexion-games-nightingale-layoffs-umbrellas.jpg?itok=5i8Kv46h 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Nightingale&nbsp;</em>developer Inflexion Games is laying off a number of staff and closing one of its offices.</figcaption></figure><p>Flynn goes on to say that while his studio is "proud" of&nbsp;<em>Nightingale</em>, the game's Early Access release hasn't achieved the level of commercial success necessary to "continue development at our studio's previous size".</p>

<p>As such, not only will these staff be laid off, but Inflexion's UK office will also be closing entirely. Flynn says he and his studio will "support each member of the team affected by the reductions".</p>

<p><em>Nightingale&nbsp;</em>itself will seemingly continue development; Flynn says he will provide "more details on our upcoming updates soon", so we'll likely get to find out what&nbsp;<em>Nightingale</em>'s future direction will be in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>In our&nbsp;<em>Nightingale&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/nightingale-preview">preview</a>, writer Robert Adams declared that there's "plenty of fun to be had" in the game, but that players should be aware of the game's "flaws" before diving in, which might give some idea as to why&nbsp;<em>Nightingale&nbsp;</em>hasn't been more successful.</p>




<p>It also looks as though a major initiative to fix some of&nbsp;<em>Nightingale</em>'s biggest problems, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1928980/view/4569553448608139865" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dubbed "Realms Rebuilt"</a>, hasn't been as successful as Inflexion had hoped.</p>

<p>Of course, this won't come as much of a salve to Inflexion, but it's not the only studio losing employees at the moment. The industry is still in the grip of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-june-14th">layoff wave</a>&nbsp;that has affected (and looks like it will continue to affect) companies both <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/riot-games-league-of-legends-layoffs">big</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/disco-elysium-developer-zaum-confirms-game-cancellation-and-layoffs">small</a>.</p>

<p>If you would like to check out&nbsp;<em>Nightingale</em>, it's available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1928980/Nightingale/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">right now on PC via Steam Early Access</a>.</p>
