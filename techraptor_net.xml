</figure>
<p>Kotick's reasoning regarding Embracer's desire to hurt Activision involves the two companies releasing what he considers to be similar games at similar times, including <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-island-2-release-date-moved-to-april" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d3ec9c2d-facf-442a-974a-8f5fa5d1240e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Dead Island 2</em></a>, <em>Insurgency</em>, and <em>Remnant 2 </em>(which Kotick says have similarities to <em>Call of Duty </em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-blizzard-deep-dive-breaks-down-diablo-iv-release-date-trailer" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="8a9c064f-770c-42b5-a1a7-d8ea93c11706" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Diablo IV</em></a>, respectively).</p><p>The lawsuit in question was brought against Kotick and his former companies in 2022 by AP7. It alleges that Kotick rushed the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-buys-activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick-staying-as-ceo" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ca03cb11-0e22-42e4-bb57-2d2f082d977b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">sale of Activision Blizzard to Microsoft</a> in 2021 in order to dodge the consequences of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activision-blizzard-employee-speaks-out-about-sexual-harassment" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="377898d2-bd83-41f5-9293-7f03ef9de06f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">numerous</a> sexual harassment <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activision-blizzard-employees-walk-out-after-new-explosive-allegations" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="37853141-4a88-4074-b619-4cc60e7ad075" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">allegations</a>.</p><p>Indeed, Kotick goes one step further and suggests that the "narrative" of those allegations was "false", and that AP7 was aided in its lawsuit by "activists" who "brought false and wholly unsubstantiated claims against Activision and Mr. Kotick".</p><p>Embracer, for its own part, was quick to respond to The Game File and Totilo. The company told Totilo that it was "humbled" by Kotick's claims, but that it "did not and [does] not need any help from a Swedish pension fund in competing with Activision". Claws out, eh?</p><figure role="group">

<p>It's not just <em>It Takes Two </em>that's doing well, though. In the aforementioned interview, Fares also confirms that <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/way-out" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e2cb188e-f0aa-4666-85ea-d14e29df56e5" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>A Way Out</em></a>, which was Hazelight's first foray into co-op-exclusive adventuring, has sold "over 12 million" copies as well.</p><p>Of course, <em>Split Fiction</em>, the studio's latest title, is "doing very well as well", according to Fares. At last count, <em>Split Fiction </em>had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-sales-4m-battlefield-skate" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="780fa581-f417-4e89-86d1-414cbf5909f8" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">sold four million copies</a>, and since that figure is from May last year, it's likely to be much further ahead than that by now.</p><p><em>Split Fiction</em>'s success is such that a movie version is in the works, with a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-movie-report" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="249fa328-8f25-4975-b468-c4dc37526434" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">bidding war reportedly taking place</a> over the rights to said movie.
