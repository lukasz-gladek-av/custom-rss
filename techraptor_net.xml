            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dungeons-dragons-pinball-game-announced-by-wizards-of-coast<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> pinball machine is coming next year. Wizards of the Coast is extending the world's most popular fantasy TTRPG into the realm of old-school time wasters thanks to a deal with Stern Pinball.</p>

<h2>The Dungeons &amp; Dragons Pinball Machine Announcement</h2>

<p>The official <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> account announced the Dungeons &amp; Dragons pinball machine via a <a href="https://x.com/Wizards_DnD/status/1874138499051298872?t" rel="nofollow">social media post</a> on X (formerly Twitter).</p>

<p>The post contained little detail. It was a collection of eyeball emojis followed by a thirty-second teaser trailer. The trailer was barebones, showing illustrations of a dungeon, a battle map, a d20 being rolled, and a blink and you'll miss it face of a red dragon. The name of the pinball machine, <em>The Tyrant's Eye</em>, alongside this imagery strongly implies the machine will involve toppling a red dragon tyrant.</p>

First, there is a limited supply of these pinball machines. Second, the machines will only be shipping to the mainland United States. Sorry, EU and UK fans. Third, purchases of these pinball machines will only be available to All-Access Stern Insider members.</p>

<p>As for the price for one of these maines? The Pro and Premium editions of the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> pinball machines will be sold at an MSRP of $6,999. Furthermore, there is a Limited Edition machine available for $12,999.</p>

<p>This does beg the question as to what these pinball machines contain. What novelty will they bring to the game of pinball? Will certain creatures and characters be showcased like the conniving Xanathar or the magnficent Mordenkainen? Those details will be revealed by Stern on January 3.</p>

<p>The release of a Dungeons &amp; Dragons pinball machine is a natural extension of the game's growing popularity. One that has surged thanks to the rise of actual plays like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-10-year-anniversary-live-show-announced-includes-fjord-and-jester" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Critical Role</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dropout-announces-vod-dates-for-their-actual-play-live-show-dimension20-time-quangle" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dimension 20</em></a> alongside the critical and commercial success of Larian Studios' <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/baldurs-gate-3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bioshock-creator-ken-levine-not-overly-impressed-by-generative-ai.1071861/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioshock-creator-ken-levine-generative-ai<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>BioShock&nbsp;</em>creator Ken Levine has expressed skepticism regarding generative AI, admitting its usefulness for technical tasks but doubting its ability to "tell [him] a really compelling story".</p>

<p>In a new interview with GamesIndustry.biz, Levine is asked for his opinions on generative AI and its "capability to react to players". Levine says he doesn't want to "underestimate" the technology, but that its biggest limitation right now is "persistence".</p>

<p>He gives the example of ChatGPT's video generator Sora, which he says is capable of generating a "beautiful" street scene featuring a woman walking down the street. However, if that woman were to "turn around and walk backwards", Sora wouldn't "remember where she has been".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bioshock-ken-levine-judas-generative-ai.jpg?itok=A5rCS0Qf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bioshock-ken-levine-judas-generative-ai.jpg?itok=MLoF-X4n 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ken Levine's&nbsp;<em>Judas&nbsp;</em>won't be using generative AI for its art or narrative.</figcaption></figure><p>It's this lack of persistence that Levine says means AI can't tell him a "really compelling story that has a three-act structure"; in fact, AI can't "even tell [him] multiple scenes", he says, going on to say that he's "not overly impressed" by the technology as it currently stands.</p>

<p>Despite that, Levine acknowledges that generative AI has its uses. He says that it's useful for "training your bug database to query how many bugs you have in certain situations", for instance, or "clearing [the&nbsp;<em>Judas&nbsp;</em>dev team's] analytics database".</p>

<p>However, he hasn't used it for concept art, largely "because there's some legal issues" around how generative AI sources its images. In case you're not aware, generative AI <a href="https://hbr.org/2023/04/generative-ai-has-an-intellectual-property-problem" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">can often use art without crediting the original artists</a> when generating content.</p>

<p>The full GI.biz <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-future-of-storytelling-with-ken-levine" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">interview</a> is well worth reading, especially if you're interested in keeping up with Levine's work on&nbsp;<em>Judas</em>. He discusses everything from the game's approach to player choice all the way through to his work on&nbsp;<em>BioShock</em>.</p>




<p>Levine isn't the only person in the industry to express skepticism when it comes to gen AI. Back in July, Nintendo <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-generative-ai-no-plans" rel="nofollow">declared that it had no plans</a> to use the tech in its games, acknowledging similar IP rights issues to Levine.</p>

<p>However, that hasn't stopped companies like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-generative-ai-vp" rel="nofollow">Netflix</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-working-hard-on-using-ai-to-make-npc-and-worlds-more-alive-reactive-and" rel="nofollow">Ubisoft</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/square-enix-ceo-pledges-to-be-aggressive-in-applying-ai-and-cutting-edge-tech-to" rel="nofollow">Square Enix</a>&nbsp;from going all in on generative AI. It looks like this is a debate that isn't going away anytime soon.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sifu Is Free on the Epic Games Store Right Now]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sifu-epic-games-store-free</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sifu-is-free-on-the-epic-games-store-right-now.1071840/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sifu-epic-games-store-free<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic has revealed the next free game that you can download and keep right now on its store, and it's perfect for fans of martial arts-based action brawlers, although its relentless difficulty might take some getting used to.</p>

<p>That's right: your next <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/sifu" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">free Epic Games Store game</a> is Sloclap's&nbsp;<em>Sifu</em>, which was actually an Epic Store exclusive on PC until <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/martial-arts-brawler-sifu-comes-to-steam-and-xbox-in-march" rel="nofollow">its release on Steam and Xbox</a>&nbsp;in March last year.</p>

<p><em>Sifu&nbsp;</em>is the latest in a string of free games Epic has been offering up on the Store for the last couple of weeks. It joins the likes of&nbsp;<em>Ghostrunner 2</em>,&nbsp;<em>Control</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Hot Wheels Unleashed</em>, along with plenty of others (which you can no longer redeem, unfortunately).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sifu-epic-games-store-free-brawl.jpg?itok=koXWYtYX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sifu-epic-games-store-free-brawl.jpg?itok=Vk0fyERH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Sifu&nbsp;</em>is free to keep right now on the Epic Games Store.</figcaption></figure><p>Since&nbsp;<em>Sifu&nbsp;</em>launched in February 2022, it's received <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/show-off-your-style-and-moves-in-sifu-free-summer-2022-update" rel="nofollow">a number of updates</a> bringing features like new game modes, extra modifiers, and more. If you played this one back at launch, it's worth giving it another shot, especially if you were into the core gameplay loop at the time.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Sifu</em>, it's a martial arts brawler in which you must battle your way through a series of dungeon-like environments in order to avenge your father.</p>

<p>The game's unique gimmick revolves around a magical talisman you wear; each time you die, you're resurrected, but you age a number of years, gaining attack power in return for a smaller health pool.</p>

<p><em>Sifu&nbsp;</em>adopts a structure that's not dissimilar to a roguelite; you can either press on with your current run or start again with the permanent upgrades you've already unlocked to give yourself a better chance of reaching the last boss while still young.</p>




<p><em>Sifu&nbsp;</em>isn't the only free game you can claim on PC right now, either. If you head on over to <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/vambrace_cold_soul" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a>, you can grab yourself a copy of roguelite RPG&nbsp;<em>Vambrace: Cold Soul</em>, and you won't have to pay a penny.</p>

<p>Like&nbsp;<em>Sifu</em>,&nbsp;<em>Vambrace&nbsp;</em>has also benefited from a number of updates over the years, including <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vambrace-cold-soul-update-features-difficulty-tweaks" rel="nofollow">difficulty tweaks</a>, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/devespresso-games-announces-new-game-and-more-changes-for-vambrace-cold-soul" rel="nofollow">New Game Plus mode</a>, and plenty more. Again, if you gave it a try at launch but put it down, you might want to pick it up again, especially since it won't cost you anything!</p>
