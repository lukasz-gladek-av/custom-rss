            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Games Workshop has announced its new <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000</em></a> Drukhari codex. This codex provides new rules and updates to an army that has been starved of support for a while. It also introduces new units for that army.</p>

<h2>The <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> Drukhari Codex Announcement</h2>

<p>In an official <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/5jk5xmlb/lady-malys-stands-tall-over-the-new-codex-drukhari/" rel="nofollow">Warhammer-Community</a> post, Games Workshop gave a preview of the <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> Drukhari Codex. The first major draw is the introduction of a new named unit. Lady Malys, the Archon of the Poisoned Tongue, as the name implies, brings swift and deadly swordplay to the battlefield alongside deadly poison. Poison that improves not just Malys' lethality, but the effectiveness of units under her.</p>

These miniatures will have new wargear options and alternate heads and bodies. These new archons will be featured in the new Realspace Raiders Battleforce box, which will contain a new archon, 10 Wyches, 10 Kabalite Warriors, 5 Hellions, 5 Scourges, 5 Incubi, and a Venom transport.</p>

<p>As for the quality-of-life improvements in the <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> Drukhari Codex, a few are highlighted. The book contains rules on five new detachments and a new Power from Pain army rule, which aligns with the Drukhari's sadomasochistic methods. The army rule will add new pain abilities to every unit's datasheet, which can be activated by spending pain points.</p>

<p>In addition, one of the new detachments features the body horror constructs known as the Haemonculi. The aptly named Coven of Agonies detachment includes a Talos, Cronos, 10 Wracks, and a Haemonculus unit, all dedicated to dangerous close-quarters combat.</p>

<p>The announcement of this new codex is a huge relief to Drukhari players since the army hasn't been updated since the announcement of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/warhammer-40k-guide" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000</em> Tenth Edition</a> back in the Summer of 2023. That is more than two years of new substantive updates or changes.</p>
