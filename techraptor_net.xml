            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/11-bit-studios-announces-this-war-of-mine-forget-celebrations-dlc-for-charity.1035960/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-war-of-mine-charity-dlc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>11 bit studios has announced a brand new&nbsp;<em>This War of Mine&nbsp;</em>DLC pack to celebrate the game's tenth anniversary, and all proceeds from the sale of said DLC will go to charity.</p>

<p>The aptly-named&nbsp;<em>Forget Celebrations&nbsp;</em>DLC spotlights Katia, a character from the original&nbsp;<em>This War of Mine&nbsp;</em>and a seasoned war journalist. When a missile attack destroys her home, she's forced into a fight not only for her survival, but also for the survival of the book she's writing.</p>

<p>All proceeds from&nbsp;<em>Forget Celebrations&nbsp;</em>will go straight to 11 bit's four charity partners, namely <a href="https://www.warchild.org.uk/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">War Child</a>, <a href="https://www.amnesty.org.uk/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Amnesty International</a>, <a href="https://www.libertyukraine.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Liberty Ukraine Foundation</a>, and Indie Games Poland, so the studio isn't taking a cent of your money for this one.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/this-war-of-mine-forget-celebrations-dlc-charity-gameplay.jpg?itok=VHavI0fs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/this-war-of-mine-forget-celebrations-dlc-charity-gameplay.jpg?itok=Yd-W5OBm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The new&nbsp;<em>This War of Mine&nbsp;</em>DLC will see all of its proceeds going to charity.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Forget Celebrations&nbsp;</em>will feature an entirely new story revolving around Katia, giving you the chance to revisit this cult survival classic through fresh new eyes.</p>

<p>Naturally, since this is another slice of&nbsp;<em>This War of Mine</em>, you can expect some very difficult decisions to crop up, as well as lots of opportunities to scavenge for resources and materials Katia will need to finish her book.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time 11 bit has donated all of the proceeds from all or part of&nbsp;<em>This War of Mine&nbsp;</em>to charity. When Russia first invaded Ukraine, the studio pledged all of the game's profits <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-war-of-mine-profits-to-be-donated-to-ukrainian-red-cross-over-next-7-days" rel="nofollow">to the Ukrainian Red Cross for a week</a>.</p>

<p>Not only that, but the game has been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-war-of-mine-is-being-taught-at-polish-schools" rel="nofollow">recommended by the Polish government</a> for teaching in schools, so it's not just gaming fans that are benefiting from&nbsp;<em>This War of Mine</em>'s penetrating look at wartorn societies.</p>

<p>By the end of that month,&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>sales had hit 441,000, which means it managed to sell almost <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-2-profitable-sales-350k" rel="nofollow">an extra 100,000 copies</a> in the week or so between then and its initial release.

We don't have a release date yet for&nbsp;<em>Forget Celebrations</em>, but 11 bit says it'll reveal more soon.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sakuna-chronicles-kokorowa-and-gears-of-creation-announced</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sakuna-chronicles-kokorowa-and-the-gears-of-creation-expands-the-sakuna-franchise.1035894/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sakuna-chronicles-kokorowa-and-gears-of-creation-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin&nbsp;</em>developer Edelweiss has announced&nbsp;<em>Sakuna Chronicles: Kokorowa and the Gears of Creation</em>, a spinoff that also officially inaugurates what must now be known as the&nbsp;<em>Sakuna&nbsp;</em>franchise.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Kokorowa and the Gears of Creation&nbsp;</em>will be published in the West by Marvelous' indie brand XSEED, the company behind games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/loop8-summer-of-gods-gameplay-walkthrough-shows-off-xseeds-coming-of-age-rpg" rel="nofollow">Loop8: Summer of Gods</a>&nbsp;</em>and potion shop sim&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/potionomics" rel="nofollow"><em>Potionomics</em></a>, among many others.</p>

<p>As you might expect from the title, the game will revolve around the titular Princess Kokorowa, a "high-ranking goddess presiding over wheels and inventions from her heavenly home". The debut trailer describes Kokorowa as "the tireless Goddess of Invention".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sakuna-chronicles-kokorowa-and-the-gears-of-creation-princess.jpg?itok=2VfZH1I7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sakuna-chronicles-kokorowa-and-the-gears-of-creation-princess.jpg?itok=cFO8gI-5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Sakuna Chronicles: Kokorowa and the Gears of Creation&nbsp;</em>will, as you might expect, revolve around Princess Kokorowa.</figcaption></figure><p>Along her journey, Kokorowa will meet larger-than-life characters like free-willed automaton Takebina, as well as a host of anthropomorphic animal characters who remain unnamed at time of writing.</p>

<p>We don't know a heck of a lot about&nbsp;<em>Sakuna Chronicles: Kokorowa and the Gears of Creation&nbsp;</em>yet. Edelweiss and XSEED say they'll announce more info, including platforms and release timing, at a later date.</p>

<p>It looks like the game will largely utilize a 3D art style rather than the mixture of 2D and 3D favored by&nbsp;<em>Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin</em>, although it could just be that we're yet to see any of the game's 2D sections.</p>

<p>In any case, you can take a look at the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Sakuna Chronicles: Kokorowa and the Gears of Creation&nbsp;</em>right here.</p>




<p>Released in 2020,&nbsp;<em>Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin&nbsp;</em>is a farming sim-action RPG hybrid that sees protagonist Princess Sakuna exiled to a distant island and tasked with clearing it of its monster infestation.</p>

<p>The game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sakuna-of-rice-and-ruin-breakout-hit-stop-stock-trading" rel="nofollow">proved a surprise hit at launch</a>, halting the stock trading of publisher Marvelous (XSEED's parent company) after share prices skyrocketed owing to the game's success.</p>

<p>If you want to get caught up before the launch of&nbsp;<em>Sakuna Chronicles: Kokorowa and the Gears of Creation</em>, then you can grab&nbsp;<em>Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1356670/Sakuna_Of_Rice_and_Ruin/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1023-CUSA09130_00-SAKUNA0000000000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS4</a> (and therefore also PS5 via backwards compatibility), and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/sakuna-of-rice-and-ruin-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Atomfall Release Date Brings Post-Nuclear Survival in March]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atomfall-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/atomfall-release-date-brings-post-nuclear-survival-in-march.1035807/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atomfall-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rebellion has announced the release date for its post-apocalyptic survival-action game&nbsp;<em>Atomfall</em>, and the UK-set game is set to arrive on PC and consoles in spring next year.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/801800/view/6491470391966433300" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a Steam post</a>,&nbsp;<em>Atomfall&nbsp;</em>arrives on March 27th, and it's also coming to Game Pass on day one, so if you're a subscriber, you'll get to check it out at no additional cost on Xbox consoles.</p>

<p>Rather unusually, this one's coming to Xbox One and PS4 as well as current-gen machines, too. Let it never be said that Rebellion doesn't provide for those who are still attached to their last-gen consoles.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/atomfall-release-date-gunman.jpg?itok=mstIcy2k 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/atomfall-release-date-gunman.jpg?itok=mURP-yNj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Atomfall&nbsp;</em>should provide succor for those who feel underserved by more recent Bethesda&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>fare.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Atomfall&nbsp;</em>is, it's a post-apocalyptic action-RPG inspired by real events but with a decidedly fictional bent.</p>

<p>The game is set five years after the very real Windscale nuclear disaster, a 1957 fire that caused radioactive material to leak from the eponymous Windscale nuclear site. In&nbsp;<em>Atomfall</em>'s universe, though, that disaster had much more far-reaching consequences than it did in real life.</p>

<p>As you explore&nbsp;<em>Atomfall</em>'s quarantine zone, you'll scavenge for resources, meet the locals, and contend with "bizarre characters, mysticism, cults, and rogue government agencies". In real life, of course, most of us Brits just apologized profusely, as is our wont.</p>

<p>You can check out the&nbsp;<em>Atomfall&nbsp;</em>release date trailer, which also gives a glimpse into the game's peculiarly British post-nuclear landscape (although it's not quite the blasted hellhole of&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>or <em>Stalker</em>), right here.</p>




<p><em>Atomfall&nbsp;</em>will give you the chance to use both ranged and melee weapons, but ammunition is scarce, so you'll have to blend firearms with melee weapons in order to create viable combat strategies.</p>

<p>If you're partial to the likes of the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-london-mod-million-downloads" rel="nofollow"><em>Fallout: London&nbsp;</em>mod</a> or the British dystopian vibes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/we-happy-few" rel="nofollow"><em>We Happy Few</em></a>, then&nbsp;<em>Atomfall&nbsp;</em>should definitely be on your wishlist. The game is coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/801800/Atomfall/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10007896" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/atomfall/9nc4wdl5kzbl" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a> on March 27th.</p>
