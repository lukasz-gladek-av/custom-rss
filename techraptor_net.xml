            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-version-16-march<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has announced the&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 1.6 release date, with the latest update for the stylish hack-and-slash action RPG set to launch next month.</p>

<p>Following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-version-1-5-release-date" rel="nofollow">January's Version 1.5</a>,&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 1.6, which bears the characteristically HoYoverse alternate title of "Among the Forgotten Ruins", will launch across all platforms on March 12th.</p>

<p>It'll bring with it a new chapter of the main story in which you must go up against the mysterious phantom thief syndicate known as Mockingbird, attempting to secure an artifact replete with secrets. Sounds like classic&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>stuff to me.</p>

The first, Soldier 0 - Anby, is an S-rank Electric Attack Agent who can amplify crit damage for her allies.</p>

<p>Another S-rank Agent, Trigger, will also be joining the fray in this update. Like Soldier 0 - Anby, Trigger's element is Electric, but she's a Stun Agent who can easily dodge attacks using her Sniper Mode and boost damage from her teammates.</p>

<p>Lastly, Pulchra will be available as an A-rank Physical Stun Agent in Version 1.6, and reruns will be available for Fire Anomaly Agent Burnice and Ether Attack Agent Zhuyuan throughout the update's life cycle.</p>

<p>As well as all of the above, you'll also get the chance to fight a new boss, Geppetto, in Hollow Zero, and there are plenty of other new challenges to try out as well.&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 1.6 is a characteristically dense HoYoverse update, so make sure to add March 12th to your calendar if you're a fan.</p>




<p><em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>is the latest game to be released by&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>studio HoYoverse (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-developer-mihoyo-rebrands-as-hoyoverse" rel="nofollow">formerly known as miHoYo</a>).</p>

<p>Like its predecessors,&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>is an action RPG, but its emphasis is far more on stylish hack-and-slash combat rather than the elemental experimentation of&nbsp;<em>Genshin&nbsp;</em>or the turn-based strategizing of&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail</em>.</p>
