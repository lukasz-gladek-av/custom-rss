            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/2001-space-odyssey-board-game-tasks-you-with-outsmarting-hal-9000<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Maestro Media has announced a <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em> board game. This board game adaptation of the iconic Stanley Kubrick sci-fi film tasks players with disabling the film's antagonist: the ship's onboard AI, HAL 9000.</p>

<h2>The <em>2001: A Space Odyssey Board Game</em> Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, the <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em> board game is a one-versus-many board game experience. It replicates the second half of the Stanley Kubrick film. Players are crew members on the spaceship Discovery One, and HAL 9000 has just turned on the crew. Players need to take turns navigating the ship with the ultimate goal of disabling HAL.</p>

HAL can take multiple turns, sabotaging vital systems and causing chaos for the crew. If HAL manages to terminate three systems or disable the ship's Life Support, then HAL 9000 wins.</p>

<p>Thankfully, each crew member on the Discovery One has a special ability that can be used to help the team outsmart HAL and stay one step ahead. If the crew wants to survive, they'll need to work together to shut HAL down.</p>

<p>The <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em> board game was designed by Phil Walker-Harding. Harding has a solid history in the tabletop gaming space, having worked for multiple beloved studios, including <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/z-man-games-announces-lord-of-rings-fate-of-fellowship-pandemic-middle-earth-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Z-Man Games</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cmon-reduces-staff-and-pauses-board-game-development-amid-us-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">CMON</a>, Kosmos, and Ravensburger. His design credits include <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/imhotep-review-friendly-competition" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Imhotep</em></a>, <em>Wrath of Fire Mountain</em>, <em>Cities</em>, and <em>Sushi Go!</em></p>

<p>It should be noted that the game's aesthetic elements are in keeping with the game's style. The original film was made in the 1960s, which means it has a distinct retro futurist aesthetic. That distinct blend of analog technology, bright color palettes, and sleek plastic instruments are captured in the board game's game pieces. Considering Kubrick's notorious attention to detail, it's a touch that fits this licensed game.</p>

<p>The <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em> board game is available now on Maestro Media's website at an MSRP of $29.99 not including shipping.</p>
