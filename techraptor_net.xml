            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new DLC pack for <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger </em>has been revealed, and it's bringing new Mega Digivolutions for you to try out, plus a brand new story episode and more.</p><p>As revealed in a brand new teaser trailer, the new DLC will be released in March. It's the third part of a series of episode packs that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/digimon-story-time-stranger-episode-pack-1-dlc-release-date" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4d1e799d-4ab4-438f-b813-3ba32d4d567b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">began back in December</a>, and as such, it adds similar content to its two predecessors.</p><p>The DLC teases the introduction of the "X Program", which was put into place to "cull the outsized Digimon population", according to the teaser trailer's description. We also get to see what looks to be another new form for Omnimon, around whom the new DLC packs revolve.</p><figure role="group">

<p>If you're not familiar with <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em>, it's the followup to the well-received JRPG <em>Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth</em>. Like its predecessor, the game alternates between exploration segments and turn-based battling, and it's got tons of Digimon combinations for you to discover as well.</p><p>The game sees you traveling between the real world and the digital world in order to unravel a mystery that spans not only multiple realities, but also time itself.</p><p>Just like <em>Cyber Sleuth</em>, you'll be tackling a main story quest that spans hours and hours of JRPG gameplay, as well as sidequests and a very in-depth Digimon rearing system.</p><p>You can check out the trailer for <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em>'s brand new DLC pack right here. It's a teaser, so it doesn't give too much away, but it should give you an idea of what to expect at any rate.</p>
