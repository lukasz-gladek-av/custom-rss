            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-masters-of-ceremony-warbond<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and developer Arrowhead Game Studios have announced a new&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Warbond, and it's bringing lots of new gear for you to kit out your Helldiver with next week.</p>

<p>Following on from Warbonds like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-borderline-justice-warbond" rel="nofollow">Borderline Justice</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-servants-of-freedom-warbond" rel="nofollow">Servants of Freedom</a>, Masters of Ceremony launches on May 15th on both PC and PlayStation 5, and it brings "all-new elite weaponry, capes, and armors", in Arrowhead's words.</p>

<p>The first new weapon up for grabs as part of Masters of Ceremony is a rifle known as the R-2 Amendment, which packs not only a 20-round magazine but also a close-quarters bayonet to make fighting easier if you're overwhelmed.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-masters-of-ceremony-warbond-sabre.jpg?itok=MuBlt8gN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-masters-of-ceremony-warbond-sabre.jpg?itok=BCxcr-ah 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A new&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Warbond is just around the corner.</figcaption></figure><p>A new melee weapon, the CQC-2 Sabre, is also being added. It is, according to Arrowhead, "a sabre hailing from an elegant time", and as you'd probably expect, it's great for carving up enemies in close quarters, although it won't serve you quite so well at range.</p>

<p>Also on the weapon front, the Masters of Ceremony Warbond brings the new G-142 Pyrotech Grenade, an explosive that will "spin and shower the surrounding area in sparks before ceremoniously exploding in a ball of flames".</p>

<p>The final weapon being added as part of this Warbond is the CQC-1 One True Flag, a patriotic symbol that also "doubles as a spear to drive home the values of [Super Earth's] glorious sovereignty".</p>

<p>Of course, the Warbond also packs in new armor and a new cape to accessorize with, allowing you to deck out your Helldiver for maximum fear factor when you're storming the battlefield.</p>




<p>Although work continues apace on&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>, creative director Johan Pilestedt is already thinking of new things. Back in January, he announced he <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-johan-pilestedt-sabbatical" rel="nofollow">would take a "sabbatical"</a> before returning to Arrowhead in order to work on the studio's next game.</p>

<p>Despite that,&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>isn't going away anytime soon; in April, a board game based on the shooter was <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/helldivers-2-board-game-fully-funded-in-12-minutes-on-gamefound" rel="nofollow">fully funded on crowdfunding site Gamefound</a> within just twelve minutes of going live.</p>

<p><em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>is available now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/helldivers-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and its Masters of Ceremony Warbond arrives on May 15th.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/yes-palworld-is-changing-mechanics-because-of-the-nintendo-lawsuit.1184211/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-mechanics-changing-nintendo-lawsuit<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>developer Pocketpair has revealed that recent changes to the game's mechanics are, indeed, due to the ongoing Nintendo lawsuit, and that more changes are incoming in the next update.</p>

<p>Speaking <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1920360001794945232" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on X</a>, Pocketpair says that just "as many have speculated", changes implemented in&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>'s 0.3.11 update, which was released in November, "were indeed a result of the ongoing litigation [from Nintendo]".</p>

<p>The changes in question revolve around&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>'s Pal-summoning mechanic, which used to be achieved through the use of a device known as the Pal Sphere, but is now instead done with a "static summon next to the player".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-nintendo-lawsuit-mechanics-smokie.jpg?itok=5Osk9DDr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-nintendo-lawsuit-mechanics-smokie.jpg?itok=ilvNV2Zl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Palworld</em>'s mechanics are changing because of a lawsuit brought by Nintendo, and more changes are coming.</figcaption></figure><p>Pocketpair acknowledges "frustration", both its own and that of its players, with regards to these changes. However, the studio says that not making the changes "would have led to an even greater deterioration of the gameplay experience".</p>

<p>The studio goes on to say that&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>'s upcoming 0.5.5 update will bring "yet another compromise". Specifically, you'll no longer glide using Pals; instead, you'll need a glider item in your inventory, although Pals "will still provide passive buffs to gliding".</p>

<p>Just like the first change, Pocketpair says it knows this alteration will be "disappointing", but that "these changes are necessary in order to prevent further disruptions to the development of&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>".</p>

<p>In case you need a reminder, the lawsuit in question was brought against Pocketpair by Nintendo <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-palworld-pocketpair-lawsuit" rel="nofollow">back in September last year</a>. The <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-lawsuit-patents-demands-nintendo" rel="nofollow">offending elements</a> of&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>appear to be specific gameplay mechanics that bear resemblance to&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>, including the aforementioned gliding and capture systems.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-nintendo-lawsuit-mechanics-gatling.jpg?itok=A4W4QDlR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-nintendo-lawsuit-mechanics-gatling.jpg?itok=w7sxUEkP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nintendo is gunning for&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>, at least in a legal sense.</figcaption></figure><p>Despite the ongoing lawsuit, development on&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>continues. The game recently received a major update allowing players to play with one another <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-crossplay-update-patch-notes" rel="nofollow">across different platforms</a>, and Pocketpair appears to be working on a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-dating-sim-announced-again" rel="nofollow">cursed-looking dating sim spinoff</a> that may or may not be real.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what happens as a result of this ongoing Nintendo-Pocketpair legal battle, but I'd be very surprised to see&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>to continue without more major changes.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-stendhal-nerf</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-strongest-ability-is-getting-nerfed.1184163/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-stendhal-nerf<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>'s most powerful abilities is about to get nerfed, so if you want to keep doing absolutely outrageous damage numbers with Maelle, you've got one more day to get your fill.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/expedition33/status/1920387317002293303" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, developer Sandfall Interactive says that Maelle's ability Stendhal has "ended up overshadowing most other options" in the fencer's arsenal. The studio says the ability was "underwhelming for most of development", which resulted in a "big damage boost" that the developer says "overdid it".</p>

<p>Sandfall says that it "hadn't planned to make any balance changes" this early into&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>'s release, but that Stendhal's overpowered nature "clearly stood out", making things "a bit too easy" for those using Maelle in combat.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/clair-obscur-expedition-33-stendhal-nerf-maelle-counter.jpg?itok=IUpEg18O 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/clair-obscur-expedition-33-stendhal-nerf-maelle-counter.jpg?itok=vFjl_iwl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Maelle's most powerful ability is getting nerfed in&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Despite Stendhal's nerf, Sandfall says it still very much wants you to "be able to break the game", and that you "absolutely still can".</p>

<p>Stendhal will remain a "strong single-hit skill with great synergy potential", but it'll be "more in line with everything else" rather than standing out as Maelle's best option in every combat situation.</p>

<p>Changes to the ability will come as part of&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>'s first round of hotfixes, which will arrive on Steam tomorrow, with other platforms to follow soon after. There likely won't be any other changes on the same level as those being made to Stendhal.</p>

<p>If you're wondering why you haven't yet unlocked the Stendhal ability for Maelle, it becomes available automatically at the beginning of&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>'s third act. I shan't say any more for fear of spoilers.</p>




<p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>is a turn-based RPG heavily inspired by classic JRPG franchises like&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy</em>.</p>

<p>Developed by French studio Sandfall Interactive, the game takes place in the Belle Epoque-inspired land of Lumiere, which is subject to the whims of the Paintress, a monstrous figure who paints a descending number each year, causing everyone of that age or above to die.</p>

<p>It's proven a popular game among fans; sales of&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">reached two million</a> within less than two weeks of the game's launch, despite the fact it's also available on Game Pass.</p>
