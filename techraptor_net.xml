            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lego-fortnite-brick-festival-storm-chasers<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic has revealed big changes for&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>in the coming days, including a major new social roleplaying experience and an update to the core mode that adds lots of new content.</p>

<p>First up,&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite</em>'s new Brick Life mode is coming on December 12th. Described by Epic as an "all-new social roleplay experience in the&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>universe", the mode will allow you to "make new friends, explore the sights, land your dream job, and move into your new home", according to Epic's description.</p>

<p>Brick Life looks to be an experience that wants to compete with&nbsp;<em>The Sims&nbsp;</em>(and also <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>, perhaps), so of course, you'll also be able to build your dream home and furnish it with all kinds of fun accessories, by the looks of things.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lego-fortnite-brick-life-odyssey-update-phones.jpg?itok=bS3qgpjP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lego-fortnite-brick-life-odyssey-update-phones.jpg?itok=HaYo1H59 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Lego Fortnite</em>'s new Brick Life mode is a "social roleplaying experience" that has shades of&nbsp;<em>The Sims&nbsp;</em>about it.</figcaption></figure><p>In the trailer, we also see&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>characters riding on vehicles, working out at the gym, stealing diamonds from some kind of bank vault, and engaging in plenty of other activities, so it looks like there'll be lots to do in Brick Life.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for this new&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>mode right here.</p>




<p>The second major piece of&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>news released by Epic today is a name change and major update for&nbsp;the main&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite</em>&nbsp;mode. It's now called&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite Odyssey</em>, and it'll be part of a new bespoke&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>section within the main&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>game.</p>

<p>Tomorrow,&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite Odyssey&nbsp;</em>will get a brand new update by the name of Storm Chasers, and it's set to bring a new biome, new dungeons to explore, and new enemies to fight, plus "a formidable big bad" in the form of the titular Storm King. Here's the trailer!</p>




<p>In case you're not aware,&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>is a spinoff mode within massively popular battle royale game&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>.</p>

<p>Released in December last year, the mode debuted to a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lego-fortnite-debuts-with-over-23-million-concurrent-players-will-get-updates-in-early" rel="nofollow">staggering number of concurrent players</a>, with that number <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-festival-launches-with-over-600000-concurrent-players-as-lego-fortnite-passes" rel="nofollow">only increasing in the following days</a>.</p>

<p>Since then,&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>has received a number of updates, including new features, tweaks to existing mechanics, and even <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-fortnite-may-2024" rel="nofollow">a crossover with&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em></a>, among many other things.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>for free right now as part of&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>, which is available to play on PC, PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and mobile devices.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chained-echoes-dlc-ashes-of-elrant-q2-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/chained-echoes-dlc-ashes-of-elrant-brings-new-character-and-more-next-year.1055757/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chained-echoes-dlc-ashes-of-elrant-q2-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Deck13 and developer Umami Tiger have announced&nbsp;<em>Ashes of Elrant</em>, the first major story DLC for JRPG homage&nbsp;<em>Chained Echoes</em>. It's due to arrive sometime in the second quarter of next year.</p>

<p><em>Ashes of Elrant&nbsp;</em>will bring a brand new playable character in the form of the White Wolf (no, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-2077-sales-witcher-production" rel="nofollow">not that one</a>), an anthropomorphic wolfman character who looks to be a close combat melee specialist.</p>

<p>It's not just the White Wolf, though;&nbsp;<em>Ashes of Elrant&nbsp;</em>will also introduce new story segments to&nbsp;<em>Chained Echoes</em>, as well as new areas to explore, more than 40 new enemies and bosses to take on, and more equipment to collect, plus lots more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/chained-echoes-ashes-of-elrant-dlc-white-wolf.jpg?itok=qdSZ8wIM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/chained-echoes-ashes-of-elrant-dlc-white-wolf.jpg?itok=4g1diigx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Chained Echoes Ashes of Elrant&nbsp;</em>DLC will add a new playable character and more.</figcaption></figure><p>Story-wise, Umami Tiger (previously known simply as solo developer Matthias Linda) hasn't revealed too much about what you can expect, which is par for the course for a story-driven RPG.</p>

<p>However, we do know&nbsp;<em>Ashes of Elrant&nbsp;</em>will take place just before the finale of&nbsp;<em>Chained Echoes</em>, and that it'll involve a "new call for help" being sent to the Crimson Wings. Answering that call will lead to uncovering "more about the origin of the Order of Leonar and Lenne's past".</p>

<p>Naturally, you'll have to play&nbsp;<em>Ashes of Elrant&nbsp;</em>in order to learn more. We don't have a release date for it yet, but the DLC is set to arrive sometime in Q2 next year, so you can likely expect it sometime around spring or summer.</p>




<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Chained Echoes</em>, it's a throwback JRPG created by German solo dev Matthias Linda. The game features deliberately retro-style pixel art visuals, as well as turn-based combat and a story that revolves around multiple characters.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Chained Echoes&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1229240/Chained_Echoes/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/chained-echoes/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/chained-echoes/9N1WWRPJ12FK" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/chained-echoes-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>, and its&nbsp;<em>Ashes of Elrant&nbsp;</em>DLC is set to launch in Q2 next year.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-10m</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-rivals-player-count-reaches-10-million-in-just-72-hours.1055718/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-10m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>NetEase has announced that its online superhero shooter&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>has already crossed a major player count milestone just a few days after its initial release.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1865909229070016851" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on the&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>X account, the game has crossed the 10 million player mark already, which is particularly impressive given that the announcement was made almost exactly 72 hours after&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' launch on Friday.</p>

<p>In the post, NetEase thanks "each and every one" of the people who have checked out&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>so far and shares a special piece of artwork depicting some of the game's interpretations of classic Marvel characters like Wolverine, Hawkeye, and, uh, Squirrel Girl.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-rivals-player-count-10-million-artwork.jpg?itok=1oOjPhrX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-rivals-player-count-10-million-artwork.jpg?itok=UlZJaAp8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>seems to have proven pretty popular among players.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting this player count doesn't necessarily translate to revenue for NetEase;&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>is free-to-play, after all, and all of its heroes are unlocked for all players at the start of the game, although a battle pass is up for sale if you do want to shell out some real-world cash.</p>

<p>Still, a quick look at <i>Marvel Rivals</i>' <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2767030/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB page</a> shows that the game still appears to be going pretty strong. Its 24-hour player count peak sits at 480,990 at time of writing, with 296,557 players currently playing the third-person hero shooter.</p>

<p>That's without taking into account player numbers on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S as well. Naturally, many of those 10 million players will have jumped in to check the game out and will have no intention of sticking around, but it's still safe to call&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>a success, I think.</p>




<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>is, it's a third-person multiplayer hero shooter created by NetEase Games.</p>

<p>Bearing <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-announced" rel="nofollow">more than a passing resemblance</a> to Blizzard's&nbsp;<em>Overwatch</em>,&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>sees teams of Marvel heroes and villains competing against one another to complete objectives like holding territory or escorting a moving object to its destination.</p>

<p><em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>is available to play for free right now on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/mighty-morphin-power-rangers-ritas-rewind-review-power-of-friendship</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mighty-morphin-power-rangers-ritas-rewind-review-the-power-of-friendship.1055679/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/mighty-morphin-power-rangers-ritas-rewind-review-power-of-friendship<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I was able to attend Summer Game Fest live earlier this year, and one of the games that hyped me up the most was, you guessed it, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/mighty-morphin-power-rangers-ritas-rewind-preview-mighty-good-time" rel="nofollow"><em>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita's Rewind</em></a>. The last time I consumed any sort of <em>Power Rangers</em> media was back in the 90s, but even still, something about <em>Rita's Rewind</em> gave me a great deal of excitement.</p>

<p>And now, after having spent time going through <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/digital-eclipse/games" rel="nofollow">Digital Eclipse's</a> <em>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita's Rewind </em>as both solo and co-op, I'm pleased to say it lived up to my expectations. This retro-fueled beat 'em up is the perfect homage to both <em>Power Rangers</em> fans as well as those who just love a good ol' brawl in the streets.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ritas-rewind-special.jpg?itok=EqXz3zQb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ritas-rewind-special.jpg?itok=5jihDthC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>When it comes to clowns, I don't hold back.</figcaption></figure><h2>Punchin' 'em Good in <em>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita's Rewind</em></h2>

<p>Whether you're new to beat em' ups or you scarf them down like some sort of gaming glutton, <em>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita's Rewind </em>hits the spot. It's a side-scrolling beat em' up first and foremost, but it does have a few tricks up its sleeve to differentiate it from the rest. Of course, the main draw to <em>Rita's Rewind </em>are the Power Rangers themselves.</p>

<p>I'm a Blue Ranger guy -- same as I was back in the 90s -- and getting to play him in video game form is a treat. You can choose from any of the Rangers (and an extra one after you beat the game!) and each has a pretty simplified, but nonetheless satisfying moveset.</p>

<p>Each Power Ranger has the same set of moves, but their animations are different to help make them feel more distinct from one another. For example, the Blue Ranger incorporates his lance into attacks, while the Black Ranger uses an axe. Like I said, character choice doesn't seem to make much of a difference unlike in, say, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-shredders-revenge" rel="nofollow"><em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge</em></a>, but it's nice to have distinct visual flair.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ritas-rewind-elevator.jpg?itok=u4PLwEcP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ritas-rewind-elevator.jpg?itok=-LgvA3q8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Fighting with friends is always better.</figcaption></figure><p>A few more moves create a satisfyingly simple set of attacks anyone can enjoy, including an attack that launches a Ranger into the air. From the air, you can take out pesky Tenga Warriors that tend to fly up high. You can finish a combo off by launching yourself down on an enemy with a strong kick or a "down smash."</p>

<p>Combat is gratifying, especially with the sound effects that accompany whacking the enemy. I just wish there was a bit more complexity to the combat in <em>Rita's Rewind</em>, as that would make this great brawler something truly excellent. Nonetheless, there wasn't a moment I didn't have fun throughout the 3-hour or so campaign.</p>

<p>Definitely bring a friend along, if that wasn't already clear. While playing through <em>Rita's Rewind </em>is in itself an enjoyable experience, the optimal way is always to play with friends. Having a buddy come along on the harder difficulty made for a wonderful session of play, and I can't wait to get all the Rangers together for another go.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ritas-rewind-co-op.jpg?itok=gUJMn3oZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ritas-rewind-co-op.jpg?itok=7fV3y7DE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You can see their little faces distort as you punch them. I'm just now noticing this and I love it.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita's Rewind </em>Mixes Things Up</h2>

<p>Whether you're fighting through a toxic factory or bashing away at Putties in a misty graveyard, stage variety g<em>ives Rita's Rewind </em>a lot of charm. However, there are also moments throughout the campaign that mix things up and change the gameplay altogether, and that's another point where <em>Rita's Rewind </em>shines.</p>

<p><em>Rita's Rewind</em> occasionally mixes things up and becomes an on-rails shoot 'em up. During several points during the campaign, you take control of a Dinozord and start blasting away at flying ships and ground hazards in your way. I'm a junkie for <em>Star Fox 64</em>, and these segments play a lot like this, so you know I'm having a blast.</p>

<p>But wait, there's more! That's right, you can, of course, take control of a Megazord as well. You get to partake in brief segments as the Megazord fights another gigantic foe. It plays a bit like <em>Punch-Out </em>here, where you have to recognize enemy attack patterns and dodge around them, then go in for the ol' one-two.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ritas-rewind-bike_0.jpg?itok=_nBmwjvL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ritas-rewind-bike_0.jpg?itok=ydXXw5oD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There's also some high-octane motorcycle segments too! <em>Akira </em>slide!</figcaption></figure><p>Megazord segments are decent enough, but fall flat compared to the other areas of gameplay in <em>Rita's Rewind.<strong> </strong></em>Get hit once as a Megazord and you're thrown back -- then you have to charge in again while dodging attacks and hope you can land your hit. It's a bit finicky and takes a while to get the hang of.</p>

<p>This is especially true if you're playing multiplayer, as it switches who controls the Megazord after getting hit once. The transition period for switching between players, going in, and hoping to punch your opponent again slows the pace of the gameplay down considerably.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ritas-rewind-dinozord.jpg?itok=64iK_i42 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ritas-rewind-dinozord.jpg?itok=g8XrLsiS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Each Power Ranger does, of course, have a different Dinozord.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita's Rewind </em>Feels Authentically Retro</h2>

<p>From both a visual and sound perspective, <em>Rita's Rewind</em> is absolutely top tier. By far, my favorite aspect of the visual design in <em>Rita's Rewind</em> is its CRT filter. This isn't your ordinary, "we'll throw some lines on the screen and call it CRT" type of deal. It turned my monitor into a gosh darn CRT television.</p>

<p>The filter adds a slight curvature to the edges of the screen, which most other filters in games seem to ignore. Of course, if this isn't to your liking, you can either forgo the filter altogether or choose from several others. Either way, <em>Rita's Rewind</em> is meant to be seen through this retro lens.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ritas-rewind-megazord.jpg?itok=vLOzonUS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ritas-rewind-megazord.jpg?itok=jfrPX4sU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Tell me this doesn't look awesome.</figcaption></figure><p>The spritework is also exceptional, as are the animations. Everything about <em>Rita's Rewind</em> oozes with love for the IP. During those Dinozord/Megazord segments, you're met with a nice blend of 2D and 3D graphics that make for an exceptionally action-packed, wild ride as you blast your way through foes.</p>

<p>There's also an exciting, rock-and-roll soundtrack that pays homage to <em>Power Rangers</em>' Tokusatsu origins. It's the kind of music that'll pump you up and serves as a wonderful complement to the non-stop action. Composer Sean Bialo is no stranger to retro-inspired OSTs, and even worked on games like <em>Shredder's Revenge</em>. Bialo's experience is clearly on display here.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ritas-rewind-rollercoaster.jpg?itok=7CDFMPtt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ritas-rewind-rollercoaster.jpg?itok=fN_zAnQG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Can't enjoy a darn rollercoaster ride in peace...</figcaption></figure>

<p>My complaints are few and far between. Besides the just OK Megazord segments, bosses can feel a bit of a button mash on higher difficulties, especially when the game employs relatively simple fighting mechanics. <em>Rita's Rewind </em>is also just a tad too short for my liking, but there is some replayability with various collectibles and mission objectives to complete.</p>

<p>All in all, <em>Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers: Rita's Rewind</em> is a love letter to the franchise and is a great beat 'em up to boot, so there's a lot to love about this game. Grabbing a few friends and plowing through the campaign for <em>Rita's Rewind</em> sounds like the perfect way to close what is by all accounts a fantastic year for video games.</p>
