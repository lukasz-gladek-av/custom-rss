            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has revealed the latest in its&nbsp;<em>Universes Beyond&nbsp;</em>series of&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering&nbsp;</em>crossovers, and I hope you're ready to get tubular, because the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are on their way to a tabletop near you.</p>

<p>Launching on March 6th, the new&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering - Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&nbsp;</em>set will feature new sets of boosters, as well as a brand new Commander deck featuring none other than the Turtles' leader himself, Leonardo.</p>

<p>Per a press release, while Leonardo will serve as the Commander deck's face commander, you'll also be able to take advantage of a new mechanic that allows you to combine the strength of two Commanders with the Partner ability.</p>

<p>Eastman himself has returned to illustrate the new set's four headliner cards, which all feature "original borderless artwork" by the&nbsp;<em>TMNT&nbsp;</em>creator, as well as a "shiny stamp" of his signature.</p>

<p>Additionally, existing&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering&nbsp;</em>cards will be tricked out with&nbsp;<em>TMNT</em>-themed artwork in the new set's Collector Boosters. Wizards has revealed a new&nbsp;<em>Turtles</em>-themed version of Doubling Season, but there are 20 source material cards with new artwork in total.</p>

<p>Not only that, but lands in the new set will be decked out with new full-art pizza variants as part of new Pizza Bundles, although Wizards promises that "the toppings are sure to be contentious". I think that's probably an understatement, given what we've seen so far.</p>

It joins the likes of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/final-fantasy-magic-gathering-crossover-brings-classic-art-and-new-mechanics" rel="nofollow">Final Fantasy</a>&nbsp;</em>(which <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-final-fantasy-made-200m-in-one-day" rel="nofollow">proved a hugely successful crossover</a>),&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/official-magic-gathering-sonic-hedgehog-secret-lair-is-gonna-go-fast" rel="nofollow"><em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em></a>, and Marvel's very own Merc with a Mouth <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/deadpool-secret-lair-brings-merc-with-mouth-to-magic-gathering" rel="nofollow">Deadpool</a>, among many others.</p>

<p>The news also comes just a few months after the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering&nbsp;</em>movie's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-movie-screenwriters-have-been-summoned" rel="nofollow">screenwriters were announced</a>&nbsp;in the form of&nbsp;<em>Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol&nbsp;</em>writer Noah Gardner and&nbsp;<em>Calls&nbsp;</em>scribe Aidan Fitzgerald.</p>

<p><em>Magic: The Gathering</em>'s new&nbsp;<em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&nbsp;</em>set launches on March 6th, with pre-release events happening between February 27th and March 5th. A full decklist for the Turtle Power! Commander deck will be revealed "closer to the set's release", according to Wizards.</p>
