            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/esa-announces-iicon-not-e3<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The ESA, the driving force behind E3, has announced a new event by the name of iicon, but don't get your hopes up; it really doesn't sound a heck of a lot like E3 at all.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.theesa.com/entertainment-software-association-unveils-iicon-game-changing-thought-leader-summit-to-harness-the-power-of-interactive-entertainment-and-shape-the-future-of-business-and-culture/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on its website, the ESA (which stands for Entertainment Software Association) describes iicon as an event aiming to "connect visionaries, thought leaders and innovators from across industries to harness the power of interactive entertainment".</p>

<p>In short, it sounds like iicon is much more corporate-minded than E3; it's more for business executives and industry figures than the general public, so don't expect to see any jaw-dropping game or console reveals.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/iicon-stanley-pierre-louis-esa-head.jpg?itok=Wb8qOeuy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/iicon-stanley-pierre-louis-esa-head.jpg?itok=ohqdHDQe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>ESA head Stanley Pierre-Louis says iicon will create "a space for visionaries" to "come together, connect, and reimagine what's possible through interactive entertainment".</figcaption></figure><p>The new event's <a href="https://www.iicon.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official website</a>&nbsp;has lots of copy aimed primarily at brands, offering them the chance to "align" with a "rapidly growing industry" and to "harness video game technology, innovations, and communities to elevate your brand".</p>

<p>According to the site, iicon promises "visionary keynotes, engaging discussions and workshops, and elite networking opportunities" with execs "shaping the future of entertainment, business, and technology".</p>

<p>The event won't just be about gaming, either; it also promises to incorporate other industries adjacent to gaming and interactive media, like film, TV, and music, as well as "sports, healthcare, education, finance, and more".</p>

<p>The ESA says that attendance will be "by invitation only", so it doesn't sound like you'll just be able to buy a ticket and rock up as a member of the public, which seems like it's in keeping with iicon's more exclusive approach.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/e3-2019-esa.jpg?itok=_bGvK2N_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/e3-2019-esa.jpg?itok=7r0mPMqU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The ESA's new iicon event does not sound much like E3.</figcaption></figure><p>Companies like Take-Two, Ubisoft, and Xbox have already signed up for iicon, which should provide another clue that the event won't be anything like E3; after all, some of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-wont-actually-be-at-e3-2023-but-will-still-host-live-event-in-los-angeles" rel="nofollow">companies</a> confirming their attendance publicly <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-nintendo-sony-skipping-e3-2023" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">shunned</a> E3 in the years before its demise.</p>

<p>In case you need a reminder, the ESA officially killed E3 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/e3-is-officially-dead" rel="nofollow">in December 2023</a>&nbsp;following a chaotic couple of years that included show cancellations and studios turning down appearances at the convention.</p>

<p>That's another reason iicon will almost certainly be nothing like E3; it would be a very unusual (and arguably foolish) business move to create an event exactly like one that was canned not even a year and a half ago.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in ESA news, meanwhile, the trade body recently took President Trump to task over his <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/esa-trump-tariffs-comments" rel="nofollow">newly-introduced tariffs</a>, which the organization says could cause "significant harm to everyday Americans". Trump has paused tariffs on Canada and Mexico, but has gone ahead with a 10% tariff on China-imported goods.</p>

<p>In any case, the inaugural iicon event will take place between April 27th and 30th next year at the Las Vegas Fontainebleau Resort. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-early-access-mixed-reviews-50k-players<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Players are starting to get their hands on the early access (as distinct from Early Access) release of&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7</em>, and while the numbers are pretty impressive even for an iconic franchise like this one, player impressions are decidedly mixed.</p>

<p>In case you need a refresher,&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7</em>'s early access period started today for those who bought either the Deluxe or Founders Edition of the game. This isn't an "Early Access" release; it's the full game, but some players are getting to check it out ahead of the full release <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-pc-specs" rel="nofollow">on February 11th</a>.</p>

<p>First, the good news for publisher 2K.&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7</em>'s early access launch has debuted to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1295660/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">over 55,000 players</a> on Steam at time of writing, which surely portends well for the full release of the game. I wouldn't be surprised if&nbsp;<em>Civ 7&nbsp;</em>smashed&nbsp;<em>Civ 6</em>'s 162,657 <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/289070/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">concurrent player record</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/civilization-7-early-access-mixed-reviews-city.jpg?itok=FGHaDJ2s 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/civilization-7-early-access-mixed-reviews-city.jpg?itok=pFGxgtT4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>has debuted in early access to high player numbers and mixed reviews.</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately for 2K, the picture painted by the game's Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1295660/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_VII/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reviews</a> is perhaps a more ambiguous one.</p>

<p>At time of writing,&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>has attracted a Mixed rating across 2,587 reviews, with just 41% of those reviews being positive. Admittedly, the figure represents less than 5% of the game's overall early access player base, but that's still not a great look.</p>

<p>Common complaints from players include criticisms aimed at the game's user interface, as well as accusations that the game feels <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/NDYEE/recommended/1295660/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">"unfinished"</a> and that game customization is <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/machine001/recommended/1295660/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">lacking</a>.</p>

<p>Even some positive reviewers express dissatisfaction with the UI; one <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198049076071/recommended/1295660/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reviewer says</a> the "pros...outweigh the cons" when it comes to&nbsp;<em>Civ 7</em>, but describes the user interface as "abysmal".</p>




<p><em>Civilization&nbsp;</em>has been through cycles similar to this before; players often criticize new installments of the series for making changes to previous versions, and reception gradually improves as updates and DLC packs get released.</p>

<p>Time will tell whether or not that's what's happening here. We'll probably learn more about what the overall player impression of&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>is when it launches in full on February 11th for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1295660/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_VII/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/sid-meier-s-civilization-vii/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-for-xbox-series-xs/9N23HJHSC6BL" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>
