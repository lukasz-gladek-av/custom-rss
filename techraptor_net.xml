            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yuito Kimura, one of the two co-founders of&nbsp;<em>Granblue&nbsp;</em>developer Cygames, has stepped down from his role as executive director at the company, citing ongoing health concerns.</p>

<p>Kimura's departure was announced today via the official Cygames <a href="https://www.cygames.co.jp/en/news/id-24576" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, with the company confirming that his responsibilities "have been allocated among the current board members", so it sounds like they won't be searching for a specific replacement for Kimura.</p>

<p>Cygames' announcement doesn't give a reason for Kimura's departure, but over on <a href="https://x.com/KimuraYuito/status/1972912672619516331" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">social media</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/cygames-executive-director-yuito-kimura-steps-down" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gematsu</a>), the man himself says that he has ongoing health issues that have made his duties at Cygames difficult to carry out. These health issues are, however, not life-threatening, according to Kimura.</p>

Let's hope not!</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with Cygames, it's the studio responsible for most of the games in the&nbsp;<em>Granblue&nbsp;</em>series, including the 2024 action RPG&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/granblue-fantasy-relink" rel="nofollow">Granblue Fantasy: Relink</a>&nbsp;</em>and fighting game&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy Versus&nbsp;</em>(although development on that game was handled by Arc System Works).</p>

<p>Cygames was founded by Kimura and president Koichi Watanabe back in 2011, going on to develop a number of mobile games for the Japanese market, including&nbsp;<em>Rage of Bahamut</em>,&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest Monsters: Super Light</em>, and, of course,&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy</em>.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, given how big the&nbsp;<em>Granblue&nbsp;</em>series has become overseas, it's still not possible to play the original&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy&nbsp;</em>in English. Other Cygames titles, like <i><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragalia-lost-shutdown-coming-this-november" rel="nofollow">Dragalia Lost</a>&nbsp;</i>and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/umamusume-pretty-derby-western-release-date" rel="nofollow">positively meme-worthy&nbsp;<em>Umamusume: Pretty Derby</em></a>, have received Western releases.</p>

Stay tuned for more on this.</p>
