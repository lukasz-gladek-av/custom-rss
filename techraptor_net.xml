<p>It's not just deciding whether citizens are going to get through the barricade, however; you'll also have to manage your camp's resources and reinforce your defenses if you want to survive.</p><p>Periodically, you'll have to fend off waves of the infected as they attack your compound, and to do so, you'll take command of flying drones and use their weaponry to dispatch the zombie hordes.</p><p>Once you've quarantined survivors, that's not the end of it; you'll then be able to harvest them for valuable samples that will allow you to level up your staff and upgrade your facilities.</p><p>You can check out a trailer for <em>Quarantine Zone: The Last Check</em>, which should be a good fit for you if you've enjoyed games like the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/who-is-zombie-is-undead-document-thriller-coming-next-month" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5a5d2e7b-e5c2-43aa-b7a7-c33f3ebfc520" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">rather unfortunately-titled <em>Who Is Zombie</em></a><em> </em>in the past, right here.</p>
<p>When <em>Quarantine Zone: The Last Check </em>launches, it'll only set you back $19.99 or your regional equivalent, although Brigada and Devolver say they'll announce regional pricing for the game nearer to its release date.</p><p><em>Quarantine Zone: The Last Check </em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3419520/Quarantine_Zone_The_Last_Check/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">PC via Steam</a> on January 12th.
