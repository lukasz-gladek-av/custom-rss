            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/vanguard-normandy-brings-wwii-board-game-experience-to-kickstarter-this-november<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Warlord Games has announced a new board game is coming to Kickstarter. The game, Vanguard: Normandy, is a historically inspired WWII board game built on the foundation of Warlord Games' acclaimed wargame, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/bolt-action-third-edition-breathes-new-life-to-wwii" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Bolt Action</em></a>.</p>

<h2>The <em>Vanguard: Normandy</em> Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, Vanguard: Normandy focuses on the struggle between the US and German armies as they battle to hold Normandy in the Summer of 1944. 1-4 players can take control of the American or German armies and partake in multiplayer campaign missions inspired by historical accounts. The game will also include a full solo-play mode following the real battles of the US Army.</p>

Players will capture objectives, navigate the fog of war, manage vital resources, gain different types of Requisition points, use them to deploy their forces.</p>

<p>No prior experience with Bolt Action is required. <em>Vanguard: Normandy</em> is a standalone board game experience. In fact, Warlord Games designed this game to lower obstacles for those interested in the hobby of wargaming.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not everyone wants to assemble and paint miniatures before they play a game, so we're taking<br>
those obstacles away for Vanguard: Normandy whilst creating a board game that still feels like<br>
Bolt Action. By adapting the unit activation and pin mechanisms, the game will have a familiarity<br>
to Bolt Action players - the rest of the game, however, is brand new!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A copy of<em> Vanguard: Normandy</em> will contain the following:</p>

<ul><li>More than 50 pre-assembled and pre-painted US and German miniatures, including armored vehicles</li>
	<li>15 Double-sided interlocking hex boards</li>
	<li>Fully detailed unit information cards</li>
	<li>Full color rules, campaign books, and punchboards</li>
	<li>A set of custom dice and wooden counters</li>
</ul><p>The crowdfunding campaign for <em>Vanguard: Normandy</em> will go live on Kickstarter November 5. If you sign up to the game's mailing list before it goes live, you will receive an exclusive dice tray at no additional charge alongside the campaign's fulfillment.</p>
