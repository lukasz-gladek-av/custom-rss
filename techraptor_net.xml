      <div><p>Stone Blade Entertainment recently launched a crowdfunding campaign for <em>Ascension 15th Anniversary Edition</em>. The campaign celebrating a milestone for the iconic deckbuilding game is a runaway success, reaching its goal within minutes of it going live.</p>



<p>According to its campaign page, <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/projects/stoneblade/ascension-15th-anniversary#/section/rewards/reward-product-85307" rel="nofollow"><em>Ascension 15th Anniversary Edition</em></a> provides both newcomers and veteran players a pristine version of the game, complete with a promotional embossed tin case, foil cards, and more.</p>

The Return of the Fallen expansion introduces a new Fate mechanic, and is framed as the final battle against Samael for the fate of Vigil. This expansion is included in the 15th anniversary collector's edition of the game.</p>

<p>If you already have copies of <em>Ascension</em>, the <em>Ascension 15th Anniversary Edition</em> campaign is full of optional add-ons. In addition to center decks for all 15 expansions, you can purchase discounted card sleeves, playmats, the Ascension Tactics spin-off and another deckbuilding game, <em>Shards of Eternity</em>. The sleeves and center decks are exclusive to this Gamefound campaign.</p>

<p>The different pledge levels of <em>Ascension 15th Anniversary Edition</em> are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>15th Anniversary Collector's Edition for $99:</strong> A copy of the game with all foil cards, a limited edition tin, and every Year One promo card.</li>
	<li><strong>15th Anniversary Promo Pack for $30:</strong> Every unique promo card revealed as part of the crowdfunding campaign</li>
	<li><strong>Ascension Deckbuilding Game for $40:</strong> The base version of&nbsp;<em>Ascension Fourth Edition</em></li>
	<li><strong>Dreams &amp; Nightmares Collector's Edition (CE7) for $99:</strong> A limited-edition tin box containing all foil cards of the <em>Delirium</em> and <em>Deliverance</em> expansion, delirium dice and insight tokens, all Year Seven promo cards, and exclusive game components.</li>
	<li><strong>The Ultimate Collection for $499:</strong> The 15th Anniversary Collector's Edition of the game, all expansions and promo cards, Gamefound Exclusive Center Deck versions of <em>Ascension Fourth Edition</em> and <em>Ascension Legends</em>, and a Collector's carry case designed to hold everything</li>
</ul><p>At the time of writing, the crowdfunding campaign has raised&nbsp;$239,366, more than twenty times its initial funding goal of $10,000. The campaign ends September 4. All products in the campaign are expected to ship by December 2026.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Zenless Zone Zero Version 2.2 Set for September Release]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-version-22-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/zenless-zone-zero-version-2-2-set-for-september-release.1278279/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has revealed that&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 2.2 will be arriving in early September, bringing with it new Agents for your squad, a new story chunk to uncover, and more.</p>

<p>Following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-version-21-release-date" rel="nofollow">July's Version 2.1 update</a>, Version 2.2 of&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero</em>&nbsp;is launching on September 4th (which, given <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-september" rel="nofollow">recent developments</a>, is a pretty daring release date to commit to on HoYoverse's part, it must be said).</p>

<p>Story-wise, you'll be dealing with the fallout of the Exaltists' conspiracy and getting to know the Obol Squad, a new elite unit alongside whom you'll be working in order to "uncover long-buried truths", as well as to reveal the hidden stories behind one of its members.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zenless-zone-zero-version-2.2-seed-orphie.jpg?itok=roa5RDDh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zenless-zone-zero-version-2.2-seed-orphie.jpg?itok=xlZ7I-ZC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Two new Agents are joining the fray in&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 2.2.</figcaption></figure><p>That agent is Seed, and you'll be getting the chance to add her to your team in&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 2.2. She's a genius mechanic and Electric Attack Agent who can enhance sustained damage across her whole team.</p>

<p>Joining Seed is the twofer unit Orphie &amp; Magus, a Fire Attack Agent who can boost team Attack and cause Aftershocks to ignore part of your enemy's Defense stat. They're joined by S-rank Bangboo Mercury, who can serve as a tank for their team.</p>

<p>Alongside Seed and Orphie &amp; Magus, you'll also get another chance to pick up Evelyn and Trigger throughout the course of Version 2.2's cycle, and Soldier 0 - Anby, who's "currently undergoing intensive training", will be returning "in future versions" as well.</p>

<p>Of course, Version 2.2 will also bring with it plenty of new events and gameplay improvements, so once you've played through the main part of the new update's story, there should still be plenty for you to do.</p>




<p><em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>is <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">available to check out right now for free</a> on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and mobile devices. Version 2.2, "Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night", launches on September 4th.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Splitgate Peer-to-Peer Support Confirmed After Sequel Returns to Beta]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splitgate-peer-to-peer-support-confirmed</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/splitgate-peer-to-peer-support-confirmed-after-sequel-returns-to-beta.1278234/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher 1047 Games has announced that peer-to-peer support is coming to&nbsp;<em>Splitgate</em>, allowing you to continue playing the game online even after the central servers are shut down.</p>

<p>Back in July, 1047 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splitgate-2-beta-layoffs" rel="nofollow">announced</a> that in order to focus on rebuilding&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>(which is returning to beta following negative feedback for its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splitgate-2-1-0-release-date" rel="nofollow">initial release</a>), servers for the original&nbsp;<em>Splitgate&nbsp;</em>will be closed down, but at the time, the devs said they would consider either offline play or peer-to-peer support.</p>

<p>Now, in a news post on the official&nbsp;<em>Splitgate&nbsp;</em>website, 1047 confirms that the direction it's chosen to go down is peer-to-peer play, which means you'll still be able to play with others online, although you'll do so via direct connection and not through a central server.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/splitgate-peer-to-peer-servers-shooting.jpg?itok=HlgMDqex 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/splitgate-peer-to-peer-servers-shooting.jpg?itok=gOsRvXZq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you love the original&nbsp;<em>Splitgate</em>, fear not; it'll still be playable after next week.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as introducing peer-to-peer play, 1047 says it's made "previously unreleased, stockpiled, or work-in-progress" content for&nbsp;<em>Splitgate&nbsp;</em>playable, including 14 new maps for you to gallivant around.</p>

<p>In essence, peer-to-peer play means that certain players will act as hosts, so the stability of the game will depend on how strong their connection is. You'll be able to view in-progress&nbsp;<em>Splitgate&nbsp;</em>games from the server browser.</p>

<p>You'll also be granted all in-game cosmetics to enjoy, and all of your previous progression will remain intact as well, so everything you've unlocked over the course of your time with&nbsp;<em>Splitgate&nbsp;</em>will still be accessible.</p>

<p>PC and console play will still be supported, as will cross-play, so you'll be able to play&nbsp;<em>Splitgate&nbsp;</em>alongside players on other platforms. Anticheat, however, will not be enabled, so there's a chance you may come across more nefarious behavior than before.</p>




<p>You can read the full FAQ for how peer-to-peer play will work in&nbsp;<em>Splitgate&nbsp;</em>via the <a href="https://www.splitgate.com/news/splitgate-1-lives-on-through-peer-to-peer-support" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement post</a>, and you can check the game out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/677620/Splitgate/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/splitgate/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/splitgate/9P4S1BPJLPHZ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.</p>
