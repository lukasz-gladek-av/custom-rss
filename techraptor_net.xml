            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Games Workshop has dropped a preview for another <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-age-of-sigmar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em></a> army. The upcoming <em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em> Flesh-Eater Courts battletome contains new mechanics and updated rules for the delusional undead army, and GW has provided a sneak peek.</p>



<p>In an official <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/nudwrxbe/knightly-bannermen-join-a-riotous-bacchanal-in-the-flesh-eater-courts-armies-and-regiments-of-renown/" rel="nofollow">Warhammer-Community</a> post, Games Workshop provided a glimpse at the changes in the new <em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em> Flesh-Eater Courts battletome. This is the second undead army to get a spotlight in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-fourth-edition-signals-new-age" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">newest edition</a> of the fantasy miniatures war game recently. The other army was the ghostly <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/games-workshop-previews-changes-in-new-warhammer-age-of-sigmar-nighthaunt-battletome" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nighthaunt</a> army.</p>

That delusion can even be altered on the battlefield, adjusting the horde's behavior.</p>

<p>One of those changes are in the form of the Knights of New Summercourt delegation. It centers around Ushoran, Mortarch of Delusion. This delegation fights alongside Knights, Varghulf Courtiers, and Serfs. With "In Their Sire's Shadow," they can do a free Charge once per battle alongside Ushoran when certain conditions are met.</p>

<p>But Ushoran's behavior can change on a whim, which the <em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em> Flesh-Eater Courts battletome embodies. Once per turn, Ushoran can use "A Duel, Good Sir!" to challenge an enemy general. If the general accepts, both they and Ushoran can only target each other until either one of them are defeated.</p>

<p>Since the Flesh-Eater Courts are undead, dying can be more of a setback than a danger. "Red Errantry Hosts" lets you set up a replacement unit of Knights that have been defeated, albeit with half the models (rounded up).</p>

<p>Additionally, all units can utilize certain passives. "Equinox Parade" gives units a Run bonus on round one. "Ritual Dance" gives a movement bonus in round 3. And "Eat Your Fill" lets units heal after combat on round four.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em> Flesh-Eater Courts battletome will be available for pre-order this upcoming Saturday.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/docked-announced-saber-interactive</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/docked-is-a-realistic-dock-management-sim-from-saber-interactive.1270251/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Saber Interactive has announced&nbsp;<em>Docked</em>, a realistic management sim that tasks you with managing a busy port after a devastating hurricane has swept through it.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Docked&nbsp;</em>will have you operating heavy machinery, overseeing supply and logistics chains, and managing the overall operations of the port. It's very much one for the <i>Construction Simulator&nbsp;</i>crowd, although it's got the disaster twist of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/snowrunner" rel="nofollow">SnowRunner</a>&nbsp;</em>as well.</p>

<p>Unlike Astragon's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/seafarer-the-ship-sim-astragon" rel="nofollow">recently-announced&nbsp;<em>Seafarer: The Ship Sim</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Docked&nbsp;</em>will see you managing the operations of the port itself, so you won't actually be sailing any ships in this one; rather, you'll be responsible for what happens to them when they come into port.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/docked-announced-ship.jpg?itok=SwaYy9F_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/docked-announced-ship.jpg?itok=OYMiZSdL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You won't be sailing this thing, but you will get to decide what happens to it in your port.</figcaption></figure><p>While you may not be sailing the ships that come into Port Wake, you will be operating lots of heavy machinery, including "colossal ship-to-shore cranes" and "sturdy, heavy-duty tractors", among other things.</p>

<p>As you'd probably expect from a Saber Interactive game, the simulation element will be important in&nbsp;<em>Docked</em>; you'll need to "tighten ropes, position materials, optimize weight distribution, [and] navigate delicate cargo with little margin for error".</p>

<p>As you revitalize your port, you'll need to upgrade and expand it "one crane at a time". Each job you take on will earn you cash, and you can reinvest that cash into Port Wake, buying new vehicles and upgrading your fuel and power supplies as you go.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Docked</em>, which gives you a pretty good sense of what you can expect from the game, right here.</p>




<p><em>Docked&nbsp;</em>doesn't have a release date yet, but when it does arrive, it'll be coming to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. If you want to keep up with the game, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2487300/Docked/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wishlist it on Steam right here</a>. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/raccoin-coin-pusher-roguelike-balatro-publisher</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/balatro-publishers-raccoin-wants-to-be-your-new-roguelike-obsession.1270209/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>publisher Playstack has announced&nbsp;<em>Raccoin</em>, a roguelike that blends strategic deckbuilding with the arcade thrills of coin-pusher machines, and it's getting a playtest very soon.</p>

<p>As revealed by Playstack and developer Doraccoon in a press release,&nbsp;<em>Raccoin&nbsp;</em>is a ""nonstop dopamine rush" in which you must utilize special coins, combos, and synergies to get the results you want from a classic arcade coin-pusher.</p>

<p>If all of this is starting to sound familiar, that's probably because you're one of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-5m" rel="nofollow">millions of people</a> who has played&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Raccoin&nbsp;</em>very much seems to be in the same vein; it looks to be attempting to do for coin-pushers what&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>did for poker.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/raccoin-playstack-gadget.jpg?itok=AgD07SwI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/raccoin-playstack-gadget.jpg?itok=FIgtO5x6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Raccoin&nbsp;</em>wants to do for coin-pushers what&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>did for poker.</figcaption></figure><p>Some of the special coins you can look forward to include one that allows you to grow "a money tree" for your machine, as well as a "Nuclear Coin" that will provide a more propulsive push.</p>

<p>Doraccoon is promising "over 100 unique items", all of which have the potential to "dramatically shift the course of your run". Naturally, since this is a&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>-style arcade roguelike, you'll be stacking multipliers and building crazy combos as well.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to different characters to play as, each of whom brings their own unique personality and themed coins. These include a "math-savvy raccoon manager" and a "quirky biologist". Is the former a manager of raccoons or a raccoon themselves (or both)? You'll have to play to find out!</p>

<p>If you want to get a sense for what <i>Raccoin&nbsp;</i>plays like, you can check out the announcement trailer right here.</p>




<p>Of course, a better way to join the&nbsp;<em>Raccoin&nbsp;</em>hype is to playtest the game yourself, and starting from August 18th, you'll get the chance to do just that. All you need to do is request access over on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3784030/RACCOIN_Coin_Pusher_Roguelike/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official Steam store page</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[PUBG PS4 and Xbox One Support Ending in November]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pubg-ps4-and-xbox-one-support-ending-in-november</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pubg-ps4-and-xbox-one-support-ending-in-november.1270167/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Krafton has announced that later this year, it will wind down support for&nbsp;<em>PUBG: Battlegrounds&nbsp;</em>on PS4 and Xbox One, meaning that if you want to play the console versions of the game, you'll have to pick up a next-gen machine.</p>

<p>This news comes via an <a href="https://www.pubg.com/en/news/9005" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official post</a> on&nbsp;the&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>website, in which Krafton confirms that support for the last-gen versions of its popular battle royale shooter will come to an end on November 13th.</p>

<p>Krafton describes this decision as "a necessary step towards aligning&nbsp;<em>PUBG Console&nbsp;</em>with current-gen consoles", and it should also help to "provide...players with a more stable gameplay environment on console", as well as ensuring "a smoother, more seamless experience with future updates".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pubg-ps4-xbox-one-support-ending-explosion.jpg?itok=gi3c0IQe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pubg-ps4-xbox-one-support-ending-explosion.jpg?itok=eVJj5-lM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>PUBG</em>'s PS4 and Xbox One versions will soon lose support.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Krafton, once this transition is complete, console players will see "improved visuals and more stable frame rates", and not only that, but ongoing crash issues should be resolved "through memory-related optimizations".</p>

<p>Since&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>is a live-service game, it probably won't shock you to learn that it won't be playable in single-player, either. Once support ends for the PS4 and Xbox One versions, that's it; they won't be playable or downloadable anymore.</p>

<p>If you're on PS5, you'll need to redownload&nbsp;<em>PUBG</em>'s new PS5 version once the transition happens, but if you're on Xbox Series X|S and you already have the game installed, you'll automatically get the new version thanks to Smart Delivery.</p>

<p>Once the transition happens,&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>will support 1080p at 60fps or 1440p at 30fps on Xbox Series S, while Series X and PS5 Pro will enjoy dynamic 4K resolution at 60fps. The base PS5 version will also hit 60fps, but at just 1440p resolution.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pubg-ps4-xbox-one-support-ending-swamp.jpg?itok=F7QS0HIo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pubg-ps4-xbox-one-support-ending-swamp.jpg?itok=5Z46HUbz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The newer console versions of&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>should look and play nicer, at least.</figcaption></figure><p>This news follows the announcement that the PC version of&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-pubg-anti-cheat-system" rel="nofollow">is getting new anti-cheat systems</a>, but that probably won't affect console players, since crossplay between console and PC isn't supported.</p>

<p>In any case, you can download and play&nbsp;<em>PUBG: Battlegrounds&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/578080/PUBG_BATTLEGROUNDS/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP5082-CUSA14081_00-PTSBUN0000000000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/pubg-battlegrounds/c0mn5dn8kr3f" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and the PS4 and Xbox One versions of the game will become unavailable on November 13th.</p>
