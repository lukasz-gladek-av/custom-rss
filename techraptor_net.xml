            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic has announced that you'll soon be able to buy exact amounts of V-Bucks in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>, so if you want something that's 500 V-Bucks but you've only got 400, you won't need to buy hundreds more to make up the difference.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/new-v-bucks-exact-amount-purchasing-offer-in-fortnite?lang=en-US" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on the game's official website, Epic confirms that this feature is coming on October 14th, and that it'll be available not only in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>, but also in&nbsp;<em>Rocket League&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;Fall Guys&nbsp;</i>as well.</p>

<p>There's a catch, though: you won't be able to take advantage of this feature on PlayStation. It'll be available on every other platform, though, so presumably, thanks to the wonders of cross-progression, you can just play somewhere else, top up your account, then head back to PlayStation to enjoy your spoils.</p>

<p>Although the PlayStation limitation will be frustrating for those playing on that platform, Epic says it'll "work to make [the new feature] available everywhere", so you may see the option appearing on PlayStation in future as well.</p>

<p>Exact Amount offers will be available "in increments of 50" for&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Rocket League</em>'s in-game currencies, while in&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys</em>, increments of 100 will be available, with balances being rounded up to the nearest 100. Epic says this is being done in order to "align with item prices".</p>

<p>News of this latest&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>feature follows the revelation back in July that&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-ios-uk-cma" rel="nofollow">may never return to iOS in the UK</a> thanks to decisions made by the country's CMA regulatory body, although the game did make its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-ios-app-store-returns" rel="nofollow">triumphant return to the US App Store back in May</a>.</p>

Surprise!</figcaption></figure><p>We're in the midst of&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s Shock 'n Awesome season at the moment, which introduces bugs that are reminiscent of (but totally legally distinct from)&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>'s Terminids for you to fight.</p>

<p>You can do that, and a lot more besides, in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>for free right now on...well, on pretty much every platform going, although you may want to avoid PlayStation if you're looking to use the new Exact Amount feature.</p>
