            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/transformers-reactivate-canceled-as-splash-damage-staff-at-risk-of-redundancy<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Splash Damage has announced that upcoming online multiplayer action game&nbsp;<em>Transformers: Reactivate&nbsp;</em>has been canceled, and that a number of roles at the studio may now be "at risk of redundancy".</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/splashdamage/status/1877020458454749485" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message</a> on social media platform X, Splash Damage says that as well as canceling&nbsp;<em>Transformers: Reactivate</em>, the studio will be "scaling down to refocus [its] efforts on other projects", which is why some staff may be laid off.</p>

<p>The studio doesn't specify which staff members or which departments are most at risk, but it does say that "having to say goodbye" to employees "hurts even more" than not being able to release&nbsp;<em>Transformers: Reactivate</em>.</p>

The game was first revealed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everything-announced-at-game-awards-2022" rel="nofollow">during the Game Awards opening ceremony back in 2022</a>, but since then, Splash Damage has been pretty quiet about its development.</p>

<p>Outside of the (admittedly rather evocative) announcement trailer, Splash Damage didn't reveal much about&nbsp;<em>Reactivate</em>, save that it would be an online-focused action game for 1-4 players and that it would come to PC and consoles.</p>

<p>Following the initial reveal, however, Splash Damage did announce that it had purchased <i>Transformers: Reactivate&nbsp;</i>development partner Bulkhead. As far as we know, Bulkhead remains a Splash Damage subsidiary despite the cancellation.</p>

<p>At some point, Splash Damage planned to hold a closed beta for the game, but it looks like that test never materialized either, at least for public-facing signups.</p>

<p>It doesn't sound like Splash Damage is shutting down entirely as a result of this cancellation, so we'll have to wait and see what the studio does next. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/finspan-wingspan-creators-january<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Wingspan&nbsp;</em>studio Stonemaier Games has announced&nbsp;<em>Finspan</em>, the latest game in the&nbsp;<em>Wingspan&nbsp;</em>family. As you've probably already guessed, the game expands the card-based engine-building gameplay of&nbsp;<em>Wingspan&nbsp;</em>into the world of marine life.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Finspan</em>, which follows on from&nbsp;<em>Wingspan&nbsp;</em>and its <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/embrace-your-inner-dracologist-with-wyrmspan" rel="nofollow">dragon-based successor&nbsp;<em>Wyrmspan</em></a>, has you playing as a marine researcher who must observe aquatic life over three zones: the Sunlight Zone, the Twilight Zone, and the Midnight Zone.</p>

<p>Each of&nbsp;<em>Finspan</em>'s dive sites will help you with a key aspect of your research, from growing your fish collection to discovering new eggs and even hatching eggs to create schools of fish. If you've played&nbsp;<em>Wingspan</em>, you'll probably be familiar with the basic idea here, albeit with a marine twist.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stonemaier-games-finspan-play.jpg?itok=yFRfN_Xc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stonemaier-games-finspan-play.jpg?itok=n-viEVPW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Finspan&nbsp;</em>takes the&nbsp;<em>Wingspan&nbsp;</em>formula to new depths, as it were.</figcaption></figure><p>Players will compete with one another to assemble vast arrays of marine life, with the winner being the player that gains the most points. You can score points through "fish, eggs, young, schools, and achievements", according to Stonemaier.</p>

<p><em>Wingspan&nbsp;</em>designer Elizabeth Hargrave says that while she knew fish were often requested by fans of her game, she "didn't feel like [she] had the bandwidth to do them justice", but that she's "absolutely delighted"&nbsp;<em>Finspan&nbsp;</em>will soon be out there in the world.</p>

<p>Hargrave goes on to say that she hopes&nbsp;<em>Finspan&nbsp;</em>"will inspire people to connect with the marine world and conservation in the same way that&nbsp;<em>Wingspan&nbsp;</em>has made people birders".</p>

<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Finspan</em>, which also shows off the game's beautiful board and fish card artwork, right here.</p>




<p><em>Finspan&nbsp;</em>will support up to five players of ages 10 and up, and a game should take you somewhere between 45 and 60 minutes to complete, which is roughly in keeping with&nbsp;<em>Wingspan</em>'s duration.</p>

<p>Notably, the game will also offer a solo play mode created by Automa Factory, the studio that also worked on solo play modes for Stonemaier titles like&nbsp;<em>Scythe&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Tapestry</em>, as well as&nbsp;<em>Wingspan&nbsp;</em>itself.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Finspan&nbsp;</em>when it launches on January 22nd to <a href="https://stonemaiergames.com/games/finspan/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">buy direct from Stonemaier</a>, followed by a wider retail release in February.
