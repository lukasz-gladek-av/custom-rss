            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/division-2-story-dlc-delayed-again<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has delayed the upcoming&nbsp;<em>The Division 2&nbsp;</em>story DLC out of the game's sixth year, but it looks like the third season will remain on the cards for February.</p>

<p>In an X <a href="https://x.com/TheDivisionGame/status/1884255116636705006" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, Ubisoft says that it wants to "deliver the best possible experience" for&nbsp;<em>The Division 2</em>'s story DLC, and so it "will not ship during Year 6". That likely means it won't be released until at least summer this year, although it could be even longer.</p>

<p>The DLC was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/division-heartland-division-2-resurgence-news" rel="nofollow">announced back in 2023</a>&nbsp;and was initially intended to be part of the game's fifth year of content, adding new zones, main missions, and "a whole new endgame structure" towards the end of 2024.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-division-2-story-dlc-delayed-beyond-2025-map.jpg?itok=UDvPwOZ5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-division-2-story-dlc-delayed-beyond-2025-map.jpg?itok=TnDQ-HoP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Division 2</em>'s story DLC has been delayed again.</figcaption></figure><p>However, in December 2023, the game's story DLC <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/division-2-story-dlc-delayed-to-2025-as-ubisoft-launches-project-resolve-to-improve" rel="nofollow">was delayed</a>&nbsp;beyond 2024, making this the second time the DLC has been pushed back. Perhaps appropriately, that first delay was revealed alongside "Project Resolve", an initiative that aimed to improve&nbsp;<em>The Division 2&nbsp;</em>across the board.</p>

<p>Ubisoft hasn't revealed a new release date for&nbsp;<em>The Division 2</em>'s story DLC. Honestly, at this stage, I don't think I'd be surprised if the expansion was canned altogether, although perhaps the game still enjoys a sizable enough player base for these delays not to spell the end.</p>

<p>The pushback of this DLC comes after what has been a pretty horrendous year for Ubisoft. The studio has endured multiple <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-h1-2024-25-fiscal-results" rel="nofollow">high-profile failures</a>, including&nbsp;pirate game&nbsp;<em>Skull and Bones</em>, open-world adventure&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, and first-person shooter&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing" rel="nofollow"><em>XDefiant</em></a>.</p>

<p>Not only that, but Ubisoft has&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-february" rel="nofollow">delayed</a> its upcoming flagship RPG&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-march" rel="nofollow">twice</a>, faced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-strike-investor-letter" rel="nofollow">investor unrest</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-lawsuit-data-policy" rel="nofollow">legal action</a>, and closed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-layoffs-leamington-closure" rel="nofollow">three of its studios</a>, with several more undergoing downsizing.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-johan-pilestedt-sabbatical<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Arrowhead Game Studios' chief creative officer Johan Pilestedt is to take an extended "sabbatical" from work, and when he returns, he'll be working on a new Arrowhead game.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1884015181895983223" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Pilestedt says that while fans have been enjoying&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>for almost a year, he's been "living it since early 2016", and if the first <i>Helldivers&nbsp;</i>is included, "since 2013".</p>

<p>He says that eleven years of working on the&nbsp;<em>Helldivers&nbsp;</em>games have caused him to neglect his family, his friends, his wife, and himself, and so he wants to take some time to "redeem what was lost from all of those that supported [him] for over a decade".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-johan-pilestedt-sabbatical-omens-of-tyranny.jpg?itok=d_Ad7Gc7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-johan-pilestedt-sabbatical-omens-of-tyranny.jpg?itok=IjcaBny3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Helldivers 2</em>'s creative lead Johan Pilestedt is taking some time out from work.</figcaption></figure><p>Expressing faith in his Arrowhead colleagues to continue doing "their utmost" to deliver "amazing stuff" for&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>while he's off, Pilestedt says that on his return, he will "start working on the next Arrowhead game".</p>

<p>Whether that means he won't be involved in&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>anymore going forward isn't clear, but at the very least, it seems his focus will be elsewhere for a while, so major showstopping creative updates for&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>may be few and far between in future.</p>

<p>Well-wishers flocked to X to express their hope that Pilestedt enjoyed his break, with the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shuhei-yoshida-leaving-playstation" rel="nofollow">recent PlayStation leaver</a> Shuhei Yoshida and Kinda Funny's Greg Miller sending their best wishes to Pilestedt.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with Pilestedt, he served as the CEO and chief creative officer of Arrowhead Game Studios between 2009 and last year before <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-arrowhead-new-ceo" rel="nofollow">stepping down and appointing a new CEO</a> in order to focus on his creative work.</p>

<p><em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/helldivers-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wwe-2k25-release-date-cover-star-and-gameplay-details-revealed.1093722/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wwe-2k25-release-date-revealed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>2K has announced the&nbsp;<em>WWE 2K25&nbsp;</em>release date, as well as who'll be on the wrestling sim's cover and what kind of new gameplay improvements you can expect.</p>

<p>Per a new trailer,&nbsp;<em>WWE 2K25&nbsp;</em>will officially release across PC and consoles (including last-gen machines, intriguingly enough) on March 14th, and if you pick up one of the game's two special editions, you can play it a week early.</p>

<p>The cover star is none other than "Original Tribal Chief" Roman Reigns. After&nbsp;<em>WWE 2K24</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wwe-2k24-announced" rel="nofollow">WrestleMania Showcase focus</a>, the new game's Showcase mode will instead revolve around Reigns and the extended Anoa'i wrestling family, which also includes The Rock, Rikishi, and Jacob Fatu, among others.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wwe-2k25-release-date-showcase.jpg?itok=5lOFox96 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wwe-2k25-release-date-showcase.jpg?itok=GDqDmiDq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>WWE 2K25</em>'s cover star is Roman Reigns, and he's also heavily involved in the game's Showcase mode.</figcaption></figure><p>The Showcase mode will be titled The Bloodline's Dynasty, and it'll let you relive "historic showdowns" involving the extended Anoa'i family or "flip the script and change the outcome of select match-ups".</p>

<p><em>WWE 2K25&nbsp;</em>will also introduce The Island, a hub featuring "a series of areas built around different WWE themes" in which you'll try to impress Reigns by completing a number of different challenges and tasks.</p>

<p>2K is boasting that&nbsp;<em>WWE 2K25&nbsp;</em>will feature the largest roster of any&nbsp;<em>WWE 2K&nbsp;</em>game to date; it'll feature over 300 wrestlers spanning multiple generations of WWE history, including the likes of Rey Mysterio, Chyna, and Bret "Hitman" Hart, plus more.</p>

<p>Of course, you can also look forward to lots of new match types in&nbsp;<em>WWE 2K25</em>, including intergender wrestling for the first time in the series' history, as well as new Underground Matches, the return of Chain Wrestling, and Bloodline Rules Matches.</p>




<p>Three different versions of the game will be available: <a href="https://wwe.2k.com/2k25/buy/?release=wwe-2k25-standard-edition" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Standard</a>, <a href="https://wwe.2k.com/2k25/buy/?release=wwe-2k25-deadman-edition" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Deadman</a>, and <a href="https://wwe.2k.com/2k25/buy/?release=wwe-2k25-the-bloodline-edition" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bloodline</a>.</p>

<p>The Standard version launches on March 14th, and it'll also get you cross-gen access, which is becoming rarer and rarer these days. Meanwhile, Deadman and Bloodline both pack in extra goodies and launch a week early.</p>

<p><em>WWE 2K25&nbsp;</em>comes out on March 14th (or March 7th, depending on your edition) on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2878960/WWE_2K25/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP1001-PPSA22696_00-WWE2K25000000000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/wwe-2k25-standard-edition/9P6NQMP5LXD6/0017" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.</p>

<p>We've been fans of Cubicle 7's <em>Warhammer</em> roleplaying games for a while, and you can read our review of the <em>Age of Sigmar&nbsp;Soulbound</em>&nbsp;starter set&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/age-of-sigmar-soulbound-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplaying Game</em> starter set&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-fantasy-roleplay-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-wrath-and-glory-starter-set-1.jpg?itok=_3mXzx0r 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-wrath-and-glory-starter-set-1.jpg?itok=aK27Opmu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Wrath and Glory </em>Starter Set includes 2 books for the GM to run the adventure.</figcaption></figure><h2>For The Emperor!</h2>

<p>Similar to Cubicle 7s's <em>Warhammer</em> fantasy roleplaying systems, their sci-fi <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> (or <em>40K </em>for short) roleplaying systems also have 2 options, with different mechanics and styles. The <em>Wrath and Glory</em> system that we're looking at here, uses 6-sided dice, similar to the tabletop wargaming system, and is much more combat-focused. Whereas <em>Imperium Maledictum</em> (for which we will review the starter set for next month when it releases), uses a D100 system, similar to that of the <em>WFRP </em>system that Cubicle 7 also produces, and is much more focused on investigation and social encounters.</p>

<p>It's also worth noting that this starter set is slightly different from that released in 2018 by&nbsp;Ulisses Spiele, which we <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/wrath-and-glory-starter-set-review-warhammer-40k-roleplaying" rel="nofollow">reviewed here</a>. With Cubicle 7 taking on the system, they've updated the books (this version includes a completely new adventure) and changed some of the components inside, all for the better.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-wrath-and-glory-starter-set-3.jpg?itok=MP-uNWZj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-wrath-and-glory-starter-set-3.jpg?itok=nBRGGbyu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>While still of a high quality, the&nbsp;<em>Wrath and Glory </em>Starter Set components don't feel as polished as the other <em>Warhammer</em> roleplaying starter sets Cubicle 7 offer.</figcaption></figure><h2>Tools Of The Faithful</h2>

<p>Like the other 2 Cubicle 7 roleplaying starter sets we've covered, <em>Wrath and Glory</em> contains all the components for 6 players plus a Games Master to play through their first adventure and beyond. Each player gets a pre-generated character sheet, which we'll go into more detail below, along with some quick reference sheets for the rules and a map of the system.</p>

<p>The Games Master, who runs the adventure, gets 2 books, the&nbsp;Traitor’s Hymn, the core adventure and rules tutorial for <em>Wrath and Glory,</em> and&nbsp;The Varonius Flotilla, a sourcebook full of details of characters the players might meet, along with ships and local politics, which can be used to either flesh out the included adventure, or create your own to expand beyond the Traitor's Hymn.</p>

<p>The maps, rules references sheets and box don't feel as polished as the other starter sets that Cubicle 7 offer. The sheets are single-sided and there's no rules reference for the GM on the inside of the box. It's not a huge deal, but compared to the others sets, it does feel like a missed opportunity.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-wrath-and-glory-starter-set-2.jpg?itok=Ffge1wna 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-wrath-and-glory-starter-set-2.jpg?itok=9BI2fdII 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Wrath and Glory </em>Starter Set includes an incredible spread of pre-generated characters that create fantastic party tension with their different loyalties.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Faithfull and Fallen&nbsp;</h2>

<p>The<em> Wrath and Glory</em> starter set includes 6 pre-generated characters, and similarly to the <em>WFRP</em> and <em>Soulbound</em> starters, each character comes with a fold-out sheet full of background details to flesh out the character beyond the stats. Also similarly to the other starters, it has a great spread of characters to introduce players to the setting.</p>

<p>Players can choose from a Rogue Trader, who are half merchant half adventurer, a Sanctioned Psyker, a magic user approved by the Imperium, a Sister of Battle, a warrior devout to the Imperium's religious creed, a Skitarius, a heavily augmented human, a Space Marine Scout, a new recruit to the superhuman soldiers of the Adeptus Astartes, and an Aeldari Ranger, a space-elf sniper.</p>

<p>The mix creates an interesting dynamic within the group, and while they may be loyal to each other, they all have higher goals or loyalties. The Rogue Trader is ultimately only out for themselves, the holier than thou Battle Sister would burn everyone she suspected of treachery, the Skitarius is only loyal to the Machine Cult, similar to the indoctrinated Space Marine who would choose their Chapter over anything, and everyone suspects the alien.</p>

<p>I said the same things in my review of the Cubicle 7 <em>Warhammer</em> fantasy starter set reviews, about the Games Master needing to do some prep (which is standard for all GMs), but here it is a little simpler as the game mechanics are a lot more straight-forward (at least in the starter set, there's a lot of extra awesome depth in the full rules). This means that once the GM has a handle on the rules, they can focus on the adventure. They do have to have some ideas ready on the fly for the Wrath dice, which we discuss below, but that's an essential skill for being a good GM anyway.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-wrath-and-glory-starter-set-4.jpg?itok=UuN2UiJj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-wrath-and-glory-starter-set-4.jpg?itok=4TrAepPB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Wrath and Glory </em>Starter Set custom dice help to keep a simple system even faster to focus on the action. Watch out for the 1 on the red dice though!</figcaption></figure><h2>How To Wage War In The Name Of The Emperor</h2>

<p>The <em>Wrath and Glory</em> system uses 6-sided dice (D6s), with each result of a 4+ being a success (or icon in <em>W&amp;G</em> terms). A roll of 6 counts as 2 icons, and the custom dice included in the <em>Wrath and Glory</em> starter set show this clearly, with skull icons for the 4 and 5, and a skull with a halo for the 6.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This system keeps the game flowing fast, as the Games Master will call out a test target, 3 is standard, and the attribute and skill required for the test. For example, if you're trying to push over something heavy, it would be an Athletics - Strength skill, but if you're trying to jump over a series of obstacles, it would be an Athletics - Agility test. Once the test and difficulty is called, the player rolls a number of D6s equal to the combined attribute and skill they have and simply need to roll a number of icons equal to or above that.</p>

<p>When players collect their dice, they identify one as the Wrath die (the starter set includes a custom red die). This dice has a bonus effect of adding a complication to the roll (success or not) if a 1 is rolled, or the group gains a point of glory or it counts as a critical hit if it shows a 6. I absolutely love this little detail, which, for such a simple mechanic, really adds depth to the rolls, along with keeping players humble. Even when rolling 20 dice for a test requiring 3 icons, that little Wrath dice can still spoil your day with a complication when you succeed.</p>

<h2>Wrath and Glory Starter Set Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>The <em>Wrath and Glory</em> starter set is a great introduction to roleplaying in the <em>Warhammer 40K</em> setting. The adventure has both intrigue and combat, showing the strength of the system in both areas and really allows you to get behind blasting the enemies of the Emperor. The characters are all fantastic, and if the players have a little background knowledge of the setting, can really get into the depths of the suspicions between each of them. If everyone is coming in cold to the setting, the character sheets do a great job of bringing you in, and telling you who you like and don't. The starter set mechanics are simple enough that you don't need to spend ages working out results, allowing you to focus on the combat, and are a great introduction and stepping stone to the full system.&nbsp;The Varonius Flotilla book allows you to expand well beyond the introductory adventure and gives you a few sessions' worth of material for the GM to work with if you want to test the system more before investing further.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dauntless-developer-phoenix-labs-more-layoffs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm&nbsp;</em>developer Phoenix Labs has laid off the majority of its remaining employees as part of what it describes as "unfortunate but necessary changes to our operations".</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/phoenix-labs_activity-7289705935696969728-PaIL/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on LinkedIn, the studio says the layoffs were a "tough decision" and that it "recognize[s] and deeply appreciate[s] the contributions of every individual impacted". The studio stops short of saying exactly how many employees will be affected by these layoffs.</p>

<p>If you're wondering what this might mean for&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>(or, indeed, for cozy sim&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm</em>), Phoenix Labs says it'll share more on its plans for these games "in the coming weeks".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/phoenix-labs-dauntless-layoffs-ice-monster.jpg?itok=VqegnAn- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/phoenix-labs-dauntless-layoffs-ice-monster.jpg?itok=P2RJgd2v 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dauntless</em>' Phoenix Labs has laid off the majority of its remaining staff.</figcaption></figure><p>Beyond the rather vague "unfortunate but necessary changes", Phoenix Labs doesn't offer any kind of reason as to why this decision has been made.</p>

<p>However, the studio has come in for criticism recently regarding the most recent major&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>update, otherwise known as Awakening.</p>

<p>The update has proven unpopular with players, resulting in the game hitting an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/331370/Dauntless/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Overwhelmingly Negative rating on Steam</a>, where it was released on the same day as the Awakening update landed.</p>

<p>Criticism included the update's changes to monetization, progression, and other gameplay systems, with some laying the blame at the feet of Phoenix Labs' owner Forte Labs, a blockchain-focused company that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/what-happens-when-a-secretive-blockchain-company-buys-your-game-studio" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">purchased</a> the studio from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dauntless-developer-phoenix-labs-acquired-by-garena" rel="nofollow">former owner Garena</a> (from which Forte itself spun off) in 2023.</p>




<p>The changes to <em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>proved unpopular enough to prompt Phoenix Labs to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dauntless-awakening-update-apology" rel="nofollow">issue an apology</a> and promise to make "immediate adjustments" back in December, but if the game's current Steam <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/331370/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">player count</a> (at time of writing) is anything to go by, those changes haven't made much of a difference.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that even if Phoenix Labs' layoffs are directly related to&nbsp;<em>Dauntless</em>' recent performance, the studio is far from alone in laying off employees; these layoffs are taking place against the backdrop of a much wider wave of staff cuts, project cancellations, and studio closures.</p>

<p>Other studios hit in recent months include&nbsp;<em>Unknown 9: Awakening&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unknown-9-awakening-layoffs-cancellation-reflector" rel="nofollow">Reflector Entertainment</a>, tech giant <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-layoffs-january-2025" rel="nofollow">Microsoft</a>, and (reportedly)&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&nbsp;</em>outfit <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rocksteady-layoffs-end-of-2024" rel="nofollow">Rocksteady</a>, among many others.</p>
