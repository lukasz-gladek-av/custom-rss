            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A couple months ago, my colleague and our Senior Content Manager Andrew Stretch <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/digimon-story-time-stranger-shows-off-vibrant-digital-world-and-quality-of-life" rel="nofollow">played <em>Digimon Story Time Stranger</em> at Summer Game Fest</a> and enjoyed it. He's a longtime cheerleader of the <em>Digimon Story</em> franchise, but I never believed him enough to try it for myself.</p>

<p>After three hours with <em>Digimon Story Time Stranger</em> at PAX West, I'm a believer now. It pretty quickly shot up to near the top of my October wishlist.</p>

<p>This demo session started off with what was essentially the beginning of the game, and I got a bit of setup for the overall plot and an easy onramp for the gameplay. Then, we transitioned to a later point in the story with level 20 Digimon.</p>



<h2>Digivolving to a Better Quality of Life</h2>

<p>The first major aspects I noticed with <em>Digimon Story Time Stranger</em> is just how many quality-of-life features there are. While I haven't played previous ones in the series, I know my way around a classic JRPG, and this one had a lot of lovely shortcuts.</p>

<p>We previously reported on some of them, like how you can auto-defeat wild encounters if your average level is stronger and still earn XP—even for 'mons in your storage. Combat animations can also be sped up by up to five-times speed.</p>

<p>I noticed a few new ones in my hands-on time at PAX, too. You can stand still in the overworld to automatically regenerate health and stamina. Your storage for all your Digimon can also be accessed anywhere in the overworld, making it easy to swap your 'mons out as needed.</p>

<p>"We don't need to do all the wasteful movements that people in past Digimon story titles had to go through," Producer Ryosuke Hara told me through a translator. "And trust me, we know there are people that have spent hundreds, if not thousands of hours in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/digimon-story-cyber-sleuth-review-digimon-are-champions" rel="nofollow"><em>Cyber Sleuth</em></a> and whatnot."</p>



<p>Battles are often determined by your understanding of type effectiveness, as you'd expect from a monster-taming game. I'm largely new to the franchise though, so learning the different attributes and elements felt like a lot to wrap my head around initially.</p>

<p>However, the combat UI makes it super easy to understand what's super effective and how strong (or weak) the multiplier will be. After all, this is a big monster-hunting turn-based RPG with hundreds of thousands of matchups to consider.</p>



<p>Overall, these quality-of-life improvements go a long way to making the game more convenient and streamlined, according Hara-san. He and the team iterated to find that perfect balance of ease without making it too easy. There's one big anchor that they used to balance this convenience against.</p>

<p>"In the end, we tried to balance it with the boss battles. We tried to make the boss battles more fun. We tried not to shake it up too much," Hara-san said through a translator. "Every boss battle is going to be appropriately hard for where you are in the story. That acts as the balancing in the game."</p>

<p>He assured us that while the boss battles ultimately serve as the skill checks, you likely will never be stuck in an impossible scenario. If your team isn't matching up well, you can always De-Digivolve and re-Digivolve your team to find new ways in.</p>



<h2>Digimon Gets Personal</h2>

<p>With the newly introduced Personality system, these conveniences feel like they'll go a long way to making <em>Digimon Story Time Stranger</em> a good time. Depending on which Personality a Digimon has, their stats will grow a certain way.</p>

<p>This system works on two levels, I've noticed. On the surface, you can really shape a Digimon's character and feel more of an attachment to them. If you feel like your Agumon is the brave, heroic type, you can foster that by interacting with him and answering questions with brave responses. It helps you develop more of a personal bond.</p>

<p>On a deeper level, understanding their Personality type will help you optimize their stats, allowing you to amplify their strengths and cover up their weaknesses. This creates a deeper endgame for players who really want to go that extra mile and make a team of absolutely perfect Digimon--or hell, even make a perfect version of all 450+ Digimon in the game.</p>



<h2>So What's the Digimon Story?</h2>

<p>In this universe, there's a Digital World that coexists with reality, and there's an ongoing war between Digimon that could lead to a cataclysmic apocalypse in both. You're part of ADAMAS, an investigation team that's trying to stop the calamity.</p>

<p>The protagonist is a Tamer that collects and controls Digimon to fight rogue Digimon and other threats. In the second part of my play session, a character mentioned something called the "Shinjuku Inferno," which sounds related to (or could be) whatever bad thing we're trying to prevent.</p>

<p>The game doesn't really waste time getting conflicts into motion; the opening hour or so throws you into the thick of a protest that goes wrong, and it ultimately leads what feels like a major inciting incident.</p>



<p>With a 40–50 hour campaign, there will be a lot to sink our teeth into when <em>Digimon Story Time Stranger</em> releases on Oct. 3. Personally, between the strong turn-based combat, quality-of-life upgrades, and intriguing apocalyptic story, I'm convinced I should've been a <em>Digimon Story</em> fan a long time ago.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Another former Xbox staffer has added their voice to criticisms surrounding Xbox Game Pass and other gaming subscription services, and this time, it's ex-Xbox VP Shannon Loftis' turn to cast a critical eye over the service.</p>

<p>Speaking on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7369880832481660928?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7369880832481660928%2C7369898365943218176%29&amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287369898365943218176%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7369880832481660928%29" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>, Loftis first admits that Game Pass "can claim a few victories with games that otherwise would have sunk beneath the waves", citing <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/human-fall-flat-review-drunk-puzzling" rel="nofollow">breakout platformer&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/human-fall-flat-review-drunk-puzzling" rel="nofollow">Human: Fall Flat</a>&nbsp;</em>as an example of this process in action.</p>

<p>However, Loftis goes on to say that "the majority of game adoption" on Xbox Game Pass "comes at the expense of retail revenue", with the exception of games that are "engineered from the ground up for post-release monetization".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/human-fall-flat-xbox-game-pass.jpg?itok=vkFBFQPw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/human-fall-flat-xbox-game-pass.jpg?itok=ADOraKxo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Not every Game Pass game can be&nbsp;<em>Human: Fall Flat</em>, says ex-Xbox VP Shannon Loftis.</figcaption></figure><p>Loftis concludes by saying that she "could (and may someday) write pages on the weird inner tensions this creates" among developers whose games will be appearing on Game Pass.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that Loftis isn't the first former Xbox staffer to offer a colorful opinion on the Game Pass subscription service this month.</p>

<p>Her comments follow those of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-bethesda-exec-says-gaming-subscription-services-worth-jack-s-without-proper-support-for-game-developers" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ex-Bethesda exec Pete Hines</a>, who said last week that subscription services are "worth jack shit" without companies "figur[ing] out how to balance the needs of the service...with the people who are providing the content".</p>

<p>Indeed, Loftis' comment was posted in response to former PlayStation boss Shawn Layden <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/shawn-layden_former-bethesda-exec-says-gaming-subscription-activity-7369880832481660928-HhnQ/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reposting Hines' comments</a> himself, adding that the question should not be whether subscription services are profitable for their owners, but whether they are "healthy and helpful" for devs.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hollow-knight-silksong-xbox-game-pass.jpg?itok=MDF4q3v2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hollow-knight-silksong-xbox-game-pass.jpg?itok=R8iBpTLK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some games, like&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>, almost certainly won't be hurt by launching on Game Pass on day one.</figcaption></figure><p>Launching on Game Pass on day one doesn't necessarily preclude a game from achieving financial success. Games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-3-3m-33-days" rel="nofollow">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>&nbsp;</em>and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/oblivion-remastered-sales-circana-april-2025" rel="nofollow">recent&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remaster</a> debuted on Game Pass, but still seemingly managed to rack up very respectable sales for themselves.</p>

<p>Still, these execs' comments on Game Pass and other subscription services should give us pause for thought, especially when it comes to smaller indie devs (and even major first-party studios). Stay tuned for more on this.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/pax-west-2025-x-games-you-should-add-to-your-wishlist</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pax-west-2025-11-games-you-should-add-to-your-wishlist.1291476/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>PAX West has wrapped up this year, and our team on the ground spent the entire four-day weekend looking all the latest in gaming. From unexpected indies to eagerly anticipated titles, here's a roundup of all the cool games Editor in Chief Andrew Otton and Features Editor Robert Scarpinito saw in Seattle.</p>



<h2><em>Blocks for Babies</em></h2>

<p>Have you ever wanted to whip out a super shotgun to clear out some blocks in <em>Tetris</em>? Then <em>Blocks for Babies</em> is exactly what you're looking for. It blends <em>DOOM </em>with <em>Tetris </em>in more clever ways than you might think. Certain blocks can only be cleared in first-person gameplay, adding an extra layer of strategy while you're laying tiles.</p>

<p>Additionally, boss battles impact both gameplay modes. For example, the boss in the PAX demo moved like the old-school game <em>Snake </em>in <em>Tetris </em>mode, dropping specific blocks you have to clear quickly. Meanwhile, in first-person, you can shoot specific blocks in the snake to do more damage as the snake flies about.</p>

<p>You can find a demo for it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2776770/Blocks_for_Babies/" rel="nofollow">(and add it to your wishlist) on Steam</a>.</p>



<h2><em>Unyielder</em></h2>

<p>This is the first of three games from Shueisha Games on this list, so strap in. <em>Unyielder </em>is all octane, no oxygen. This first-person shooter roguelike is all about quick reflexes, precise timing, and the rule of cool. You get power ups as you progress in a run, with basic ones like faster reload times and more interesting ones like the ability to infinitely reload a clip. Suddenly, that rocket launcher that loads one rocket at a time becomes an endless barrage of carnage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The secret to satisfaction here, though, is the parry system. It's one giant boss rush, and each boss has multiple attacks that can be countered. If you time your shots correctly, you'll interrupt the enemy and make them vulnerable to damage. There are five playable characters, but the one I tried had a grappling hook that I used to zip around the battlefield.</p>

<p>I'm instantly sold, and it's looking like it'll come out within the year. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/789940/UNYIELDER/" rel="nofollow">wishlist it on Steam here</a>.</p>



<h2><em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em></h2>

<p><em>Ninja Gaiden 4 </em>is the only AAA game on this list, solely because I didn't have enough time to finish the entire preview build. However, what I played was nothing short of refined and exciting. It continues the franchise's history of fast-paced, cutthroat action, and something that really caught my eye was the Bloodraven meter on the new extra-edgy protagonist Yakumo.</p>

<p>This meter can be tapped into by holding down a shoulder button, amplifying your damage and changing your combos. Unlike other action games, this isn't a one-time activation situation. It can be turned on or off at a whim as long as you have enough left, opening the door for some interesting strategies and—more importantly—sick-looking combos.</p>

<p>Throw in a dark, hyper-futuristic neo-Tokyo setting and I'll be there. <em>Ninja Gaiden 4 </em>will hit Xbox Game Pass along with PlayStation 5 on Oct. 21.</p>



<h2><em>Bakudo</em></h2>

<p>There's something so satisfying about a game that takes basic sports and cranks everything up to 11,000. <em>Bakudo </em>is still in early development by Sayil Games under Shueisha's publishing arm, and it's basically a sci-fi dodgeball boss rush. You play as a character who just entered Bakudo Academy, but there's a major conspiracy under it all.</p>

<p>The story and presentation give me <em>Kill La Kill</em> vibes, and the gameplay is merciless. Catching the enemy's ball requires you to read their movements and react quickly, and sometimes you'll need to curve the ball to get past their defenses. Certain attacks require you to parry instead of catching, opening the door for high-powered spikes if you can time it perfectly.</p>

<p><em>Bakudo </em>is equal parts charming and brutal, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2275860/BAKUDO/" rel="nofollow">you can wishlist it on Steam</a>—just don't expect it to release within the next year.</p>



<h2><em>Cat Secretary</em></h2>

<p>Cats have been having a moment in video games, and Good Story Guild is looking to ride that wave with its upcoming game <em>Cat Secretary</em>. It leans more toward the playfulness of <em>Little Kitty, Big City</em>, but it also has a little bite with its silly yet scathing commentary on capitalism.</p>

<p>You work as a cute little business cat in a company where almost everyone has been replaced with AI robots. Naturally, they need someone to do things that only organic creatures can handle, like sorting files and making coffee, which you do during the day. By night, it seems like you'll be skulking around and helping a rat potentially sabotage the company? Honestly, I'm unsure, but I'm along for the ride.</p>

<p>If you want to get your paws on <em>Cat Secretary</em>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2783280/Cat_Secretary/" rel="nofollow">you can wishlist it on Steam</a>.</p>



<h2><em>Arcane Eats</em></h2>

<p><em>Arcane Eats </em>takes a formula perfected by <em>Slay the Spire</em> and applies it to the culinary arts to fantastic results. There's a level of tongue-in-cheek humor here that makes everything feel light and breezy, and it's so mechanically sound that the rules of the game feel intuitive.</p>

<p>You have three burners to manage, and you can stack skillets of food on top of each other for a bigger "attack" against a customer's hunger. The longer they wait, though, the more mental damage they'll do to you, so you have to thread the needle between building up numbers and turn management.</p>

<p>This game is made by a small team in Seattle, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2640090/Arcane_Eats/" rel="nofollow">you can wishlist it on Steam</a>. After all, don't you want to beat the first food-judge boss, Guy Fairy?</p>



<h2><em>OPUS: Prism Peaks</em></h2>

<p>Visual-novel (adjacent?) fans might recognize the previous game from Taiwanese developers SIGONO, called <em>OPUS: Echo of Starsong</em>. I remember it being well received by critics, so I wanted to see what the hype was about with the new project from SIGONO, which is being published by Shueisha.</p>

<p>The demo I played was roughly 20 minutes, and the caliber of storytelling here felt next level. The protagonist goes through a lot of ups and downs in that short time, immediately creating an complex character that left me wanting to learn more about him. And that doesn't even get into the sudden appearance of a cursed girl he's reluctantly helping.</p>

<p><em>OPUS: Prism Peak</em> is giving <em>Life Is Strange</em> vibes with its third-person light puzzle solving and a focus on narrative, and I'm <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1947910/OPUS_Prism_Peak/" rel="nofollow">keeping an eye on its Steam page</a> as it gets closer to release.</p>



<h2>Rabbit Haul</h2>

<p>When I first heard about <em>Rabbit Haul</em>, it felt like the perfect mix of games made just for me. It's part farming sim, part tower defense, and you even have to restore a town as your "base" for upgrades. That's a trifecta that will get me more than interested immediately.</p>

<p>The overarching goal is to rebuild your hometown and you do so by growing crops on your farm to rebuild the town's economy and food reserves. The plants you grow all have different values and effects, which will come into effect when it turns to night.</p>

<p>At night, your farm is descended on by hungry raccoons hellbent and eating your food stores. Thankfully, you can fight back with weapons and the plants you grow will try to defend themselves as well.</p>

<p>It's an utterly charming game that was absolutely swarmed whenever I saw it at PAX West. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2514330/The_Rabbit_Haul/" rel="nofollow">Wishlist <em>Rabbit Haul </em>on Steam</a>, I bet you won't regret it if these are your types of games.</p>



<h2>No Stone Unturned</h2>

<p>In <em>No Stone Unturned</em> you set out to answer the age old question: Why did the chicken cross the road? You play the squirrel Detective Cox who is there to investigate the murder of said chicken found right next to the road.</p>

<p><em>No Stone Unturned</em> is a detective game with a quirky story with funny characters and a lot of mystery. There's the overarching case of the chicken, but there's more to learn about the town you'll find yourself in.</p>

<p>While gathering clues, you'll encounter all kinds of people and puzzles, as well as a bunch of classic mini-games that will remind you immediately of WarioWare.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Everything I saw in the 20ish minute demo was clever and had more than a few chuckles in it. I love the way it looks, and I can't wait to sit down and soak it all in. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2453640/No_Stone_Unturned/" rel="nofollow">Check it out on Steam</a>.</p>



<h2>War of the Western Deep</h2>

<p><em>War of the Western Deep</em> is a classic adventure game set in the graphic novel series, <em>Beyond the Western Deep</em>. It caught my eye last year at PAX West, and I was excited to see it return this year.</p>

<p>You play as Mirren (voiced by Samantha Béart, who you may know as Karlach from <em>Baldur's Gate III</em>), a royal courier sent out to send an important letter by the king. Your peaceful kingdom of Sunsgrove is about to be invaded secretly by your neighbors, and you need to travel into soon-to-be enemy territory to deliver that letter.</p>

<p>The first thing you'll notice it is visually striking, with absolutely gorgeous artwork. What's even better is how it's all hand-animated artwork, which makes for a beautiful image on screen.</p>

<p>There's also some combat that really shows off the beautiful animations. Combat is very reminiscent of something like Punch-Out!!, where it's about timing attacks and dodges with your opponent while managing a stamina bar for your movements. The crisp, flowing animations make it a delight to take in.</p>

<p>I'm a sucker for narrative heavy games and this looks amazing, so I can't wait to immerse myself in the world of Western Deep. I've certainly <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2976440/War_of_the_Western_Deep/" rel="nofollow">got it on my Steam wishlist</a>.</p>



<h2>Nocturnal 2</h2>

<p><em>Nocturnal 2</em> is the game that made us turn our head the most and we knew we had to check it out. Look through the game in motion on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2847780/Nocturnal_2/" rel="nofollow">Steam page</a> trailer and the other screenshots, and you'll get a good reason why.</p>

<p>Annoyingly, I had not heard or seen the first game, <em>Nocturnal</em>, which released in 2023. This is a sequel to that, and it looks to be a bigger and more beefed-up version of that game. The first was a sidescrolling action platformer, which the sequel also is but adds in some metroidvania elements on top.</p>

<p>It's obviously gorgeous to look at, but the combat has a decent amount going for it as well. It's more slow and deliberate, so don't go in thinking something like the speed of Dead Cells. Parrying and dodging out of the way to get your swings in is the key a lot of the times, as is knocking enemies into the air and slamming them into the ground. I didn't have a ton of time with the game, but I imagine juggling enemies and bouncing them off walls/the ground will play a big role into making big combos.</p>

<p>In any case, if you're looking for a new action platformer after, say, <em>Silksong</em>, keep an eye on <em>Nocturnal 2</em>. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2847780/Nocturnal_2/" rel="nofollow">You can wishlist it here</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ex-Nintendo Dev Says Nintendo Has "No Real Need" for New Franchises]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-nintendo-dev-new-franchises</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ex-nintendo-dev-says-nintendo-has-no-real-need-for-new-franchises.1291473/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you're wondering why Nintendo hasn't come up with a brand new franchise in a little while, an ex-Nintendo developer may well have an answer for you: it doesn't really need to.</p>

<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-09-05/nintendo-invents-new-ways-to-have-fun-with-old-characters" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a>, Ken Watanabe, a former Nintendo developer who's worked on games like&nbsp;<em>Pikmin 3&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Splatoon</em>, says new Nintendo franchises haven't appeared "simply because there's no real need to make them".</p>

<p>Rather than creating new franchises, Watanabe says the Japanese gaming giant focuses on "gameplay mechanics first", and then "pick[s] whatever fits that new gameplay best" as a franchise "skin or...wrapper".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-new-franchises.jpg?itok=sCZpgHvL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-new-franchises.jpg?itok=bP9_rAZx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>arguably demonstrates Nintendo's design philosophy as described by ex-developer Ken Watanabe.</figcaption></figure><p>Watanabe says that Nintendo's focus is on "creating a new way to play", and that the studio will pick the franchise that it thinks most applies to that "new way".</p>

<p>I'd argue this design approach is evident in this year's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/donkey-kong-bananza-review-oohh-banana" rel="nofollow">rather excellent</a>&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>; the "new way" Nintendo found this time was to create <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2" rel="nofollow">a 3D platformer</a> full of destructible terrain, and&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong&nbsp;</em>best fit the idea of wanton destruction mixed with 3D platforming.</p>

<p>According to Watanabe, it's also common for Nintendo staffers to "secretly work on something without telling their boss", and if that idea is interesting, it "gets turned into a real product". He describes making a level in&nbsp;<em>Pikmin 3&nbsp;</em>in his spare time, only for Nintendo to include said level in the final product.</p>

<p>Artist and designer Takaya Imamura follows up by saying that Nintendo "lets [its staff] just focus on building what [they] believe to be fun, without distraction". That would go some way towards explaining the generally high standard of Nintendo's work.</p>

<p>In any case, it does look like Watanabe's idea of how Nintendo operates hasn't done the company any harm at all; the Switch 2 has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-financials-q1-2026" rel="nofollow">sold very well indeed</a> thus far, so whatever Nintendo is doing, it's likely to continue into the near future, at the very least.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/pokemon-legends-z-preview-another-reason-to-get-switch-2</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pokemon-legends-z-a-preview-%E2%80%93-another-reason-to-get-a-switch-2.1291434/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I remember being fairly interested in what Game Freak was doing with its first stab at <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/pokemon-legends-arceus" rel="nofollow"><em>Pokemon Legends: Arceus</em></a>. It was a whole new way to play with Pocket Monsters, but dodgy frame rates and a repetitive rhythm lulled me away from really enjoying it.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, it had a certain quality that a lot of first tries have in this industry: it fell a little flat for me, but there was lots of potential for a sequel to really knock it out of the park. So I knew I had to try <em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A </em>while at PAX West.</p>

<p>The show floor demo was played on a Nintendo Switch 2, and it showcased two parts of the game: Battle Zones and a story encounter against a Mega Absol. After about 20 minutes with the game, I walked away from that demo excited for <em>Pokemon</em> like I was a kid waiting for <em>Pokemon Diamond </em>and <em>Pearl</em>&nbsp;again.</p>



<h2>Battle Zones Put the Focus on Trainers</h2>

<p>The first 10 minutes in the Battle Zone reminded me of a huge factor that I felt was missing from <em>Arceus</em>: trainer battles. Most of my memories with <em>Arceus </em>were roaming around wide open spaces, throwing balls at wild Pokemon with the occasional battle punctuated throughout.</p>

<p>In a Battle Zone, it's all about fighting opposing trainers. You can sneak up on their Pokemon by sending yours out from behind, giving you an advantage in the ensuing fight.</p>



<p lang="EN-US" paraeid="{773212e2-ce74-4f72-bc73-72ccdcf9ce45}{111}" paraid="115263152" xml:lang="EN-US">This time around, too, the old-school turn-based battles are no more. Everything is in real time now. You aim at an enemy while holding down a shoulder button, and all the face buttons are mapped to your Pokemon's abilities.</p>

<p>There were no agile or strong mode inputs from what I could see. Instead, each individual ability was on a cooldown, and as you'd expect, weaker attacks tend to cool down faster than others. I found myself settling into a rhythm of which attacks to rotate through, trying to minimize downtime as much as possible.</p>

<p>If you're in a poor matchup, you can quickly swap to another Pokemon by using the D-pad. It all felt seamless thanks to not having to pause the game, and the real-time menuing felt snappy and convenient.</p>



<h2>Living It Up in Lumiose City</h2>

<p><em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em> is set entirely in Lumiose City, the large city from <em>Pokemon X</em> and <em>Y</em>. When I first learned that, my immediate worry was performance. The Switch, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/2017-was-magical-year-for-nintendo" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">as amazing as that system is</a>, was starting to feel its age in recent years.</p>

<p>Luckily, the demos for <em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A </em>ran on the Switch 2, and all my fears disappeared. Running around the Battle Zone was smooth as butter, and it looked pretty good to boot.</p>

<p>As a city boy, I always love when a game brings an entire urban landscape to life, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/marvels-spider-man-2-review-2-spider-man-1-furious" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">like the&nbsp;<em>Spider-Man </em>games</a>. So I'm excited to see Pokemon's take on it, especially with the power of the Switch 2.</p>



<p>The final leg of the demo involved a boss fight with a rogue Mega Absol, which was provided a bit of story context. It seems there's some mysterious reason these random Mega Evolutions are happening, and in true Pokemon fashion, you're randomly roped into stopping them.</p>

<p>In the demo I played, the protagonist didn't have a Mega Ring at first, so this Mega Absol could be one of the early ones we'll run into in the full game.</p>



<p>The fight itself felt a bit like the bosses in <em>Arceus</em>, where the trainer themself has to dodge a bunch of attacks. However, this time around, instead of throwing weird items at them, you're ordering your Pokemon to do attacks.</p>

<p>An extra layer of strategy I enjoyed is that my Lucario had Protect mapped as one of its abilities. Using it at just the right time so it didn't take damage from a large area-of-effect attack felt so satisfying, in a way I wouldn't expect from a Pokemon game.</p>

<p>Overall, the boss fight wasn't difficult, but there were just enough plates spinning that it remained engaging throughout, which is more than I can say for my experience with some games in the franchise's past. Hopefully that momentum remains in the full release.</p>



<h2><em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em> Preview – Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Pokemon is a franchise I've learned to temper my expectations with. The level of fun I had with it as a kid probably won't match whatever I'm looking for as an adult. However, <em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em> could be the game that makes me second guess that lesson.</p>

<p>I had so much fun with the little time I spent with it, and it instantly became something I'm looking forward to playing on my Switch 2. I hope the story remains interesting the long-term, but even if not, roaming around Lumiose City holds a lot of promise for me.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/battle-of-hoth-review-ice-cold-fun</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battle-of-hoth-review-ice-cold-fun.1291431/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>AT-AT's stomp on the hard-packed ice of Hoth, shaking the ground and rattling the hidden bunkers underneath. Meanwhile, hordes of brave Rebel soldiers burst from the snow, sending torrents of well-aimed blaster fire. Does the fate of the galaxy hinge on this pivotal battle? It does when you and your friends pick up a copy of&nbsp;<em>Battle of Hoth</em>, a new strategic board game from Days of Wonder. Asmodee USA sent me a copy to check out, so let's fire up our snow-speeders and jump right in.</p>

<h2>What Is&nbsp;<em>Battle of Hoth</em>?</h2>

<p><em>Battle of Hoth</em>&nbsp;is a strategic skirmish board game for two players (with a team-mode to allow for three to four players), with one player taking on the role of the Rebel Alliance and the other taking on the Imperial army. The objective of the game is (usually, though there are many different scenarios to play through) being the first to claim a set amount of victory medals by meeting a specific scenario's victory conditions.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battle-of-hoth-board.jpg?itok=Q6-GASz3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battle-of-hoth-board.jpg?itok=byl1tAD0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>To do so, you'll assign orders to your forces around the board, roll dice to attack, and attempt to out-pace and out-think your opponent in this quick strategic game. Each scenario instructs players on how to set up the board, placing their units onto the battlefield as well as terrain hexes that alter the environment.</p>

<h2>Activating Activations</h2>

<p>I really like the way activating units is handled in this game. Instead of issuing order tokens, or secretly selecting units from your battlefield, you'll play a Command card from a hidden hand you draw. And the command cards (except for special leader cards) break up the battlefield into thirds.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battle-of-hoth-command-card.jpg?itok=IsloiLGK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battle-of-hoth-command-card.jpg?itok=vruOD9mj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>In this example, the Rebel player has played the command card seen on the board, meaning they can activate two units in the left shaded quadrant.</figcaption></figure><p>Your Command card may say you can activate two units in the middle of the board, or one on each of the left and ride sides of the board, or some other combination. I find this approach to the game extremely engaging, as I have to both work with what I've got on the board&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;decide which of my Command cards to use, and which to save.</p>

<h2>A Fast-Paced Blast</h2>

<p>One of the first things that caught my attention with&nbsp;<em>Battle of Hoth</em>&nbsp;is how little time it takes to actually set up the game and get rolling. Before I even opened the box, I admit I was expecting some hulking behemoth full of cards, rulebooks, miniatures, and tokens galore. But that's not the case with&nbsp;<em>Battle of Hoth</em>, with only a slim rulebook, a straight-to-the-action scenario book, 19 double-sided terrain hexes, 6 attack die, and miniatures for each side (the Rebels get 35 minis, and the Imperials get 39).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battle-of-hoth-rebel-minis.jpg?itok=Vaf846dt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battle-of-hoth-rebel-minis.jpg?itok=rzpKtTWr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The three types of Rebel miniatures included in the game.</figcaption></figure><p>Playing the game, I was equally surprised at how nicely it moved along. You move your units, roll dice to attack, and before you know it you're scoring hits, removing enemy units, and getting closer and closer to your goal of four victory points (or more or less, depending on scenario).</p>

<p>You achieve these victory medals by completely eliminating an enemy unit (though some scenarios may offer extra or different ways to achieve victory medals).</p>

<p>So what this creates is a truly feeling of chaotic warfare on the battlefield, with snow-speeders zooming around, AT-AT's lumbering through the battlefield, and hordes of little dudes running around trying to pick each other off. Aside from some of the more complicated scenarios, you'll be done a standard scenario within 35-45 minutes. That's fast for a strategy wargame!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battle-of-hoth-imperial-minis.jpg?itok=RRq71tI7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battle-of-hoth-imperial-minis.jpg?itok=n_QD63Cz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The three types of Imperial Miniatures available in the game.</figcaption></figure><h2>Deeper Than It Seems</h2>

<p>I'm doing a lot of praising the game's speed and simplicity, but it certainly is deeper than it seems. As I mentioned above, the Command card activations are a fun and engaging way to mobilize troops. Add to that the ability to slightly customize your deck by choosing a commander, and it's almost like a mini-game within the game.</p>

<p>The dice-resolution is great fun on this too, with custom symbols on the dice representing a soldier silhouette, a mechanical gear, and a starburst. To hit your opponent's unit, you have to get the proper symbols. Starbursts hit everything, but the other two symbols matter: you can only hit troops with a soldier silhouette and snow speeders and AT-AT's with the gear (probe droids and rebel artillery can&nbsp;<em>only</em>&nbsp;be hit with the starbursts).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battle-of-hoth-dice-roll.jpg?itok=TnM6ZC7a 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battle-of-hoth-dice-roll.jpg?itok=xB5nQv1U 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>In this scenario, the Rebel player has rolled their three dice to attack the Imperial Unit. The blue symbol and the yellow starburst are both hits, so two Imperial minis would be removed from this unit.</figcaption></figure><p>And then there's the Scenario Book, which contains 18 different scenarios to play through - from a first assault on an Imperial Scouting mission to defending the shield generators, medevac'ing important officers out of the field, and a final mass showdown called "Assault on Hoth," there's just so much game in here.</p>

<h2><em>Battle of Hoth -&nbsp;</em>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>You don't have to be a&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em>&nbsp;fan to find a lot to love in&nbsp;<em>Battle of Hoth -&nbsp;</em>though I assume many <em>will</em>&nbsp;with its focus on the classic&nbsp;<em>Empire</em>&nbsp;set piece. With its fast-paced gameplay and pick-up-and-play rules, this might be one of the cleanest introductions to strategy wargaming I've ever played. Using simple, intuitive dice-roll mechanics, easy unit movement rules, and few other "Yes... but!" clauses that can clog up the gameplay, what we get is a clean, well-oiled machine of a strategy skirmish game that prioritizes player fun over fussiness.</p>

<p>Highly, highly recommended - get out there and give it a try for yourself!</p>
