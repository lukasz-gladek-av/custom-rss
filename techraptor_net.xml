            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-sales-4m-battlefield-skate<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has announced that Hazelight's co-op platformer&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>has reached another big sales milestone, and the studio has also provided updates on when we can expect the next&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>games to arrive.</p>

<p>As part of its 2024-25 earnings report, EA reveals that&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>has sold "nearly four million units" since launching in March, although developer Hazelight <a href="https://x.com/HazelightGames/status/1919852640189456892" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">subsequently said</a> it had passed that mark.</p>

<p>This figure means&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>has racked up another two million sales for itself since the beginning of March; the game reached the two million mark <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">inside a single week</a>, having already reached a million sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-sales-1m-48-hours" rel="nofollow">within its first 48 hours</a>.</p>

<p>As well as a sales update for&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>, EA also revealed when we can apparently expect new&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>games to arrive; both are due to land in the 2025-26 fiscal year, which means EA has until March 2026 to release them.</p>

<p>EA has already been drip-feeding information about the new&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>via its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-labs-announced-ea" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Battlefield Labs initiative</a>, whereby it continuously requests community feedback in order to shape and inform the development of the game.</p>

<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Skate</em>, EA originally announced it was coming to Early Access in 2025 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/skate-reboot-early-access-2025" rel="nofollow">last year</a>, although when it does, it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-skate-reboot-no-offline-mode" rel="nofollow">won't be launching with any kind of offline mode</a>, unfortunately. You'll have to look to Activision's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-and-4-remasters" rel="nofollow">upcoming&nbsp;<em>Tony Hawk&nbsp;</em>remasters</a> if you want offline skating sims.</p>
