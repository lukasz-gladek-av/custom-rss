            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Since last month's release of the latest <em>Magic: The Gathering </em>set, Lorwyn Eclipsed, we've been busy blighting our goblins, turning our merfolk sideways, and spending <em>way</em> too much mana on Elementals. But I wanted to know what went into the design of the set, so I got the chance to chat with a few folks from the design team - read on for our interview about the creation of Lorwyn Eclipsed.</p><h2>Flavor First?</h2><p>I've heard the design team talk a lot in the past about designing cards that are either "flavor first" or "mechanics first," and I wanted to know which of these approaches was easier to build around, and how they approached this set.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>"It depends on the set," explains Mark Gottlieb, Principal Game Designer. "For example, returning to Kamigawa was more of a flavor-driven design - there was a pretty deep trope space to work with, plus the concept of tradition vs futurism led to a lot of designs."</p><blockquote><p>The mechanical core of Lorwyn and Shadowmoor ... is very solid and pretty universal...</p></blockquote><p>But as for Lorwyn, Gottlieb explains that the original set was inspired by Celtic folklore, which - while exuding a distinct vibe, didn't offer up a deep well of concrete tropes to play with. "The mechanical core of Lorwyn and Shadowmoor, though—typal, hybrid, color-matters—is very solid and pretty universal," Gottlieb explains, "So I’d say Lorwyn Eclipsed was much more of a mechanic-driven design."</p><h2>What Stays, What Goes</h2><p>When bringing a set as beloved as Lorwyn back for the first time, it must have been difficult to decide what elements were important to implement vs. what could get left behind. "The question we asked ourselves," Gottlieb continues, "is 'What is definitional about Lorwyn?' And the same for Shadowmoor. What do people immediately think of as the identity of those sets?"</p><picture>

  </picture><p>Gottlieb says they ran an exercise of dissecting the original sets into their component parts, slicing them up into "Must have," "Nice to have," and "Don't need" categories. "The 'Must have' group," Gottlieb explains, "was mostly filled with broad mechanical space, like typal, hybrid, and -1/-1 counters. Most of the original keywords, though, like clash, reinforce, and conspire, didn’t carry the same weight."</p><h2>Aging Like A Fine Kithkin Wine</h2><p>Next I wanted to know in which ways, when designing the new set, did the team "feel the age" of the original Lorwyn block. Were there any mechanics, original designs, etc. that felt like they needed a serious update? &nbsp;</p><p>"A lot of the original keywords weren’t particularly inspiring and played a bit clunky," admits Gottlieb. "But we didn’t really think about the set in terms of 'Ugh, what do we have to fix?' The thought process was much more along the lines of 'What new and exciting things can we create out of the original sets’ elements that meet the moment for modern Magic?'"</p><blockquote><p>A lot of the original keywords weren’t particularly inspiring and played a bit clunky...</p></blockquote><p>"Blight uses -1/-1 counters in a new, proactive way. Vivid takes advantage of hybrid in a way we haven’t before. We’d never had the opportunity to mash up Lorwyn and Shadowmoor elements before, since the story had previously kept them separate from one another." Gottlieb says that mindset gave the team the opportunity to come up with a whole new cycle of Elemental Incarnations, "as well as a new take on “champion” that takes advantage of newfangled 'behold' technology."</p><h2>Saying Goodbye To The Block</h2><p>To that end, I wondered if there were any challenges that came from designing this set as a single release, when we had a whole block with the setting the last time we visited Lorwyn.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>"Yes, absolutely," Gottlieb replies. "It’s like two friends that each live in a two-story house and move into a condo together. A lot of the furniture has to go. But the competition for space was a crucible, in a way. Only the best stuff could stay. Everything in the set had to earn its spot."</p><blockquote><p>It’s like two friends that each live in a two-story house and move into a condo together. A lot of the furniture has to go.</p></blockquote><p>Gottlieb went on to describe a particular challenge in their design, which was the fact the the mechanical spaces Lorwyn Eclipsed focuses on (creature types matter, color matters), involve, as he puts it, "universal elements among <em>Magic</em> cards. Just about every creature card has both color and creature types, but they don’t really speak to one another, and keeping track of eight creature types and five colors across your board state can be burdensome. So it was certainly difficult to balance the focus between those two pillars of the design."</p><h2>Getting The Band Back Together</h2><p>With a set with this kind of legacy, I was curious if any of the original designers came back for this set. "Yes, multiple designers overlapped the original sets and the new one," explains Gottlieb. "I was the Vision Design lead for Lorwyn Eclipsed, and I was the Rules Manager during Lorwyn, and was a member of the Shadowmoor design team."&nbsp;</p><picture>

  </picture><p>"Mark Rosewater worked on all five Lorwyn-based sets. Aaron Forsythe, Doug Beyer, Erik Lauer, and Mike Turian were involved in both the old and the new. But all the newer designers who contributed to Lorwyn Eclipsed have a respect for the original material and were excited to delve into a part of Magic’s history. And the Worldbuilding team did a spectacular job immersing us into the setting, which really helped everyone zero in on the tone we wanted to capture."</p><blockquote><p>All the newer designers who contributed to Lorwyn Eclipsed have a respect for the original material and were excited to delve into a part of Magic’s history.</p></blockquote><p>Finally, I closed out my questions with my classic ender: Do you have a favorite card from the new set? Is there a card you don't think is getting enough attention yet that you think will be a powerful addition to limited, constructed, or Commander?</p><p>To this, Jadine Klomparens, Principal Game Designer chimed in. "I really like Mutable Explorer and think there’s a lot of potential for it to show up in strategies that are interested in ramp or low opportunity cost changelings, or both!" I agree - Mutable Explorer's one of my favorite cards in the set!</p><picture>
