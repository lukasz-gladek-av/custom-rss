            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-sports-college-football-25-best-selling-sports-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>US industry analyst group Circana has released its gaming sales data for November, and it turns out that&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25&nbsp;</em>has earned itself a rather impressive accolade.</p>

<p>According to the indefatigable Mat Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ldljf4czuc2o" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">over on social media platform Bluesky</a>,&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25&nbsp;</em>"became the best-selling sports video game in US history" in dollar sales terms in November.</p>

<p>That's perhaps not particularly surprising given that the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/us-sales-data-july-circana" rel="nofollow">scored the top spot</a>&nbsp;on both PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S in the month of its release. <em>EA Sports College Football 25</em>'s achievement is perhaps even more impressive when we consider that so far, it hasn't been released on PC.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ea-sports-college-football-25-best-selling-sports-game-play.jpg?itok=YoRcFsNA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ea-sports-college-football-25-best-selling-sports-game-play.jpg?itok=bBB3chky 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>EA Sports College Football 25&nbsp;</em>has sold pretty well, and that's an understatement.</figcaption></figure><p>Piscatella goes on to point out that not only is&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25&nbsp;</em>sitting pretty in the sports game hall of fame, but it also now "ranks among the top 50 best-selling tracked video games" of all time according to dollar sales.</p>

<p>While the game may have reached the lofty status outlined above in November (and topped the Xbox charts to boot), it wasn't actually the best-selling PlayStation game of the month; <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ldljf4dbok2o" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">that honor</a> goes to&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>, which apparently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-series-sales-black-ops-6-launch" rel="nofollow">enjoyed the franchise's biggest ever launch</a>.</p>

<p>Since&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25&nbsp;</em>didn't get a release on Switch, the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ldljf7vf2c2o" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">best-selling game on Nintendo's console</a> for November was instead&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em>, with&nbsp;<em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>MySims: Cozy Bundle&nbsp;</em>taking up second and third place.</p>

<p>Overall, consumer spending fell by 7% in November compared <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/circana-sales-data-november-2023" rel="nofollow">to last year</a>, although subscription service spending was up by 8% on a year-on-year basis, which Piscatella attributes to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-will-be-on-game-pass-day-1" rel="nofollow">debut of&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>on Game Pass</a>.</p>
