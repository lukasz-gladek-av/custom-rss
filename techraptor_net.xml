            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Lost Haven Games has launched a new Kickstarter campaign. The indie creator's latest project is the <em>Skies Above</em> RPG, a tabletop experience inspired by SNES-era RPGs, set in a lively, optimistic world of distant clouds.</p>

<h2>The <em>Skies Above</em> RPG Kickstarter</h2>

<p>In its campaign page, the <em>Skies Above</em> RPG draws heavy inspiration from classic JRPGs, citing icons like <em>Final Fantasy</em> and <em>Dragon Quest</em> alongside the likes of the <em>Grandia</em> and <em>Lunar</em> series. The game's world is set in a post-apocalyptic sky, but eschews the dark and dreary tone. Instead, it presents a world full of vitality, intrigue, and abundance. Its core gameplay centers on exploding d8s.</p>

Skyfolk include the Khoros, bird people that became invaluable in the new world thanks to their ability to fly, and the cat-like Pommo people. The jobs are familiar genre staples like the Monk, Paladin, and Thief, alongside more esoteric choices like the Biomancer and Invoker.</p>

<p>One unique selling point for <em>Skies Above</em> RPG is a crafting and cooking system. Directly referencing the <em>Monster Hunter</em> series and <em>Dungeon Meshi</em>, the game provides rules for turning monster parts into gear and consumables. There are even recipes for various dishes within the monster bestiary. It's a system that helps this game stand out from its peers like <em>Break!!</em> and <em>Fabula Ultima</em>.</p>

<p>This game is the third project by Lost Haven Games. Its founder, Andrew Lever, recently made waves with his last project, the award-nominated TTRPG, <em>Abbadon: The Thirteen Seals</em>. A dark fantasy game, inspired by <em>Diablo</em> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/darkest-dungeon-2-kingdoms-update-inhuman-bondage-release-date" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Darkest Dungeon</em></a>, where character actions are resolved with a standard 54-card deck.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The different pledge tiers for the <em>Skies Above</em> RPG are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Sky Explorer for $21:</strong> A PDF copy of the game and digital stretch goals</li>
	<li><strong>Sky Adventurer for $54:</strong> A physical, hardcover copy of the game, a PDF, and both physical and digital stretch goals</li>
	<li><strong>Sky Legend for $126:</strong>&nbsp; Everything in the Sky Adventurer tier, a custom D8, a cover art print, a custom art card sketch, and a Frog Knight pin.</li>
</ul><p>At the time of writing, the <em>Skies Above</em> RPG is sitting at&nbsp;<span><span>$3,397, which is close to half of its initial funding goal of $8.072. The campaign concludes October 2.</span></span></p>
