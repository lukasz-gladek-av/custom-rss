            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Gamefound has acquired the crowdfunding platform, Indiegogo. This is a major change for Indiegogo, which was one of the earliest pioneers of crowdfunding platforms. This acquisition will lead to new features and improvements, as well as new conveniences for users.</p>

<h2>The Gamefound Indiegogo Acquisition</h2>

<p>In an official <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/blog/post/gamefound-acquires-indiegogo" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>, Gamefound discussed the changes that would be coming to both platforms as a result of the acquisition. First, much like Roll20 and Demiplane's acquisition, you will be able to log in to Gamefound using either your Indiegogo or Gamefound credentials. In addition, Indiegogo will be adopting Gamefound's business terms and policies, which are generally friendlier to the end user.</p>

Campaigns include both pre-launch and late pledges. The platform provides integrated tax tools, providing more transparent prices for various regional taxes and national tariffs. Lastly, users have access to stretch pay and direct currency exchange.</p>

<p>“It’s time for crowdfunding to be a forward-facing industry again,” said Julie dePontbriand, CEO of Indiegogo. “Gamefound’s technology is unrivaled, and we’re thrilled to bring it to Indiegogo’s diverse community. Together, we’re making crowdfunding more innovative, creator-friendly, and exciting than ever before.”</p>

<p>These changes aside, not much will change for either platform. Gamefound is still dedicated to providing a platform for tabletop crowdfunding projects. It has been their mission statement since it was founded in 2016, and that is still their focus. Their track record speaks for itself with successes like board game adaptations of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cyberpunk-2077-board-game-campaign-raises-over-1-million-in-one-day" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/helldivers-2-board-game-fully-funded-in-12-minutes-on-gamefound" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Helldivers 2</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/blasphemous-board-game-brings-penitence-to-gamefound" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Blasphemous</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hearts-of-iron-board-game-reaches-gamefound-success-in-13-minutes" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Hearts of Iron</em></a>.</p>

<p>As for Indiegogo, it will continue as a platform for various tech and arts projects. Projects as diverse as Steam Deck competitors or board game projects like the original <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/steamforged-games-announces-street-masters-champion-edition" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Street Masters</em></a> board game. The difference now is that the platform's userbase of about 38 million will be enjoying some quality-of-life improvements.</p>
