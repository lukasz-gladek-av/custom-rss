<p>Over the holiday period, Epic has given away a number of games on its Store, including&nbsp;<em>Control</em>,&nbsp;<em>Ghostrunner 2</em>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sifu-epic-games-store-free" rel="nofollow">martial arts action brawler&nbsp;<em>Sifu</em></a>, among others. Each of the games available over the last couple of weeks has been redeemable for a single day.</p>

<p><em>Hell Let Loose&nbsp;</em>marks the end of that period, however, as it's available until December 9th, which means Epic has gone back to its usual schedule of giving away one free game per week.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Hell Let Loose</em>, it's a hardcore World War 2-set first-person shooter that was originally developed by Australian outfit Black Matter. It was first released on Steam Early Access <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hell-let-loose-hits-steam-early-access-on-july-6" rel="nofollow">back in 2019</a> following a successful Kickstarter campaign two years prior.</p>

<p>In 2022, publisher Team17 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/team17-expands-with-hell-let-loose-and-label-acquisitions" rel="nofollow">took over development</a>, with subsidiary Cover 6 Studios currently handling the bulk of ongoing work on the game in conjunction with British developer Expression Games.</p>

<p>Tragedy then struck&nbsp;<em>Hell Let Loose&nbsp;</em>in July that same year, when producer James Light <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hell-let-loose-producer-james-light-dies-aged-just-28" rel="nofollow">passed away</a> from "complications following cardiac surgery" aged just 28.</p>




<p>As for the game itself, it's a multiplayer-focused shooter that supports up to 100 players in each battle. Players can engage in on-foot battles or take to a number of different vehicles in order to wage war on their opponents.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Hell Let Loose&nbsp;</em>right now for free <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/hell-let-loose-03f036" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on the Epic Games Store</a>.
