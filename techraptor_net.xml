            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-space-marine-3-revealed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Focus Entertainment and Saber Interactive have confirmed that&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 3&nbsp;</em>is officially in development, so get ready to suit up as Ultramarine Demetrian Titus once more.</p>

<p>In an announcement <a href="https://www.focus-entmt.com/en/news/focus-entertainment-publishing-announces-the-development-of-warhammer-40000-space-marine-3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, the two studios, as well as&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k&nbsp;</em>IP holder Games Workshop, confirm that the game is coming, and that it'll offer "intense, brutal, and spectacular gameplay" while remaining "true to the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k&nbsp;</em>universe".</p>

<p>Focus deputy CEO John Bert says you can look forward to an "immersive campaign" in&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 3</em>, as well as multiplayer gameplay and "innovations that will redefine the standards of third-person action games".</p>

<p>Saber CEO Matthew Karch, meanwhile, says&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>was "transformative" for his company, and that while he acknowledges the "tremendous expectations" surrounding&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 3</em>, he's confident his team can create "a true love letter to the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k&nbsp;</em>universe".</p>

<p>Further details about the game are scarce at the moment, but judging by the very short teaser, we'll be seeing the return of Ultramarine Captain Demetrian Titus. If the past two&nbsp;<em>Space Marine&nbsp;</em>games are anything to go by, you'll likely be fighting the forces of Chaos at some point as well.</p>

<p>Given that&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>had sold <a href="https://x.com/Focus_entmt/status/1879948638245261796" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">over six million copies</a> at last count, it probably shouldn't come as a surprise that the game is getting a followup, but it's nice nonetheless.</p>




<p>As well as&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 3</em>, the&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>folks are also currently working on a game that will <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-marine-2-devs-hasbro-tentpole-ip" rel="nofollow">utilize a "tentpole" Hasbro IP</a>, although that IP hasn't been revealed yet.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what Focus and Saber are cooking up for&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 3</em>. In the meantime, if you want to refresh your memory, you can read my&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review" rel="nofollow">review here</a>.
