            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/talos-principle-reawakened-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Devolver Digital and developer Croteam have announced&nbsp;<em>The Talos Principle: Reawakened</em>, a reworked version of the philosophical 2014 puzzler that the two studios promise is "more than a remaster".</p>

<p>Described as the "definitive edition" of the game,&nbsp;<em>Reawakened&nbsp;</em>includes the full original experience, as well as the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/expansion-announced-talos-principle" rel="nofollow"><em>Road to Gehenna&nbsp;</em>expansion</a> and a brand new chapter titled&nbsp;<em>In the Beginning</em>. This new chapter "explores the origins of the Simulation and the challenges of its first test".</p>

<p><em>The Talos Principle&nbsp;</em>has also been rebuilt with Unreal Engine 5 in the new version of the game, resulting in what Devolver and Croteam call a "more immersive and detailed" world.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-talos-principle-reawakened-puzzle.jpg?itok=TzrhZyrG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-talos-principle-reawakened-puzzle.jpg?itok=YzkwsE7q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The original&nbsp;<em>The Talos Principle&nbsp;</em>is getting a fancy remaster next year.</figcaption></figure><p>Along with the visual overhaul,&nbsp;<em>The Talos Principle: Reawakened&nbsp;</em>is also promising "modernized quality-of-life updates that maintain the vision of the original classic", although Devolver and Croteam don't go into detail regarding exactly what those updates are.</p>

<p>Rather excitingly, if you're playing on PC, you can also look forward to a new level editor that lets you craft your very own&nbsp;<em>Talos Principle&nbsp;</em>challenges. I'd imagine there will be puzzles several degrees more fiendish than the original game's offerings online in hours after this one launches.</p>

<p>This new version of the game is set to debut sometime early next year for PC and current-gen consoles, so it looks like you're out of luck if you were hoping to check it out on your PS4 or your Xbox One, sadly. Still, there's always the original!</p>




<p>If you're unfamiliar with the original&nbsp;<em>The Talos Principle</em>, it's a first-person puzzler with a heavy emphasis on philosophical theming and narrative.</p>

<p>The game sees you tasked with solving puzzles by a mysterious "creator" figure, all while contemplating what your purpose might be in a beautiful but strangely empty world.</p>

<p>You can check out the original&nbsp;<em>The Talos Principle&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/257510/The_Talos_Principle/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/the-talos-principle/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 4</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/the-talos-principle/C1TJ5KT8LT9J" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox One</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/the-talos-principle-deluxe-edition-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>. There's no word yet on whether owners of the original will get any kind of discount on the new version, which is due to land on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S in 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-devs-feedback-early-access<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>developer Grinding Gear Games has outlined some of the changes coming to the game in the near future as a result of Early Access player feedback.</p>

<p>The action RPG was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-early-access-release-delayed" rel="nofollow">released last week</a>&nbsp;and despite Grinding Gear's fears that the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-early-access-server-issues-warning" rel="nofollow">servers may not hold up</a>, it's garnered a Very Positive rating in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2694490/Path_of_Exile_2/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam review stakes</a>, with over 32,000 players weighing in with their opinions.</p>

<p>Of course, though the majority of those reviews express positive sentiments, many players are noting areas in which they think&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>could improve, and it's those areas that Grinding Gear Games is addressing in <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3611705" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a new blog post</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/path-of-exile-2-early-access-xyclucian.jpg?itok=_Np3dB-u 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/path-of-exile-2-early-access-xyclucian.jpg?itok=74ju7gR7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>has met with a positive reception, but players are identifying some areas of improvement as well.</figcaption></figure><p>In the post, Grinding Gear says that there are a number of features raised by user feedback that the studio feels need to be "urgently addressed".</p>

<p>First up, dodge rolling is being changed so that players are "trapped less often", although Grinding Gear notes that it does want players to run the risk of becoming trapped by enemies if they don't use their dodge rolls smartly.</p>

<p>Other changes include the checkpoint system, which is being expanded to reduce the "tedious" nature of retreading maps to return to objectives, as well as changes to items to make&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>more "rewarding".</p>

<p>Various other areas of improvement are in Grinding Gear's crosshairs too, including currency, map mods, and endgame maps. If you don't spot your issue here, Grinding Gear assures players that there are "lots more things coming" as well.</p>




<p><em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>is, as you can probably guess, the sequel to 2013's free-to-play action RPG&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile</em>. It adds various new gameplay features and mechanics, as well as new weapons, visual improvements, and more.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>right now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2694490/Path_of_Exile_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on PC via Steam Early Access</a>.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/astrometica-early-access-preview-empty-space-in-more-ways-than-one</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/astrometica-early-access-preview-empty-space-in-more-ways-than-one<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Space survival crafting title&nbsp;<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="55334a98-ed16-459b-82d9-b2284972d02a" href="https://techraptor.net/games/astrometica" rel="nofollow"><strong><em>Astrometica</em></strong></a>&nbsp;has launched into Early Access, letting us explore what it has to offer the genre. A well-polished game, it centers around a survivor of a large spaceship explosion. Crashing into an asteroid belt, you're looking for other survivors, a way to remain alive, and a way home. There are signs of humanity left behind, but no one else is seen throughout your time floating through space.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My favorite part of&nbsp;<em>Astrometica</em>&nbsp;is the music. Going through space and listening to ethereal vibes that brought me back to my childhood days in the 90s really hit a high note. It feels like space, the largeness, being full and empty all at once. I could sit there and just listen to the music for hours as it fully enhances the gameplay experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/astrometica-mining-tool-space-view.jpg?itok=GmWZfz5C 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/astrometica-mining-tool-space-view.jpg?itok=wje8krdd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>That feeling of empty space is prevalent in&nbsp;<em>Astrometica.</em>&nbsp;While this lends itself to the feeling of being alone and without aid, it also works against the game. There's simply not enough to explore or do. You can fully explore the available area, visit the story locations, build a base and vehicles, and still be done in about 10-15 hours. This includes the many, many deaths&nbsp; There are multiple areas labeled WIP, including the two warp locations you discover.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even the story feels empty. You've crash-landed in an asteroid belt. There's another group of survivors from the same ship. While you find one of them, you don't find the other two or learn what happened to them. Along with the notes they've left behind, there are logs from the original miners of the asteroid belt. This story points towards a mysterious force and alien invasion. You encounter some of these aliens in one location, but beyond that, there's only one other enemy to watch out for. There's no conclusion to either storyline, no solution to the mystery, nothing. This will hopefully be wrapped up as more content is added during early access.</p>

<p>These logs and messages are left behind in the locations you explore. If you don't pay attention to them, however, you can easily forget there's even a storyline pushing you forward. This isn't that unusual for survival titles that focus on crafting, but crafting in <i>Astrometica</i>&nbsp;is basic, with few variations in modules you can build, vehicles, and crafting devices. There's a single plant you can grow, basic combinations for cooking, and a limited number of upgrades for equipment.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/astrometica-base-building-build-tool.jpg?itok=iye50Ikd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/astrometica-base-building-build-tool.jpg?itok=wdwMqPZz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>It seems like the focus of BeryMery was on fine-tuning and polishing the experience, instead of shoving in a bunch of content that may be buggy. There was a single bug that I experienced during the course of the preview, where a gold bar turned into a tool. This happened one other time when collecting ore, but it didn't affect the overall gameplay. Music didn't cut in and out, items worked as intended, and crafting was simple and didn't result in a janky base with pieces clipping into one another. There was no clipping, so much so that I died multiple times from running into asteroid pieces, part of my base, and even my vehicle.&nbsp;That polish is great for an Early Access game that's expected to be buggy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm hoping that further development of the title with access to WIP areas will expand upon the story and available activities. As it stands,&nbsp;<em>Astrometica</em>&nbsp;feels like an addition to another title versus a main game. There's nothing that drew me to keep playing, nothing that stands out as a wow factor differentiating it from the competition. It is an extremely well-crafted game, but that's simply not enough for me to consistently follow and play an Early Access title among a sea of games.&nbsp;</p>

<hr><p><em>Astrometica&nbsp;was previewed on PC over the course of 10 hours using a key provided by&nbsp;RockGame S.A. and BeryMery. Screenshots were taken during the course of the preview.&nbsp;</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-seasons-ending-in-january-offline-mode<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rocksteady and Warner Bros have announced that&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em>'s fourth season will serve as its last, and that you'll be able to play the superhero third-person shooter offline starting from today.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.suicidesquadgame.com/en-us/community/season-4-deep-dive" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Season 4 deep dive blog post</a> on the game's official website, Rocksteady says that Season 4's eighth episode, which will debut in January, will "serve as the last seasonal Episode" for&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em>, and that "the Suicide Squad's crusade against Brainiac is drawing to an end".</p>

<p>Although seasons are ending, there is a silver lining.&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em>'s offline mode, which Rocksteady <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-kill-justice-league-offline" rel="nofollow">confirmed would eventually happen back in December last year</a>, is being introduced today as part of Season 4's seventh episode.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-seasons-ending-deathstroke.jpg?itok=TpPGMxq1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-seasons-ending-deathstroke.jpg?itok=5oevYSej 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Suicide Squad</em>'s fourth season brings an offline mode, and it also brings Deathstroke.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Suicide Squad</em>'s offline mode will let you experience everything that's been released for the game without needing to be connected to the internet, and you'll even be able to copy over your online profile to create a new offline file.</p>

<p>What's more, all of your cosmetics and the other content you've purchased will be available via the offline mode. You can check out <a href="https://dcgamessupport.wbgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/36119520746515-OFFLINE-MODE-FAQ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Rocksteady's FAQ</a> if you want more info about how&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em>'s offline mode will work.</p>

<p>A new playable character is also being introduced in this season in the form of Deathstroke, who has three distinct playstyles: Assassin, Mercenary, and Strategist. As you'd expect, each carries its own Talents to distribute as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-seasons-ending-tentacle.jpg?itok=6NYzU9n3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-seasons-ending-tentacle.jpg?itok=yRjH4k66 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It looks like Rocksteady is ready to move on from&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em>.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em>'s demise probably shouldn't come as a surprise. Back in February, Warner Bros admitted that sales of the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-kill-justice-leagues-sales-disappointed-hogwarts-legacy-is-big-win" rel="nofollow">had been disappointing</a>; in fact, it was the major contributing factor to a $200 million writedown for the studio's gaming division.</p>

<p>In September, developer Rocksteady was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rocksteady-layoffs-suicide-squad" rel="nofollow">hit by layoffs</a>&nbsp;mainly focused on the QA division, with Rocksteady employees reportedly directly citing&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em>'s underperformance as the reason for the layoffs.</p>

<p>As for what Rocksteady's up to now, the studio is apparently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-directors-cut-report" rel="nofollow">helping out with a Director's Cut version</a> of&nbsp;<em>Harry Potter&nbsp;</em>RPG&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, and it's also reportedly looking to pitch a new single-player game. Let's hope it meets with more success than&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em>.</p>
