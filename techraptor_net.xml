            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nine-sols-sales-800k<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Red Candle Games has revealed that Metroidvania action platformer&nbsp;<em>Nine Sols&nbsp;</em>has reached a big sales milestone, with the game also celebrating its first anniversary.</p>

<p>Released on May 29th last year,&nbsp;<em>Nine Sols&nbsp;</em>has, according to a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1809540/view/544484746860692250" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, reached 800,000 copies since its launch. That number counts across all platforms, too, so it includes not only the game's initial PC release, but also November's console ports.</p>

<p>Red Candle also includes a timeline of&nbsp;<em>Nine Sols</em>' achievements in the post, revealing that by the six-week mark, the game had reached 6,000 Steam reviews and earned itself an Overwhelmingly Positive rating (which, across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1809540/Nine_Sols/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">all reviews</a>, it still holds at time of writing).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nine-sols-sales-800k-explosion.jpg?itok=knOIaziU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nine-sols-sales-800k-explosion.jpg?itok=ya2byuep 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Nine Sols&nbsp;</em>has managed to sell 800,000 copies across all platforms since launching last year.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Nine Sols</em>, it's a 2D action platformer with heavy Metroidvania elements created by Taiwanese studio Red Candle Games, best known for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/devotion-removed-from-steam-amid-outcry-over-winnie-pooh-reference" rel="nofollow">controversial</a>&nbsp;horror adventure game&nbsp;<em>Devotion</em>.</p>

<p>The game revolves around Yi, who must seek out the titular nine Sols in order to take their Sol Seals. His true motivations are unclear at the outset of the game, but become clearer as the plot progresses.</p>

<p>Yi also befriends a young human child by the name of Shuanshuan at the start of&nbsp;<em>Nine Sols</em>, and it's his relationship with Shuanshuan that informs his character development and reveals more about the world in which the game takes place.</p>

<p>While&nbsp;<em>Nine Sols&nbsp;</em>is a Metroidvania, that might not be the best attitude with which to approach it; you can think of it more as a semi-linear platformer that takes influence from&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/sekiro-shadows-die-twice" rel="nofollow">Sekiro</a>&nbsp;</em>than as a&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hollow-knight" rel="nofollow"><em>Hollow Knight</em></a>-style sprawling and interconnected experience.</p>




<p>If you'd like to give&nbsp;<em>Nine Sols&nbsp;</em>a go (and I'd recommend you do so), you can check it out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1809540/Nine_Sols/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10007919" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/nine-sols/9N3LGKGF3CC2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nine-sols-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>. It's well worth your time.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Witcher 3 Is Getting Cross-Platform Mod Support Later This Year]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/witcher-3-cross-platform-mod-support</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-witcher-3-is-getting-cross-platform-mod-support-later-this-year.1202586/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/witcher-3-cross-platform-mod-support<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>CD Projekt Red has announced that&nbsp;<em>The Witcher 3&nbsp;</em>will be getting cross-platform mod support later this year, potentially bringing some of the game's most popular mods to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://www.thewitcher.com/es/en/news/51479/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-cross-platform-mod-support" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the game's official website, cross-platform mod support will be added to the game via the mod.io platform, which is the same one used by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/baldurs-gate-3-developer-teases-robust-cross-platform-plan-for-mod-support" rel="nofollow">games like&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a>, among others.</p>

<p>Naturally, console mods will be available at no extra cost; all you'll need to do is create a mod.io account and connect it to your CD Projekt Red profile in order to access mods on PS5 and Xbox.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-witcher-3-cross-platform-mod-support-griffin.jpg?itok=21bUxwMw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-witcher-3-cross-platform-mod-support-griffin.jpg?itok=aTIDBPbU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You could turn this griffin - or, indeed, Geralt - into something truly bizarre when&nbsp;<em>The Witcher 3&nbsp;</em>mods land on console later this year.</figcaption></figure><p>You'll only be able to mod&nbsp;<em>The Witcher 3&nbsp;</em>on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S; the last-gen versions of the game won't be getting mod support. Additionally, only mods approved by CD Projekt Red will be accessible on consoles.</p>

<p>While CD Projekt Red's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/witcher-3-redkit-mod-editor-release-date" rel="nofollow">REDkit mod editor</a> isn't necessary for creating&nbsp;<em>The Witcher 3&nbsp;</em>mods on consoles, the developer does recommend that you use it if you want the "best chance" of your mod being approved.</p>

<p>Additionally, if your mods use scripts, you will need to use REDkit, so it's probably worth downloading it and getting to grips with it now if you're planning to put anything together for PS5 or Xbox Series X|S.</p>

<p>It's also not possible to create mods for the game directly on the consoles themselves. You'll need to make the mods on PC, even if you're intending for them to be used specifically on consoles.</p>




<p><em>The Witcher 3&nbsp;</em>recently celebrated its tenth anniversary, but the series isn't stopping there, of course; back in December last year, CD Projekt Red <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/witcher-4-official-reveal" rel="nofollow">officially unveiled&nbsp;<em>The Witcher 4</em></a>, although it's likely to be some time before we get more info about it.</p>

<p>Additionally, the studio revealed earlier this week that pre-production on the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>sequel <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cd-projekt-profits-cyberpunk-sequel-pre-production" rel="nofollow">has officially begun</a>. Again, though, expect to wait quite a while before an official announcement.</p>
