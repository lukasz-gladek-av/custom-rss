            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps3-software-update-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has released a system software update for the PS3 almost nine years after the seventh-generation console was discontinued in the US.</p>

<p>Of course, the update is a pretty <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/support/hardware/ps3/system-software/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">small</a> one; it doesn't add any major new features to the console, nor does it fix any obvious, glaring issues. Instead, much like the two updates before it, it simply "improves system performance", which usually involves smaller under-the-hood changes.</p>

<p>According to Sony, you're going to need 200MB of free space on your PS3 if you want to download this update. You can either update your system software through the console itself or via PC using a USB drive or other removable storage media.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ps3-update-2025-original.jpg?itok=5H4eFQdb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ps3-update-2025-original.jpg?itok=Pa7-dXr2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The PS3 has received a new system update almost nine years after its discontinuation.</figcaption></figure><p>Additionally, if you're looking to play Blu-ray discs on your PS3, you'll need to update, as Sony says you'll need a renewed encryption key to play the discs. You can get that key by - you guessed it - updating your console.</p>

<p>The PS3 was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-3-production-ending-soon" rel="nofollow">discontinued back in 2017</a>, which means it was supported by Sony for around eleven years. That's not a bad innings for a console, and it's roughly the same time period for which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-discontinues-production-of-xbox-360" rel="nofollow">Microsoft supported the Xbox 360</a>.</p>

<p>Sony released the console in late 2006, and while it went on to achieve the lowest hardware sales of its respective generation, it was up against the Xbox 360 and the Nintendo Wii, so that's hardly a surprise.</p>

<p>Iconic franchises like&nbsp;<em>Uncharted</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us</em>, and the&nbsp;<em>Souls&nbsp;</em>series got their start on the PS3, and many of its games have been remade or remastered for subsequent generations.</p>




<p>The PS3 was also the first console to feature a Blu-ray disc drive; Xbox instead opted for the doomed HD DVD format, although that decision would be reversed in time for the launch of the Xbox One in 2013.</p>

<p>In 2021, Sony <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-store-on-ps3-consoles-closes-this-july" rel="nofollow">announced it would shut down the PlayStation Store</a> across PS3 and its two handhelds, but widespread backlash saw the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-store-will-stay-online-for-ps3-and-vita" rel="nofollow">reverse that decision swiftly</a>, at least in the case of the PS3 and the PS Vita.</p>

<p>Sadly, this PS3 update almost certainly doesn't herald some kind of phoenix-like revival for the console, but hey - if you're still playing your PS3, at least you know it hasn't been totally forgotten. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-studio-visual-arts-reportedly-hit-by-layoffs.1125771/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-studio-visual-arts-layoffs-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Another PlayStation studio has reportedly been hit by layoffs, with support studio Visual Arts apparently in the Sony firing line this time around.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-studios-visual-arts-layoffs-cuts-last-us-1851767734" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Kotaku</a>, Visual Arts was hit by layoffs earlier this week as part of "a further restructuring of Sony's US game development operations". Cuts reportedly included staff who worked on some of Sony's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/horizon-mmo-canceled-report" rel="nofollow">recently-canceled projects</a>, including&nbsp;<em>Days Gone&nbsp;</em>developer Bend Studio's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-live-service-games-canceled" rel="nofollow">canned live service game</a>.</p>

<p>However, Kotaku's source, whom the publication doesn't name, says the layoffs were more widespread than that, seemingly suggesting that cuts also included staff who weren't involved in the aforementioned projects.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/playstation-visual-arts-layoffs-days-gone.jpg?itok=HbgYrISj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/playstation-visual-arts-layoffs-days-gone.jpg?itok=_e2dW7V2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Recent PlayStation layoffs apparently include employees who worked on a now-canceled project by&nbsp;<em>Days Gone&nbsp;</em>dev Bend Studio.</figcaption></figure><p>As Kotaku points out, ex-Visual Arts associate project manager Abby LeMaster confirmed the layoffs herself <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/abbynlemaster_it-was-tough-waking-up-to-messages-that-many-activity-7302431179213807617-xwpO" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on LinkedIn</a>, saying that waking up to news of the layoffs was "tough" and that the talent let go by the studio would be "extraordinarily difficult to recoup".</p>

<p>While you might not know Visual Arts' name, it's a fairly important studio for Sony, providing development support for major studios like Naughty Dog.</p>

<p>These layoffs come after what has been a relatively difficult year for Sony. While the gaming giant enjoyed critical <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/astro-bot-sales-sony-financials" rel="nofollow">and commercial</a> success with the likes of throwback platformer&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em>, Sony also suffered an embarrassing failure in the form of hero shooter&nbsp;<em>Concord</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds" rel="nofollow">shut down just a couple of weeks after launching</a>.</p>

<p>In January, Sony announced it would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-leadership-shakeup" rel="nofollow">shake up its leadership structure</a>, appointing Hideaki Nishino the sole president and CEO of Sony's interactive division. The change means that while Hermen Hulst will remain the head of PlayStation Studios, he'll now report to Nishino, rather than the two sharing CEO duties.</p>
