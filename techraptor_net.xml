            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced a brand new Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase for tomorrow, so while we won't be getting info on first-party Nintendo titles, we will get to learn what third-party publishers are cooking up for the gaming giant's ecosystem.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1950541896012493166" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on social media, the Partner Direct showcase for July 2025 will air tomorrow, July 31st, at 6am Pacific/9am Eastern. That's around 2pm BST and about 3pm CEST, so make sure to set your alarm accordingly.</p>

<p>According to Nintendo, you can expect "roughly 25 minutes" of info about upcoming Switch 2 and Switch games from the company's "publishing partners", although none of those partners are mentioned by name in Nintendo's post.</p>

<p>It could also be time for some third-party publishers to reveal ports of some of their most popular games for the Switch 2; Capcom could choose to bring more&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>games to the platform, for instance, or EA could reveal that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-6-revealed-release-date-october-maybe" rel="nofollow">the recently-revealed&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-6-revealed-release-date-october-maybe" rel="nofollow">Battlefield 6</a>&nbsp;</em>is, in fact, also making its way to the Switch 2.</p>

<p>Of course, this being a third-party showcase, one game is likely to be on everyone's mind, namely Team Cherry's&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>. Will we finally get to hear about a release date during this Direct?</p>

<p>I'd say there's a non-zero chance of that happening. Xbox recently announced that&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-gamescom-demo" rel="nofollow">will be playable at its booth</a> during this year's Gamescom, so that might line up pretty nicely with a Direct release date announcement.</p>

Please? For us?</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, since Team Cherry is sort of hitching its wagon to Xbox (what with the game landing on Game Pass on day one and its inclusion as part of Xbox's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">new ROG Ally reveal this summer</a>),&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>might be a no-show during tomorrow's Direct as well.</p>

<p>Either way, you can check the show out tomorrow, July 31st, at 6am Pacific/9am Eastern. Join us here tomorrow for all of the reveals and news from that show as well!</p>
