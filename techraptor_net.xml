            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-2m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Sandfall Interactive and publisher Kepler Interactive have announced that JRPG-inspired adventure&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>has hit another big sales milestone less than two weeks after its initial release.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/expedition33/status/1919701863491838316" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, the two studios reveal that&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>has reached two million sales since its launch in late April. The figure means the game has picked up another million and a half sales since <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-500k" rel="nofollow">very quickly hitting 500,000</a>&nbsp;on launch day.</p>

<p>Sandfall says it's "watched in awe" as players flocked to&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, "feeling every step, every emotion, every revelation" alongside those playing through the&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy</em>-style RPG.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, it's a turn-based RPG inspired by the&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>series, and it's also a pretty strong argument against&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>producer Naoki Yoshida's <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/final-fantasy-16-ditched-turn-based-combat-to-appeal-to-younger-generations-producer-says/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">assertions</a> that gamers don't want turn-based games anymore.</p>

<p>The game follows the titular Expedition 33 as it sets out to put an end to the Paintress, a solemn and terrifying figure who paints increasingly low numbers each year, with everyone of the equivalent age perishing as she paints.</p>

<p>It features staples of the JRPG genre like an overworld map with plenty of optional locations to explore, party members that can be swapped out on the fly, and turn-based battles (albeit with real-time elements and a parry system).</p>
