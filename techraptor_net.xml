            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/spire-of-dioronna-card-game-based-on-3-body-problem-now-live-on-kickstarter<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A S<em>pire of Dioronna</em> board game has gone live on Kickstarter. This card game is based on the <em>3 Body Problem</em> novel series written by Liu Cixin, which was recently given a streaming series adaptation on Netflix. Specifically, it focuses on a single character from those books.</p>



<p>According to its campaign page, <em>Spire of Dioronna </em>is a modular map escape card game. It is based on Dioronna, a <em>3 Body Problem: Death's End</em> character. Dioronna was a prostitute in the time of the Byzantine Empire who, through the aid of a high-dimensional fragment, attempted to help Constantine kill the leader of the Ottoman Empire.</p>

In addition, the spire in the school may be the same one where Dioronna practiced her craft. But once you and your fellow students enter the spire the items and the room shatter apart.</p>

<p>If you want to escape this predicament, you must work together. Players take turns drawing room cards from a deck and slowly building a map. The objective is to find three unique magic items, a wizard hat, a cat, and a key, then find the exit. <em>Spire of Dioronna</em> is designed for 2-4 players and a single game takes about 20-40 minutes to complete.</p>
