            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-31-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has revealed the release date for&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.1, with the latest update for the spacefaring turn-based gacha RPG set to land later this month.</p>

<p>Titled "Light Slips the Gate, Shadow Greets the Throne" in typical grandiose HoYoverse style, Version 3.1 will arrive on February 26th and will bring a brand new map to explore, plus two new 5-star characters to use and more.</p>

<p>First up, Version 3.1 will let you explore the Grove of Epiphany, a city-state under attack by a "shadowy foe" looking to claim its Titan's Coreflame for its own. The Trailblaze Mission for this update will see you investigating what's happening in the Grove and reclaiming the Coreflame.</p>

<p>The first is Tribbie, a transformed version of the demigod Tribbios. HoYoverse says she deliberately split herself into "thousands of Messengers" using the Century Gate, and now, she can join your party.</p>

<p>She can buff your team and debuff enemies to help your party deal more damage, so she's a valuable combatant to have if you need an extra edge in combat.</p>

<p>Your second new fighter in Version 3.1 is Mydei, a "warrior as valiant as a lion" who consumes HP to deal extra damage. Reruns for Yunli and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-introduces-new-five-star-character-huohuo" rel="nofollow">Huohuo</a> will also appear in the first and second halves of the Version 3.1 event cycle.</p>




<p>You can also look forward to a new season of Divergent Universe in which battles will be split between day and night, introducing unique effects for both times of day. That's alongside the usual gameplay fixes and miscellaneous quality-of-life improvements.</p>

<p><em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices</a>. Version 3.1 launches across all platforms on February 26th.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Hyper Light Breaker Roadmap and First Major Update Revealed]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hyper-light-breaker-roadmap-first-update</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hyper-light-breaker-roadmap-and-first-major-update-revealed.1109490/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hyper-light-breaker-roadmap-first-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Heart Machine and publisher Arc Games have revealed the first major Early Access roadmap for action-adventure roguelike&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker</em>, as well as what's coming as part of the game's first big update next week.</p>

<p>The game launched last month to mixed player reviews on Steam, with players <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hyper-light-breaker-fixes-coming" rel="nofollow">criticizing performance and accessibility issues</a> as well as some of the game's design.</p>

<p>As you can probably guess, the first big update in February, which lands on the 18th, aims to address some of those problems, promising rebalancing for combat and gear as well as "performance updates" and bug fixes.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hyper-light-breaker-roadmap-fight.jpg?itok=oiZfF5AO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hyper-light-breaker-roadmap-fight.jpg?itok=tESpoMn1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hyper Light Breaker</em>'s first roadmap is aiming to address some of its most common sticking points.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as these fixes and rebalancing efforts, the February monthly update will also bring a new player character, new holobytes, and new enemies to fight, plus new affixes to experiment with.</p>

<p>Another monthly update will arrive in March, and it'll bring plenty of new stuff; new enemies and a new assassin are on the way, plus more performance updates and more rebalancing.</p>

<p>Following that, a significant new update is coming in April, and this one's big enough to get its own name. The Buried Below update continues the previous two updates' efforts with regards to rebalancing and bug fixing, but it also brings new areas, another new player character, and "improved onboarding".</p>

<p>There's plenty more coming before the game's 1.0 launch as well, although that launch still doesn't have a release date. You can see the full&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>Early Access roadmap right here.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hyper-light-breaker-roadmap-full.jpg?itok=vjJ4C1_a 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hyper-light-breaker-roadmap-full.jpg?itok=ZQ4dAe-z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There's lots on the way for&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker</em>.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>is the latest game in the&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light&nbsp;</em>series. Developed by Heart Machine, the game eschews its predecessor's top-down&nbsp;<em>Zelda</em>-style perspective in favor of a full 3D look, and it's a roguelike as opposed to&nbsp;<em>Drifter</em>'s handcrafted adventure.</p>

<p>While sales figures haven't been officially released, it seems that&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>hasn't exactly performed as well as parent company Embracer would have liked, at least if its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-2m-embracer" rel="nofollow">recent financial statement</a> is anything to go by.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>right now on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1534840/Hyper_Light_Breaker/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam Early Access</a>, and if you'd like to know what our very own Austin thought of the game, you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/hyper-light-breaker-preview-journey-worth-taking" rel="nofollow">take a look at his preview here</a>.</p>
