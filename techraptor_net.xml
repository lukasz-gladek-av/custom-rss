            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-spring-festival-rocket-league-mode<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>NetEase Games has revealed a brand new event for hero shooter&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>. The Spring Festival event arrives tomorrow, bringing with it a whole new game mode and some shiny new skins.</p>

<p>Kicking off on January 23rd at 9am UTC (that's 4am Eastern and 1am Pacific), the Spring Festival event's main draw is its Clash of Dancing Lions limited-time mode, which will look familiar to you if you've ever played&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/rocket-league" rel="nofollow"><em>Rocket League</em></a>.</p>

<p>Teams of three compete against one another on a dedicated map, with each team aiming to gain possession of a ball and make sure it enters the opposing team's scoring zone. Whoever reaches "a predetermined score" first will be declared the winner.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, three Clashing Lions-themed skins have been introduced for those heroes. Star-Lord gets a fetching Lion's Mane costume, Black Widow gets a Lion's Heartbeat outfit, and Iron Fist gets a Lion's Gaze look.</p>

<p>They're all essentially themed around the same traditional Chinese lion dance motif, and they all look pretty excellent. At the very least, you'll be able to earn Star-Lord's outfit through "completing tasks", although it isn't clear whether you can earn the other two that way as well.</p>

<p>Additionally, since&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/marvels-spider-man-2" rel="nofollow">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a>&nbsp;</em>is landing on PC soon, NetEase says a new&nbsp;<em>Spider-Man 2</em>-themed bundle will be available in&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' store, complete with a new outfit for Spidey, as well as a new nameplate and spray. Those are launching on January 30th.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>, it's a free-to-play hero shooter developed and published by Chinese studio NetEase. Similar in many ways to&nbsp;<em>Overwatch</em>, the game pits Marvel heroes like Black Widow, Captain America, and Venom against one another in objective-based gameplay modes.</p>

<p>The game has proven popular among players, reaching a player count of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-10m" rel="nofollow">10 million within a 72-hour period</a>. It's also attracted the attention of modders, who have already <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-modding-workaround" rel="nofollow">found a way around</a> an apparent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-modding-clampdown" rel="nofollow">clampdown on skin modding</a> introduced alongside&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' first season.</p>

<p>You can play&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>for free right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2767030/Marvel_Rivals/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/marvel-rivals/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/marvel-rivals/9n8pmw7qmd3d" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-hedgehog-4-movie-march-2027<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Paramount has already announced a release date for the fourth&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog&nbsp;</em>movie, despite the fact that the third movie was only made available to stream yesterday (and that it's still available to watch in some theaters).</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/sonic-4-release-date-march-2027-1236280697/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Variety</a>,&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog 4&nbsp;</em>will be launching on March 19th, 2027. Obviously, that date is more than two years away, but hey, I suppose&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>movie fans need something to look forward to.</p>

<p><em>Sonic the Hedgehog 4&nbsp;</em>won't necessarily be the movie's final title, but if it follows the naming conventions of its two predecessors, then it probably won't bear any kind of secondary name. Don't expect&nbsp;<em>Sonic 4: The Rise of Robotnik&nbsp;</em>or anything anytime soon.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-movie-release-date-sonic-3-shot.jpg?itok=XODQS-Vq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-movie-release-date-sonic-3-shot.jpg?itok=NIohTK_b 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The fourth&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>movie will be hitting theaters in March 2027.</figcaption></figure><p>A <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fourth-sonic-hedgehog-movie-2027-report" rel="nofollow">report back in December</a> (also courtesy of Variety) already revealed that a fourth&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>movie was confirmed before the proverbial ink on the third one was dry, but now we know exactly when we can expect it.</p>

<p>Of course, we still don't know what kind of story details we can expect from the movie, although the post-credits scenes included in the third installment are probably strong clues as to where it's headed.</p>

<p>The third movie's post-credits scenes (look away now if you don't want spoilers!) confirm that Shadow survived the events of the film, and they also tease the appearance of both Metal Sonic and Amy Rose in the next movie.</p>

<p>As such, we can probably expect&nbsp;<em>Sonic 4&nbsp;</em>to focus on both characters, and Keanu Reeves' Shadow the Hedgehog will probably be returning as well. Naturally, all of this is speculation until the movie is officially revealed.</p>




<p>The existence of a fourth&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog&nbsp;</em>movie makes a lot of sense given how well the previous three have done in financial terms.</p>

<p>According to Paramount, between them, the three&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>films have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-the-hedgehog-movies-1b-box-office" rel="nofollow">crossed $1 billion at the box office</a>, and since that report was released earlier this month, that number's likely to be higher by now as well.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog 4&nbsp;</em>releases on March 19th, 2027. Don't expect to hear anything more about the movie for a while given how far off that date is.</p>
