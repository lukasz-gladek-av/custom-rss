            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has officially announced a new <em>Life Is Strange </em>game, <em>Life Is Strange: Reunion</em>, and it will (as the name suggests) reunite Chloe and Max when it launches in just a couple of months.</p><p>Ahead of a livestream, Xbox officially unveiled the name, direction, and release date for <em>Life Is Strange: Reunion </em>in an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/20/life-is-strange-reunion-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Wire blog post</a>. It's coming to PC and Xbox Series X|S (and, presumably, other platforms) on March 26th.</p><p>The goal, according to the <em>Life Is Strange </em>team, is to give Chloe and Max "the ending they deserve" and to provide a "thrilling finale" to the stories of both characters in a reunion "thought impossible". Be aware that spoilers for <em>Life Is Strange </em>and its sequels may follow.</p><figure role="group">

<p>If you're wondering how Chloe was able to return after the events of the original <em>Life Is Strange</em>, well, the team says it "may be due to Max's power", making reference to the conclusion of 2024's episodic<em> Double Exposure</em>, in which Max merged parallel timelines and recovered her Rewind ability.</p><p>Chloe, however, is "no prize to be won", as the <em>Life Is Strange </em>folks say; she's her own woman, which is why she'll be the co-protagonist of this game alongside Max.</p><p>They'll be trying to find their way back to each other over the course of <em>Reunion</em>, each offering "alternating views of the world" and "different-but-complementary perspectives" on the events of the story.</p><p>Once again, Max is able to rewind time, a power she'll be using to both escape and get herself into some pretty tricky situations. Chloe's Backtalk ability returns, too, allowing her to smart-talk her conversation partners.</p><figure role="group">
