            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/astrometica-early-access-preview-empty-space-in-more-ways-than-one<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Space survival crafting title&nbsp;<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="55334a98-ed16-459b-82d9-b2284972d02a" href="https://techraptor.net/games/astrometica" rel="nofollow"><strong><em>Astrometica</em></strong></a>&nbsp;has launched into Early Access, letting us explore what it has to offer the genre. A well-polished game, it centers around a survivor of a large spaceship explosion. Crashing into an asteroid belt, you're looking for other survivors, a way to remain alive, and a way home. There are signs of humanity left behind, but no one else is seen throughout your time floating through space.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My favorite part of&nbsp;<em>Astrometica</em>&nbsp;is the music. Going through space and listening to ethereal vibes that brought me back to my childhood days in the 90s really hit a high note. It feels like space, the largeness, being full and empty all at once. I could sit there and just listen to the music for hours as it fully enhances the gameplay experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/astrometica-mining-tool-space-view.jpg?itok=GmWZfz5C 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/astrometica-mining-tool-space-view.jpg?itok=wje8krdd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>That feeling of empty space is prevalent in&nbsp;<em>Astrometica.</em>&nbsp;While this lends itself to the feeling of being alone and without aid, it also works against the game. There's simply not enough to explore or do. You can fully explore the available area, visit the story locations, build a base and vehicles, and still be done in about 10-15 hours. This includes the many, many deaths&nbsp; There are multiple areas labeled WIP, including the two warp locations you discover.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even the story feels empty. You've crash-landed in an asteroid belt. There's another group of survivors from the same ship. While you find one of them, you don't find the other two or learn what happened to them. Along with the notes they've left behind, there are logs from the original miners of the asteroid belt. This story points towards a mysterious force and alien invasion. You encounter some of these aliens in one location, but beyond that, there's only one other enemy to watch out for. There's no conclusion to either storyline, no solution to the mystery, nothing. This will hopefully be wrapped up as more content is added during early access.</p>

<p>These logs and messages are left behind in the locations you explore. If you don't pay attention to them, however, you can easily forget there's even a storyline pushing you forward. This isn't that unusual for survival titles that focus on crafting, but crafting in <i>Astrometica</i>&nbsp;is basic, with few variations in modules you can build, vehicles, and crafting devices. There's a single plant you can grow, basic combinations for cooking, and a limited number of upgrades for equipment.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/astrometica-base-building-build-tool.jpg?itok=iye50Ikd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/astrometica-base-building-build-tool.jpg?itok=wdwMqPZz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>It seems like the focus of BeryMery was on fine-tuning and polishing the experience, instead of shoving in a bunch of content that may be buggy. There was a single bug that I experienced during the course of the preview, where a gold bar turned into a tool. This happened one other time when collecting ore, but it didn't affect the overall gameplay. Music didn't cut in and out, items worked as intended, and crafting was simple and didn't result in a janky base with pieces clipping into one another. There was no clipping, so much so that I died multiple times from running into asteroid pieces, part of my base, and even my vehicle.&nbsp;That polish is great for an Early Access game that's expected to be buggy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm hoping that further development of the title with access to WIP areas will expand upon the story and available activities. As it stands,&nbsp;<em>Astrometica</em>&nbsp;feels like an addition to another title versus a main game. There's nothing that drew me to keep playing, nothing that stands out as a wow factor differentiating it from the competition. It is an extremely well-crafted game, but that's simply not enough for me to consistently follow and play an Early Access title among a sea of games.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-seasons-ending-in-january-offline-mode<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rocksteady and Warner Bros have announced that&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em>'s fourth season will serve as its last, and that you'll be able to play the superhero third-person shooter offline starting from today.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.suicidesquadgame.com/en-us/community/season-4-deep-dive" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Season 4 deep dive blog post</a> on the game's official website, Rocksteady says that Season 4's eighth episode, which will debut in January, will "serve as the last seasonal Episode" for&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em>, and that "the Suicide Squad's crusade against Brainiac is drawing to an end".</p>

<p>Although seasons are ending, there is a silver lining.&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em>'s offline mode, which Rocksteady <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-kill-justice-league-offline" rel="nofollow">confirmed would eventually happen back in December last year</a>, is being introduced today as part of Season 4's seventh episode.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-seasons-ending-deathstroke.jpg?itok=TpPGMxq1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-seasons-ending-deathstroke.jpg?itok=5oevYSej 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Suicide Squad</em>'s fourth season brings an offline mode, and it also brings Deathstroke.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Suicide Squad</em>'s offline mode will let you experience everything that's been released for the game without needing to be connected to the internet, and you'll even be able to copy over your online profile to create a new offline file.</p>

<p>What's more, all of your cosmetics and the other content you've purchased will be available via the offline mode. You can check out <a href="https://dcgamessupport.wbgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/36119520746515-OFFLINE-MODE-FAQ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Rocksteady's FAQ</a> if you want more info about how&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em>'s offline mode will work.</p>

<p>A new playable character is also being introduced in this season in the form of Deathstroke, who has three distinct playstyles: Assassin, Mercenary, and Strategist. As you'd expect, each carries its own Talents to distribute as well.</p>

Back in February, Warner Bros admitted that sales of the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-kill-justice-leagues-sales-disappointed-hogwarts-legacy-is-big-win" rel="nofollow">had been disappointing</a>; in fact, it was the major contributing factor to a $200 million writedown for the studio's gaming division.</p>

<p>In September, developer Rocksteady was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rocksteady-layoffs-suicide-squad" rel="nofollow">hit by layoffs</a>&nbsp;mainly focused on the QA division, with Rocksteady employees reportedly directly citing&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em>'s underperformance as the reason for the layoffs.</p>

<p>As for what Rocksteady's up to now, the studio is apparently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-directors-cut-report" rel="nofollow">helping out with a Director's Cut version</a> of&nbsp;<em>Harry Potter&nbsp;</em>RPG&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, and it's also reportedly looking to pitch a new single-player game. Let's hope it meets with more success than&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/funko-brandshield-itch-io-denial</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/funko-and-brandshield-deny-causing-itch-io-phishing-claim-shutdown.1056699/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/funko-brandshield-itch-io-denial<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Collectible company Funko and "online brand protection" software suite BrandShield have both denied causing yesterday's takedown of Itch.io, which resulted in the storefront being taken offline for several hours.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Itch.io site owner Leaf Corcoran <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/itchio-offline-funko-phishing-brandshield" rel="nofollow">said that a "bogus phishing report" had been made</a> on behalf of toy company Funko, with the report apparently coming from an AI-powered software suite called BrandShield, which Funko apparently uses.</p>

<p>Corcoran elaborated that the request pertained to a fan page for action-adventure game&nbsp;<em>Funko Fusion&nbsp;</em>on Itch.io, and while a request of this nature would usually take the form of a DMCA takedown, a "fraud and phishing" report was issued instead.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/itch.io-funko-brandshield-takedown-denial.jpg?itok=XVcGvsf- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/itch.io-funko-brandshield-takedown-denial.jpg?itok=WG2-GJBd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Both Funko and BrandShield deny taking down Itch.io.</figcaption></figure><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/originalfunko/status/1866255848366039468" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">statement on social media platform X</a>, Funko says "a takedown request was issued" for the specific&nbsp;<em>Funko Fusion&nbsp;</em>fan page Corcoran referred to, not for the whole site; Funko is adamant that it "did not request a takedown of the Itch.io platform".</p>

<p>For its part, meanwhile, BrandShield <a href="https://x.com/BrandShieldltd/status/1866161489528180988" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">says</a>&nbsp;its AI platform "detects potential threats and provides analysis", and that "an abuse was detected" on an Itch.io page. Like Funko, BrandShield says it requested a "takedown" of the specific URL in question and not the Itch.io domain as a whole.</p>

<p>BrandShield goes on to say that the decision to take down the Itch.io domain as a whole was "made by the service providers" and not by BrandShield.</p>

<p>As readers on X point out, though, the request that was made to Itch.io's domain registrar wasn't a standard DMCA takedown notice; it was a "fraud and phishing" request, which is likely to have different - and probably far more drastic - response protocols from domain registrars.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/funko-fusion-hot-fuzz.jpg?itok=JKnJM0zr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/funko-fusion-hot-fuzz.jpg?itok=5waE8B_Q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>All of this apparently started because of an Itch.io&nbsp;<em>Funko Fusion&nbsp;</em>fan page.</figcaption></figure><p>Things get stranger, though, if <a href="https://x.com/itchio/status/1866239798924763227" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> by Itch.io yesterday is to be believed.</p>

<p>In the post, Corcoran says that Funko "just called [his] mom", sharing a screenshot of a message allegedly from his mother in which she says she received a "strange call from a company about accusatory statements on your social media account".</p>

<p>Corcoran says the message from his mom is "not a joke", and if that's the case, then it's not the best look in the world for Funko, especially since users seem to be rallying around Itch.io in this matter. We'll bring you more as we get it.</p>
