            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dungeons-dragons-pinball-game-announced-by-wizards-of-coast<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> pinball machine is coming next year. Wizards of the Coast is extending the world's most popular fantasy TTRPG into the realm of old-school time wasters thanks to a deal with Stern Pinball.</p>

<h2>The Dungeons &amp; Dragons Pinball Machine Announcement</h2>

<p>The official <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> account announced the Dungeons &amp; Dragons pinball machine via a <a href="https://x.com/Wizards_DnD/status/1874138499051298872?t" rel="nofollow">social media post</a> on X (formerly Twitter).</p>

<p>The post contained little detail. It was a collection of eyeball emojis followed by a thirty-second teaser trailer. The trailer was barebones, showing illustrations of a dungeon, a battle map, a d20 being rolled, and a blink and you'll miss it face of a red dragon. The name of the pinball machine, <em>The Tyrant's Eye</em>, alongside this imagery strongly implies the machine will involve toppling a red dragon tyrant.</p>

First, there is a limited supply of these pinball machines. Second, the machines will only be shipping to the mainland United States. Sorry, EU and UK fans. Third, purchases of these pinball machines will only be available to All-Access Stern Insider members.</p>

<p>As for the price for one of these maines? The Pro and Premium editions of the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> pinball machines will be sold at an MSRP of $6,999. Furthermore, there is a Limited Edition machine available for $12,999.</p>

<p>This does beg the question as to what these pinball machines contain. What novelty will they bring to the game of pinball? Will certain creatures and characters be showcased like the conniving Xanathar or the magnficent Mordenkainen? Those details will be revealed by Stern on January 3.</p>

<p>The release of a Dungeons &amp; Dragons pinball machine is a natural extension of the game's growing popularity. One that has surged thanks to the rise of actual plays like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-10-year-anniversary-live-show-announced-includes-fjord-and-jester" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Critical Role</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dropout-announces-vod-dates-for-their-actual-play-live-show-dimension20-time-quangle" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dimension 20</em></a> alongside the critical and commercial success of Larian Studios' <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/baldurs-gate-3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioshock-creator-ken-levine-generative-ai</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bioshock-creator-ken-levine-not-overly-impressed-by-generative-ai.1071861/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioshock-creator-ken-levine-generative-ai<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>BioShock&nbsp;</em>creator Ken Levine has expressed skepticism regarding generative AI, admitting its usefulness for technical tasks but doubting its ability to "tell [him] a really compelling story".</p>

<p>In a new interview with GamesIndustry.biz, Levine is asked for his opinions on generative AI and its "capability to react to players". Levine says he doesn't want to "underestimate" the technology, but that its biggest limitation right now is "persistence".</p>

<p>He gives the example of ChatGPT's video generator Sora, which he says is capable of generating a "beautiful" street scene featuring a woman walking down the street. However, if that woman were to "turn around and walk backwards", Sora wouldn't "remember where she has been".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bioshock-ken-levine-judas-generative-ai.jpg?itok=A5rCS0Qf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bioshock-ken-levine-judas-generative-ai.jpg?itok=MLoF-X4n 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ken Levine's&nbsp;<em>Judas&nbsp;</em>won't be using generative AI for its art or narrative.</figcaption></figure><p>It's this lack of persistence that Levine says means AI can't tell him a "really compelling story that has a three-act structure"; in fact, AI can't "even tell [him] multiple scenes", he says, going on to say that he's "not overly impressed" by the technology as it currently stands.</p>

<p>Despite that, Levine acknowledges that generative AI has its uses. He says that it's useful for "training your bug database to query how many bugs you have in certain situations", for instance, or "clearing [the&nbsp;<em>Judas&nbsp;</em>dev team's] analytics database".</p>

<p>However, he hasn't used it for concept art, largely "because there's some legal issues" around how generative AI sources its images. In case you're not aware, generative AI <a href="https://hbr.org/2023/04/generative-ai-has-an-intellectual-property-problem" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">can often use art without crediting the original artists</a> when generating content.</p>

<p>The full GI.biz <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-future-of-storytelling-with-ken-levine" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">interview</a> is well worth reading, especially if you're interested in keeping up with Levine's work on&nbsp;<em>Judas</em>. He discusses everything from the game's approach to player choice all the way through to his work on&nbsp;<em>BioShock</em>.</p>




<p>Levine isn't the only person in the industry to express skepticism when it comes to gen AI. Back in July, Nintendo <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-generative-ai-no-plans" rel="nofollow">declared that it had no plans</a> to use the tech in its games, acknowledging similar IP rights issues to Levine.</p>

<p>However, that hasn't stopped companies like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-generative-ai-vp" rel="nofollow">Netflix</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-working-hard-on-using-ai-to-make-npc-and-worlds-more-alive-reactive-and" rel="nofollow">Ubisoft</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/square-enix-ceo-pledges-to-be-aggressive-in-applying-ai-and-cutting-edge-tech-to" rel="nofollow">Square Enix</a>&nbsp;from going all in on generative AI. It looks like this is a debate that isn't going away anytime soon.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sifu-epic-games-store-free</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sifu-is-free-on-the-epic-games-store-right-now.1071840/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sifu-epic-games-store-free<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic has revealed the next free game that you can download and keep right now on its store, and it's perfect for fans of martial arts-based action brawlers, although its relentless difficulty might take some getting used to.</p>

<p>That's right: your next <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/sifu" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">free Epic Games Store game</a> is Sloclap's&nbsp;<em>Sifu</em>, which was actually an Epic Store exclusive on PC until <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/martial-arts-brawler-sifu-comes-to-steam-and-xbox-in-march" rel="nofollow">its release on Steam and Xbox</a>&nbsp;in March last year.</p>

<p><em>Sifu&nbsp;</em>is the latest in a string of free games Epic has been offering up on the Store for the last couple of weeks. It joins the likes of&nbsp;<em>Ghostrunner 2</em>,&nbsp;<em>Control</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Hot Wheels Unleashed</em>, along with plenty of others (which you can no longer redeem, unfortunately).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sifu-epic-games-store-free-brawl.jpg?itok=koXWYtYX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sifu-epic-games-store-free-brawl.jpg?itok=Vk0fyERH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Sifu&nbsp;</em>is free to keep right now on the Epic Games Store.</figcaption></figure><p>Since&nbsp;<em>Sifu&nbsp;</em>launched in February 2022, it's received <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/show-off-your-style-and-moves-in-sifu-free-summer-2022-update" rel="nofollow">a number of updates</a> bringing features like new game modes, extra modifiers, and more. If you played this one back at launch, it's worth giving it another shot, especially if you were into the core gameplay loop at the time.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Sifu</em>, it's a martial arts brawler in which you must battle your way through a series of dungeon-like environments in order to avenge your father.</p>

<p>The game's unique gimmick revolves around a magical talisman you wear; each time you die, you're resurrected, but you age a number of years, gaining attack power in return for a smaller health pool.</p>

<p><em>Sifu&nbsp;</em>adopts a structure that's not dissimilar to a roguelite; you can either press on with your current run or start again with the permanent upgrades you've already unlocked to give yourself a better chance of reaching the last boss while still young.</p>




<p><em>Sifu&nbsp;</em>isn't the only free game you can claim on PC right now, either. If you head on over to <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/vambrace_cold_soul" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a>, you can grab yourself a copy of roguelite RPG&nbsp;<em>Vambrace: Cold Soul</em>, and you won't have to pay a penny.</p>

<p>Like&nbsp;<em>Sifu</em>,&nbsp;<em>Vambrace&nbsp;</em>has also benefited from a number of updates over the years, including <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vambrace-cold-soul-update-features-difficulty-tweaks" rel="nofollow">difficulty tweaks</a>, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/devespresso-games-announces-new-game-and-more-changes-for-vambrace-cold-soul" rel="nofollow">New Game Plus mode</a>, and plenty more. Again, if you gave it a try at launch but put it down, you might want to pick it up again, especially since it won't cost you anything!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dont-look-back-2nd-edition-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Everyone was dead. She was sure of it. The huge monster of a man wielding a machete had hacked Ranger Sandy to pieces right in front of her eyes, and she had been running for what felt like hours ever since. Even if they had survived, they wouldn't have left her. Would they? She had heard the car start, and she did wonder why the others had sent her a different way to the car. Maybe they would come back for her once they had found a safe place to hide? Hopefully, before that killer found her.</em></p>

<p>Welcome to <em>Don't Look Back 2nd Edition</em>! We covered the original <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dont-look-back-core-game-review" rel="nofollow">Don't Look Back</a></em> box set a few years ago, and recently we covered the awesome <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/hametsu-core-rulebook-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Hametsu</em></a>, also by Black Site Studios.</p>



<p><i>Don't Look Back </i>is a horror miniatures tabletop game that can be played cooperatively against an AI-controlled killer, or with the latest edition, a player can take control of the killer and try to slay their friends. The 1st edition of the game released in 2021, which you can read our review of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dont-look-back-core-game-review" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and the 2nd edition update is essentially the same, but with a lot more content in the rulebook.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dont-look-back-2nd-ed-2.jpg?itok=iQw3udLo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dont-look-back-2nd-ed-2.jpg?itok=6zXylbO6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Don't Look Back</em> captures the horror genre superbly with its mechanics [Photo credit: Black Site Studio].</figcaption></figure><h2>What Is The Difference Between The Don't Look Back 1st and 2nd Edition Rulebooks?</h2>

<p>The core rules for <em>Don't Look Back</em> are the same as they were in the 1st edition, with a focus on the layout and presentation of the rules to make them as clear as possible. What the 2nd Edition <em>Don't Look Back</em> core rulebook now contains is a lot more options and background, which includes:</p>

<ul><li>2 new characters (on top of the 6 original 1st edition)</li>
	<li>Rules for randomly generating your own plots&nbsp;(in addition to the five classic&nbsp;core plots)</li>
	<li>Optional rules for vehicles&nbsp;and companions</li>
	<li>Trilogies - Originally a separate book, the new rulebook includes these rules for creating a series of 3 linked games</li>
	<li>Final Call - The 2nd edition core rulebook includes rules for creating your own character, playing as the killer, and also running the game as a games master</li>
	<li>Pack Hunt - It also includes the rules for including multiple killers, and hordes of enemies in your games</li>
	<li>Large background section - The book includes a lot of background, maps, and images on North Wood to help you flesh out your games</li>
	<li>Two complete trilogies - It also includes 2 complete sets of 3 linked adventures, Visions and Corporate Casualties</li>
</ul><figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dont-look-back-2nd-ed-3.jpg?itok=GXUeXIAb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dont-look-back-2nd-ed-3.jpg?itok=qW7VDYfS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Don't Look Back</em> 2nd Edition includes a whole host of pregenerated characters, but also the ability to create your own&nbsp;[Photo credit: Black Site Studio].</figcaption></figure><h2>How Do You Play Don't Look Back 2nd Edition?</h2>

<p>The core rules for <i>Don't Look Back</i> are very simple, which is essential for a narrative and theme-driven game as it allows you to focus on what's going on, rather than flipping back and forth through a rulebook, ruining the immersion.</p>

<p>With each turn in <em>Don't Look Back</em>, fright tokens are generated to represent noises, shadows, and eerie effects. The killer can randomly appear from fight tokens, or they might just generate terror for nearby characters. When characters gain terror points, they increase the movement and combat skill of the killer targeting that character, and also reduce a character's rolls, making it more difficult to achieve tasks. If a character ever has double the amount of terror points of their fright value, they are removed from the game, succumbing to panic.</p>

<p>During the game, players need to complete the scenario objective while avoiding the killer and controlling the terror points on their character. Players do this each turn by working together to search areas and removing fright tokens by investigating and shining light tokens on them. They can also lure the killer to an area to allow other characters the freedom to search with the 7 Minutes in Heaven action with another consenting character, in a true horror trope.</p>

<p>As with all miniatures games, you will need a few items on top of the <i>Don't Look Back</i> core rulebook to play:</p>

<ul><li>Three types of dice (D20s, D10s and D6s)</li>
	<li>A measuring tool</li>
	<li>A 3x3 playing area with an assortment of terrain</li>
	<li>A miniature to represent The Killer</li>
	<li>A hero/character miniature for each player</li>
</ul><p><em>Don't Look Back</em> is a miniatures agnostic system, which means you can use any miniatures from any system you want to represent the killer and characters, but <a href="https://blacksitestudio.com/en-gb/pages/dlb" rel="nofollow">Black Site Studios</a> have a whole range of killers (and their rules) and character miniatures, along with scenery that's perfect for the North Wood setting.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dont-look-back-2nd-ed-4.jpg?itok=ZsM24WHh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dont-look-back-2nd-ed-4.jpg?itok=OLz716zH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Black Site Studios have a multipart Killer miniature to create the enemy you want for<em> Don't Look Back</em>&nbsp;[Photo credit: Black Site Studio].</figcaption></figure><h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On Don't Look Back 2nd Edition?</h2>

<p>We loved <i>Don't Look Back </i>1st edition, it's simple rules let you explore the theme very well without distracting, allowing full immersion. The mechanics complimented the theme perfectly, and nothing has changed in this edition, other than giving you a huge amount of content in a single book. Everything that made <em>Don't Look Back</em> great is still there, only now there's more of it. The added scenario generator, character generator, and ability to play as the killer, or run it with a GM make this an incredibly varied system with a huge amount of replayability, built of a simple set of core mechanics that get it done.</p>

<h2>Should I Buy Don't Look Back 2nd Edition?</h2>

<p>Even if you own the first edition of <em>Don't Look Back</em>, this updated rulebook has a huge amount of content, all between the same covers to stop you from carrying multiple books around. It's all presented better, with a great opening chapter on the setting and the North Wood area. If you're not a horror fan though, then you won't find much else in <em>Don't Look Back</em> as it's entirely built around the theme.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideo-kojima-od-physint-strikes</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hideo-kojima-says-upcoming-projects-od-and-physint-heavily-impacted-by-strikes.1071807/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideo-kojima-od-physint-strikes<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Metal Gear&nbsp;</em>and <i>Death Stranding&nbsp;</i>creator Hideo Kojima has provided a year-end update on his upcoming projects, currently codenamed&nbsp;<em>OD&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Physint</em>, and it sounds like SAG strikes heavily impacted both games.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1873951232764895628" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post on social media platform X</a>, Kojima says that during 2024,&nbsp;his studio Kojima Productions "developed [<em>OD</em>] and had actor and environment scanning", but that during the second half of the year, "scanning and filming were suspended due to the SAG strike".</p>

<p>Of&nbsp;<em>Physint</em>, Kojima says that "casting was also suspended" for the game owing to the strike. It sounds like&nbsp;<em>Physint&nbsp;</em>is currently a lot earlier in development than&nbsp;<em>OD</em>, which makes sense given that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideo-kojima-announces-new-game-od-in-partnership-with-xbox-and-filmmaker-jordan-peele" rel="nofollow">the latter has an official trailer</a> (albeit a brief one) and the former <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideo-kojima-announces-next-generation-espionage-action-game" rel="nofollow">does not</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hideo-kojima-games-impacted-strikes-od.jpg?itok=DLlPabeQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hideo-kojima-games-impacted-strikes-od.jpg?itok=OptHfXK5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hideo Kojima's upcoming games&nbsp;<em>OD&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Physint&nbsp;</em>have been impacted by strikes this year.</figcaption></figure><p>In case you're not aware, Kojima is likely referring to the July SAG-AFTRA strike, which saw voice actors and mocap artists going on strike after negotations regarding generative AI protections broke down.</p>

<p>The strike is technically still ongoing; at time of writing, <a href="https://aftermath.site/sag-aftra-video-game-voice-actor-strike-the-game-awards-2024" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">no overarching agreement</a> has been reached, although a number of gaming companies have signed agreements with SAG in order to protect its members from generative AI exploitation.</p>

<p>Indeed, in Kojima's message, he says that he and his studio "hope to resume next year", which evidently means that the filming, capture, and casting processes haven't restarted for either&nbsp;<em>OD&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Physint</em>.</p>

<p>Kojima also recaps the rest of his year in the message, as well as providing an update on the upcoming live-action&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>film, which is being produced in conjunction with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-movie-a24" rel="nofollow">movie production company A24</a>. He says preparations for the movie, as well as "other adaptations", are underway.</p>

<p>Kojima's message also comes just under two months after the surprise Xbox release of the original&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding</em>, which also saw Kojima Productions <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-xbox-release-kojima-ip" rel="nofollow">acquiring the rights to the IP</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-tempestfall-delisted<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Carbon Studio has announced that its VR action-adventure game&nbsp;<em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar: Tempestfall&nbsp;</em>will be delisted across all digital storefronts starting from next month.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1337100/view/523078230806103089" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an announcement post on Steam</a>, Carbon says that it's delisting the game "as our license reaches its conclusion", and that it'll no longer be available on any storefront. That means you won't be able to buy it on Steam, Meta, or Viveport.</p>

<p><em>Tempestfall&nbsp;</em>will first be removed from Steam on January 10th, which is also when support for the game on that platform will be rescinded. Carbon says the timeline for delisting on Meta and Viveport is "still under review" and that an update will be provided "as soon as more information becomes available".</p>

<p>Carbon says it understands that news of&nbsp;<em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar: Tempestfall</em>'s delisting "may come as a disappointment". It sounds like the studio had no choice but to pull the game from stores since the license holders (likely Games Workshop in this case) were unwilling to renew said license.</p>

<p><em>Tempestfall&nbsp;</em>isn't the only game based on a major fantasy license being pulled from stores soon.&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance&nbsp;</em>is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dungeons-dragons-dark-alliance-delisted-february" rel="nofollow">also making its exit from digital storefronts</a> in February, although I imagine that's probably less sad news than&nbsp;<em>Tempestfall</em>'s demise for many.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dungeons-and-dragons-dark-alliance-delisting.jpg?itok=mNgC54Gi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dungeons-and-dragons-dark-alliance-delisting.jpg?itok=3kDBuy0g 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Tempestfall&nbsp;</em>isn't the only game being delisted soon.</figcaption></figure><p>These two games join the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/littlebigplanet-3-plus-dlc-delisted-halloween" rel="nofollow"><em>LittleBigPlanet 3</em></a>, racing game&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/forza-horizon-4-delisting-player-surge" rel="nofollow"><em>Forza Horizon 4</em></a>, and PlatinumGames' mobile action game&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/world-of-demons-delisted" rel="nofollow">World of Demons</a>&nbsp;</em>in the delisting vortex; it's no longer possible to buy any of these games on digital storefronts.</p>

<p>To combat games being delisted and support being removed from said games, digital storefront GOG recently launched its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gog-preservation-program-warcraft-delisting" rel="nofollow">Preservation Program</a>, which guarantees that any game belonging to the Program will be supported forever, regardless of whether its developers or publishers support it.</p>

<p>If you want to buy <i>Warhammer Age of Sigmar: Tempestfall&nbsp;</i>before it's delisted, you can do so via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1337100/Warhammer_Age_of_Sigmar_Tempestfall/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/pcvr/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-tempestfall/4617889574904734/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Meta</a>, or <a href="https://www.viveport.com/apps/8e1e49fc-e4df-4c3e-8387-df8cca8a8890?hl=en-US&amp;srsltid=AfmBOoq3HWS0qANSe2mG4MZJk1fg5WhBIm24ZN04WPak9As-Q9oUaIjK" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Viveport</a> right now. Be aware that you will need a VR headset to enjoy it, though.</p>
