            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions of survival game <em>Icarus </em>have been delayed, developer Grip Studios has announced, but don't worry; it's not a massive delay.</p><p>Back in January, it was announced that <em>Icarus </em>would come to current-gen consoles <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/icarus-ps5-xbox-series-xs-release-date" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="57045ece-8867-4771-8def-2bce853cb5ab" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">at the end of this month</a>, but now, Grip Studios has revealed that the game will be delayed until March 26th.</p><p>The reason for the delay is pretty much exactly what you'd expect; in a press release, Grip says it needs more time to "further refine the game's experience on consoles". The developers say they've identified "a few areas that need further refinement", so taking extra time to work on them is "the right decision".</p><figure role="group">

<p>In case you need a reminder, while <em>Icarus </em>was developed by Rocketwerkz on PC, console development and publishing will be handled by Grip Studios, whose name you might know from its support work on games like <em>Mafia: The Old Country </em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/indiana-jones-and-great-circle" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="09ba0fb1-40df-4991-9f55-2f16878ad8e2" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em></a>.</p><p>News of the delay of <em>Icarus</em>' console release comes a month or so after Dean Hall and Rocketwerkz announced that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/icarus-sales-1m-steam-winter-sale" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c279503c-13a7-4443-b2c6-79704af33562" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">the game's sales skyrocketed</a> during the most recent Steam winter sale, so we can expect that number to increase further once the console versions arrive.</p><p>If you're not familiar with <em>Icarus</em>, it's an open-world survival game in which you and your friends (or just you, if you're the solitary type) must descend onto a planet on which the terraforming process has gone wrong.</p><p>Once there, you can choose either to play in a sandbox-style open world or to complete individual missions, but either way, you'll be exploring your surroundings, building structures to help you stay alive, and hunting local wildlife for resources.</p>
<p><em>Icarus </em>now launches for <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10013354" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/icarus-console-edition/9P3H2PVZZPSD" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a> on March 26th. The game is currently available for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1149460/ICARUS/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC via Steam</a> as well.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
