            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-labs-announced-ea<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA and its "collective Battlefield Studios teams" have announced Battlefield Labs, a testing initiative that will allow certain&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>players to test out the new game and provide their feedback during development.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/battlefield/news/this-is-battlefield-labs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>website, EA describes Battlefield Labs as its "most ambitious community development collaboration ever". The initiative will give players the chance to provide their feedback in order to "validate the future of&nbsp;<em>Battlefield</em>".</p>

<p>So, what exactly will Battlefield Labs entail? Essentially, if you're approved for the program, you'll be testing various elements of the new&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>game, like core combat, environment destruction, and "balance and feedback" for features like weapons, gadgets, and vehicles.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-labs-announced-bf2042.jpg?itok=Gw27uiy4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-labs-announced-bf2042.jpg?itok=rV4k72SI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Battlefield Labs seems like an attempt to avoid another disastrous launch like that of&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 2042</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>EA also says that Battlefield Labs will include tests for the Conquest and Breakthrough gameplay modes, which it describes as "the heart and soul of our all-out warfare experience", as well as "pillars" of the franchise like its class system, which was controversially replaced with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/battlefield-2042-specialist-system-gamble" rel="nofollow">the Specialist system</a> in&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 2042</em>.</p>

<p>You can sign up for a chance to join the Battlefield Labs program <a href="https://electronicarts.queue-it.net/?c=electronicarts&amp;e=generalsite&amp;cid=en-US" rel="nofollow">right here</a>, but at time of writing, there are tens of thousands of users in the queue, so be prepared to wait a while before you get your opportunity.</p>

<p>Initially, only "a few thousand participants" will be invited to join Battlefield Labs in Europe and North America, but over time, "tens of thousands more" across "further territories" will get to try the game out.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that this doesn't constitute a full announcement of the new&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>game, although you can see a few seconds of gameplay in the video EA released as part of the Battlefield Labs announcement. You can check that out here.</p>




<p>It's likely that Battlefield Labs is part of EA's attempt to avoid repeating the disastrous launch of&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 2042</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-2042-bugs-other-issues-plague-launch" rel="nofollow">plagued with bugs and other problems</a> at launch, as well as missing features like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-2042-scoreboard-update-coming-in-february" rel="nofollow">scoreboards</a>.</p>

<p>The problems at launch were so bad that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/60000-battlefield-2042-players-want-their-money-back" rel="nofollow">a petition</a> to allow players to claim an unequivocal refund for the game reached <a href="https://www.change.org/p/sony-allow-refund-for-battlefield-2042-on-all-platforms" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">almost 234,000 signatures</a>, which is probably why EA wants to make sure the next game is ready for player scrutiny before it's released.</p>

<p>The seventh season of&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 2042</em>, which took place last year, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-2042-seasons-ending" rel="nofollow">served as the game's last</a>, and production on the next game ramped up around the same time. Four studios - Motive, DICE, Criterion, and Ripple Effect - are currently working on the game.</p>

<p>We don't know what the next <i>Battlefield&nbsp;</i>will be called yet, nor do we know when it'll release, but we do, at least, know it'll have been made with the participation of the community. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/esa-trump-tariffs-comments<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Entertainment Software Association (ESA), the gaming industry's major trade body in the US, has urged the Trump administration to "consult with the private sector" regarding incoming tariffs on foreign-imported goods.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/ethangach/status/1886390949091123378" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">statement</a> shared with Kotaku's Ethan Gach, the ESA says that tariffs on gaming hardware and products would "impact Americans of all ages" and that they could cause "significant harm to everyday Americans", as well as to the gaming industry itself.</p>

<p>The ESA goes on to urge Trump and his administration to "consult with the private sector in a transparent process" to avoid causing such harm to both Americans and "one of the fastest-growing entertainment sectors in the US".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/esa-trump-tariffs-comments-e3.jpg?itok=bxfJLpBX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/esa-trump-tariffs-comments-e3.jpg?itok=ICjfNyW7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The ESA is perhaps best-known by many for being the driving force behind E3 prior to its demise.</figcaption></figure><p>In case you're not aware, the tariffs to which the ESA is referring <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn93e12rypgo" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">were imposed</a> by President Trump this weekend, primarily targeting goods made in Mexico (although those particular tariffs have been <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china-sheinbaum-trudeau-017efa8c3343b8d2a9444f7e65356ae9?taid=67a0e79c4fe82f000101eeaa" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">paused for a month</a>), China, and Canada.</p>

<p>Specifically, Trump will impose a 25% tariff on Mexican- and Canadian-made goods, with a 10% tariff being slapped on Chinese-made products. This is, of course, a problem for companies that import their goods from those countries.</p>

<p>Many gaming consoles and peripherals are made in China, and as the BBC points out in the above-linked story, economists say that import hikes for companies are usually passed on to consumers in the form of increased prices.</p>

<p>This means that for a console as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-pro-announced-november" rel="nofollow">eye-wateringly expensive as the PS5 Pro</a>, for instance, you could expect to pay significantly more in future, which could in turn lead to fewer consoles and accessories being purchased on the whole.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ps5-pro-esa-trump-tariffs.jpg?itok=u2Cxpwh7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ps5-pro-esa-trump-tariffs.jpg?itok=9GgxKWv5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you think the PS5 Pro is expensive now...</figcaption></figure><p>It's also entirely possible that Trump's tariffs could affect the price of physical game media; as Mat Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x/post/3lgb3euyyik2e" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">points out</a> on Bluesky, a lot of physical production infrastructure is in Mexico, and so a 25% tariff could hike the prices of game disks.</p>

<p>Of course, that would also probably mean a price hike for digital games in order to ensure parity between the two media types.</p>

<p>It's impossible to predict exactly what's going to happen at this stage, but the ESA is spooked enough to call on Trump and his administration to discuss the matter further with the gaming sector. Whether they do or not is another matter entirely. Stay tuned for more.</p>
