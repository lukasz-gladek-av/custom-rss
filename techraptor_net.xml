            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Studio Wildcard has confirmed that you're not going to see upcoming survival sequel <em>Ark 2 </em>until 2028 at the earliest, and while this doesn't technically represent a delay, it's later than the studio's otherwise most recent assessment.</p><p>As revealed by Studio Wildcard co-founder Jeremy Stieglitz on the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/sci-fi-dino-taming-survival-game-ark-2-eyes-a-2028-release-with-a-little-or-a-lot-of-vin-diesel" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Epic Games Store</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/after-originally-being-revealed-in-2020-ark-2-has-been-delayed-again-until-2028/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">VGC</a>), <em>Ark 2 </em>is currently targeting a 2028 release. Presumably, that'll be an Early Access launch as well, which means it could be a number of years more before the full version is out there.</p><p>Back in <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/ark-2/interview-development-update" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">June</a>, Stieglitz and Studio Wildcard said that <em>Ark 2 </em>would "hopefully" be released "within the next two years", which would have put the release at June 2027 at the latest. Technically, then, this latest 2028 estimate could be said to be a delay of sorts.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>It's going to be a while before you can get your hands on <em>Ark 2</em>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Before <em>Ark 2</em>'s arrival, however, there will be an expansion for <em>Ark: Survival Ascended </em>by the name of <em>Legacy of Santiago</em>, and it'll introduce "a lot of the mechanics and features" intended for the sequel by way of a sort of test launch for Studio Wildcard.</p><p>There's plenty of other stuff planned for <em>Ark: Survival Ascended </em>throughout 2026 and 2027 as well, so if you're worried you'll be hurting for <em>Ark</em>-related content, you needn't be. You'll just have to wait a little longer for the full-blown sequel.</p><p><em>Ark 2 </em>was originally announced all the way back at <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/live-game-awards-2020-announcements-and-news" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a982241a-bdbb-4ed6-918b-2b5ee8272e07" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">2020's The Game Awards ceremony</a>. It was intended for release in 2023, but was subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ark-2-delayed-to-end-of-2024-ark-survival-ascended-remaster-announced" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="27a1bb9d-48a9-4dea-990b-fbb9e6982107" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">delayed to 2024</a>, although obviously, that rough release window didn't hold true in the end either.</p><p>When it does arrive, <em>Ark 2 </em>promises "the definitive next-gen survival experience", and it's got big names like Vin Diesel and Auliʻi Cravalho behind it, so this one'll be a more star-studded project than its predecessors, it seems.</p>
<p><em>Ark 2 </em>is currently slated for release in 2028, although given previous delays, that may not hold true for long. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bloober Team has announced that it's working on a brand new difficulty mode for survival horror game <em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em>, and it should make things easier if you've been struggling with some of the game's tougher challenges.</p><p>As revealed in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2101960/view/500593045099513471" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">news post on Steam</a>, the new Temporal Diver mode is intended for "those who prefer to enjoy the story without struggling with challenging encounters", so if you just want to soak up the narrative of <em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em>, this one's for you.</p><p>Don't worry, though; if you are a player who likes things more difficult, this will be an entirely optional, additional difficulty mode rather than a change to the existing gameplay, so you'll still be able to enjoy the experience as it currently stands as well.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Cronos: The New Dawn </em>is getting a new, easier difficulty mode next year.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Bloober Team hasn't explained exactly how the new difficulty mode will work, but we can make a few educated guesses; it'll probably reduce <em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em>'s focus on resource management and combat, although it likely won't remove those elements entirely.</p><p>In any case, the storied horror studio is promising more information "in the coming weeks", so we will learn more about what will change and what will stay the same in the Temporal Diver difficulty mode soon.</p><p>If you're not familiar with <em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em>, it's an original survival horror game by Bloober Team, perhaps best known for its work on last year's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-2-5m-worldwide" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b6940450-1468-41cf-8204-e4a2084d3f43" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">successful <em>Silent Hill 2 </em>remake</a>, as well as the likes of licensed spook-'em-up <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/blair-witch" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e47e5379-5686-451a-9164-1641ecae29eb" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Blair Witch</em></a><em> </em>and horror walking sim series <em>Layers of Fear</em>.</p><p>Unlike other Bloober Team offerings, this one's a full-blooded survival horror, complete with resource management-based gameplay and combat against gribblies, as well as the requisite mind-bending narrative element. You can check out the rather fun new trailer for its Temporal Diver difficulty mode here.</p>
<p><em>Cronos: The New Dawn </em>is available now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2101960/Cronos_The_New_Dawn/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/cronos-the-new-dawn/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/cronos-the-new-dawn/9p7tflq7ctxn" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/cronos-the-new-dawn-switch-2/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.
