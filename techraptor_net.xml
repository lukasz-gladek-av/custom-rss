            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-network-test-stats<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has revealed some fun statistics for the recent&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>network test, in which those lucky enough to be invited got a glimpse of what can be expected from the game's final release later this year.</p>

<p>Over <a href="https://x.com/BandaiNamcoUS/status/1905622167158432218" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on X</a>, Bandai Namco shared what it called its "Numbers from the Night", and it turns out that across the network test as a whole, players slaughtered the Gladius, Beast of Night boss 58,615 times. That's a lot of dead Nightlords.</p>

<p>Spectral Hawks, the ghostly birds used to ferry players across&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>'s map, were summoned 427,533 times across the network test, while 23.6 million recovery attacks were used to help downed players get back on their feet.</p>

<p>Almost 150,000 Flying Dragons of the Hills were killed, and almost 100,000 Royal Knights met their ends at the hands of enterprising warriors. If you think you're going to struggle in&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, let these numbers give you some solace.</p>

<p>On the other hand, almost 38 billion (!) runes were lost by players cumulatively over the course of&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>'s network test. I like to imagine that 37 billion of those were just one very, very unlucky player.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, it's an upcoming action RPG spinoff of FromSoftware and Bandai Namco's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-25-million" rel="nofollow">hugely successful</a> open-world Soulslike&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>, and it represents the developer's first major spinoff for one of its properties.</p>




<p><em>Nightreign</em>'s core gameplay loop sees you and two other players (or just you, but not you and one other) descending onto a map in order to loot it, kill its bosses for XP, and grow strong enough to battle the Nightlord at the end of a three-day period.</p>

<p>The game will feature not only enemies from&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>, but also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-dark-souls-enemies-confirmed" rel="nofollow">foes featured in FromSoftware's&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls&nbsp;</em>series</a>, including the likes of the first game's Centipede Demon,&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls 2</em>'s The Duke's Dear Freja, and&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls 3</em>'s The Nameless King.</p>

<p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>launches <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nighreign-release-date" rel="nofollow">on May 30th</a> on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2622380/ELDEN_RING_NIGHTREIGN/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/elden-ring-nightreign/9PJ22QNVCZ3G" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.
