            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Kinetic Games has announced a brand new&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>map in the form of Nell's Diner, and the long-awaited Grafton Farmhouse rework now has a release date too.</p>

<p>Per a press release, Nell's Diner will be arriving later this year. Described by the developer as a "run-down, retro restaurant", the new map will be roughly equivalent in size to&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia</em>'s houses. You'll be able to explore "a classic diner counter, comfy booths, and a kitchen" as you hunt whatever specter happens to be haunting the place.</p>

<p>We don't have a release date for Nell's Diner yet, but when it arrives, creative director Daniel Knight says the new map will be "one of the most unique" he and his team have created for the game.</p>

<p>Arriving on August 12th, the rework will apparently bring a "totally overhauled" Grafton Farmhouse in which you can expect to find "faulty electrics, caved-in ceilings and layers of dust" as well as an "eerie attic" and a "harrowing seamstress room". Sounds about right for&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia</em>.</p>

<p>Along with Nell's Diner, Knight says the new version of Grafton Farmhouse is "central to [the studio's] efforts in amplifying the horror in <em>Phasmophobia</em>", so if you're looking to experience the best the ghost-hunting horror game has to offer, it sounds like these new maps will be right up your street.</p>

Back in April, Kinetic announced that the game had managed to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-console-sales-3m" rel="nofollow">sell three million copies on consoles alone</a>&nbsp;after launching on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S last October.</p>

<p>Not only that, but there's also a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-movie-blumhouse" rel="nofollow">movie adaptation of the game</a> in the works at horror production studio Blumhouse, although details on that project are somewhat scarce at the moment.</p>

<p>We'll likely learn more in the coming months, but until then, you can check out&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/739630/Phasmophobia/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/phasmophobia/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/phasmophobia-game-preview/9N6D60SBZN05" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. The Grafton Farmhouse rework launches on August 12th, and Nell's Diner arrives later this year.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Direct Indie World Showcase Announced for Thursday]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-indie-world-august-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-direct-indie-world-showcase-announced-for-thursday.1262361/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced that a new Nintendo Direct Indie World show will be airing later this week, bringing new information about indie games heading to both of the Japanese gaming giant's currently-active platforms.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1952716473656385840" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on social media, the Indie World showcase will air on Thursday at 6am Pacific (that's 9am Eastern and around 2pm BST). It's set to bring "roughly 15 minutes of new announcements and updates" regarding indie games coming to Switch 2 and Switch.</p>

<p>The Indie World Direct follows <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">last week's Partner Showcase</a>, during which new projects from the likes of Bandai Namco, Square Enix, and Capcom were announced for Switch 2 and Switch (as well as other platforms).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-stories-3-nintendo-direct-indie-world.jpg?itok=VK437OZy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-stories-3-nintendo-direct-indie-world.jpg?itok=VRGuSIfM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Monster Hunter Stories 3&nbsp;</em>was just one of many games announced during last week's Partner Showcase.</figcaption></figure><p>So, what kind of games can we expect to see at this week's Indie World show? Nintendo is keeping its cards close to its chest, as is customary for the company, so we don't know exactly what we're going to get.</p>

<p>Of course, I'd be remiss if I didn't bring up the elephant (or perhaps that should be the bug) in the room. Could this show finally, blessedly deliver us from our wait when it comes to a&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>release date?</p>

<p>There's still reason to hope, even if&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>has been absent from many a show in recent months. The game is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-gamescom-demo" rel="nofollow">getting a demo at this year's Gamescom</a> (albeit at Xbox's booth), so a release date could well be just around the corner.</p>

<p>On the other hand, since Team Cherry does seem to have hitched its wagon to Xbox's procession, it's equally possible that we'll be left bereft once again. Still, hopefully, there will be plenty of other great indies to tide us over.</p>

Come on. Please.</figcaption></figure><p>Whatever the case may be, Nintendo's Indie World show will air this Thursday at 6am Pacific/9am Eastern/2pm BST. We'll bring you all the news and announcements from that show as they happen, so check back in with us then for more.</p>
