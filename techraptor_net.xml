            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-snap-self-published-skystone<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Marvel Snap&nbsp;</em>developer Second Dinner has announced that it will move "almost all" publishing responsibilities for the game in-house, with support from an external publisher.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1884400415925817429" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Second Dinner says that in order to ensure there's no repeat of the unplanned outage that saw the game go down for several hours earlier this month, "almost all operational and publishing responsibilities" will now be handled by Second Dinner itself.</p>

<p>The studio won't be going it alone, though; it'll be receiving support from US-based publisher <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/skystone" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Skystone Games</a>, whose name you might recognize from indie titles like&nbsp;<em>It Lurks Below</em>,&nbsp;<em>Spacelines from the Far Out</em>, and <i>Tyrant's Realm</i>.</p>

<p>Following that outage, which Second Dinner called "a surprise", the developer vowed to find a new publisher for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Snap&nbsp;</em>"in order to make sure this never happens again".</p>

<p>There's seemingly no animosity between Second Dinner and current publisher Nuverse, either. The developer says the transition is happening "with the help of" Nuverse, and that the switch is "a full-team effort between Second Dinner, Nuverse, Skystone, and Marvel".</p>

<p>It's unclear what the new publishing arrangement will mean for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Snap&nbsp;</em>itself, but for now, it's likely going to be business as usual; the game is available once again via mobile storefronts, and its servers are back online as well.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Marvel Snap</em>, it's a card battler in which you collect and battle cards themed around Marvel superheroes.</p>

<p>The game is available to play right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1997040/MARVEL_SNAP/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, as well as on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nvsgames.snap" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/marvel-snap/id1592081003" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">iOS</a>. Stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>Following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-mans-sky-worlds-part-i-update" rel="nofollow">the first part</a> of the Worlds update back in July, Worlds Part 2 introduces "stranger, more alien terrain" for you to explore, including "new mountains, deep valleys, and sprawling plains on untouched planets".</p>

<p>A new class of star has been added in this update in the form of Purple-class solar systems, which bring new worlds for you to discover along with a new story to unravel.</p>

That should give you something to do <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/subnautica-2-early-access-2025-co-op" rel="nofollow">while you wait for&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2</em></a>.</p>

<p>There's plenty more to discover in this update as well, from bigger features like new gas giant planets and new creatures through to smaller improvements like one-button inventory sorting.</p>

<p>You can read the full patch notes for the&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>Worlds Part 2 update <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/worlds-part-ii-update/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a> courtesy of the game's official website, and you can check out a trailer showing off some of the update's more significant new features below.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky</em>, it's an open-world survival-crafting game that takes place in an "infinite procedurally-generated universe".</p>

<p>The game got off to a rocky start when it was released in 2016, but after many updates, Hello Games has managed to shape&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>into something resembling the game its fans were originally promised.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/275850/No_Mans_Sky/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/no-mans-sky/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/no-mans-sky/BQVQTL3PCH05" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/no-mans-sky-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>, and the game is also available as part of a Game Pass subscription, but only if you sign up to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-price-hike-new-tier" rel="nofollow">certain tiers</a>.</p>
