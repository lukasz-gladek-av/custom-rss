            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-sales-800k<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em>has reached another big sales milestone, developer and publisher Level-5 has revealed, and there are more free gifts coming your way to celebrate.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/FANTASYLIFE_EN/status/1929463460858855881" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Level-5 announces that&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</em>has reached the 800,000 sales mark across all platforms, and that the game "might even hit a million copies by the end of June" as a result of "everyone's support".</p>

<p>The new milestone means that&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</em>has picked up <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-switch-2-500k-sales" rel="nofollow">another 300,000 sales for itself</a> in the last week or so. It's not hard to see how the game might reach a million sales by the end of June; in fact, I'd be surprised if it didn't achieve that figure much sooner.</p>

Your game has sold 800,000 copies.</figcaption></figure><p>Level-5 is also <a href="https://x.com/FANTASYLIFE_EN/status/1929485787814662537" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">giving away some new goodies</a> to celebrate 800,000 sales, so if you want some extra items to help you out on your adventure, make sure to put the new code into the Gift Code Entry window in-game.</p>

<p>As a quick reminder,&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em>isn't available on any kind of subscription service, so this isn't a&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/bethesda/status/1924921261253075244" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Doom</em>-style</a> "most players" boast; this is all sales. Hopefully, Level-5's latest goes on to even bigger and better things.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</em>, it's the followup to the 2014 (2012 in Japan) 3DS life sim-slash-RPG&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life</em>. Although it's a sequel, you won't need to have played the original to enjoy the new game.</p>

<p>Like its predecessor,&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</em>allows you to choose from a number of "lives", which are essentially jobs. They're not just combat-oriented, either; lives help you not only to fight monsters, but also to gather ingredients for crafting and then to turn those ingredients into helpful items for your adventure.</p>




<p>It's fair to say it's been a long road for&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i</em>; the game has been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-girl-who-steals-time-delayed" rel="nofollow">delayed</a> numerous <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-girl-who-steals-time-delayed-indefinitely" rel="nofollow">times</a>, and its original producer Keiji Inafune <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/keiji-inafune-level-5-departure" rel="nofollow">departed Level-5 in 2024</a>, leaving studio CEO Akihiko Hino to step up to the plate as&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i</em>'s new producer.</p>

<p><em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em>is available now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2993780/FANTASY_LIFE_i_The_Girl_Who_Steals_Time/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time/9pp7tdrdzghd" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/FANTASY-LIFE-i-The-Girl-Who-Steals-Time-2339978.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>. A Nintendo Switch 2 version is set to launch on June 5th.</p>
