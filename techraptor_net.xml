            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-steam-player-count<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>, the latest game in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>series of stealth action-adventure games, has launched to the franchise's highest Steam player count of all time.</p>

<p>As spotted by the folks at <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/assassins-creed/assassins-creed-shadows-sets-huge-franchise-record-with-growing-player-count-3168000/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Dexerto</a>,&nbsp;<em>Shadows</em>' peak player count on Steam <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3159330/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">hit 64,825</a> over the weekend. At time of writing, that's still the game's peak; 43,263 players are currently enjoying&nbsp;<em>Shadows</em>, which still isn't bad considering today is a Monday.</p>

<p>That figure puts&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>slightly ahead of Greek epic&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Odyssey</em>, which managed to achieve a peak player count of 62,069 around the time of its release. There's not much in it, but&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>is officially the series' biggest Steam launch.</p>

<p>Ubisoft's biggest Steam launch ever was the crunchy melee brawler&nbsp;<em>For Honor</em>, which achieved an impressive 225,831 peak player count in August 2018. It's followed by&nbsp;<em>Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege</em>'s peak of 201,933, with&nbsp;<em>The Division</em>'s 114,228 (a very satisfying number) putting it in a comfortable third.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>can't reach those lofty heights, its success will doubtless come as a relief to Ubisoft, given that the game hasn't exactly had an easy time of it in recent months.</p>

<p>Announced last year,&nbsp;<em>Shadows&nbsp;</em>was originally set to launch in November, but was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-february" rel="nofollow">subsequently delayed to February</a> as Ubisoft announced it would rethink some of its business practices (including releasing PC games on Steam on day one in future).</p>




<p>The game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-march" rel="nofollow">then delayed again</a>, with publisher Ubisoft <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing" rel="nofollow">closing down</a> three of its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-layoffs-leamington-closure" rel="nofollow">locations</a>&nbsp;and revealing its intention to pursue <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-financials-cost-cutting-q3" rel="nofollow">further cost-cutting measures</a> after a pretty dire third-quarter performance.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen whether&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>can single-handedly turn Ubisoft's fortunes around, but the game is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3159330/Assassins_Creed_Shadows/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/assassins-creed-shadows/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/assassins-creed-shadows" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.
