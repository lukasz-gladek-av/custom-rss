            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rare appears to have become caught up in Microsoft's round of layoffs today, and the developer's long-running project&nbsp;<em>Everwild&nbsp;</em>also seems to have been canceled, according to a new report.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sources-everwild-has-been-cancelled-as-xbox-layoffs-hit-rare/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">VGC</a>,&nbsp;<em>Everwild</em>, which hasn't been heard from in some time (barring a somewhat vague update from Xbox boss Phil Spencer earlier this year), has been shut down. Additionally, employees at Rare are "likely to lose their jobs" (that's VGC's wording, but the publication is citing "people with knowledge of the project").</p>

<p>It's all part of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" rel="nofollow">massive round of layoffs</a> at Microsoft that began earlier today, with&nbsp;<em>Candy Crush&nbsp;</em>studio King and Bethesda's parent company ZeniMax already affected by job cuts. Other studios, like Rare, were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-layoffs-next-week-report" rel="nofollow">widely expected</a> to enter Microsoft's crosshairs as part of these cuts.</p>

<p>The game was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-is-beautifully-serene-game-from-rare" rel="nofollow">announced all the way back in 2019</a>&nbsp;with a rather evocative trailer, albeit one that didn't show too much in the way of concrete gameplay.</p>

<p>That would turn out to be a consistent theme with&nbsp;<em>Everwild</em>; another trailer was shown <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-trailer-shown-at-xbox-games-event" rel="nofollow">during the Xbox event in July 2020</a>, and while it was certainly visually striking, it once again failed to show exactly what kind of game&nbsp;<em>Everwild&nbsp;</em>would be.</p>

<p>Between then and now, Xbox didn't say much about&nbsp;<em>Everwild&nbsp;</em>at all, but rumors swirled that the game's development had essentially been rebooted, suggesting that Rare and Xbox weren't entirely sure in which direction they wanted to take their latest project.</p>




<p>It's hard to say whether&nbsp;<em>Everwild&nbsp;</em>would have been granted more of a reprieve were these layoffs not being put into effect. Its lengthy, seemingly troubled development gives the impression of a game that nobody was quite sure about, so it may well have ended up falling by the wayside anyway.</p>

<p>In any case, with&nbsp;<em>Everwild&nbsp;</em>now dead, Rare doesn't have another publicly-announced project in the works. Xbox doesn't seem to be shuttering the studio (for now, at least; there's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown" rel="nofollow">certainly past form in this area</a>), so we'll just have to wait and see what happens next.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Granblue Fantasy: Relink Sales Top 2m Copies Worldwide]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/granblue-fantasy-relink-sales-2m</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Cygames has revealed that&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy: Relink&nbsp;</em>sales have hit another major milestone, around a year and a half after the game's initial release.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/881020/view/506206686159045888" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on Steam,&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy: Relink&nbsp;</em>has passed the two million sales mark, which means it's earned another million sales for itself since February last year.</p>

<p>That milestone was reached in around eleven days; it seems that sales have slowed pretty significantly since then, but two million is a very respectable number indeed for an action RPG based on what remains a relatively niche property.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/granblue-fantasy-relink-sales-2m-combat.jpg?itok=ZwZNWUZc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/granblue-fantasy-relink-sales-2m-combat.jpg?itok=uo-0beuh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Granblue Fantasy: Relink&nbsp;</em>sales are doing very well for themselves, thank you very much.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy: Relink</em>, it's a third-person action RPG based on the mobile gacha game&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy</em>. Taking place in a land known as the Sky Realm, the game casts you as "the captain of a skyfaring crew", with whom you'll embark on adventures galore.</p>

<p>The game has had a long road to release; it was first revealed back in 2016 as a collaboration with PlatinumGames, but by 2019, the&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Wonderful 101&nbsp;</em>studio was no longer involved with the project.</p>

<p>Following that, it would spend a few more years in development before being <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/granblue-fantasy-relink-gets-spectacular-new-trailer-release-in-2023-confirmed" rel="nofollow">slated for a 2023 release</a>, although it was subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gamescom-opening-night-live-here-are-all-trailers-news-reveals" rel="nofollow">delayed to February 2024</a>. Thankfully, that's a date the action RPG did manage to make.</p>

<p><em>Relink&nbsp;</em>isn't the only&nbsp;<em>Granblue&nbsp;</em>spinoff to grace PC and consoles, either. It's joined by the 2020 fighting game&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy Versus</em>&nbsp;and its 2023 sequel&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising</em>, both of which pit characters from the world of&nbsp;<em>Granblue&nbsp;</em>against one another in one-on-one bouts.</p>
