<p>Since the terms haven't been disclosed, we don't know what Sony and Tencent have agreed upon with regards to <em>Light of Motiram</em>, but we do know that the game is <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3319630/info/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">no longer listed</a> on Steam, which could point to an extensive rebrand being on the cards for the near future.</p><p>If you need a refresher, <em>Light of Motiram </em>was first announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/light-of-motiram-announced-tencent-horizon" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="de12962d-e208-46b1-aeaf-7d9dfc338831" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">back in November last year</a>, quickly attracting attention for its art style's similarities to Sony and Guerrilla Games' <em>Horizon </em>series.</p><p>These similarities were clearly subsequently brought to the attention of Sony itself, because the gaming giant <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-tencent-light-of-motiram-lawsuit" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="158b5a17-6308-4b2e-9131-b6559d6e961f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">filed a lawsuit</a> against Tencent in July, calling <em>Light of Motiram </em>a "slavish clone" of <em>Horizon </em>and alleging copyright infringement.</p><p>Although the Steam page for <em>Light of Motiram </em>has been killed, it's entirely possible Tencent will revive the project under a different name, although doing so will probably also require an extensive rework of the aesthetic (and potentially even the underlying gameplay mechanics).</p><figure role="group">
