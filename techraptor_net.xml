      <div><p>Go On Board's <em>Tekken: The Board Game</em> is a runaway success. The crowdfunding campaign for the tabletop adaptation of Bandai Namco's iconic fighting game has been topping the charts on the platform, reaching its funding goal in a short 35 minutes.</p>



<p>&nbsp;According to its campaign page, <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/projects/go-on-board/tekken-the-board-game#/section/project-story" rel="nofollow"><em>Tekken: The Board Game</em></a> is an asymmetric fighting game set in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/tekken-8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Tekken</em></a> universe. It is a game for one to eight players, and a single game can take between 20 and 60 minutes. This is the second high-profile board game adaptation Go On Board is hosting on the platform. The other is the fantasy board game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/witcher-legacy-board-game-brings-more-narrative-monster-hunting-to-table" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>The Witcher: Legacy</em></a>.</p>

You each choose a character that comes with its miniature and deck of cards. Each card represents different moves: attack, push, defend, etc..You choose one of three areas to attack: low, mid, or high. If your opponent can predict where your attack is coming from, they can block, or worse, counter-attack.</p>

<p>Much like any high-end fighting game match, a game of <em>Tekken: The Board Game</em> becomes one of psychology and resource management. String together combos. Bluff your opponent with your next move. Know the right time to activate Heat and Rage Mode. The game even has an environmental destruction mechanic, letting you deal extra damage to your opponent.</p>

<p>Lastly, for dedicated <em>Tekken</em> fans, this board game has highly detailed miniatures of the franchise's iconic characters. These miniatures are larger than normal miniatures, ranging between 57.4 mm and 60 mm. The campaign even includes an Exclusive Box for early adopters containing Devil Kazuya, Azazel, and the Coliseum of Fate, Elegant Palace, and Fallen Destiny arenas.</p>
