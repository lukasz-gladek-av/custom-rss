            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-15m-switch-2-first-year<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has revealed the number of Switch 2 consoles it expects to sell within the machine's first year on sale, and it's safe to say the Japanese gaming giant isn't underselling its newest hardware.</p>

<p>In the company's financial summary for the 2024-25 fiscal year, Nintendo reveals that it expects to shift a staggering 15 million Switch 2 units before April next year, which gives the console around nine months to achieve that figure.</p>

<p>Software-wise, Nintendo says it expects to sell around 45 million software units in that time as well. It's worth noting that this figure doesn't include original Switch games; Nintendo is expecting to sell a staggering 105 million of those before April.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-first-year-15m-docked.jpg?itok=ZbR9Ycrd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-first-year-15m-docked.jpg?itok=ndeuZnOP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nintendo is expecting to sell a heck of a lot of Switch 2 units.</figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo's prediction is in line with a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-20m-shipments-report" rel="nofollow">Bloomberg report</a> earlier this year, which stated that the company was preparing to ship "more than 20 million units" in the console's first year. That would give the Switch 2 an additional three months to reach the 20 million figure, which sounds about right.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, Nintendo also says it expects to sell about 4.5 million original Switch consoles this financial year. I suppose not everyone is going to flock to buy the newest machine, and there are still a few people left in the world who don't own a Switch.</p>

<p>Nintendo will no doubt be hoping that its predictions about the Switch 2 are correct, because sales aren't looking great. They're down 30% on last year, with profit falling 43% as well.</p>

<p>It is, of course, worth noting that the last twelve months haven't exactly seen a slew of high-profile first-party Nintendo releases to bolster sales, although&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Party Jamboree&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</i>have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-sales-nintendo-financials" rel="nofollow">certainly attempted to pull their weight</a> in this regard.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-switch-2-15m-units.jpg?itok=IHVDvREQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-switch-2-15m-units.jpg?itok=N-w02qgM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>wasn't able to save Nintendo from falling sales this year.</figcaption></figure><p>Since Nintendo is at the end of a console's life cycle, a drop in sales is also to be expected, and I'm sure the company isn't exactly quaking in its boots when the Switch 2's launch is just around the corner.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-masters-of-ceremony-warbond</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/helldivers-2-masters-of-ceremony-warbond-brings-new-regal-gear-next-week.1184214/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-masters-of-ceremony-warbond<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and developer Arrowhead Game Studios have announced a new&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Warbond, and it's bringing lots of new gear for you to kit out your Helldiver with next week.</p>

<p>Following on from Warbonds like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-borderline-justice-warbond" rel="nofollow">Borderline Justice</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-servants-of-freedom-warbond" rel="nofollow">Servants of Freedom</a>, Masters of Ceremony launches on May 15th on both PC and PlayStation 5, and it brings "all-new elite weaponry, capes, and armors", in Arrowhead's words.</p>

<p>The first new weapon up for grabs as part of Masters of Ceremony is a rifle known as the R-2 Amendment, which packs not only a 20-round magazine but also a close-quarters bayonet to make fighting easier if you're overwhelmed.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-masters-of-ceremony-warbond-sabre.jpg?itok=MuBlt8gN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-masters-of-ceremony-warbond-sabre.jpg?itok=BCxcr-ah 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A new&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Warbond is just around the corner.</figcaption></figure><p>A new melee weapon, the CQC-2 Sabre, is also being added. It is, according to Arrowhead, "a sabre hailing from an elegant time", and as you'd probably expect, it's great for carving up enemies in close quarters, although it won't serve you quite so well at range.</p>

<p>Also on the weapon front, the Masters of Ceremony Warbond brings the new G-142 Pyrotech Grenade, an explosive that will "spin and shower the surrounding area in sparks before ceremoniously exploding in a ball of flames".</p>

<p>The final weapon being added as part of this Warbond is the CQC-1 One True Flag, a patriotic symbol that also "doubles as a spear to drive home the values of [Super Earth's] glorious sovereignty".</p>

<p>Of course, the Warbond also packs in new armor and a new cape to accessorize with, allowing you to deck out your Helldiver for maximum fear factor when you're storming the battlefield.</p>




<p>Although work continues apace on&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>, creative director Johan Pilestedt is already thinking of new things. Back in January, he announced he <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-johan-pilestedt-sabbatical" rel="nofollow">would take a "sabbatical"</a> before returning to Arrowhead in order to work on the studio's next game.</p>

<p>Despite that,&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>isn't going away anytime soon; in April, a board game based on the shooter was <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/helldivers-2-board-game-fully-funded-in-12-minutes-on-gamefound" rel="nofollow">fully funded on crowdfunding site Gamefound</a> within just twelve minutes of going live.</p>

<p><em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>is available now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/helldivers-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and its Masters of Ceremony Warbond arrives on May 15th.

            <title><![CDATA[Yes, Palworld Is Changing Mechanics Because of the Nintendo Lawsuit]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-mechanics-changing-nintendo-lawsuit</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/yes-palworld-is-changing-mechanics-because-of-the-nintendo-lawsuit.1184211/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-mechanics-changing-nintendo-lawsuit<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>developer Pocketpair has revealed that recent changes to the game's mechanics are, indeed, due to the ongoing Nintendo lawsuit, and that more changes are incoming in the next update.</p>

<p>Speaking <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1920360001794945232" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on X</a>, Pocketpair says that just "as many have speculated", changes implemented in&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>'s 0.3.11 update, which was released in November, "were indeed a result of the ongoing litigation [from Nintendo]".</p>

<p>The changes in question revolve around&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>'s Pal-summoning mechanic, which used to be achieved through the use of a device known as the Pal Sphere, but is now instead done with a "static summon next to the player".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-nintendo-lawsuit-mechanics-smokie.jpg?itok=5Osk9DDr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-nintendo-lawsuit-mechanics-smokie.jpg?itok=ilvNV2Zl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Palworld</em>'s mechanics are changing because of a lawsuit brought by Nintendo, and more changes are coming.</figcaption></figure><p>Pocketpair acknowledges "frustration", both its own and that of its players, with regards to these changes. However, the studio says that not making the changes "would have led to an even greater deterioration of the gameplay experience".</p>

<p>The studio goes on to say that&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>'s upcoming 0.5.5 update will bring "yet another compromise". Specifically, you'll no longer glide using Pals; instead, you'll need a glider item in your inventory, although Pals "will still provide passive buffs to gliding".</p>

<p>Just like the first change, Pocketpair says it knows this alteration will be "disappointing", but that "these changes are necessary in order to prevent further disruptions to the development of&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>".</p>

<p>In case you need a reminder, the lawsuit in question was brought against Pocketpair by Nintendo <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-palworld-pocketpair-lawsuit" rel="nofollow">back in September last year</a>. The <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-lawsuit-patents-demands-nintendo" rel="nofollow">offending elements</a> of&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>appear to be specific gameplay mechanics that bear resemblance to&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>, including the aforementioned gliding and capture systems.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-nintendo-lawsuit-mechanics-gatling.jpg?itok=A4W4QDlR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-nintendo-lawsuit-mechanics-gatling.jpg?itok=w7sxUEkP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nintendo is gunning for&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>, at least in a legal sense.</figcaption></figure><p>Despite the ongoing lawsuit, development on&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>continues. The game recently received a major update allowing players to play with one another <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-crossplay-update-patch-notes" rel="nofollow">across different platforms</a>, and Pocketpair appears to be working on a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-dating-sim-announced-again" rel="nofollow">cursed-looking dating sim spinoff</a> that may or may not be real.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what happens as a result of this ongoing Nintendo-Pocketpair legal battle, but I'd be very surprised to see&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>to continue without more major changes.</p>
