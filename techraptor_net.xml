            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Dotemu has announced that its roguelite brawler&nbsp;<em>Absolum&nbsp;</em>has hit a big sales milestone in the first week of release.</p>

<p>Per a press announcement,&nbsp;<em>Absolum&nbsp;</em>sales have reached 200,000 since the game launched last week, which isn't too bad for Dotemu's "first original IP". The studio is best known for creating new titles in existing franchises like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-review-razor-sharp-retro-platformer" rel="nofollow"><em>Ninja Gaiden</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-slug-tactics-release-date" rel="nofollow"><em>Metal Slug</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/streets-of-rage-4" rel="nofollow"><em>Streets of Rage</em></a>.</p>

<p>Dotemu handled publishing duties for&nbsp;<em>Absolum</em>, but it was just one of three developers on the project, alongside fellow&nbsp;<em>Streets of Rage 4&nbsp;</em>studio Guard Crush Games and animation studio Supamonks, which handled "the entire art direction and animation" for the game.</p>

<p>The game takes place in the land of Talamh, where a scrappy band of rebels step up to battle the evil Sun King Azra, who has taken advantage of the panic caused by a "magical cataclysm caused by ambitious wizards".</p>

<p>Gameplay-wise, <i>Absolum&nbsp;</i>offers "a mix of rapid combo chains and spellcasting powers" for each of its four playable characters, as well as the "endless replayability" you'd expect from a roguelite.</p>

<p>Despite that, however, the game doesn't feature randomly-generated levels; instead,&nbsp;<em>Absolum</em>'s action plays out across "an array of hand-crafted stages", according to Dotemu, so if you prefer your roguelite level design bespoke, you've come to the right place.</p>




<p>You can tackle&nbsp;<em>Absolum</em>'s levels solo, or you can grab a friend to play through it with you in either local or online co-op, just like the beat-'em-up classics of old.</p>

<p><em>Absolum&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1904480/Absolum/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10014070" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/absolum-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>, and you can read our very own Andrew's preview of the game from back in August <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/absolum-features-gorgeous-story-and-flashy-combat-to-keep-you-coming-back-over-and" rel="nofollow">here</a> (as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/absolum-preview-very-promising-beat-em-up" rel="nofollow">Austin's preview here</a>).</p>
