            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Critical Role has announced an official videogame partnership. The multimedia company has announced it will be collaborating with AdHoc Studio on several upcoming videogame projects. One of them is an official Critical Role videogame.</p>

<h2>The AdHoc Studio Critical Role Videogame Announcement</h2>

<p>In an official press release, Critical Role's CEO Travis Willingham discussed the reasoning behind their collaboration with AdHoc Studio. According to Willingham, he was auditioning for a role in the studio's upcoming narrative-driven superhero workplace drama game, <em>Dispatch.&nbsp;</em>Afterwards, more in-depth talks happened, resulting in a partnership which includes official Critical Role videogame development.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dispatch-game-dialogue-screenshot.jpg?itok=8hZ74aQ7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dispatch-game-dialogue-screenshot.jpg?itok=zeL7O1ub 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><blockquote>
<p>"Just from looking over the audition and game materials, I knew there was something special about what AdHoc was creating and I immediately reached out,” said Willingham. “The design, tone, style and storytelling of DISPATCH jumped off the page, and I knew given the pedigree of the folks at AdHoc, this was a team we wanted to collaborate with. Critical Role is always looking to build with people who are innovating around new ways to deliver story, character and worldbuilding, and AdHoc fits that perfectly.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As part of this partnership, Critical Role will collaborate with AdHoc on future Dispatch brand development. This will include merchandise, tabletop gaming, and more. In addition, both AdHoc and Critical Role will help co-develop the first videogame set in Critical Role's fantasy setting of Exandria, showcasing AdHoc's design strengths in deep, player choice-driven storytelling.</p>

<p>AdHoc's pedigree in videogame narrative cannot be understated. The studio was founded by several veterans of Telltale Games, the studio responsible for their critically-acclaimed videogame adaptations of <em>The Walking Dead</em> and <em>The Wolf Among Us</em> set in the <em>Fables</em> universe.</p>

<p>Considering the voice cast of Dispatch includes two other key members of Critical Role, Matt Mercer and Laura Bailey, there is clear vested interest in AdHoc from a creative and design perspective.</p>

<p>A Critical Role videogame has been something the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-confirms-video-game-is-coming" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">has wanted to do</a> for a while. Given breadth of the world of Exandria, told throughout <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-concludes-campaign-3-with-epic-8-hour-finale-new-godly-exu-announced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">three major campaigns</a> and several spin-offs spanning ten years, there is plenty of material to pull from.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Vile: Exhumed Review - Dirty Computer]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/vile-exhumed-review-dirty-computer</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/vile-exhumed-review-dirty-computer.1248960/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>is an operating system sim in the mold of games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hypnospace-outlaw" rel="nofollow">Hypnospace Outlaw</a>&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Simulacra</em>, and it asks a simple question: What kind of secrets could the innocuous facade of a distinctly '90s-inspired Windows 2.0-style interface be hiding?</p>

<p>Structurally, solo developer Cara Cadaver's game has you trawling through the primitive menus and basic graphics of an old PC, searching for the truth behind the disappearance of adult film actress Candy Corpse.</p>

<p>Just like the OS itself, though,&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>is hiding a lot from you at the outset, and things are not as simple as that setup implies. If you want to find out what might have happened to Candy, you're going to have to put your digital detective hat on, and happily, it's worth doing so, even if you'll be left wanting more at the end.</p>

<h2><em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>Is a Very Convincing '90s PC Sim</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vile-exhumed-review-calculator.jpg?itok=VNaMJplg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vile-exhumed-review-calculator.jpg?itok=0QO1fPgO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Agh! My eyes! The numbers!</figcaption></figure><p>There's a refreshing lack of adornment to&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed</em>. As soon as you boot it up, you'll be faced with a simple login screen that asks you to enter a 4-digit PIN. There's no fluff, no introductory cutscene explaining who the key players in this story are, and no tutorials to be found either.</p>

<p>That works to its credit; since&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>doesn't mess around, you're free to "enjoy" its unsettling, eerily quiet atmosphere right from the get-go. The silence of the operating system is almost oppressive, broken only by the sound of clicking as you navigate clunky menus and positively atavistic-looking websites.</p>

<p>I never felt like Cadaver's game jumped the shark, either. Its PC simulation remained convincing until the very end, helped along by the eldritch glow of the CRT monitor filter overlaying the "action," so to speak.</p>

<p>If you don't have any nostalgia for old-school operating systems, then&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>might not be able to weave its strange magic for you, but I thoroughly enjoyed the matter-of-fact, no-nonsense style in which this ancient PC coughed up its secrets.</p>

<h2>You'll Find a Timely Story in&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vile-exhumed-review-forum.jpg?itok=mStteqII 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vile-exhumed-review-forum.jpg?itok=Sh7u5tPt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Vile: Exhumed</em>'s story doesn't pull its punches.</figcaption></figure><p>Those secrets are worth discovering, too. While&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>is nominally the story of Candy Corpse and her disappearance, there's more to discover inside this particular computer's memory, not least to whom it belongs and why you're digging through it.</p>

<p>Unlike the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Simulacra&nbsp;</em>or its <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/simulacra-2" rel="nofollow">slightly disappointing sequel</a>,&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>doesn't resort to cheap jump scares, nor does it descend into the valley of daft pseudo-supernatural horror.</p>

<p>The scares are much closer to home, and while I don't want to spoil anything, the Steam page does make clear mention of "themes of sexual content, violence, and abusive and harmful language," so you know what kind of realm we're in here.</p>

<p>Since you're free to explore the operating system in whatever order you choose,&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed</em>'s story will likely unfold in a non-linear fashion, and discovering what happened to Candy is just one part of filling in the wider picture.</p>

<p>Great horror is grounded in the real, and that's certainly the case with&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed</em>. If its story ever threatens to feel silly or outré, the fact that many of its themes still disappointingly resonate in the real world only add to the threat.</p>

<h2><em>Vile: Exhumed</em>'s Operating System Is Filled With Secrets</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vile-exhumed-review-password.jpg?itok=3LoXQWs9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vile-exhumed-review-password.jpg?itok=-iFvlUpR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Good luck working this one out.</figcaption></figure><p>Discovering the narrative feels chilling thanks to the plethora of secrets contained within&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed</em>'s operating system. Some applications will give up their secrets readily, while others require passwords or authentication to access.</p>

<p>You're left to discover many of these keys by yourself, although hints are frequently available. Making discoveries therefore feels like pulling off great detective work, evoking the quiet satisfaction of getting an old, irascible computer to do what you want in the process.</p>

<p>Some of those secrets can feel a little too esoteric for their own good, however. I never managed to work out what lurked behind the innocuous-seeming perfume website, for instance, and there are a couple of other head-scratchers that defeated me as well.</p>

<p>Still, if you're the type to pore over games hunting for every scrap of information, then&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>should give you a good couple of hours of entertainment. Unfortunately, however, that's all it's going to give you.</p>

<h2>Frankly, There's Just Not Enough of&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vile-exhumed-review-ffvr.jpg?itok=Jy1QxqQ9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vile-exhumed-review-ffvr.jpg?itok=ybKZ1h8m 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I wanted to spend more time in&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed</em>'s meticulously constructed operating system.</figcaption></figure><p>If I have a core criticism of&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed</em>, it's that there's just not enough of it. Just when things are starting to move along and adrenaline is starting to build, it's over. The ending is a pretty abrupt one, too, although it feels appropriate given what you're likely to have learned beforehand.</p>

<p>Discovering the story of Candy by digging through old websites and deducing passwords is a hugely enjoyable (if that's the right word) experience, so the fact that there's just so little of it is heartbreaking for me.</p>

<p>Cadaver has made it clear&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>is designed to be played in a single sitting, and there's no save function, nor does it allow you to continue playing after the credits. I sort of understand why from a narrative perspective, but I'd have loved the chance to continue spending time with this throwback machine.</p>

<p>Still, I will always prefer a game that leaves before its time to something that massively outstays its welcome. In being so shockingly brief,&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>avoids the pitfalls of puzzle games that keep going long after their best ideas are spent.</p>

<h2><em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vile-exhumed-review-vns.jpg?itok=K0T8_eCC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vile-exhumed-review-vns.jpg?itok=VCMzvbqH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>has plenty of "delights" to offer retro puzzle connoisseurs.</figcaption></figure><p>Cara Cadaver has crafted a very neat little puzzler in&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed</em>. On one level, it's a great simulation of a time before user-friendliness and "idiot-proof" operating system design, and on another, it's an unsettling tale of violence and abuse that may well stay with you (it certainly has with me).</p>

<p>I'd love to see what Cadaver can craft in a larger, more open-ended sandbox environment, but if you're looking for a (very) tightly-plotted experience that doesn't stick around after it's not welcome,&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>will provide.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora Update to Add New Game Plus and More in December]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-update-new-game-plus</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-update-to-add-new-game-plus-and-more-in-december.1248921/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has announced a new update for&nbsp;<em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</em>, and the studio has promised to add two of the features most requested by the game's community.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://x.com/AvatarFrontiers/status/1947325865982914631" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">social media post</a>, the update, which is due to arrive on December 5th, will add a New Game Plus mode to the first-person shooter, so you'll be able to tackle its story again with all of your equipment and skills intact.</p>

<p>New Game Plus will, however, also bring tougher enemies and a higher level of overall challenge, so you'll need to take advantage of the stronger gear and new skill tree offered by the mode in order to prevail.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-update-new-game-plus-mech.jpg?itok=MGTm52Cw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-update-new-game-plus-mech.jpg?itok=6VlH0YTK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora&nbsp;</em>is getting a big new update in December.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as the New Game Plus mode, you're also getting a third-person view option, allowing you to see your character as you explore the lush environments of Pandora. Honestly, I'm surprised there was no third-person view mode to start with, but better late than never, I guess.</p>

<p>According to Massive Entertainment, various gameplay systems in <i>Frontiers of Pandora&nbsp;</i>have been <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-update-brings-third-person-and-new-game-plus-modes" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reworked</a> in order to ensure a "seamless and intuitive" experience while playing in third-person, so it shouldn't just feel like a tacked-on extra.</p>

<p>If you're wondering why it's going to take so long for the update to arrive, it's probably because Ubisoft wants to time the release as close to the launch of the upcoming third&nbsp;<em>Avatar&nbsp;</em>movie as possible.</p>

<p>Additionally,&nbsp;<em>Frontiers of Pandora&nbsp;</em>was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-gets-gameplay-debut-and-december-7-release-date" rel="nofollow">released on December 7th back in 2023</a>, so while this update won't land exactly on the game's second anniversary, it'll be close enough to be considered a celebration anyway.</p>




<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2840770/Avatar_Frontiers_of_Pandora/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora/9N9QJG4S82B5" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and its New Game Plus update arrives on December 5th.
