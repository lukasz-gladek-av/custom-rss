The tabletop publisher's digital event was packed with new board game announcements and ongoing support for various beloved franchises. Here is everything they announced.</p>

<h2>The RenegadeCon 2025 Board Game Announcements</h2>

<p>During a Twitch livestream, Renegade Game Studios began RenegadeCon 2025 with new board game announcements. They were then collected into a <a href="https://renegadegamestudios.com/blog/renegade-con-february-2025-reveals-recap/" rel="nofollow">recap blog post</a> on their official site.</p>

A game where two to four players play as gigantic monsters as they terrorize the world and gain infamy. In addition, each player controls a Military faction dedicated to slowing down the monsters' rampage. Whoever has the most infamy wins. It is currently available for pre-order at an MSRP of $55. The game will be released in June.</p>

<p>The second RenegadeCon 2025 announcement is a new twist on an old classic. <em>Risk GI Joe: Special Missions</em> has players join either GI Joe or Cobra as they complete missions across a world map. There are multiple twists on the Risk formula here, including a focus on completing multiple objectives instead of world domination. <em>Risk GI Joe: Special Missions</em> is available for pre-order now at an MSRP of $70.</p>

<p>Third is a revised edition of the board game, <em>Sentient</em>. One to four players play as cutting-edge robotics companies. You'll compete against one another calibrating AI networks, and striking deals with investors, all to kick off the sentient robot revolution. This update to the 2017 original release includes a new solo mode and an updated game board. Sentient is available for pre-order at an MSRP of $40.</p>

Players must gather resources to feed, clothe, and shelter your growing number of settlers. <em>Skara Brae</em> is available for pre-order at an MSRP of $60.</p>

<p>Another Garphill Games project announced was <em>The Anarchy</em>. This Medieval-themed board game is set after the death of King Henry I with players in the role of nobles loyal to the swiftly inaugurated King Stephen de Blois. During this chaotic era, Players must build their domain, defend their castle from attack, and storm strongholds loyal to Empress Matilda.</p>

<p>Whoever proves they are the most brave and loyal to King Stephen wins the game. <em>The Anarchy</em> is available for pre-order at an MSRP of $65.</p>

<p>Of course, RenegadeCon 2025 wouldn't be complete without new material coming to World of Darkness.</p>
