            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingmakers-early-access-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher tinyBuild and developer Redemption Road have finally announced the&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>Early Access release date, although the game will be landing perhaps a little later than you might have expected.</p>

<p>As revealed in a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2109770/view/516336614597722796" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>,&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>will be launching on October 8th. Redemption Road acknowledges that some may have been "expecting it sooner", and that the game didn't make its previously-announced Q2 release window.</p>

<p>However, the studio says that "building a game where time-traveling mercs drop air strikes on medieval knights takes a hell of a lot of toiling", and that the aim is to give players "a game that hits hard and holds up", a goal for which the devs are currently "grinding".</p>

<p>The game quickly began accruing wishlists and followers on Steam, with publisher tinyBuild announcing last year that a&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingmakers-movie-announced" rel="nofollow">movie is in development</a>, despite the fact that the game didn't have anything approaching a release date at that point.</p>

<p>Following that announcement,&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingmakers-delayed-q1-2025" rel="nofollow">delayed to 2025 in December</a>, and while Redemption Road promised the game would arrive in the first quarter of the year, it was subsequently pushed back again to the second quarter (and then again to October).</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers</em>, Redemption Road describes it as an "epic action/strategy sandbox" in which you must "change the course of history and save the future" by traveling back in time with your "vast arsenal of modern weapons".</p>

<p>You'll switch between hitting the ground as a soldier equipped with modern military tools and issuing orders to your troops strategy-style, and you'll need to build fortifications to keep your troops safe as well.</p>

<p><em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>launches on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2109770/Kingmakers/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam Early Access</a> on October 8th. Stay tuned for more.</p>
