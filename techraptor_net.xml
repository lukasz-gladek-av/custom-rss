            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/spider-man-2-pc-port-bad-reviews<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Marvel's Spider-Man 2&nbsp;</em>has officially hit PC, and fans are flocking to Steam to express their dissatisfaction with what they see as an unsatisfactory port, citing extensive technical issues.</p>

<p>The game landed on Steam yesterday, and a quick look at its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2651280/Marvels_SpiderMan_2/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reviews on the platform</a> shows a Mixed rating across almost 2,000 reviews (at time of writing), which isn't a great look for a first-party Sony game that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-sales-pass-548-milion-units-marvels-spider-man-2-has-sold-10-million-copies" rel="nofollow">sold gangbusters</a> on PlayStation and serves as one of the company's flagship titles.</p>

<p>Common themes have emerged across the negative reviews, too. One user <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198047951793/recommended/2651280/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">says</a> that calling the port "rough" would be "an understatement", pointing to improperly-loaded features like lighting, extra-slow framerates, and regular freezes and stutters, which <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/RootyBlues/recommended/2651280/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">other users</a> have also <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199237301221/recommended/2651280/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">complained about</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvels-spider-man-2-pc-port-negative-reviews-city.jpg?itok=342RL_r5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvels-spider-man-2-pc-port-negative-reviews-city.jpg?itok=qq17ncnN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Marvel's Spider-Man 2&nbsp;</em>is picking up some bad reviews on PC.</figcaption></figure><p>For what it's worth, some reviewers are <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198276342581/recommended/2651280/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">saying</a> that they've been able to get the game running with relatively <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/GeneralKamo/recommended/2651280/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">few problems</a>, so it seems the crashes and bugs aren't affecting all players equally.</p>

<p>Still, though, enough players are complaining about technical issues with&nbsp;<em>Spider-Man 2</em>'s PC port that I'd imagine Sony will issue an emergency patch in the next few days to address some of the more common problems.</p>

<p>The timing of this issue is particularly unfortunate for Sony. Just a couple of days ago, the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-psn-account-requirement-incentives" rel="nofollow">walked back its PSN requirement</a> for certain PC single-player games, including&nbsp;<em>Spider-Man 2</em>, promising incentives for those games if you linked a PSN account.</p>

<p>It's a move that's bound to garner goodwill from the PC gaming community given just how <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-pc-playstation-backtrack" rel="nofollow">unpopular mandatory PSN accounts are</a> with those folks, but low-quality PC ports like this one apparently is will probably do a lot to erase that goodwill.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[MultiVersus Updates Will End After Season 5, Offline Mode Being Added]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-updates-ending-season-5-offline</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/multiversus-updates-will-end-after-season-5-offline-mode-being-added.1096983/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-updates-ending-season-5-offline<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Player First Games and Warner Bros. have announced that their crossover platform fighter&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus&nbsp;</em>won't be getting any more updates after its next season, and that an offline mode will be added as well.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://multiversus.com/en/news/multiversus-update" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the game's official website, Season 5 of&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus</em>, which begins on February 4th and runs until May 30th, will be the game's last. Following that, the two studios have <a href="https://x.com/multiversus/status/1885327981758865568" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">promised</a> that you'll be able to enjoy the game offline "for the foreseeable future".</p>

<p>Two new playable characters, Aquaman and Lola Bunny, will be added to&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus</em>' roster as part of Season 5, and Player First says you'll be able to obtain both characters "through gameplay", with Aquaman coming as part of the battle pass' first tear and Lola Bunny being offered as the game's daily login reward.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/multiversus-updates-ending-season-5-fight.jpg?itok=suYIAw3w 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/multiversus-updates-ending-season-5-fight.jpg?itok=4BXqARRH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Warner Bros.' platform fighter&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus&nbsp;</em>won't be getting any more updates after May.</figcaption></figure><p>As of today, you also can't buy anything in&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus&nbsp;</em>with real money, but you can still use any of the premium currency you've accumulated until the end of Season 5.</p>

<p>If you haven't played&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus&nbsp;</em>before, you won't be able to download it after Season 5, although you'll still be able to reinstall the game if you've played it and deleted it. Make sure that you check this one out before May 30th if you've got any interest in it whatsoever.</p>

<p>In an accompanying <a href="https://multiversus.com/en-gb/faq" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">FAQ</a>,&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus&nbsp;</em>developer Player First somewhat bafflingly dodges its own question regarding why the game's updates are ending, but a quick look at its Steam <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1818750/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">numbers</a> suggests that it's probably unsustainable to continue development with such a low player count.</p>

<p>This is a situation that will probably feel hauntingly familiar if you've been keeping up with Warner Bros.' other high-profile flop <i>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</i>. Just like&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus</em>, that game's updates <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-seasons-ending-in-january-offline-mode" rel="nofollow">also ended following its last season</a>, and an offline mode was added in that case as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warner-bros-suicide-squad-updates-ending-multiversus.jpg?itok=p4lbnaTi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warner-bros-suicide-squad-updates-ending-multiversus.jpg?itok=QV-dIR3m 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Warner Bros.' game&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&nbsp;</em>suffered a similar fate to&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Both&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad&nbsp;</em>were major failures for Warner Bros., with the former <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-flop-warner-bros-100m" rel="nofollow">costing the company $100 million</a> and the latter's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-kill-justice-leagues-sales-disappointed-hogwarts-legacy-is-big-win" rel="nofollow">disappointing sales</a> contributing to a $200 million writedown.</p>

<p>Warner Bros. Games also recently announced that its boss David Haddad, who's been with the company for over a decade, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warner-bros-games-david-haddad-stepping-down" rel="nofollow">will step down</a>. The aforementioned games' failures weren't given as a reason (and Haddad did also oversee a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-sales-30m" rel="nofollow">major success in&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-sales-30m" rel="nofollow">Hogwarts Legacy</a>&nbsp;</em>recently), but they certainly won't have helped his case.</p>

<p>You can still download&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus&nbsp;</em>on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1818750/MultiVersus/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/multiversus/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/multiversus/9ndkxxbl90gf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, so make sure to do so before May 30th if you want to play it offline in future.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dr. Disrespect's Former Studio Midnight Society Closes Down]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/midnight-society-shutdown-dr-disrespect</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dr-disrespects-former-studio-midnight-society-closes-down.1096905/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/midnight-society-shutdown-dr-disrespect<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Dr. Disrespect's former studio Midnight Society has announced that it's closing down, which presumably also means that work on first-person extraction shooter&nbsp;<em>Deadrop&nbsp;</em>will also come to an end.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/12am/status/1885061680398213160" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">notice</a> on X, Midnight Society says it's "closing its doors after three incredible years", which also means that its "amazing team of over 55 developers" are now looking for work. The studio says it's "actively seeking other game studios" to provide those employment opportunities.</p>

<p>Although Midnight Society doesn't explicitly say that&nbsp;<em>Deadrop&nbsp;</em>has been canceled, it's unlikely that work on the game will continue; that would require another studio to pick up the slack or for Midnight Society members to form a new outfit, and there's no indication that will happen, so it looks like the game is, er, dead.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/midnight-society-shutting-down-deadrop.jpg?itok=gtu-zY_A 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/midnight-society-shutting-down-deadrop.jpg?itok=esGyfraP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Deadrop&nbsp;</em>studio Midnight Society, which was founded in part by Dr. Disrespect, is closing down.</figcaption></figure><p>Midnight Society was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/drdisrespect-game-studio-midnight-society-announced" rel="nofollow">founded back in 2021</a>, with controversial YouTuber Dr. Disrespect serving as one of the founders of the studio, as well as its public face.</p>

<p>The studio's first project,&nbsp;<em>Deadrop</em>, was revealed under the codename&nbsp;<em>Project Moon</em>, and the studio said back in 2022 that it would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/drdisrepects-game-studio-wants-player-feedback-every-6-weeks" rel="nofollow">collect user feedback on a regular basis</a>, using it to shape the direction of the game.</p>

<p>In June, however, Dr. Disrespect <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dr-disrespect-fired-midnight-society-sexting-minor" rel="nofollow">was fired</a> from Midnight Society following allegations of sexual misconduct, which were apparently part of the reason for the content creator's lifetime Twitch ban in 2020.</p>

<p>His YouTube channel was also demonetized, although YouTube recently <a href="https://kotaku.com/drdisrespect-twitch-ban-minor-youtube-monetization-1851752083" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reversed that decision</a>, allowing Dr. Disrespect (real name Guy Beahm) to continue to make money through his channel.</p>




<p>Following Beahm's ousting from Midnight Society, the studio was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/midnight-society-deadrop-layoffs-dr-disrespect" rel="nofollow">hit by layoffs</a>&nbsp;back in September, with one of&nbsp;<em>Deadrop</em>'s Founders (essentially a major contributor to the studio rather than an actual founder) claiming that around 50% of the studio's workforce was let go. It looks like now we know why.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Killing Floor 3 Release Date Revealed for March]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/killing-floor-3-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/killing-floor-3-release-date-revealed-for-march.1096869/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/killing-floor-3-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Tripwire Interactive has announced the&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</em>release date, so get ready to start slaying some zeds come springtime.</p>

<p>Per a press release, the third installment in the studio's&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor&nbsp;</em>series will launch on March 25th across PC and current-gen consoles, and pre-orders are open now if you already know you're going to be playing this one on day one.</p>

<p>Several versions of the game will be available at launch, and pre-ordering any of them will net you a bonus that includes a weapon skin, a trinket, and a player card. Of course, you'll get a bunch of extra goodies if you order any of the non-standard editions as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/killing-floor-3-release-date-giant-zed.jpg?itok=aNSyQFki 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/killing-floor-3-release-date-giant-zed.jpg?itok=tlyplPpP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</em>launches in March.</figcaption></figure><p>If you pick&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</em>up at retail, you'll be able to get the Standard Edition in North America or the Day One Edition outside of that territory. The latter comes with the Flatline Tactical Bundle and a special skin pack, while the former either comes with the skin pack or the bundle (and costs a little less into the bargain).</p>

<p>As for digital editions, you will,óf course, be able to buy the game on its own, but you'll also be able to pick up the Deluxe and Elite Nightfall Editions, which pack in a bunch of extras and some Creds to go along with them.</p>

<p>If you want to check out <i>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</i>before it's released, you can still <a href="https://killingfloor3.com/#signup" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">gain access</a> to the game's closed beta, which runs from February 20th to 24th. You can check out the trailer below to learn more about that.</p>




<p>If you're wondering what&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</em>is, it's a multiplayer FPS that serves as the third installment in the&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor&nbsp;</em>franchise. It takes place 70 years after the events of the second game and once again sees you teaming up with your buddies to fight off waves of hostile "zeds" (read: zombies, but with qualifications).</p>

<p><em>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</em>is set to launch for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1430190/Killing_Floor_3/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/killing-floor-3/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/killing-floor-3/9pfzlckhc1vm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on March 25th.</p>
