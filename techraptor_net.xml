<h2>The AdeptiCon 2025 Preview Event Announcements</h2>

<p>In an official <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/or72z0uw/every-reveal-from-the-warhammer-preview-show-at-adepticon-2025/" rel="nofollow">Warhammer-Community post</a>, Games Workshop assembled everything announced during the AdeptiCon 2025 preview event. Those announcements covered both major tentpole franchises and various spin-offs.</p>

Yes, the Space Wolves are getting new miniatures, a dedicated army box, and their own codex. These new miniatures include new Wolf Guard units and the Blood Claws.</p>

<p>For those that have rejected Imperium dogma, the preview included a new look at several Chaos Space Marine chapters. Like the Emperor's Children, the World Eaters, Death Guard, and Thousand Sons are getting their own dedicated codices. More blood for the Blood God.</p>

<p>On the gameplay side of things, the AdeptiCon 2025 Preview event highlighted a new Chapter Approved Mission Deck. This deck will change Matched Play by introducing three new ways to play: Incursion (1000 points), Strike Force (2,000 points) and the new Asymmetrical War mode. As the name implies, Asymmetrical War features uneven deployment zones and differing primary objectives.</p>

The Typhon box ramps up the battle on Volkus, where the Adeptus Mechanicus must fend off a swarm of Tyranids. Yes, playable Tyranids are coming to Kill Team. The box even includes Tyranid-themed terrain.</p>

<p>In the land of the Mortal Realms, the AdeptiCon 2025 Preview event confirmed a new <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-spearhead-mode-introduced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Warhammer Age of Sigmar Spearhead</a> set. The set, Spearhead: Sand and Bone, brings the smaller, more streamlined Spearhead rules to the dark lands of Dolorum and the chilling deserts of Ossia. The set includes new twists, Battle Tactics, Objectives, rules for four new Spearhead armies, and terrain fitting a Realm of Death.</p>

<p>Those new Spearhead armies are the Cities of Sigmar's Fusil-Platoon, the Serephon Sunblood Prowlers, the Ossiarch Bonereapers Mortisan Elite, and the Ogor Mawtribes Scrapglutt.</p>

First is the introduction of the Grand Cathay army for the forces of Order. This East Asia-coded army will be getting an arcane journal and battalion box with 50 miniatures. Those miniatures will include 30 Jade Warriors, 10 Jade Lancers, two different artillery units, and the battalion's leader: A Shugengan Lord astride their Great Spirit Longma mount.</p>

<p>The preview extends into the forests of the old world. On the side of chaos are the forest-dwelling, corruption-spreading Beastmen Brayherds. They will be receiving an arcane journal and battlion box of their own. Their units include ferocious shamans, chieftains, Tuskgor Chariots. Challenging them on the side of Order are the Wood Elf Realms wit their own battalion box respectively.</p>

<p>This preview is but a glimpse of announcements and developments coming to Games Workshop's franchises in the future. Release dates and price points for these announced products are all pending.</p>
