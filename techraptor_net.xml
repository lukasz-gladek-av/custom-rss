After passing trials at an early age, I was then molded into the tool that now serves the Imperium at Inquisitor Halikarn's request. The others may have misgivings, but I never do. The Inquisitor points, and I obey. But this hive city? This miracle? Even I have my doubts. But if there's corruption, either way, I will find it and snuff it out.</i></p>

<p>We've been fans of Cubicle 7's <em>Warhammer</em> roleplaying games for a while, and you can read our review of the <em>Age of Sigmar&nbsp;Soulbound</em>&nbsp;starter set&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/age-of-sigmar-soulbound-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow">here</a>, the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplaying Game</em> starter set&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-fantasy-roleplay-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and the starter set for the other <em>Warhammer 40K</em> roleplaying system that they produce, <em>Wrath and Glory</em>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-40k-roleplay-wrath-and-glory-stater-set-review" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/imperium-maledictum-starter-set-2.jpg?itok=-2lkQ2H0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/imperium-maledictum-starter-set-2.jpg?itok=T8cp7KQO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Imperium Maledictum</em> Starter Set includes 2 books for the GM and a load of great reference sheets for the players, with background as well as rules.</figcaption></figure><h2>Corruption and Miracles</h2>

<p>Similar to Cubicle 7's <em>Warhammer</em> fantasy roleplaying systems, their sci-fi <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> (or <em>40K </em>for short) roleplaying systems also have 2 options, with different mechanics and styles. The <em>Wrath and Glory</em> system that we've looked at <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-40k-roleplay-wrath-and-glory-stater-set-review" rel="nofollow">here</a>&nbsp;uses 6-sided dice, similar to the tabletop wargaming system, and is much more combat-focused.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Imperium Maledictum</em> (which we are looking at here) uses a D100 system similar to that of the <em>WFRP </em>system that Cubicle 7 also produces and is much more focused on investigation and social encounters. Think of the split of systems between heroic systems using D6s (<em>Wrath and Glory</em> / <em>Soulbound</em>) and street-level using the D100 system (<em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay</em> and&nbsp;<em>Imperium Maledictum).</em></p>

<p>All of the previous starter sets we've covered recently have been out for a year or two, but the <em>Imperium Maledictum&nbsp;</em>starter set is brand new, released this month.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/imperium-maledictum-starter-set-5.jpg?itok=6sSfJeeg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/imperium-maledictum-starter-set-5.jpg?itok=OPryp0cl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>As well as thematic Inquisitorial seal for Inquisitor Halikarn, you get 2 awesome custom D10.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Tools Of The Ordo Hereticus</h2>

<p>Following the pattern of the other Cubicle 7 <em>Warhammer</em> roleplaying starter sets we've covered, <em>Imperium Maledictum</em> contains all the components for 6 players plus a Games Master to play through their first adventure and beyond. Each player gets a pre-generated character sheet, which we'll go into more detail about below, along with some quick reference sheets for all the rules they need to play.</p>

<p>The Games Master, who runs the adventure, gets 2 books, the&nbsp;Blazing Seraph, the core adventure and rules tutorial for <em>Imperium Maledictum,</em> and Rokarth: A Guide to the Hive, a sourcebook full of details background details for the hive, a giant city structure, and its inhabitants, from the ruling noble houses, merchant guilds ad the gangs that run the underhive.</p>

<p>It also contains some random encounter tables for the different levels of the hive that can be used to flesh out the introductory adventure or expand into a full campaign in Rokarth before picking up more&nbsp;<em>Imperium Maledictum </em>books.</p>

<p>The set also includes a custom set of dice, 2 10-sided dice, one with the 10s (10, 20, etc) and the other with 0 to 9 to show a number between 1 and 100 when rolled together. The dice have custom markings, and any 1s are represented by the InquisitoriaI I symbol. Out of all the custom dice in the 4 <em>Warhammer</em> starter sets, these are my favourite.</p>

<p>I say the same things in all my reviews of the Cubicle 7 <em>Warhammer</em>&nbsp;starter sets, that the Games Master needs to do some prep (which is standard for all GMs), but here if you're not a <em>Warhammer 40K</em> fan already it would be very helpful to read a little beyond the starter set books.</p>

<p>They do a great job of introducing the system and the hive, but a wider understanding of the setting would be beneficial, especially as this is aimed at the lower levels of society and is a lot more intrigue and investigation-based. Having a great understanding of that will make your games much more fun and vivid for your players.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/imperium-maledictum-starter-set-3.jpg?itok=wU0Nfb1Z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/imperium-maledictum-starter-set-3.jpg?itok=PRcbJE3w 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The box the&nbsp;<em>Imperium Maledictum</em> Starter Set comes in turns into a GM screen with a map of the sector. Some helpful charts for the GM would have really added to the set though.</figcaption></figure><h2>Those Who Serve The Imperium</h2>

<p>The<em>&nbsp;Imperium</em><em>&nbsp;Maledictum</em> starter set includes 6 pre-generated characters, and similarly to the other starter&nbsp;sets, each character comes with a fold-out sheet full of background details to flesh out the character beyond the stats. Also, similarly, it includes a great spread of characters to introduce players to the setting.</p>

<p>Players can choose from a zealot of the Imperial creed, armed with their faith and a chainsword, a covert infiltrator, an Imperial scribe, who's knowledge and data access usually proves more useful than any of the combat effectiveness of the other characters, a sanctioned psyker, a powerful magic user allowed by the Imperium, a mechanically augmented member of the cult of the machine god, who amusingly is the best healer for the fleshier members of the team, and an Imperial soldier.</p>

<p>Unlike in the <em>Wrath and Glory</em> starter set, where some characters can be at odds with the others, here, they are all entirely dedicated to Inquisitor&nbsp;Halikarn and share the same passion for the Imperium. They're all unique characters, so they don't always get along, but they're entirely joined up about their mission and reasons for working together.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/imperium-maledictum-starter-set-4.jpg?itok=ySApL6FP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/imperium-maledictum-starter-set-4.jpg?itok=sLrfbnXe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Imperium Maledictum</em> Starter Set incudes a great spread of characters from the setting, that all have their own character folio with some great depth.</figcaption></figure><h2>Not Only War In Warhammer 40K</h2>

<p>The <em>Imperium</em><em>&nbsp;Maledictum</em> system requires players to roll 2D10 to get a number between 1 and 100, needing to score under their skill to succeed. The GM can add or subtract to the character's skill, depending on how hard the test is. Success levels (SL) can then be used to work out how well you succeed (or fail), and the 10s number rolled is subtracted from the difficulty of the test. The number left is compared to a table to show how successful you have been.</p>

<p>There is also the opportunity to gain superiority during the adventure, which can be used to further boost your SL. This is gained by learning about the enemy, the battlefield, and each other, and the mechanic plays extremely well into the investigatory nature of the system and rewards players for doing social and research encounters rather than just blasting their way into and through situations.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Imperium Maledictum Starter Set Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>The <em>Imperium</em><em>&nbsp;Maledictum</em> starter set is a great introduction to the style and mechanics of the system, but not the setting as a whole, so if everyone is completely new to <em>Warhammer 40K</em>, some background reading is advised first. The focus on the other aspects, over bringing war to your enemies (which it still does well), is really brought out with the pre-generated characters, and the adventure takes players through that.</p>

<p>The components and design are of the quality standard I've come to expect from Cubicles 7's starter sets, and the range of characters and detail in the sheets is fantastic. I think that the only thing missing from the set is a small <em>Warhammer 40K</em> primer document for those new to the setting, but that detail can be found easily enough online. Otherwise, it's a fantastic product, with a great adventure and an awesome custom dice set.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nacon-connect-2025-announced</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nacon-connect-2025-announced-for-next-week.1119423/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nacon-connect-2025-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nacon has revealed the air date for its latest Nacon Connect presentation, which will feature information on some of the studio's previously-announced games as well as a few surprises.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out Nacon Connect 2025 next week; it's airing on March 6th at 10am Pacific (that's around 1pm Eastern and about 6pm GMT, in case you're wondering). Nacon is remaining cagey about exactly what's going to be announced during the showcase.</p>

<p>Back <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nacon-connect-2023" rel="nofollow">in 2023</a>, Nacon gave us a look at games like&nbsp;<em>RoboCop: Rogue City</em>,&nbsp;<em>Clash: Artifacts of Chaos</em>, and&nbsp;<em>The Lord of the Rings: Gollum&nbsp;</em>(the latter of which was not yet wreathed in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lord-of-rings-gollum-studio-reportedly-abandons-game-development" rel="nofollow">tragedy that would subsume its developer</a> after its release).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/robocop-rogue-city-nacon-connect.jpg?itok=G_ihziSU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/robocop-rogue-city-nacon-connect.jpg?itok=k5X4lYoi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>In 2023, Nacon showed off&nbsp;<em>RoboCop: Rogue City&nbsp;</em>as part of its Nacon Connect presentation.</figcaption></figure><p>The festivities <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/terminator-survivors-and-more-unveiled-at-nacon-connect" rel="nofollow">returned last year</a>, when Nacon revealed survival game&nbsp;<em>Terminator: Survivors</em>&nbsp;during Nacon Connect 2024, as well as showing off the likes of action RPG&nbsp;<em>Dragonkin: The Banished</em>,&nbsp;<em>GreedFall 2: The Dying World</em>, and racer&nbsp;<em>Test Drive Unlimited: Solar Crown</em>.</p>

<p>As for what could be coming in this year's showcase, the studio's upcoming slate still contains all four of the aforementioned games, all of which are yet to receive definitive release dates (although&nbsp;<em>GreedFall 2&nbsp;</em>is admittedly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/greedfall-2-early-access-roadmap" rel="nofollow">out now in Early Access</a>).</p>

<p>In fact,&nbsp;<em>Terminator: Survivors&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/terminator-survivors-early-access-release" rel="nofollow">delayed back in August last year</a>; it was originally slated for a 2024 release, but it was subsequently pushed back to 2025.</p>

<p>If I had to guess, I'd say we'll probably get a release date or a release window for&nbsp;<em>Terminator: Survivors</em>, and I'd be surprised if we didn't hear more about Rogue Factor's&nbsp;<em>Hell Is Us&nbsp;</em>and Midgar Studio's&nbsp;<em>Edge of Memories&nbsp;</em>as well.</p>




<p>Whatever's on the way - and whatever surprises Nacon has planned - will be revealed in full during the Nacon Connect 2025 presentation, which is set to air on March 6th. You'll be able to check it out via Nacon's YouTube channel.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/quantic-dream-unaffected-netease-layoffs</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/star-wars-eclipse-developer-quantic-dream-unaffected-by-netease-layoffs.1119366/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/quantic-dream-unaffected-netease-layoffs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Star Wars Eclipse&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Detroit: Become Human&nbsp;</em>developer Quantic Dream has confirmed that it is safe from layoffs and project cancellations put into effect recently across NetEase-funded studios.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/defondaumiere_quantic-dream-jobs-activity-7300062734602100737-dpnq/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message</a> on LinkedIn, Quantic Dream CEO&nbsp;Guillaume de Fondaumière says the studio is "unaffected" by the cuts, and that development on Quantic Dream's ongoing projects continues "at full pace", although he doesn't provide updates for specific projects (sorry,&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Eclipse&nbsp;</em>hopefuls).</p>

<p>The CEO says that his studio "remains committed to the strategy outlined by David [Cage] and [de Fondaumière] in 2019", when NetEase <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/quantic-dream-will-now-develop-for-all-platforms-after-netease-buys-minority-stake" rel="nofollow">first acquired a minority stake</a> in the studio. He says that NetEase's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/quantic-dream-acquired-by-netease" rel="nofollow">acquisition</a> of Quantic Dream in 2022 fit with the companies' "shared vision for the future".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/quantic-dream-netease-detroit-become-human.jpg?itok=l0h5DF9A 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/quantic-dream-netease-detroit-become-human.jpg?itok=AUNdZ3fu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Quantic Dream says it's safe from NetEase cuts and layoffs.</figcaption></figure><p>To close his post, de Fondaumière points to&nbsp;<em>Detroit: Become Human</em>, which reached 11 million sales last year, "demonstrating the lasting appeal and quality of [the studio's] titles".</p>

<p>He ends by saying that Quantic Dream's current projects are "progressing as planned" and that the studio is "fully committed to delivering and launching these innovative, high-quality titles in the future".</p>

<p>For context, studios funded by NetEase have been suffering layoffs and project cancellations, as well as outright closures, in recent months. Developers like BioWare vet Mac Walters' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/worlds-untold-netease-pause-shutdown" rel="nofollow">Worlds Untold</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Just Cause&nbsp;</em>creator Christofer Sundberg's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/liquid-swords-layoffs-just-cause-creator" rel="nofollow">Liquid Swords</a>&nbsp;have announced layoffs before even releasing their first games.</p>

<p>It's not just studios yet to release their games or underperforming studios, either. In a shock move, NetEase also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-studio-shockingly-closed-by-netease-laying-off-everyone" rel="nofollow">closed the Seattle studio</a> responsible for developing <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-40m" rel="nofollow">global hit</a>&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>, laying off the studio's entire staff contingent in the process.</p>

Some, like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/blood-of-dawnwalker-ex-witcher-devs" rel="nofollow">The Blood of Dawnwalker</a>&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/witcher-3-game-director-starts-rebel-wolves" rel="nofollow">Rebel Wolves</a>, say that they're also safe from NetEase's cuts, although for how long is another matter entirely.</p>

<p>As for what's next for Quantic Dream, the studio is currently working on narrative adventure&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Eclipse</em>, although the game doesn't even have a tentative release window yet. Stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>First up, it's the BMW Z4 3.0i '03, a convertible sports car that debuted back in 2002. You can see the competition version of this model in action at iconic racetracks like the legendary&nbsp;Nürburgring.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pathologic-3-quarantine-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Ice-Pick Lodge and publisher HypeTrain Digital have revealed the release date for upcoming not-quite-a-demo&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3: Quarantine</em>, a free-to-play prologue that will introduce the world of the game.</p>

<p>Revealed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pathologic-3-quarantine-2025-prelude-demo" rel="nofollow">back in December</a>,&nbsp;<em>Quarantine&nbsp;</em>will be arriving for PC via Steam on March 17th, giving what the two studios call "a chilling glimpse into the dark and immersive world of&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3</em>".</p>

<p><em>Pathologic 3: Quarantine&nbsp;</em>will tell the story of how Daniil Dankovsky, also known as the Bachelor, came to leave his "acclaimed lab" and kick off the events of&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3</em>&nbsp;proper.&nbsp;<em>Quarantine&nbsp;</em>will also introduce the core gameplay mechanics that will make up the basis of&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3</em>.</p>

That's a pretty tall order for a prologue demo.</p>

<p>You'll be able to examine and diagnose patients with the mysterious Sand Plague, but you'll also be prying into their personal lives to see what kind of unsavory secrets they're hiding.</p>

<p>As you play, you'll also be building Dankovsky's mental map of the world around him; the two studios say the Bachelor is a "sharp mind in search of the truth", and it's that very truth you'll have to uncover throughout&nbsp;<em>Quarantine</em>.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3</em>, it's the third game in the&nbsp;<em>Pathologic&nbsp;</em>series, although technically, it's actually sort of the first.</p>

<p>Announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pathologic-3-announced-2025" rel="nofollow">in October</a>,&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3&nbsp;</em>is actually an expanded and revised version of the long-awaited&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 2&nbsp;</em>Bachelor Route, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pathologic-2-bachelors-scenario-announced" rel="nofollow">intended as an expansion for the second game</a> but which appears to have taken on a life of its own, appropriately enough for&nbsp;<em>Pathologic</em>.</p>

<p>It gets more complicated, though, because&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 2&nbsp;</em>is sort of an expanded and reworked version of the original&nbsp;<em>Pathologic</em>. It's best to think of each game in the series as a reimagining of the first rather than a true sequel.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3&nbsp;</em>is due to arrive on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3199650/Pathologic_3/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> sometime this year. The free&nbsp;<em>Quarantine&nbsp;</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3389330/Pathologic_3_Quarantine/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">demo-slash-prologue</a> will be available on March 17th.</p>
