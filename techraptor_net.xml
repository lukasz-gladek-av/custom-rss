Even with its huge amount of replayability? You want more? Luckily, Leder Games have got you, with 2 expansions that add to the base <em>Arcs</em> game. In this article, we'll look at the huge box The Blighted Reach Expansion and the small card pack Leaders and Lore and see what they add to games.</p>

<p><em>Arcs</em> is a sci-fi strategy board game by Cole Wehrle and Leder Games, and you can read our review of it <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/arcs-review-fun-unbridled-space-chaos" rel="nofollow">here</a>, which is recommended before you read this review of the expansions.</p>



<p>The 2 <em>Arcs</em> expansions, The Blighted Reach and Leaders and Lore are supplementary expansions to the core <em>Arcs </em>game. One adds a new campaign element and the other supplements the Leaders and Lore add-on that was introduced in the base game. We look at both in detail below.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/arcs-the-blighted-reach-4.jpg?itok=_nV3xZ1L 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/arcs-the-blighted-reach-4.jpg?itok=oaDzzQ7A 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The <em>Arcs</em>&nbsp;The Blighted Reach box is huge, adding in more components than the core game, but having a box that can contain all of it.</figcaption></figure><h2>What Does The Arcs The Blighted Reach Expansion Add To Games?</h2>

<p><em>Arcs</em> The Blighted Reach Expansion adds a whole campaign to the&nbsp;<em>Arcs</em>&nbsp;base game and includes more components than the original box. The Blighted Reach box is also designed so that you can also store your base <em>Arcs</em> game inside, so everything is combined in a single place.</p>

<p>The Blighted Reach Expansion contains a 3 arc campaign, that starts with players selecting a character, known as a Fate to play. These are randomly drawn from the 8 available in the first act. Each fate has its own objective, and if you complete your objective, you can continue to play your fate in the next act (drawing 1 new fate to see if you wish to change). If you fail your objective, your current fate is discarded, and you draw 2 new ones. There are 24 fates in total, 8 in each of the 3 acts, so every game you play will offer a different combination of paths and objectives to seek.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/arcs-the-blighted-reach-2.jpg?itok=SJp-D8jQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/arcs-the-blighted-reach-2.jpg?itok=zRA5Q0hC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Each of the 24 fates in <em>Arcs</em>&nbsp;The Blighted Reach Expansion includes a fate card, and 3 acts worth of new content.</figcaption></figure><p>Each fate also has its own fate deck, which gives you cards, and also adds cards to the court deck, and other rules as the game progresses, this means that the fates that the other players are playing will also add elements to the game, impacting your own depending on their fates.</p>

<p>The whole campaign adds an overarching element of the Empire and an Imperial Council that does add a lot of rules and complexity to the base game. There are some extremely crazy abilities to unlock, and it can really shake the balance of the game. It also changes the game entirely from the base <em>Arcs</em> game, giving it much more of an unbalanced narrative element than a strategy game. It is a lot of fun, and exploring the different fates is extremely rewarding, but just because you like the base <em>Arcs</em> game, doesn't mean you will like this, and also some that didn't love the base game, will love this instead. It is highly recommended that you play the base game a few times before taking on the campaign, because the complexity added here is high, and not having a core understanding of the base rules will make you miss the joy of exploring The Blighted Reach</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/arcs-the-blighted-reach-3.jpg?itok=jEffnrhS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/arcs-the-blighted-reach-3.jpg?itok=6iDfoqKa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The <em>Arcs</em> Leaders and Lore Pack adds 8 new leaders and 14 new lore cards to those included in the base game.</figcaption></figure><h2>What Does The Arcs Leaders and Lore Pack Add To Games?</h2>

<p>The Arcs Leaders and Lore Pack adds a further 8 Leader and 14 Lore cards, to those already already available in the core <em>Arcs</em> game. The Leaders and Lore game mode adds a random element to games, stepping away from the core strategy of the base game, and sits nicely between the base game, and the Blighted Reach expansion. The leader card details the abilities and setup for that leader, and the lore card adds another unique ability.</p>

<p>The Leaders and Lore Packs adds more variety to those already included in the base game, improving replayability and adding in some great leader/lore combinations. It feels odd that a pack of 22 cards wasn't just added into the core game, or that the 22 leaders and lore cards weren't removed from the core game into a larger Leaders and Lore pack. It seems strange to include half in the core game with an extra purchase for the extra variety when it could all just be included together for a very minor 22-card price bump on the core game, or make it a completely separate purchase for those who want the asymmetrical abilities variety in <em>Arcs</em> gameplay.</p>

<h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On The Arcs Expansions?</h2>

<p>The Leaders and Lore Pack adds the same fun variety to games of <em>Arcs</em> that's already included in the cards in the base game, it just increases the number of options and randomness of drawing, thus increasing replayability. Between the 16 leaders and 28 lore cards, that's a lot of combinations. It feels very weird that it's split in half and either not all in an expansion, or all in the base game for such a low amount of cards. Leaders and Lore sits nicely between the base strategy of the core game, and the Blighted Reach Expansion, adding in variety, but not the complexity of the full campaign.</p>

<p>The Blighted Reach Expansion completely changes the <em>Arcs'</em> experience. It moves from a strategy game to a narrative experience, simply using the base game mechanics to move the story along. I love both games, but they are completely different, and may not be for everyone, especially as to get the full experience, you need to play through all 3 acts.</p>

<h2>Should I Buy The Arcs Expansions?</h2>

<p>If you liked <em>Arcs</em> with the Leaders and Lore experience from the core set, then the Leaders and Lore Pack adds more of that to keep things fresh.</p>

<p>If you want an incredible narrative experience, and enjoy the core mechanic of <em>Arcs</em>, then The Blighted Reach is a lot of fun, with a huge amount of replability. If you're looking for a balanced experience, focusing on the core strategy of <em>Arcs</em>, then the Blighted Reach isn't for you, as it just uses the mechanics to progress the narrative. That also works on the flipside, and if you didn't like <em>Arcs</em>, but want an enjoyable narrative experience, then you might love the Blighted Reach, where you didn't love the strategy of the base game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/arcs-review-fun-unbridled-space-chaos<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You're there. You're nearly there. Your push for power has nearly brought you glory. You hold the resources, and no one can stop you. But something changes. Something shifts and that material wealth will no longer see you at the peak of power. So you shift. You pivot. Your now worthless materials are pushed into production, and your vast fleet emerges into the stars. You burn the fuel you have stockpiled and you prepare to release hell on those that oppose you. The hand you were dealt has forced this, it is not what you sort when you first started, but fate has decreed you become a monster. Welcome to <em>Arcs</em>.</p>

<p><em>Arcs</em> is a sci-fi strategy board game by Cole Wehrle and Leder Games. Most will know their work from the popular <em>Root </em>and <em>Oath</em>&nbsp;board games. <em>Arcs</em> has seen the tabletop industry divided, is it complicated and random, or is this 2024's game of the year? In this review, we'll look at how to play, and how it feels to play.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/arcs-3.jpg?itok=U5BBXDZt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/arcs-3.jpg?itok=Iw48XPky 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Arcs</em> takes place on a galaxy map that cacn change with the set up cards each game.</figcaption></figure><h2>How Do You Play Arcs?</h2>

<p>You will see <em>Arcs</em> described as a trick-taking game and in essence, this means that players play cards with a suit and a value, and the card the first player plays, sets the standard for those played after. In <em>Arcs</em>, there are 4 types of cards, Administration, Aggression, Construction, and Mobilization. Each of those cards has values 1 through 7. The first player to play a card can play any of their choice. The suit of the card details the actions that they can take, and all cards also have a number of pips (the higher the card value, the fewer pips it has), which details the number of those actions they can do. A 4 pip aggression card means you can take any combination of 4 move, battle, or secure actions.</p>

<p>The actions players can take in <em>Arcs</em> see them doing a mixture of building cities and shipyards, building ships and hiring agents, moving ships to locations to build on, taxing cities they own, or control by having the most ships in an area for resources, or battle with your ships against enemy ships and cities. You can also secure cards, known as the court, where hired agents go onto. If you have the most agents there, you get the card and its ability, and you also capture any enemy agents on that card.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/arcs-4.jpg?itok=QKXJCU4I 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/arcs-4.jpg?itok=OZMbM43y 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Each of the 4 <em>Arcs </em>card suits dictate the type and number of actions you can take, the amibtion (if any) you can declare and the value that sets the standard if played by the first player.</figcaption></figure><p>The next player then has a choice when they play their card. They can play the same suit, but a higher value, known as surpassing, and they get actions equal to the number of pips on their card. They can play any card face down, known as copying, and take 1 action on the card that was already played. Or the player can play a card face up, and take one action from their card.</p>

<p>When the lead player plays their card, they can also declare an ambition, of which there are 5 to choose from, but they can only choose the one shown on the card they play. In each chapter, only 3 ambitions can be declared, and once declared, anyone can win them, not just the player who declared the ambition. The 5 ambitions are:</p>

<ul><li>Tycoon - won by having the most fuel and material</li>
	<li>Tyrant - won by having the most captives</li>
	<li>Warlord - won by having the most trophies</li>
	<li>Keeper - won by having the most relics</li>
	<li>Empath - won by having the most psionics</li>
</ul><figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/arcs-5.jpg?itok=9Ys-pcxz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/arcs-5.jpg?itok=vXpSGUY7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Arcs</em> guild cards can be scored with agents, but if another player scores them, they capture any agents you had on them.</figcaption></figure><h2>Is There A Lot Of Strategy In Arcs?</h2>

<p>The hand you draw each turn in<i> Arcs</i> sets the tone for your turn. Don't have a lot of aggression cards? You're not going to be doing a lot of Warlord or Tyanting. Even if you've been working towards that for the last few chapters, you're going to need to adapt each chapter based on the cards you draw. That might not be appealing to some players, I certainly found it frustrating as I built up my forces and focused the first few chapters on smashing as many of my opponent's ships and cities as possible in my first game, but the more you play <em>Arcs</em>, the more aware you become of the options you have. If you have a huge armada, it still stops your opponent from taxing their own cities and allows you to focus on other areas. If you have a huge amount of stockpiled resources, you can use them for bonus actions that turn, like moving and attacking, outside of the actions from the card you play to watch the galaxy burn.</p>

<p>The timing of declaring an ambition is also extremely strategic as it indicates what you're aiming for. You can only declare an ambition if you play the first card by holding the initiative during each turn in each chapter, and only 3 out of the 5 can be declared, which means that if you spend the entire chapter gaining relics, but the other players all declare 3 different ambitions, you won't score for having them this chapter. Declaring too early pushes other players to compete towards that ambition too, although it's usually pretty obvious what you're aiming for, knowing how and when to pivot your game is a huge part of the strategy.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/arcs-2.jpg?itok=ezfKJFnZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/arcs-2.jpg?itok=I5IlHR53 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Battles in <em>Arcs</em> take place using custom dice, with low risk low reward blue dice, high risk high reward red dice, and raid dice to capture resources.</figcaption></figure><h2>How Long Does A Game Of Arcs Take?</h2>

<p>The<i> Arcs'&nbsp;</i>box says 60-120 mins for a game, and that feels about right. Games are rarely super quick, but that's part of the charm. It's not about fast strategy, it's about the slow domination of an area of the game, and the ability to slowly win back other areas if required. You really want to consider your options as you play, and you need to give the other players a chance to do the same. Everything from the card you play to the actions and sequencing of those actions is key, and shouldn't be rushed.</p>

<p>One thing to note is that the setup is pretty fast. There's a deck of cards to shuffle for actions, the components for each player to collect, and the guild deck to shuffle and draw a couple of cards from. The most complex, which isn't that complex, is setting up the map. There are a few set-up card options for each player count, and this details which areas of the map aren't used, and where to set up your pieces. Once that's done, you're ready to go.</p>

<h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On Arcs?</h2>

<p>I was blown away by <em>Arcs</em> in my first game. I went at it as I usually do in my first play of almost any game, and led with violence over strategy, building up a mighty empire with which to empty the stars of my enemies in later turns. But the cards weren't to be, and I was forced to rethink, which was initially frustrating, why couldn't I play the game I wanted? But actually, no one was playing the game they wanted. Had I pushed forward aggressively, everyone else would have been forced to react and play my game, which they started preparing for, completely setting them off when I forcibly pivoted into gaining resources and using my fleet to protect myself. And it feels like that's what <em>Arcs</em> is about. There's a little bit of chaos with the random card draw, but you can absolutely ride that, and turn it into your strategy, as every other player will be, whilst trying to second-guess your strategy (it's not difficult when playing me, ships, all the ships) and either beat you to it, or offset it with their own.</p>

<h2>Should I Buy Arcs?</h2>

<p>I think <em>Arcs</em> is an awesome game, but is it for everyone? No, it's not. If you don't like longer games, then <em>Arcs</em> is definitely a slow and steady game. It's not a 4-hour slog, but it's at least a couple of hours. There are multiple paths to victory, but they're not all available to you, and the mercy of the card draws may upset some. If you've played&nbsp;Cole Wehrle's other games (<em>Root</em> and <em>Oath</em>), then you'll know what you're getting into and will probably love it. If you're not looking for deep strategy or especially reactive strategy, then this won't be for you. But if the above review sounds like something you and your group will enjoy, then it's definitely a game that gets better the more you play it, and a regular group will find a huge amount of replayability here.</p>
