            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p dir="ltr">With Daggerheart's release last year, and outings in the Age of Umbra by Critical Role and Colossus of the Drylands by Legends of Avantris, the latest Daggerheart adventure comes from New Zealand's Viva La Dirt League by way of Daggerheart Azarim.</p><p dir="ltr">Set in the world of Azerim, the setting of Viva's Adventures of Azerim D&amp;D series and their skit series Epic NPC Man, this four-part mini-series picks up an adventure with 'Baradun and the Dickheads' as they get lost in a cave system using the Beast Feast campaign setting of Daggerheart.</p><p dir="ltr">As the series is already running, TechRaptor had a chance to sit down with Viva La Dirt League GM Robert Hartley to talk Daggerheart, learning while playing, and how eating food and telling stories is just about the most human thing you can do.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How Daggerheart: Azarim Came To Be</h2><p dir="ltr">To begin, I was interested in hearing how the collaboration between Viva La Dirt League and Critical Role came about. As was expected of two busy production companies, this has been in the work for a long time. "We've all been fans of Critical Role for quite some time and aware of what they do as both a production company and also as content creators in general," Hartley began "I think it was about two years ago that contact first started so there was a lot of discussion for collaboration."</p><p dir="ltr">"Then Daggerheart started to come out [...] and I was really keen to try it out. For Halloween each year I do a different thing outside of D&amp;D for the Viva guys. [...] I had this idea that I wanted to do 'Honey, I shrunk the kinds' kind of thing where I shrunk their Tech Town characters and have them within the tech store. I decided I'm going to use the duality dice system [...] and so I used that without the classes of Daggerheart and I really loved it."</p><p dir="ltr">From there it wasn't a matter of 'if' but 'when' they'd play a larger game of Daggerheart. "Then [Critical Role] got in touch and said 'would you like to play Daggerheart?' and we said it was perfect timing."</p><picture>

  </picture><h2 dir="ltr">Beast Feast Puts Cooking In Your TTRPG</h2><p dir="ltr">The Campaign Frame that Daggerheart: Azerim is based on is Beast Feast. Here, there is a focus on food as players can harvest different components from killed creatures to make meals that restore their HP, Stress, and Armor.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr">"I thought it was an incredible idea of Darrington Press to include everything you would need to play in one book" - Robert Hartley</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">"I took a few options and said 'I'd be interested in running this, this, or this' and I pitched each [Campaign Frame] to them as the Campaign Frame is described, they've got a pitch page. Ultimately, we all decided it would be Beast Feast."</p><p dir="ltr">Hartley lamented that he feel like in D&amp;D and other TTRPG systems the downtime is often ignored or treated like filler so you don't quite get as many moments of characters around a campfire. With Beast Feast, Hartley was excited that these downtime moments were built into the gameplay. He did add that this Campaign Frame definitely wasn't for everyone as there was lifting to do on the DMs part making more systems for the cooking but that he was a huge fan of building these kinds of systems.</p><picture>

  </picture><p dir="ltr">Playing as Baradun and the Dickheads each of the party members already had a rapport with one another, as well as powerful Dungeons &amp; Dragons character sheets so it was Hartley's job to convert them to Daggerheart.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Moving A Character Over To Daggerheart</h2><p dir="ltr">Hartley explained that in porting over the characters, recreating them in a close likeness to their D&amp;D counterparts, it was easy for the majority of characters as they had comparable classes and abilities across the system, but for characters like Greg the Onion Farmer, it was a bit harder.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking positively of the experienc,e Hartley explained it was a good way for him to throw himself into the deep end of learning Daggerheart. Additionally, it allowed him to learn each of the characters in and out and then plan a story in a way to give each player a chance to show off their skills.</p><p dir="ltr">Hartley joked "Some people would see it as 'oh, they're forcing their GM to do all the work instead of porting their own characters over' but instead it gave me an insight."</p><p dir="ltr">"The hardest one was that in every game that I've ever played, that's trying to get Greg over. When I first started working with Viva and I was trying to introduce them to D&amp;D I already had the problem of going 'ok, I'm going to make from scratch a new Shopkeeper class'."</p><picture>

  </picture><p dir="ltr">From there, Hartley moved Greg to be an Artificer, but the complexity of the class didn't really match the vibes of the show, before Greg became a Cleric to focus on support. Now in Daggerheart, he was moved again to be a Seraph.</p><h2 dir="ltr">&nbsp;Learning Daggerheart Through Play</h2><p dir="ltr">An aspect I've enjoyed of Daggerheart: Azarim in the same way I enjoyed watching Legends of Avantris' Dust To Damnation is how as the game is going on the rules and mechanics are being introduced to the party with time to ask questions and understand rules.</p><p dir="ltr">"One of our unique selling points is that we are one of the more accessible actual plays. Over the years I used to get a little bit frustrated at just how long we'd played together with them still not knowing the basic rules, but one of the things that changed my mind is I started speaking to people at conventions and over and over again people said 'It's wonderful that I was able to get into D&amp;D and understand it because of the number of times you repeat the rules.'"</p><p dir="ltr">Hartley also highlighted that this repetition of the rules is also accessible for those who are new in the space that might feel worried about having to ask those 'basic' questions.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/daggerheart-azarim-book.jpg?itok=asEjNyDN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1919" height="1079">

  </picture><p dir="ltr">Hartley explained that before going into Daggerheart: Azarim he'd provided the players with some of the absolute basics like how the dice function, their abilities, etc but planned to be teaching the rest as they played giving the players and audience the space to learn how to play Daggerheart through the adventure.</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr">"I told them what they needed to know, and I told them what was optional to know, and I left it at that"</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">I did have to ask how Hartley felt when he had planned out a big adventure for these players and the first dice roll resulted in a combined 6 on the Duality Dice with a -1 modifier, and that the very next roll was a 1 and a 2 with fear, the lowest/worst Daggerheart roll you can pull off.</p><p dir="ltr">"I joked with Ben, who has the worst dice rolls. I said 'Hey man, one of the great things about Daggerheart is that there's no way to Critical Fail' [...] and he goes 'I'll find a way.'"</p><h2 dir="ltr">TTRPGs And Food</h2><p dir="ltr">Talking so much about TTRPGs and the cooking and sharing of food I was interested to learn from Hartley what his favorite snacks and food to bring to the table are. While they don't snack at the Viva table, when playing at home "there's usually bags of chips, chocolate straws, lots of biscuits, and bags of [gummy candy]. We have a rule at our game that the first person to ask 'what are we eating' needs to be in charge of picking."</p><p dir="ltr">One interesting twist at Hartley's table is that as the food is set to arrive he'll like to navigate his players to a situation where they're eating in the game as well as in real life. "As you've entered this nobles domain he invites you in to join him at the table 'please, come in, I've got some hors d'oeuvres laid out…"</p><picture>

  </picture><p dir="ltr">Talking deeper on the very human aspect of telling stories and sharing food Hartley also added "Storytelling is at it's heart a fundamental human thing. It's something we've been doing longer than anything else and it's why we have civilization. Other animals can communicate 'danger coming' but humans are the only ones who can communicate complex ideas to a point where we can pass down learning. Just as fundamental is sharing food as a social species. We're not all capable of hunting or gathering the food so we evolved to share the food with one another.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">You can check out Hartley, Baradun, and the Dickheads in Daggerheart: Azerim. Episodes are first releasing on Beacon, then on Viva+ a week later, and finally on Viva La Dirt League's TTRPG YouTube channel where the first episode is available now.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
