            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Post-apocalyptic MMO shooter&nbsp;<em>Pioner </em>now has an Early Access release date, so get ready to head into GFA Games' Soviet-inspired open world next month.</p>

<p>As revealed in a press release,&nbsp;<em>Pioner&nbsp;</em>will arrive on PC via Steam Early Access on December 16th, and if you're a fan of games like GSC Game World's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-update-17" rel="nofollow"><em>Stalker&nbsp;</em>series</a>, Platypus'&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/misery-steam-return" rel="nofollow"><em>Misery</em></a>, and the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chernobylite-2-exclusion-zone-announced" rel="nofollow"><em>Chernobylite&nbsp;</em>titles</a>, you might want to check this one out.</p>

<p><em>Pioner&nbsp;</em>(and yes, as far as I can tell, that's an intentional spelling rather than a typo) takes place in an "alternate reality inspired by the Soviet era" and aims to tell a story "deeply influenced by classic science fiction", so I guess you can throw&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/atomfall" rel="nofollow">Atomfall</a>&nbsp;</em>into the mix here as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pioner-release-date-warehouse.jpg?itok=do-Z5YKZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pioner-release-date-warehouse.jpg?itok=GsrRq1ao 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pioner&nbsp;</em>looks like one for fans of&nbsp;<em>Stalker&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Chernobylite</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Since it's an MMO shooter,&nbsp;<em>Pioner&nbsp;</em>will feature both PvE and PvP gameplay; you can choose to take part in a "story-driven campaign" complete with "rich lore and engaging quests", but if you'd rather just dunk on your fellow players, "intense" PvP play will be available too.</p>

<p>The progression in&nbsp;<em>Pioner&nbsp;</em>is tied to influence; if you want to get better items from merchants and improve your abilities outside of combat, you'll need to increase your influence by completing quests, exploring the world, and killing monsters.</p>

<p>As well as the core gameplay,&nbsp;<em>Pioner&nbsp;</em>will also offer a host of diversions including a fishing minigame and a "unique tactical card mini-game" by the name of Carnage, which sounds like it'll suck you in if you're a fan of&nbsp;Gwent or Queen's Blood.</p>

<p>You can check out the new release date trailer for&nbsp;<em>Pioner</em>, which also gives a sense of what kind of world awaits you should you decide to take the plunge, right here.</p>




<p><em>Pioner&nbsp;</em>arrives on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3105890/PIONER/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on December 16th. Stay tuned for more.</p>
