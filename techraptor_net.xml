            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>11 bit studios has announced a&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>modding competition, and the top prize is a hefty wad of cash, but even if you don't win that, there are other goodies up for grabs.</p>

<p>As revealed on the official&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1601580/view/498325386812199405" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">page</a>, the modding contest will see modders using the&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-2-modding-tool-at-launch" rel="nofollow">modding tools</a>&nbsp;in order to create something that will impress and delight the 11 bit judges. The top prize is a $10,000 cash payout, which ain't too shabby.</p>

<p>Even if you don't nab the top prize, though, there are several other areas you might win in. Other contest categories include Best City Mechanics, Best Frostland Mechanics, Best Graphics, and Best Politics, and the best mod in each of these areas will win a custom AMD Radeon RX 7700 graphics card.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/frostpunk-2-modding-contest-areas.jpg?itok=KZ7Nztlm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/frostpunk-2-modding-contest-areas.jpg?itok=B26iDu7Z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Frostpunk 2</em>'s modding contest wants you to make an unforgettable mod.</figcaption></figure><p>Even if you do happen to win in one of those other categories, you'll still be eligible for the Best Overall Mod category as well, so it's entirely possible that one mod will win two or even three prizes at once.</p>

<p>Three mods will also be the recipients of the contest's Honorable Mentions, which will net those modders an 11-bit "goodie pack", although 11 bit doesn't say what will be contained within those packs.</p>

<p>In terms of rules, you must submit your&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>mod to mod.io, although you can also upload it to the Steam Workshop if you like. You'll need to use the #fp2modcontest hashtag, too. You can check out the full rules for the contest, as well as info on how to enter, <a href="https://mod.io/g/frostpunk2/r/fp2-mod-contest-terms-conditions" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>.</p>




<p>11 bit says it doesn't matter if you've already uploaded your mod; any mod is eligible, as long as it's uploaded to mod.io, it can run with the current version of&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2</em>, and it doesn't contain "harassment, sexual/erotic, or otherwise inappropriate content".</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the world of&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2</em>, 11 bit revealed back in February that the game will be coming to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-2-console-summer-roadmap" rel="nofollow">sometime this summer</a>, although we still don't have a release date for those versions yet, unfortunately.</p>

<p>For now,&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>is available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1601580/Frostpunk_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, and it's also part of PC Game Pass. The modding contest is open right now, and it runs until August 22nd, with the winners being announced by the start of September.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/plan-b-terraform-10-release-date</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Gaddy Games has announced the release date for the 1.0 version of terraforming sim&nbsp;<em>Plan B: Terraform</em>, and it's coming pretty soon.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Plan B: Terraform&nbsp;</em>1.0 will be launching on August 29th, by which point the game will have been in Early Access for around two and a half years. That's pretty significantly over and above the originally-intended 1.0 release date of "early 2024", but hey, these things happen.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Plan B: Terraform</em>, Gaddy Games describes it as a "planetary-scale terraforming and resource management game" which, when it hits 1.0, will deliver a "meditative sci-fi simulation, grounded in real climate science and sustainable systems".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/plan-b-terraform-1.0-release-date-overview.jpg?itok=Ogsj-3RB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/plan-b-terraform-1.0-release-date-overview.jpg?itok=E_ZlCSOr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Plan B: Terraform&nbsp;</em>is hitting 1.0 late next month.</figcaption></figure><p>While the Early Access period might have gone on a little longer than Gaddy Games originally intended, that time has been used to implement "continuous evolution", according to the studio.</p>

<p>Features added during Early Access include "overhauled levels and objectives, new transportation systems...and key improvements to the UI and terrain". In short, if you haven't checked this one out since it launched a couple of years ago, you may well find a very different game if you play it now.</p>

<p>As you might expect from a terraforming game,&nbsp;<em>Plan B: Terraform&nbsp;</em>has plenty of realistic environmental simulations for you to enjoy. These include a "dynamically simulated water cycle", a "scientifically grounded climate simulation", and extensive resource gathering systems as well.</p>

<p>It's all wrapped up in a world that contains "over a million hexagons", according to Gaddy Games, and on those hexagons, you'll build settlements that will grow into thriving metropolises. You'd better believe managing the infrastructure for those cities is on the cards as well.</p>




<p><em>Plan B: Terraform&nbsp;</em>launches in full on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1894430/Plan_B_Terraform/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> on August 29th, where it's also currently available via Early Access. If you're a fan of meditative sims like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/planet-crafter" rel="nofollow">The Planet Crafter</a>&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/astroneer" rel="nofollow"><em>Astroneer</em></a>, you'll probably get a kick out of this one, but don't take my word for it; there's a free demo available on Steam right now!</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/magic-inn-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cute-wizard-innkeeper-sim-magic-inn-launches-this-august.1242981/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Magic Inn</em>, a "charming tavern life simulator" from developer and publisher Purpledoor Studios, is officially launching next month, the studio has revealed.</p>

<p>The game was originally slated for release <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2468630/view/538842113820852740" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">in April</a>&nbsp;(which itself constitutes a delay from the originally intended release date), but was subsequently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2468630/view/497193144876532222" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pushed back</a> to the second quarter of 2025. Now, however, Purpledoor Studios is ready to reveal the official release date: August 4th.</p>

<p>As the name suggests,&nbsp;<em>Magic Inn&nbsp;</em>lets you run your very own tavern, but with a twist: you play an "exiled wizard-turned-innkeeper", and your duties involve not only ensuring everything runs smoothly, but also learning and casting the right spells to help you do so.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-inn-release-date-cooking.jpg?itok=lkBs-Bg8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-inn-release-date-cooking.jpg?itok=PKYjkqdm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Magic Inn&nbsp;</em>is a cute life sim with a magical twist.</figcaption></figure><p>After being exiled from your home, you must take on the running of the titular magic inn and gradually build it up into a true 5-star resort. To do so, you'll need to hire great staff, create unforgettable recipes, and befriend the locals in order to secure goods.</p>

<p>You'll have to manage not only the inn itself, but also its individual staff members and rooms, ensuring that everything is up to code, as it were. Purpledoor says even the King himself might visit, and if he does, you'll need to be sure he finds only perfection.</p>

<p><em>Magic Inn&nbsp;</em>will also feature a rather intriguing-looking card battling system that represents the game's conversations; everything from negotiation through to persuasion and even attraction is handled through "conversation-driving card battles", as Purpledoor puts it.</p>

<p>Of course, the card battling system also includes...well, combat. You can send out parties of adventurers to do battle with monsters and gather loot, which you can then use to craft new tools and improve your inn further.</p>

<p>You can wishlist&nbsp;<em>Magic Inn</em> on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2468630/Magic_Inn/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>, and you can also check out a demo for the game if you're on the fence.</p>
