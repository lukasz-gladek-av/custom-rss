            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Sega and developer Two Point Studios have announced&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Finds</em>, the first major DLC expansion for museum management sim&nbsp;<em>Two Point Museum</em>, and it's heading your way next month.</p>

<p>As revealed in <a href="https://community.twopointcounty.com/two-point-studios/two-point-museum/blogs/89-two-point-museum-fantasy-finds-coming-17th-july" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Two Point Museum&nbsp;</em>site,&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Finds&nbsp;</em>will launch on July 17th across all platforms on which the game is currently available, and it'll bring a ton of extra stuff for you to enjoy, all of it fantasy-themed.</p>

<p>First off, you can look forward to 40 new exhibits "with magical properties to hypnotize guests with", and that's not necessarily a figure of speech, either. You'd better watch your guests around some of the more esoteric oddments.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/two-point-museum-dlc-fantasy-finds-gnomes.jpg?itok=47nUXFxD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/two-point-museum-dlc-fantasy-finds-gnomes.jpg?itok=rYpSmJPY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Two Point Museum</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Finds&nbsp;</em>DLC has weird stuff galore for you to check out.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as the new exhibits,&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Finds&nbsp;</em>will also introduce a new Expert type, a new map to explore, and plenty of "exclusive decorations, items, and utility items" for you to fill your museum up with.</p>

<p>More interactive displays will also be introduced in the DLC, as well as a new helicopter paint job and three new guest archetypes for you to keep happy. You'd better make sure they don't get hypnotized!</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Two Point Museum</em>, it's a management sim, and you'll never guess what you get to manage. That's right: your very own aquarium. The clue's in the name, I guess.</p>

<p>Released <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/two-point-museum-release-date" rel="nofollow">back in March</a>, Two Point Studios' latest lets you manage a museum, oversee its exhibits, and try to keep its guests happy, all while acquiring your own artifacts and trying to thwart the efforts of enterprising thieves.</p>




<p>The game is the latest management sim from Two Point Studios, who, as the name suggests, can also count <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/check-into-two-point-hospital-on-august-30" rel="nofollow">2018's&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/check-into-two-point-hospital-on-august-30" rel="nofollow">Two Point Hospital</a>&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/two-point-campus-release-date-revealed" rel="nofollow">2022's&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/two-point-campus-release-date-revealed" rel="nofollow">Two Point Campus</a>&nbsp;</em>as feathers in their cap.</p>

<p><em>Two Point Museum</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Finds&nbsp;</em>DLC launches across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3592600/Two_Point_Museum_Fantasy_Finds/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on July 17th, and the base game is currently available on all of those platforms as well.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/legendary-writer-chris-avellone-teams-up-with-ex-quantic-dream-dev-for-mature-rpg.1229082/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Chris Avellone, a legendary industry writer who's worked on the likes of&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Fallout: New Vegas</em>, has joined <em>Detroit: Become Human</em>&nbsp;writer Adam Williams' Republic Games for a "mature" fantasy RPG.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/chris-avellone-joins-former-quantic-dreams-writer-at-republic-games-to-work-on-ambitious-project-inspired-by-golden-age-of-rpgs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>, Avellone has been added to Williams' team, and while his position in the company is unclear, it's likely that he'll be working as a writer on the project.</p>

<p>Avellone himself says he's the one who asked Williams to join Republic Games; he says that he loves both the "design principles" and the "narrative construction" Williams is building for the project, and that being on the "ground floor" of the game is "amazing".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/knights-of-the-old-republic-ii-chris-avellone.jpg?itok=-8Huog4T 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/knights-of-the-old-republic-ii-chris-avellone.jpg?itok=BsGBYDi9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Chris Avellone's industry credits include&nbsp;<em>Knights of the Old Republic II</em>, among other games.</figcaption></figure><p>Williams says that Republic Games' first title will be an RPG with a "rich, interesting story", and that it'll feature "lots of meaningful choices, branches, and endings".</p>

<p>The game will revolve around "a totalitarian regime seeking to crush a rebellion", and there will be "competing factions" the player can join. You'll have the "freedom to create the hero - or antihero - [you] want to be", according to Williams.</p>

<p>He goes on to say that the game will feature a "deep undercurrent of prophecy and the supernatural", and that it'll also revolve around "full, classic RPG gameplay" that will incorporate "combat, character creation, recruitable companions, romances, and more".</p>

<p>The goal with the as-yet-unnamed game, Williams says, is to "combine that 'golden-age-of-RPGs' design with next-level interactive storytelling". It all sounds pretty ambitious.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/detroit-become-human-adam-williams-quantic-dream.jpg?itok=2bE6Ph32 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/detroit-become-human-adam-williams-quantic-dream.jpg?itok=FKk5jwtD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Adam Williams has worked as a writer on Quantic Dream's&nbsp;<em>Detroit: Become Human</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Avellone's journey in recent years has been a rocky one. In 2020, multiple women <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chris-avellone-removed-from-games-over-assault-allegations" rel="nofollow">accused him of sexual assault</a>, and although he was later cleared of the allegations, his name hasn't popped up on many major releases since those claims were leveled at him.</p>

<p>For now, Republic Games' ambitious-sounding RPG remains unannounced. Hopefully, we'll get a full reveal in the coming months. Stay tuned for more.</p>
