            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Board game publisher Kosmos has announced a new game coming in 2026. That game, titled <em>Perfect Murder</em>, is a competitive experience about detectives, serial killers, and murder.</p><h2>The <em>Perfect Murder</em> Board Game Announcement</h2><p>Kosmos announced the <em>Perfect Murder</em> board game through an official <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DRcfdgnjSMV/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Instagram post</a>. The post showed an image of the game's box, and a release date of 2026.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The text in the post, written in both German and English, does contain extra information. It is a competitive, two-player experience. One player is the murderer; the other player is the detective. The murderer must perform the perfect crime, leaving false trails and red herrings along the way. The detective must uncover the truth and bring the killer to justice.</p><p>The last part of the post provides some insight into the nature of the core gameplay. The section states the following:</p><blockquote><p>With nine suspects, twelve weapons, and eight rooms, a new case unfolds every time. Bluffing, deduction, and clever deduction make each game a thrilling adventure.</p></blockquote><p>In context, it appears the <em>Perfect Murder</em> board game may be a more asymmetric experience. The presence of multiple suspects, weapons, and rooms implies that the game may be a more involved version of the iconic board game Clue, one where another player tries to stump the other with a convoluted murder plan. This would parse with the social elements of bluffing, deception, and critical thinking at the end.</p><p>Kosmos is known for modestly budgeted, small box experiences. Their work includes the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/exit-theft-on-mississippi-review" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Exit</em></a> series, which is a collection of escape room challenges, the <em>Masters of Crime</em> series, the personalized city builder, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/my-city-review" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>My City</em></a>, and even board game adaptations of management games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cities-skylines-board-game-announced-by-kosmos" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Cities Skylines</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/anno-1800-board-game-coming-in-fall-2020" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Anno 1800</em>.</a> With this in mind, there's a high chance a copy of Perfect Murder won't break the bank.</p><p>As for when this competitive game of killers and detectives will hit store shelves, we will need time to gather more clues.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
