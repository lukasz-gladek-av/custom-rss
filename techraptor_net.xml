            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-pocketpair-monster-hunter-wilds-day-off<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>developer Pocketpair has announced that it's giving most of its staff the day off on Friday, and while a concrete reason isn't stated, it's almost certainly because that's the day on which&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>comes out.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/palworld-developer-pocketpair-gives-employees-special-holiday-that-just-so-happens-to-coincide-with-monster-hunter-wilds-release/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Automaton Media</a>, a notice on the Japanese Pocketpair X account states that the studio's bosses have been receiving "mysterious" messages from staff, who claim they'll be "unwell tomorrow".</p>

<p>Pocketpair then says that because it's expecting a large volume of employees to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-release-date" rel="nofollow">call in mysteriously sick on Friday</a>, it's decided to give the majority of its staff the day off. However, the studio also says that updates for&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>and <i>Craftopia</i>&nbsp;will be unaffected by this holiday.</p>

<p>It looks like Pocketpair isn't the only one that wants to play&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, either. The game's first open beta, which took place in November, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-steam-records" rel="nofollow">broke Steam records</a> for the franchise, and that's including fully-released games.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, it's the latest game in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>series of, er, monster-hunting action RPGs.</p>

<p>Taking place in the dusty Forbidden Lands, the game features a greater emphasis on storytelling, as well as the classic epic struggles with giant monsters you've come to know and love from the series.</p>




<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>for yourself when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/monster-hunter-wilds/9NMT6XFN0LVD" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on February 28th (i.e. tomorrow).</p>

<p>If you want to prepare yourself for the game, you can take a look at its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-global-release-timings" rel="nofollow">global release timings here</a>, and make sure to read <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/monster-hunter-wilds-review-new-frontier" rel="nofollow">our own Tyler's review</a> to find out what he thought of&nbsp;<em>Wilds</em>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/4a-games-reburn-la-quimera</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metro-dev-4a-games-rebrands-to-reburn-and-reveals-brand-new-pc-fps.1120545/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/4a-games-reburn-la-quimera<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Metro&nbsp;</em>series developer 4A Games has announced that it's changing its name, and that its next project will be a narrative-led first-person shooter based on an entirely original IP.</p>

<p>Per a press release, 4A Games' new name is Reburn, and it's currently hard at work on&nbsp;<em>La Quimera</em>, a game the studio describes as an "action-packed first-person shoter with a heavy focus on narrative, world design, and characters".</p>

<p>Unlike the&nbsp;<em>Metro&nbsp;</em>series' oppressive subterranean tunnels,&nbsp;<em>La Quimera&nbsp;</em>will take place in "a fictional Latin American megalopolis" and will revolve around a "down-on-their-luck PMC outfit".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/4a-games-reburn-la-quimera-aiming.jpg?itok=1KNYrj3i 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/4a-games-reburn-la-quimera-aiming.jpg?itok=ALSsfXh4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>La Quimera&nbsp;</em>is the next project from Reburn (formerly known as 4A Games).</figcaption></figure><p>Rather impressively, Reburn says it's working with filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn for the "world and narrative" of&nbsp;<em>La Quimera</em>. Refn is best known for movies like&nbsp;<em>Drive&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Neon Demon</em>, as well as 2008's prison drama&nbsp;<em>Bronson</em>.</p>

<p>The studio promises that the game's world will combine "Latin American folklore with highly advanced weaponry and technology", which, I suppose, is where the title comes from.</p>

<p>You'll be able to play&nbsp;<em>La Quimera&nbsp;</em>in single-player, but if you want to, you can also team up with up to two friends for three-player co-op. Seems a little strange to stop at three, but hey, if it's good enough for&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-2025" rel="nofollow"><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></a>, it's good enough for&nbsp;<em>La Quimera</em>, I guess.</p>

<p>Reburn says you can expect the same kind of "tense gunplay and intimate storytelling" you're familiar with from the&nbsp;<em>Metro&nbsp;</em>series, as well as "highly detailed environments, characters, and weapons".</p>




<p>It's likely that&nbsp;<em>La Quimera&nbsp;</em>is one of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/4a-games-zen-studios-embracer" rel="nofollow">two AAA titles</a> that 4A Games is apparently working on for its parent company Embracer Group, with the other presumably being the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metro-exodus-developers-still-working-on-next-game-despite-war-in-ukraine-sdk-released" rel="nofollow">next game in the&nbsp;<em>Metro&nbsp;</em>series</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Whatever the case may be,&nbsp;<em>La Quimera&nbsp;</em>is slated to arrive on PC via Steam, although it doesn't have a release date yet. No console version appears to be planned for now. Stay tuned for more.</p>
