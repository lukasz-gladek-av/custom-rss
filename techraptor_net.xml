            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-annapurna-staff-private-division-ips<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report claims that an as-yet unnamed company comprising former Annapurna Interactive employees is set to take over publishing duties for franchises that would have been overseen by ex-Take-Two indie label Private Division.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-07/ex-annapurna-video-game-staff-to-absorb-former-take-two-label-private-division" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a> by Bloomberg's Jason Schreier, ex-Annapurna Interactive staffers have formed a new company following their <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/annapurna-interactive-staff-resign-after-company-spin-off-talks-fail" rel="nofollow">abrupt resignation in September</a>, which resulted from the failure of talks to spin the division off into its own entity.</p>

<p>The new company will, according to Schreier, "inherit the games and franchises of Private Division", which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-private-division-sale" rel="nofollow">sold off by former parent company Take-Two in November</a> to an unknown buyer. The report, citing "people familiar with the deal", names that buyer as the Texas-based Haveli Investments.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-the-shire-private-division-annapurna.jpg?itok=erjunmst 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tales-of-the-shire-private-division-annapurna.jpg?itok=Je0mFceJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Private Division's games and franchises include the likes of&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Supposedly, Haveli will fund the new company and "place them in charge of distributing the former Private Division titles", which will include the likes of cozy hobbit life sim&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/intercept-games-shut-down-kerbal-space-program-2" rel="nofollow">beleaguered</a> space sandbox&nbsp;<em>Kerbal Space Program</em>.</p>

<p>According to Schreier, "an unannounced title" by&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>developer Game Freak will also be included in the deal. That game is almost certainly the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/private-division-pokemon-developer-game-freak-reveal-new-action-adventure-ip-project" rel="nofollow">previously-revealed&nbsp;<em>Project Bloom</em></a>, which doesn't have an official name yet, so hopefully we'll get to see a new reveal for it soon.</p>

<p>Schreier's report says that some of Private Division's 20 employees "will be laid off as part of the new arrangement", although we don't yet know which employees or in what departments those layoffs will be focused.</p>

<p>The writing was arguably on the wall for Private Division as early as April last year, when Take-Two <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-interactive-layoffs" rel="nofollow">laid off 5% of its workforce</a> and scrapped a number of projects. Following that, Private Division and Bloober Team <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloober-team-private-division-end-partnership" rel="nofollow">ended</a> a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloober-teams-up-with-private-division-for-new-horror-game" rel="nofollow">previously-announced partnership</a> for a new horror IP in May.</p>

Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/krafton-burning-money-to-add-generative-ai-players-to-pubg-inzoi-and-more.1076157/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-generative-ai-characters-pubg-inzoi<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Krafton has announced a partnership with Nvidia to introduce new companions called "Co-Playable Characters" to Krafton's games, and yes, they're powered by generative AI, because of course they are.</p>

<p>In a press release, the two companies say that Co-Playable Characters, or CPCs, are "powered by on-device Small Language Models" and that they have the potential to "interact with players in deeper ways than traditional NPCs".</p>

<p>This is because CPCs are apparently "equipped with the ability to understand and cooperate with users"; according to Krafton and Nvidia, CPCs will "understand and respond to game situations in a human-like manner", although given what I've seen of the&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>player base, I'm not sure I want that.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pubg-krafton-ai-characters-door.jpg?itok=kLSKyQC2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pubg-krafton-ai-characters-door.jpg?itok=_B5Ll4Eq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Krafton will soon introduce AI-powered companions to&nbsp;<em>PUBG</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>It's not just&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>itself that's getting these AI-powered characters, either. According to the press release, Krafton intends to introduce CPCs "across its gaming portfolio", so you can expect to see these characters in&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>spinoffs too, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/inzoi-release-date-delayed" rel="nofollow">upcoming life sim&nbsp;<em>inZoi</em></a>.</p>

<p>Only&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>inZoi&nbsp;</em>are mentioned, so we don't know if Krafton is also planning to introduce CPCs to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hi-fi-rush-2-krafton-ceo" rel="nofollow">the likes of&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush 2</em></a>&nbsp;or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/subnautica-2-early-access-2025-co-op" rel="nofollow"><em>Subnautica 2</em></a>, but I can't possibly imagine how having an AI inanely yammering away to me while I'm rhythmically smashing goons to pieces could help.</p>

<p>Krafton CEO Changhan Kim says that Nvidia's AI technology, which will power CPCs, is "poised to redefine the future of gaming", while Nvidia developer relations VP Keita Iida says Krafton's CPCs will bring "new, unique experiences" to games. Hmm.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/krafton-ai-characters-inzoi.jpg?itok=CB6fpefb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/krafton-ai-characters-inzoi.jpg?itok=pCzDb0ww 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Krafton's life sim&nbsp;<em>inZoi&nbsp;</em>will also include AI-powered "Co-Playable Characters".</figcaption></figure><p>Krafton might be wholeheartedly embracing AI - and it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-working-hard-on-using-ai-to-make-npc-and-worlds-more-alive-reactive-and" rel="nofollow">far from the only company</a> in gaming <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-hopes-to-use-generative-ai-to-drive-more-monetization-and-make-development-30-more" rel="nofollow">to be doing so</a> - but the technology isn't impressing everyone.</p>

<p>Last month, for instance,&nbsp;<em>BioShock&nbsp;</em>creator Ken Levine <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioshock-creator-ken-levine-generative-ai" rel="nofollow">said he wasn't "overly impressed"</a> by generative AI, suggesting that while it could certainly perform mundane tasks related to coding and other technical aspects of game development, it wasn't suitable to be used for creative purposes.</p>

<p>Similarly, gaming giant Nintendo declared last year that it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-generative-ai-no-plans" rel="nofollow">currently has no plans</a> to use generative AI to develop its games, citing issues with intellectual property rights infringement as well as a desire to deliver "value that is unique to [Nintendo]".</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Native GeForce Now App Coming to Steam Deck Later This Year]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/geforce-now-steam-deck-app-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/native-geforce-now-app-coming-to-steam-deck-later-this-year.1076106/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/geforce-now-steam-deck-app-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nvidia has announced that it's bringing a native GeForce Now app to Steam Deck devices later this year, allowing you to access the cloud gaming subscription service on your handheld device more easily.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-ces-2025/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> announcing the new app, Nvidia says Steam Deck users can look forward to "up to 4K resolution and 60 frames per second with high dynamic range" when connected to an external display.</p>

<p>It's technically already possible to access GeForce Now via your Steam Deck, but you have to use what essentially amounts to a workaround; in <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-thursday-may-games-list/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">May last year</a>, Nvidia released a custom script that installs Google Chrome onto your Deck, then "adds all the settings needed" for GeForce Now streaming via that browser.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nvidia-geforce-now-steam-deck-app-cyberpunk.jpg?itok=Ufr9mfet 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nvidia-geforce-now-steam-deck-app-cyberpunk.jpg?itok=Lm9gnORb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The GeForce Now app for Steam Deck will let you stream games at up to 4k and 60fps.</figcaption></figure><p>As Nvidia points out, your Steam Deck will theoretically draw less power if it's streaming a game from the cloud than if it's using its own internals, although I'd imagine Steam Deck users will want to wait for the app to land so they can see that for themselves.</p>

<p>Of course, you will also need a GeForce Now subscription if you want to stream games via this new app, and given that Nvidia is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/geforce-now-monthly-playtime-limit-2025" rel="nofollow">imposing a 100-hour monthly playtime limit</a> across all of its tiers this month, that may not be a particularly enticing prospect for you.</p>

<p>Still, this seems like a pretty neat way to circumvent the Steam Deck's relatively low power, and it might even help you get past things like the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/apex-legends-bans-linux" rel="nofollow"><em>Apex Legends&nbsp;</em>Steam Deck ban</a>&nbsp;(which is technically a Linux-wide ban), although given that the GeForce Now app will be Steam Deck-native, that seems a touch unlikely.</p>




<p>In any case, you'll be able to check out the native GeForce Now app for Steam Deck when it launches later this year. We don't have a full release date for it yet, so watch this space for more info.</p>
