            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new pair of third-party books is available for pre-order on D&amp;D Beyond. The <em>Grim Hollow: 2024 Bundle</em> brings a revised version of Ghostfire Games' dark fantasy world of Etharis to the platform. Notably, it is the first third-party book to use the new 2024 ruleset.</p>

<h2>The <em>Grim Hollow: 2024</em> Bundle Announcement</h2>

<p>According to the <a href="https://marketplace.dndbeyond.com/category/CBGCH9A2W" rel="nofollow">store page</a>, the <em>Grim Hollow: 2024 Bundle</em> will contain two books: the <em>Grim Hollow: Player's Guide</em> and the <em>Grim Hollow: Campaign Guide</em>.</p>

This is not to be confused with the <em>Grim Hollow: Player Pack</em> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/two-ghostfire-gaming-adventures-are-now-available-to-purchase-on-dd-beyond-continues" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Lairs of Etharis</em></a> material, which were designed with the 2014 rules in mind. If you already own this material, it is still compatible with this new edition.</p>

<p>The <em>Grim Hollow: 2024 Bundle</em> is packed with material for players who want to add darker themes and horror to their <em>D&amp;D</em> game. This includes 21 new player species, 40 new subclasses, 25 backgrounds, 41 feats, 102 new spells, 113 dark fantasy-themed magic items, and 82 advanced weapons. The <em>Player Guide</em> even includes a new character class: the Monster Hunter.:</p>

<p>For GMs, there is plenty to enjoy as well. There are 24 monsters, 10 detailed battlemaps, in-depth lore of the seven different regions of the land of Etharis, and grittier rules for resting, wounds, and corruption. Will your adventurers resist, or fall into murky moral greys?</p>

<p>The corruption isn't metaphorical either. The unique selling point of <em>Grim Hollow</em> are rules where players can slowly become monsters, including vampires, werewolves, demons, liches, avenging angels, and more.</p>

<p>The <em>Grim Hollow: 2024 Bundle</em> is available for pre-order now at an MSRP of $69.99. The <em>Grim Hollow: Player's Guide</em> is available now and can be bought separately for $39.99. The <em>Grim Hollow: Campaign Guide</em> will be available on the platform on September 30.&nbsp;</p>
