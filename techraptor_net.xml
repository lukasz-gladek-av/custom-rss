            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bungie has revealed the <em>Marathon </em>release date (again), with the extraction shooter getting ready to deploy on PC and consoles in March.</p><p>As announced in a <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathon-releases-march-5-2026-new-trailer-and-more" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">brand new blog post</a>, <em>Marathon </em>will be launching on March 5th. If you're so inclined, pre-orders for the game are open now as well, and you'll get extra stuff if you buy the game before its release date hits, including some rewards for <em>Destiny 2</em>.</p><p>This announcement marks the second time that <em>Marathon</em>'s release date has been revealed; back in April last year, Bungie <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marathon-release-date-gameplay-revealed" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="aa33e300-ad1e-49d4-aa79-c1a1ab82252d" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">set a September date for the game</a>, but <em>Marathon </em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shocking-no-one-bungies-marathon-delayed" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b9bec301-96aa-432b-879e-d90acf44097c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">was delayed</a> in June following lukewarm feedback from the game's alpha testing period.</p><figure role="group">

<p>As well as the disappointing alpha feedback, Bungie also found itself at the center of controversy in May, when it was revealed that the game contained <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-marathon-art-stolen" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5bd258c2-70a9-4816-a5f2-9f981d275fcc" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">artwork that had been stolen</a> from an online artist without proper credit.</p><p>All of that followed on from news in August 2024 that <em>Marathon</em>'s former director Chris Barrett had been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marathon-director-fired-report-bungie" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7ef2a90f-6d8c-4535-a8a5-2e5217b15752" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">fired over misconduct allegations</a>, which led him to sue Sony over his dismissal. Sony promptly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-christopher-barrett-lawsuit-evidence" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d697b644-87cf-46b1-9530-25c17167ff69" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">responded to the lawsuit</a>, providing evidence of what it called a "pattern of misconduct" on Barrett's part.</p><p>This is all to say that <em>Marathon </em>has had a lengthy and difficult development cycle, and with <em>Destiny 2 </em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-q2-2025-26-destiny-2-bungie" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b988b438-f974-4d01-854a-83f6fa549891" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">proving a disappointment to Bungie and Sony</a> in recent years, the two will likely be hoping this one is more of an unqualified success.</p><p>You can check out the new pre-order trailer for <em>Marathon</em>, which also introduces a brand new character you'll be meeting a lot in the game, right here.</p>
<p>Assuming that there are no further delays, you'll be able to check out <em>Marathon </em>on March 5th on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3065800/Marathon/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/marathon/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/marathon/9pb32dkqkzdq" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Digixart, the studio behind <em>Road 96</em>, has announced that its upcoming adventure game <em>Tides of Tomorrow</em> has been delayed until April in order to afford the studio some extra development time.</p><p>Announcing the news in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2678080/view/493840283288472148" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a post on Steam</a>, Digixart says it wants to "take a little extra time before launch" alongside publisher THQ Nordic, suggesting (with tongue firmly in cheek) that the delay caused them to consider renaming the game to <em>Tides of the Day After Tomorrow</em>.</p><p>The studio doesn't provide any more in-depth reason for the delay than that, but it's likely that, just like other game delays, things aren't quite where they need to be with <em>Tides of Tomorrow </em>right now, hence the need for some extra time to polish and finish off the game.</p><figure role="group">

</figure>
<p>The delay won't affect <em>Tides of Tomorrow</em>'s playable demo, however, so it's unlikely that anything will be significantly changing in terms of direction between now and the new release date of April 22nd.</p><p>If you're not familiar with <em>Tides of Tomorrow</em>, it's the next game from Digixart, the studio responsible for road trip adventure <em>Road 96</em>, which our very own Will <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/road-96-review" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="24ceeade-3c31-41f5-9bd2-d997ce525392" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">wasn't too impressed with</a> when it launched back in 2021.</p><p>This time around, Digixart has opted for an adventure that takes place in a world devastated by an event known as the Great Flood. You'll need to explore that world and deal with its denizens in order to combat a "deadly plastification" that threatens to end the world as you know it.</p><p><em>Tides of Tomorrow</em>'s unique gimmick is the ability to follow your friends (and, apparently, your favorite streamers) on their own adventures throughout the world of Elynd, watching what they do and having your story shaped by their actions.</p>
<p>You'll be able to check out <em>Tides of Tomorrow </em>when it launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2678080/Tides_of_Tomorrow/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a> (where a demo is currently available), <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10015068" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PS5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/tides-of-tomorrow/9nvsc8dxskrs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a> on April 22nd.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Jagex has revealed a hugely ambitious <em>RuneScape </em>roadmap to mark the MMORPG's 25th anniversary, and it promises a "comprehensive modernization of [the game's] core systems", among other things.</p><p>As unveiled during a video presentation today, <em>RuneScape</em>'s Road to Restoration initiative, which Jagex describes as an "integrity roadmap", is a "commitment" from the developer to deal with <em>RuneScape</em>'s "biggest and most requested quality-of-life improvements".</p><p>These include UI updates, improvements to "visual integrity" and "combat style modernization", and rebalancing efforts, among many other things. Suffice it to say that <em>RuneScape </em>at the end of 2026 should look a lot different to how it looks today.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>RuneScape</em>'s 25th anniversary is shaping up to be special.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In April, player character avatars will be completely updated, with features like models, animations, and hairstyles getting an overhaul. More updates will be introduced "based on community feedback" as well.</p><p>You'll gain more control over your house this year, too, allowing you to build a space that "feels personal, welcoming, and worth visiting", according to Jagex. The Construction skill will increase to 120, and you'll get a new recipe system that lets you unlock and build new furniture.</p><p>It's not all tweaks to existing systems and features, though. <em>RuneScape </em>is also getting "the largest area expansion" in its history in the form of Havenhythe, which will be arriving "in multiple parts throughout the year".</p><p>Havenhythe is a "progressively vampiric" area that brings new quests, new early-game bosses, and a new level cap for your Hunter skill, with new story and boss content also arriving later in the year.</p>
<p>News of <em>RuneScape</em>'s overhaul comes after Jagex <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/jagex-layoffs" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="611f0a88-3fdc-4d5c-a015-22d2ff230293" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">laid off a number of employees</a> back in June in order to "increase agility", although the studio clarified that the "vast majority" of those layoffs were in "non-game development and non-player-facing functions".</p><p>You can check out <em>RuneScape </em>for free right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1343400/RuneScape/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC via Steam</a>, as well as on mobile devices.
