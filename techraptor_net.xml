            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For the first time in its robust 50-year history, GAMA has announced some major changes. The trade organization known for hosting Origins Game Fair and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/gama-expo-will-be-moving-to-baltimore-in-future" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GAMA Expo</a> will be rebranding and announcing a new ten-year plan towards the health of the global tabletop industry.</p>

<h2>The New GAMA Ten-Year Project</h2>

<p>According to an in-depth report by <a href="https://boardgamewire.com/index.php/2025/10/02/gama-unveils-10-year-plan-to-become-epicenter-of-global-tabletop-gaming-industry-renames-itself-after-almost-50-years/" rel="nofollow">Board Game Wire</a>, the new ten-year project for GAMA is for the organization to become the new epicentre of the global tabletop industry. This project encompasses a comprehensive range of plans to enhance GAMA membership globally and diversify its financial support, shifting its focus from solely sponsoring tabletop expos to leading the conversation on industry sustainability.</p>

<p>The plan was spearheaded by President Nicole Brady. According to Brady, this shift was to allow the organization to manage important issues better long-term than "playing whack-a-mole" on a case-by-case basis. It was during an online "town hall" meeting that Brady articulated the future of the organization as a global one that treats the industry as more than just a hobby.</p>

<p>This push for formal organization and management is the impetus for the organization's new name. While originally known as the Game Manufacturers Association, the organization will now be known as GAMA: The Tabletop Association. As an official statement from the organization reads:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The tabletop game industry has grown far beyond where we were in 1977 when we were founded. Our new name honors that evolution while maintaining our legacy of nearly 50 years of serving the tabletop industry.&nbsp;We’re excited to move forward under a banner that celebrates the full spectrum of our industry and the people who shape it."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As for immediate plans, GAMA's focus in the next two years will be on an anti-counterfeit initiative, education and certification programs, providing professional resources, and reaching out to media about business-relevant topics.&nbsp;</p>
