            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-october-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Paradox and developer The Chinese Room have announced that&nbsp;<em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>has been delayed yet again. It's now set to come out later this year.</p>

<p>In a new development update trailer,&nbsp;<em>World of Darkness&nbsp;</em>executive VP Marco Behrmann reveals that&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>won't be meeting its previously-announced release window; the game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-yet-again" rel="nofollow">set to come out in the first half of this year</a>.</p>

<p>However, the two aforementioned studios believe that "ensuring great technical quality is more important than sticking to a specific date", and so they've admitted that&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>"will not be ready for release" before the fall.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-october-2025-shadows.jpg?itok=Lzb2Q_8V 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-october-2025-shadows.jpg?itok=a7cfqcn3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>has been delayed again. Who'd have thunk?</figcaption></figure><p>According to Behrmann, however, the game is "done", and The Chinese Room and Paradox are currently focusing on bug fixing and testing, placing&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>in a "late development stage".</p>

<p>The developer is apparently currently working to "ensure [<em>Bloodlines 2</em>] is stable and free of bugs that could disrupt the player experience", hopefully guaranteeing that the game "meets the technical quality standards that [fans] rightfully expect and deserve".</p>

<p>As such,&nbsp;<em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>will now be launching in October 2025, although Behrmann stopped short of announcing a new release date for the game. The wait goes on, it seems.</p>

<p>In case you're unfamiliar,&nbsp;<em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>has a very long and arduous development history. The game was first <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-announced-mitsoda-returning-as-writer" rel="nofollow">announced back in 2019</a>, at which point original game writer Brian Mitsoda was set to return.</p>




<p>After numerous delays, Mitsoda was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-kicks-out-narrative-designer-brian-mitsoda" rel="nofollow">removed from the project</a>, and its future was relatively uncertain until the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-back-developed-by-chinese-room" rel="nofollow">returned in late 2023</a>, now being developed by <i>Dear Esther&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<em>Everybody's Gone to the Rapture&nbsp;</em>studio The Chinese Room.</p>

<p>We can only hope that this new release window for&nbsp;<em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>is accurate, but given the game's long and storied history, I will believe that when I see it. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/popular-guessing-game-geoguessr-comes-to-steam-in-april.1144296/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/geoguessr-steam-april<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Popular geographical guessing game&nbsp;<em>GeoGuessr&nbsp;</em>is making its way to Steam, so you'll soon be able to completely fail to guess where on earth a random muddy field is through Valve's platform.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://x.com/geoguessr/status/1904516547806150715" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, the game will be launching via Steam Early Access sometime in April, and the Early Access version will include both Solo Duels and Unranked Team Duels.</p>

<p>Playing Unranked Team Duels will be free, but the Solo Duels mode will require a&nbsp;<em>GeoGuessr&nbsp;</em>Steam Pass. If you've got a subscription on the browser version of the game, that won't translate to the Steam edition, so you'll have to fork out some more cash if you want to play Solo Duels on Steam.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/geoguessr-steam-guessing.jpg?itok=K37JT8aw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/geoguessr-steam-guessing.jpg?itok=UILe_i1s 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>GeoGuessr&nbsp;</em>is coming to Steam, but there are a few catches.</figcaption></figure><p>You won't be able to use your&nbsp;<em>GeoGuessr&nbsp;</em>browser account to play the game on Steam; it's technically a new game, so it'll require a new account as well, although it sounds like you'll just be able to use your regular Steam profile.</p>

<p>You will, however, be able to access crossplay between&nbsp;<em>GeoGuessr&nbsp;</em>on Steam and the browser version of the game, so even if your buddies aren't playing via Steam, you should still be able to play with (or against!) them.</p>

<p>If you do intend to play Solo Duels, you'll rise through the ranks gradually in order to prove yourself as a&nbsp;<em>GeoGuessr&nbsp;</em>champion. It promises to be exactly as addictive as the regular browser version of the game.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>GeoGuessr</em>, the clue is in the name; it's a game that shows you a random picture from somewhere around the world, and it's up to you to use context clues (or just wild guesses) to figure out where the picture might show.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-1-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has announced the release date for the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>Title Update 1, which is set to introduce a new (or perhaps that should be returning) monster and more to the game next week.</p>

<p>Per a new&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>showcase that aired earlier today,&nbsp;Title Update 1 will arrive on Friday, April 4th. The main attraction when it comes to this update is the introduction of Mizutsune, a water monster that made its first appearance in 2016's 3DS game&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Generations</em>.</p>

<p>You'll need to be High Rank level 21 or over to take on Mizutsune, and once you reach this level, you'll be able to grab an Extra Mission after speaking with Kanya in the Scarlet Forest. That's the mission in which Mizutsune waits for you.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-1-mizutsune.jpg?itok=biImuV5Y 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-1-mizutsune.jpg?itok=rfjIgQcj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' first title update is heading your way soon.</figcaption></figure><p>It's not just Mizutsune that's coming as part of this update, of course. You can also look forward to battling a new Arch-tempered version of new monster Rey Dau, which will be added to the game in a new quest "at a later date".</p>

<p>Zoh Shia, another new monster introduced in&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, can now be fought as part of repeatable quests, although you will need to complete a new HR 50 mission in order to access it.</p>

<p>If you're looking for a new hangout spot for you and your fellow hunters, then you can head over to the new Grand Hub, which serves as a place "for hunters to gather and socialize", according to Capcom. There's also a fun new minigame to try out there.</p>

<p>You can check out all of the highlights of&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>Title Update 1 <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-us/update/ver_01_0/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a> courtesy of Capcom, and you can take a look at a brand new trailer for the update below.</p>
