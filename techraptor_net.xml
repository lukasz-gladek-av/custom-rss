            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-snap-back-online-dev-says-new-publisher<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Card battler&nbsp;<em>Marvel Snap&nbsp;</em>has come back online in the US following an outage related to the shutdown of TikTok, and developer Second Dinner has promised changes in the future to avoid a repeat of the downtime.</p>

<p>The game was taken offline over the weekend after seemingly being caught up in a TikTok ban, which was rendered temporary when now-President Trump <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1880861537981944300" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">declared a temporary reprieve</a> of 75 days for the social media platform. Second Dinner <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1880861537981944300" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">said</a> the outage was "a surprise" and that it "wasn't planned".</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1881535498709266691" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> shared on social media platform X today, Second Dinner confirmed the app was back online in the US, although it still <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1881558007831740708" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">doesn't seem to be available</a> to download from mobile app stores.</p>

<p>As a reminder, the game's current publisher is Nuverse, a gaming-related subsidiary of TikTok owner ByteDance. Last year, ByteDance <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bytedance-selling-gaming-assets" rel="nofollow">reportedly expressed interest</a> in selling off its gaming assets, which would naturally include Nuverse.</p>

<p>At time of writing, in-app purchases are <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1881539047501484050" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">apparently still down</a> within&nbsp;<em>Marvel Snap</em>, but you can make purchases on the web shop. Second Dinner has <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1881099521310269578" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">previously stated</a> that it's "committed to ensuring that all players are compensated for their lost time" due to the outage.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Marvel Snap</em>, it's a competitive card game currently available across PC and mobile devices. The game is described by its devs as a "fast-paced collectible card game that reimagines the genre with innovative mechanics".</p>

<p><em>Marvel Snap&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1997040/MARVEL_SNAP/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, and it's usually available on mobile devices as well, although reports suggest it's not downloadable on those storefronts right now. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-and-ncsoft-reportedly-cancel-unannounced-horizon-mmo.1087590/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/horizon-mmo-canceled-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>An MMORPG based on Sony and Guerrilla Games' successful IP&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>has apparently been canceled. The project was reportedly a collaboration between Sony and&nbsp;<em>Guild Wars&nbsp;</em>studio NCSoft.</p>

<p>Bear with me on this one. Back in 2023, Sony and NCSoft <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-and-ncsoft-announce-strategic-partnership-to-collaborate-in-various" rel="nofollow">announced a "strategic partnership"</a>, and that partnership was reported to include a&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>MMO, with leaker Kurakasis <a href="https://x.com/Kurakasis/status/1741262087647543736" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pointing to job listings</a> for something called "Project H" (also "Project Skyline") in December that same year.</p>

<p>Now, however, Korean publication <a href="https://news.mtn.co.kr/news-detail/2025011314314667267" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">MTN</a> (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/looks-like-horizons-unannounced-mmo-has-been-quietly-cancelled" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>) has reported that Project H has been canceled following a project review at NCSoft, along with several other titles in development at the company.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/horizon-mmo-canceled-report-aloy.jpg?itok=HnasnYjv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/horizon-mmo-canceled-report-aloy.jpg?itok=WfRjSZmL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>An MMO based on&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>has apparently been canceled.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, all of this should be taken with a pinch of salt, because Sony and NCSoft never officially announced the&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>MMO in question, so naturally, it also hasn't officially been canceled.</p>

<p>However, cancelling such a project would fit in with what appears to be a wider retreat from the live service market on Sony's part. Earlier this week, the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-live-service-games-canceled" rel="nofollow">canceled two live service games</a> in development at Bluepoint and Bend, with the former reportedly being a&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>spinoff.</p>

<p>The retreat is likely inspired by the colossal failure of hero shooter&nbsp;<em>Concord</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds" rel="nofollow">shut down just two weeks after it launched</a> last year. The game's developer would go on to be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-shuts-down-two-studios-including-concord-creator" rel="nofollow">closed down by Sony</a>, along with Neon Koi, previously known as Savage Game Studios.</p>

<p>It's also worth noting that assuming this MMO was actually in development, it's probably not the&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>multiplayer game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/guerrilla-working-on-multiplayer-horizon-game" rel="nofollow">announced back in December 2022</a>, as that's in development at Guerrilla itself rather than a third-party studio (although that could well end up being canceled too).</p>
