            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has revealed a brand new Mega Evolution for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>in the form of Mega Victreebel, and if you've ever felt like&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>could stand a little more horror in its diet, then the new trailer is for you.</p>

<p>Two new videos have appeared on The Pokemon Company's official YouTube channel. The first is a fairly whimsical introduction to Mega Victreebel that shows off the 'mon's design in&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>, as well as some of its combat moves.</p>

<p>It's the second, however, that sparked my interest. "The Case of the Sweet Scent Incident" is an honest-to-god found-footage horror video in which Mega Victreebel plays a role, and I don't want to spoil it, but it's well worth a watch if you're into the creepier side of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mega-victreebel-pokemon-legends-z-a-the-case-of-the-sweet-scent-incident.jpg?itok=KI6-3B6N 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mega-victreebel-pokemon-legends-z-a-the-case-of-the-sweet-scent-incident.jpg?itok=saskKvDp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Yes, this still is from a&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>video.</figcaption></figure><p>In essence, the new video short from the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>folks marries the warring worlds of the creature-collecting franchise and&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 7</em>, as two urban explorers investigate a building that's been giving off a sweet scent at night.</p>

<p>The conceit of the video is that the footage was discovered "on a video sharing website", so the creators are really leaning into the&nbsp;<em>Blair Witch</em>-style trappings of the genre. It's well worth a watch; you can check it out right here.</p>




<p>This has all been set up ahead of the launch of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>, which is set for release on both Nintendo Switch 2 and the original Switch <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-release-date-pokemon-presents" rel="nofollow">in October</a>.</p>

<p>Being set in the Kalos region's Lumiose City, the game will heavily feature Mega Evolution as a mechanic, and it'll introduce new Mega Evolved forms of existing Pokemon like Dragonite and Victreebel, as well as existing Mega Evolutions originally introduced back in Gen 6.</p>

<p>You'll be able to pick up&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>on the Switch family of consoles on October 16th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Time Loop RPG Rue Valley Set for November Release Date]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/time-loop-rpg-rue-valley-set-for-november-release-date.1276887/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Owlcat Games and developer Emotion Spark Studio have announced the release date for their time loop RPG&nbsp;<em>Rue Valley</em>, and it's hitting PC and consoles in just a couple of months.</p>

<p>As revealed in a new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Rue Valley&nbsp;</em>will be arriving on November 11th. It'll serve as the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/owlcat-publishing-rpgs" rel="nofollow">inaugural publishing project</a> for Owlcat; the studio is mainly known for developing CRPGs like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/pathfinder-wrath-of-righteous" rel="nofollow">Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader" rel="nofollow"><em>Warhammer 40k: Rogue Trader</em></a>.</p>

<p><em>Rue Valley&nbsp;</em>is one of two publishing projects currently in the works at Owlcat; the other,&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Road</em>, is a "turn-based RPG where feudal Japan meets magic and machine", although unfortunately, it doesn't have a release window yet.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rue-valley-release-date-corkboard.jpg?itok=AU3lrV79 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rue-valley-release-date-corkboard.jpg?itok=m1waU7zw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Time loop RPG&nbsp;<em>Rue Valley&nbsp;</em>arrives in November.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Rue Valley</em>, it's a time loop RPG heavily inspired by&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>(and it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/longdue-hopetown-kickstarter-disco-elysium" rel="nofollow">far</a> from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zaum-project-c4-disco-elysium" rel="nofollow">only game</a> for which that description feels <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-disco-elysium-devs-new-studios-spiritual-successors" rel="nofollow">appropriate</a>).</p>

<p>Since&nbsp;<em>Rue Valley&nbsp;</em>takes place during a time loop, you'll have the opportunity to shape the protagonist's personality as you see fit. You can, as Emotion Spark puts it, "be a cold-hearted loner who overthinks everything or a melodramatic loudmouth who always trusts their gut instinct".</p>

<p>As you play, you'll store your memories in a special graph, and you'll use those memories to inform your personality and skills. Just like&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>,&nbsp;<em>Rue Valley&nbsp;</em>de-emphasizes traditional combat in favor of a more psychological approach to the genre.</p>

<p>You can check out the release date trailer for&nbsp;<em>Rue Valley</em>, which gives you a sense of what you're in for if you decide to pick it up in November, right here.</p>




<p>While Owlcat may be moving into publishing with&nbsp;<em>Rue Valley&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Road</em>, that doesn't mean the studio is abandoning development; it's currently hard at work on <i>Warhammer 40k: Dark Heresy</i>, another turn-based RPG set in the grim darkness of the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k&nbsp;</em>universe.</p>

<p><em>Rue Valley&nbsp;</em>launches for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2126190/Rue_Valley/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/rue_valley" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a>, and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/rue-valley-48a101" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Epic Store</a>, as well as <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10014770/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-gb/games/store/rue-valley/9pjmhlrct0j2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and Nintendo Switch, on November 11th.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Retro N64 Console Analogue 3D Delayed Yet Again, This Time to Q4 2025]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/analogue-3d-delayed-q4-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/retro-n64-console-analogue-3d-delayed-yet-again-this-time-to-q4-2025.1276821/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Analogue 3D has been delayed once again, this time to the fourth quarter of 2025, although Analogue says it's almost over the finish line with the beleaguered console.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.analogue.co/announcements/analogue3d-shipping-in-q4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on its official website, Analogue says the new Q4 2025 release window has been "intentionally set conservatively", presumably so that no further delays happen and consumers aren't disappointed again.</p>

<p>The company says that the Analogue 3D is currently "at 99%", and that the project's "hardware, system, [and] packaging" have all been "set for months". It's "the last 1%" on which Analogue is currently "focused", although the company stops short of explaining exactly what that 1% constitutes.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/analogue-3d-delayed-q4-2025-white.jpg?itok=rgc8Xjt5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/analogue-3d-delayed-q4-2025-white.jpg?itok=FjGFjwCz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's going to take a little longer for you to get your Analogue 3D, unfortunately.</figcaption></figure><p>Analogue closes its statement by saying it's "pushing without pause and appreciate[s] everyone’s patience and trust", promising to "deliver — delays or not". It seems the company is still confident you're going to get your Analogue 3D, although we don't know exactly when yet.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time the Analogue 3D has been delayed. The console, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/analogue-3d-announced-and-its-4k-nintendo-64" rel="nofollow">first revealed back in 2023</a>, was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/analogue-3d-n64-delayed-2025" rel="nofollow">pushed back to 2025 in late 2024</a>. The release date was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/analogue-3d-n64-delayed-july" rel="nofollow">moved once again back in March</a>, with Analogue pledging to ship the machine by July, although that's obviously a goal the company was unable to meet.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what the Analogue 64 is, it's a retro "reimagining" of the Nintendo 64; it plays real N64 cartridges and apes the original aesthetic of Nintendo's console, although mercifully, the controller with which Analogue recommends you play is a little more ergonomic.</p>

<p>Rather than using emulation, the Analogue 3D uses FPGA, which the company says effectively eliminates "incompatibilities found in software emulation like input lag, graphic/audio inaccuracies, timing/frame rate issues and more".</p>

Hopefully.</figcaption></figure><p>The Analogue 3D is now set to launch sometime in Q4 2025 (although, depending on how Analogue calculates quarters, this may mean early 2026). In the meantime, if you want to claim a refund on yours, you can <a href="https://www.analogue.co/support/contact" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">do so here</a>.</p>
