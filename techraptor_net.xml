            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/over-200-rockstar-employees-demand-reinstatement-of-fired-staffers.1353019/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>More than 200 Rockstar employees have signed a letter demanding that a number of colleagues recently fired for "misconduct" be reinstated, alleging union-busting.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-is-a-blatant-unapologetic-act-of-vicious-union-busting-hundreds-of-rockstar-employees-sign-letter-to-management-demanding-fired-colleagues-get-reinstated" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>, the letter requests the reinstatement of over 30 Rockstar employees who were let go from the company recently. All of the employees were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rockstar-union-busting-accusation-gta-6" rel="nofollow">involved in union activity</a>, leading Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) organizer Fred Carter to call the dismissals an "act of union-busting unprecedented in the games industry".</p>

<p>An anonymous employee, who was one of those recently fired, told Eurogamer that the firings constitute "a blatant, unapologetic act of vicious union busting", and that it's "heartwarming" to see colleagues supporting them and "holding management to account".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/grand-theft-auto-6-rockstar-employee-letter.jpg?itok=1sM_rcRP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/grand-theft-auto-6-rockstar-employee-letter.jpg?itok=ux2hypHU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hundreds of Rockstar employees have demanded the reinstatement of several recently-fired colleagues.</figcaption></figure><p>Rockstar and parent company Take-Two's side of things is that the employees were fired for "misconduct"; the two studios suggest that the employees in question were involved in leaking key information about the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-november-2026" rel="nofollow">recently-delayed</a>&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, a claim that the IWGB disputes enough to hit Rockstar <a href="https://iwgb.org.uk/en/post/iwgb-issues-legal-claims-against-rockstar-over-unfair-dismissal-of-staff/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">with a legal complaint</a>.</p>

<p>The news comes after the aforementioned delay to&nbsp;<em>GTA 6</em>, which is the second time the game has been pushed back; it was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-vi-release-date-delay" rel="nofollow">slated for a May release</a>, but was delayed in order to give Rockstar more time to work on it.</p>

<p>When&nbsp;<em>GTA 6&nbsp;</em>does eventually launch, it's likely to break sales records across the industry; Take-Two says the game will constitute an "unrivalled blockbuster entertainment experience", and some investors are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-will-clear-7-6-billion-in-first-60-days-investment-firm-predicts/1100-6533204/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">predicting</a> revenues upwards of $7 billion within the first two months of release.</p>

<p>Whether that figure is accurate or not, it's likely that&nbsp;<em>GTA 6&nbsp;</em>will surpass its predecessor in sales and revenue terms, and since&nbsp;<em>GTA 5&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-will-clear-7-6-billion-in-first-60-days-investment-firm-predicts/1100-6533204/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">earned</a> $800 million in its first day,&nbsp;<em>GTA 6&nbsp;</em>is going to be massive.</p>




<p>We'll have to wait and see what comes of these Rockstar employees' demands. Stay tuned for more.</p>
