            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Darrington Press has announced a huge wave of material is coming for <em>Daggerheart</em>. During an official panel at GenCon 2025, the publisher announced new products, supplements, and collaborations with various tabletop influencers scheduled for release in the future.</p>



<p>The first wave of announcements at the&nbsp;GenCon 2025 panel was that official Class Packs would be coming. In response to Darrington being unable to keep physical copies of the Core Set in stock, which includes both the rulebook and a case of cards, they will be launching a Kickstarter campaign to produce individual character class packs.</p>

This includes ancestry cards, community cards, subclass cards, and all cards from the class's two domains.</p>

<p>In addition, Darrington has launched an official Homebrew Kit. This completely free resource provides readers with insights into how the systems and mechanics of <em>Daggerheart</em> were designed. In addition, it will provide resources for independent creators or third-party studios to make original creations. This includes player options like ancestries and communities, to entire campaign frames.</p>

<p>As the&nbsp;GenCon 2025 panel continued, Darrington confirmed that new supplements and prewritten adventures were on the way. An official Romantasy campaign frame, bringing players into a world of passion and power. For <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-announces-world-tour-with-city-echoes-of-exandria-tour" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Critical Role</a> fans, the panel confirmed that their actual play, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-roles-daggerheart-age-of-umbra-mini-series-debuts-at-end-of-may" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Age of Umbra</em></a>, will be getting a Season 2.</p>

Crawford will be working on a brand new setting for the game. Perkins will be writing a special adventure supplement, one that weaves multiple campaign frames into an interconnected epic.</p>

<p>But that's not all of the talent that Darrington has at their disposal. Keith Baker and Jenn Ellis, the creators of Eberron and <em>Phoenix Dawn Command</em> are creating a new original setting using the Daggerheart system.</p>

<p>Lastly, the&nbsp;GenCon 2025 panel confirmed partnerships with various TTRPG influencers and creators. This includes a wave of new&nbsp; <em>Daggerheart</em> actual plays, a mini-series form Legends of Avantris, and a one-shot by Dungeons and Daddies,</p>

<p>For those who enjoy minis and dice, Daggerheart's ancestries are now options in Hero Forge and official Daggerheart dice sets are being produced by Dispel Dice, Botch Dice, and Misty Mountain Gaming respectively.</p>
