<h2>Fifth Place -&nbsp;<b>Kill Team 3rd Edition</b></h2>

<p>The latest version of the Warhammer 40K skirmish wargame streamlined a lot of rules (and got rid of the crazy shapes for measuring), and while the 2nd edition was great, this edition feels more polished and I love the addition of the free faction rules online, letting you build your force out of your existing models without any other purchase. It also introduced a great cooperative/solo mode (at the cost of the narrative campaign play, which we hope they bring back).</p>

<h2><b>Fourth Place - The Magnus Archives Roleplaying Game</b></h2>



<p><em>Written by Tyler Chancey</em></p>

<p>This year, Monte Cook Games managed two impressive tasks. Adapting the cult horror podcast series The Magnus Archives into a fun, atmospheric TTRPG. Second, through that adaptation introduce a compelling mental Stress system and with it a layer of cosmic horror into the award-winning Cypher System. Truly a wonder to behold.</p>



<h2><b>Third Place - The Lord of the Rings: Duel for Middle-earth</b></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tabletop-game-of-the-year-lord-of-the-rings-duel.jpg?itok=pNlkit7Z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tabletop-game-of-the-year-lord-of-the-rings-duel.jpg?itok=MI9Mg8Ca 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>Written by Giaco Furino</em></p>

<p>When you give the elevator pitch of this game (a LOTR reskinning of <i>7 Wonders: Duel</i>, which is itself a 2-player version of&nbsp;<em>7 Wonders</em>) you'd be excused for thinking this is just a cash grab using a strong IP. But you'd be more wrong than Boromir suggesting one cannot simply walk into Mordor! With a tense back and forth, fun mechanics built around building a card tableau, and multiple routes to victory (including map control, points, and more),&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings: Duel for Middle-earth</em>&nbsp;was one of the most surprising gaming experiences we've had this year!</p>

<h2><b>Second Place - HeroQuest First Light</b></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tabletop-game-of-the-year-heroquest-first-light.jpeg?itok=nW8P3jKt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tabletop-game-of-the-year-heroquest-first-light.jpeg?itok=xtO-3CEZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>Written by Andrew Stretch</em></p>

<p>For families wanting to begin to broach more complicated TTRPGs with young family members HeroQuest First Light is an all-in-one box that will have them dungeon diving in no time. With a versatile game board that can be explored nearly infinite ways, and quick to grasp but satisfying combat, it becomes a bridge between a traditional board game and a pen and paper RPG. An added benefit is the GM Companion App that will allow for a party of four to explore without needing a GM lowering the barrier to entry even further.</p>

<h2><b>First Place - Wyrmspan</b></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tabletop-game-of-the-year-wyrmspan.jpeg?itok=BQua3WM0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tabletop-game-of-the-year-wyrmspan.jpeg?itok=N-HrbQ6U 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>Written by Giaco Furino</em></p>

<p><em>Wyrmspan</em>&nbsp;is a game that takes something incredible and perfects upon it further, pushing the design right up to the limits to create a bold, inviting, and strategically rewarding experience. I think&nbsp;<em>Wyrmspan&nbsp;</em>may be one of the most engrossing gaming experiences I've had this year, and fans of the original&nbsp;<em>Wingspan</em>&nbsp;absolutely need to check this game out as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Even if the birding aspect is what initially drew you into&nbsp;<em>Wingspan</em>, rest assured that this game - full of its own swath of gorgeous illustrations - will completely sink its talons into you and your gaming group!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/austin-suthers-top-10-games-of-2024.1085418/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/austin-suther-top-10-games-of-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last year, I made the brazen claim that "2023 will go down as one of the best years for game releases in a <em>long</em> time." I might have to eat my words after seeing what 2024 had to offer. I played the most JRPGs I ever have, and that's most definitely reflected in this list. I also had to cut a few things out of my list, which hurts, but I'd like to give honorable mentions to <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-review-id-explain-but-i-dont-think-i-can" rel="nofollow">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/stellar-blade-review-mother-sphere-knows-best" rel="nofollow">Stellar Blade</a></em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/lorns-lure-review-call-of-void" rel="nofollow"><em>Lorn's Lure</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/mullet-madjack-review-nostalgia-fueled-frenzy" rel="nofollow"><em>Mullet MadJack</em></a> to name just a few.</p>



<h2>10. <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em></h2>

<p>I feel like <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em> fell a bit under the radar. Admittedly, it released during a tumultuous time, with other blockbusters taking the limelight. I'm a glutton for HD-2D games, though, so I was all over this when it released.</p>

<p><em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D</em> is also my first time playing the series, and needless to say, I am eagerly awaiting 2025's HD-2D rendition of the first two games, as well.</p>



<h2>9. <em>Dragon's Dogma 2</em></h2>

<p><em>Dragon's Dogma 2</em> is an incredibly imperfect game, but I'd be lying if I said this wasn't one of the most fun games on the list. The long-awaited follow-up to the 2012 cult classic didn't disappoint me, at least, with its wildly immersive world and addicting combat.</p>

<p>Enemy variety is somewhat lacking, but tackling a new monster in <em>Dragon's Dogma 2</em> was always an exciting moment. Climbing on a cyclops' face to stab his eye is immensely satisfying. Unlocking all of the different vocations lead to myriad ways to tackle different monsters, which made experimenting with builds a rewarding experience.</p>



<h2>8. <em>Unicorn Overlord</em></h2>

<p>So, no <em>Fire Emblem</em> release this year? Fine, I'll find another strategy game to play. <em>Unicorn Overlord</em> might not be the same gameplay-wise, but it still scratches that tactical itch. Creating squads of powerful soldiers and fine-tuning their tactics is delightfully fun.</p>

<p>The story is also somewhat similar to that of <em>Fire Emblem</em> -- an ousted prince must reclaim his conquered kingdom. It's a familiar narrative, for sure, but conquering territories and gaining many allies along the way is a satisfying loop. The characters are diverse with its wonderful, undeniably Vanillaware art style. All things said, it is a fantastic package from start to finish.</p>



<h2>7. <em>Persona 3 Reload</em></h2>

<p>My Spotify playlist has a bunch of <em>Persona 3 Reload</em> songs. Every once in a while, the credits theme will play and I'll start feeling all depressed. <em>Persona 3</em> <em>Reload</em> hit me in the feels like few games do. An incredible cast of characters accompanies a darker story, making for a somewhat somber but nonetheless fantastic playthrough.</p>

<p>This was also my first time playing <em>Persona 3</em> in any form, so I was spared the arduous task of navigating pre-<em>Reload</em> Tartarus. I found the dungeon-crawling gameplay to be quite therapeutic, so climbing to the top was a breeze for me.</p>



<h2>6.&nbsp; <em>Zenless Zone Zero</em></h2>

<p>As you can probably tell by the number of JRPGs on this list, I've played some long games this year. Yet, if I had to guess what game had my highest number of hours played, it would probably be <em>Zenless Zone Zero</em>. Since it's launch, I've played it every single day. The power of gacha is strong in this one.</p>

<p><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em>'s hook isn't just the admittedly addicting gacha, though. It's the art style, a surprisingly compelling story and cast of characters, and its<em> </em>simplified <em>Devil May Cry-</em>style combat that keeps me coming back. With a steady stream of content every few weeks, I won't be dropping <em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> in the foreseeable future.</p>



<h2>5. <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em></h2>

<p>It seemed like the internet was out to get <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> -- like people wanted it to fail. Well, surprise, it's actually quite amazing. I had hope that MachineGames would knock it out of the park considering the studio's pedigree, and I was happy to see <em>Indiana Jones</em> get <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/indiana-jones-and-great-circle-review-perfect-adaptation-of-original-ip" rel="nofollow">critical acclaim</a> from critics.</p>

<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> captures the essence of what makes this franchise so beloved. The iconic music, quirky story, and supernatural elements come into play and create a game as good as any <em>Indiana Jones</em> movie.</p>

<p>I'd like to give props to the level design, as well. The Vatican is a full-blown immersive sim level, like a more grounded-in-reality version of <em>Dishonored</em>. With a DLC along the way -- presumably later this year -- I'm hoping the excellent level design carries over.</p>



<h2>4. <em>Astro Bot</em></h2>

<p>Praise be the DualSense, with its haptic feedback and a bunch of other bells and whistles. <em>Astro's Playroom</em> took full advantage of the controller's capabilities when it launched with the PS5, and <em>Astro Bot </em>takes it a step further. I truly believe the future of gaming is not in higher graphical fidelity, but in the way a controller can enhance gameplay.</p>

<p>So yes, <em>Astro Bot</em>'s utilization of the DualSense is mindbogglingly good, but the world design and platforming are even better. Many compared <em>Astro Bot</em> to <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em>, and they're definitely similar both in theme and in design. Team ASOBI found the secret formula that made <em>Super Mario</em> games so great, and made their own incredible platformer with it.</p>



<h2>3. <em>Tsukihime -A Piece of Blue Glass Moon-</em></h2>

<p>Soooo, technically this game came out several years ago, but only in Japanese. In 2024, we received an English translation for <em>Tsukihime. </em>It's my list, so I make the rules.</p>

<p>I already talked extensively about this absolutely fantastic visual novel. This was, in fact, my first true visual novel I've ever played/read, and I was gripped by its powerful storytelling and prose. If you want to read why <em>Tsukihime </em>turned me into a visual novel fan, look no further than this <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/tsukihimes-turned-me-into-visual-novel-fan" rel="nofollow">opinion piece</a> I wrote in July.</p>

<p>I'd like to give a quick shout-out to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2396980/Fatestay_night_REMASTERED/" rel="nofollow"><em>fate/stay night Remaster</em></a>. The <em>Fate</em> franchise is now a household name among weebs, and this is the first official translation for the visual novel that started it all. Check that one out too!</p>



<h2>2. <em>UFO 50</em></h2>

<p>Curse the word limit my tyrannical editors thrust upon me. Had I more words, I'd write a novel on why <em>UFO 50 </em>is so great. It's a collection of 50 separate games, many of which are quite lengthy. This isn't just some mini-game collection, it's like the equivalent of having 50 physical games on a shelf you can plop into your system at any time.</p>

<p>So yeah, while I could go on and on about <em>UFO 50, </em>I'll instead give a shout-out to some of my favorites in this retro-inspired collection: <em>Mooncat; Warptank; Elfazar's Hat; Pilot Quest;</em> and <em>Mini and Max</em>. In fact, <em>Mini and Max</em> is so good, it could be a game of the year contender by itself. To find out what I mean, you just need to play it for yourself.</p>



<h2>1. <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em></h2>

<p>If you didn't scroll down to this list right at the start of the article, then it's probably a pretty easy guess that <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio </em>is my Game of the Year. It's not just the best JRPG I've played this year, it's just the best game, flat out.</p>

<p>Unparalleled visual design (even if the graphics themselves are somewhat dated), compelling characters, a well-written story, and an addicting combat system coalesces into what I might consider a masterpiece.</p>
