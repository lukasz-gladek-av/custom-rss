            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-battle-pass-xp-simplified<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic has announced changes to the way&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s battle pass progression will work, and if you like to play different&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>experiences outside of the standard battle royale mode, you'll like this one.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/coming-soon-progress-your-fortnite-passes-by-playing-any-experience" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a news post</a> on the&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>website, Epic says that by December 1st, all battle passes in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>will progress simultaneously, and you won't need to earn different kinds of XP to make progress along their tracks.</p>

<p>Right now, for instance, to make progress in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite Festival</em>'s battle pass, you'd have to earn Festival Points, while to move along&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite</em>'s battle pass, you'd need Studs. Starting from December, however, that will no longer be the case.</p>

<p>Of course, you will still need to purchase the battle passes in question; Epic hasn't lost its mind, after all. Still, it's nice to know that you can be playing any&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>mode and not miss out on valuable XP elsewhere.</p>

<p>The first pass to get this treatment will be the Music Pass, which will be released as part of&nbsp;<em>Fortnite Festival</em>'s sixth season on November 2nd. After that, on December 1st, the "Brick or Treat"&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>pass will adopt the new system, and all passes from that point on will use the new method.</p>

<p>Additionally, as part of this change, passes in&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Festival&nbsp;</em>will change to a single track with free and premium rewards, which is the same way the battle royale pass currently works.</p>

<p>Not only that, but the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hasbro-board-games-fortnite-clue">board games of Hasbro</a> are also making their way to&nbsp;Epic's game<em>&nbsp;</em>in the form of custom maps. The first one's based around <em>Clue</em>-slash-<em>Cluedo</em>, and others will follow in the coming weeks.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/steins-gate-re-boot-will-revive-a-classic-visual-novel-next-year.1021101/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steins-gate-reboot-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Visual novel developer Mages has announced&nbsp;<em>Steins;Gate Re:Boot</em>, which appears to be either a remake or enhanced remaster of the original 2009 visual novel.</p>

<p>As noted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/steinsgate-reboot-to-bring-the-original-time-travel-adventure-to-modern-platforms/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Automaton Media</a>, details about the game are scarce at the moment; all we've got is a title, previews of some of the character artwork, and a rough release window of 2025.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202410/22274" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Famitsu article</a>&nbsp;(for which we're using machine translation),&nbsp;<em>Steins;Gate Re:Boot&nbsp;</em>will feature additional story content, and it'll also have new character design from Huke, the artist who worked on the original game. It looks as though the character art has been redrawn as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steins-gate-reboot-2025-okabe.jpg?itok=ukgVQGlA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steins-gate-reboot-2025-okabe.jpg?itok=JXb1V5Qw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Steins;Gate Re:Boot&nbsp;</em>will seemingly feature redrawn character designs by original artist Huke.</figcaption></figure><p>The Famitsu article also says that&nbsp;<em>Steins;Gate Re:Boot&nbsp;</em>is based on the original&nbsp;<em>Steins;Gate</em>, so it won't be a new game entirely. You'll have to wait for the tentatively-titled&nbsp;<em>Steins;???&nbsp;</em>if you want to see how the&nbsp;<em>Science Adventure&nbsp;</em>series continues.</p>

<p>For the uninitiated,&nbsp;<em>Steins;Gate&nbsp;</em>is a 2009 visual novel that serves as the second entry in Mages'&nbsp;<em>Science Adventure&nbsp;</em>series, which began with 2008's&nbsp;<em>Chaos;Head&nbsp;</em>(later released in enhanced form as&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chaoshead-noah-steam-release-goes-ahead-after-all"><em>Chaos;Head Noah</em></a>).</p>

<p>The game revolves around eccentric scientist Okabe Rintaro, otherwise known as Okarin, who, along with a group of his fellow students, learns that he has developed a time machine that can send text messages into the past.</p>

<p>What follows is a typically Mages-esque twisty-turny mystery that incorporates the likes of CERN (yes, that CERN), as well as old-school technology and much more. It's perhaps best to play the game if you want to know just how bonkers it gets.</p>




<p>We don't yet know exactly when&nbsp;<em>Steins;Gate Re:Boot&nbsp;</em>will arrive, nor do we know what platforms it will be released for. I'd say PC and PlayStation are safe bets, though, along with the Switch and whatever its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation">much-vaunted successor turns out to be</a>.</p>

<p>In the meantime, though,&nbsp;<em>Steins;Gate&nbsp;</em>is available to play <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/412830/STEINSGATE/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">right now on PC</a> if you want to check it out. An enhanced version,&nbsp;<em>Steins;Gate Elite</em>, is also available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/819030/STEINSGATE_ELITE/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4774-CUSA13222_00-STEINSGATEELITE4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 4</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/steins-gate-elite-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>
