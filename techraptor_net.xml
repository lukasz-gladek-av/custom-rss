            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-roadmap-q2-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GSC Game World has released a brand new&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>roadmap that covers the second quarter of the year, and it promises more fixes to the game's A-Life system, plus lots of other new features and tweaks.</p>

<p>A-Life, which is the name GSC Game World gives to the system that governs its NPCs' ambient behavior, has been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-a-life-20-gsc-game-world" rel="nofollow">the subject of some controversy</a> since&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>'s launch, with numerous <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-update-1-1-a-life" rel="nofollow">updates</a> attempting to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-update-12" rel="nofollow">address</a> some of its most critical issues.</p>

<p>That hasn't changed in the new roadmap, which promises "A-Life/AI updates" in Q2. These updates consist of "persistent" improvements to the system, as well as "smarter human combat", mutants eating corpses, and more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stalker-2-roadmap-q2-2025-pointing.jpg?itok=zc-NJulR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stalker-2-roadmap-q2-2025-pointing.jpg?itok=PZ3yqgs2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>is getting some big changes throughout the rest of the quarter.</figcaption></figure><p>It's not all about A-Life, though. The new&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>is also promising the release of a beta modding SDK (software development kit), allowing you to make your own&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>mods. A closed beta will also be held with mod makers to test out the feature.</p>

<p>Also on the list are features like mutant loot, the ability to skip the game's shader compilation, and an increase to the player's stash window, as well as two new weapons. Naturally, this all sits alongside "further stabilization, optimization, and 'anomalies' fixing" (i.e. bugs).</p>

<p>The next-gen update to the&nbsp;<em>Stalker: Legends of the Zone&nbsp;</em>trilogy, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-roadmap-legends-of-zone-next-gen-2025" rel="nofollow">promised for 2025 back in December</a>, is also scheduled for this quarter, although it may well get delayed again.</p>

<p>GSC Game World says this roadmap, which is the first of a new three-monthly cycle, will help&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>to "become the game we imagined - and you deserve".</p>




<p>In case you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>, it's the long-awaited sequel to the cult classic 2007 FPS&nbsp;<em>Stalker: Shadow of Chernobyl&nbsp;</em>(which still maintains the old Russian spelling of the town's name, unlike <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl" rel="nofollow">the sequel</a>).</p>

<p>Like the first game,&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>has you exploring the Chornobyl nuclear exclusion zone (albeit a heavily fictionalized version of same), seeking out anomalies and artifacts while also grappling with disparate factions.</p>

<p><em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/stalker-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ps5-prices-rising-in-certain-regions-due-to-challenging-economic-environment.1163715/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-prices-rising-europe-uk-australia-new-zealand<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has announced that it's raising the prices of the PS5 in certain regions, although the price of the accompanying disc drive accessory is actually going down.</p>

<p>In a PlayStation <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/13/ps5-price-to-rise-in-europe-australia-and-new-zealand/?sf276959904=1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a>, Sony says that because of a "challenging economic environment" which involves "high inflation and fluctuating exchange rates", the PlayStation 5's price will be increasing in Europe, the UK, Australia, and New Zealand.</p>

<p>Happily (or perhaps not if this is the model you're thinking of buying), the PS5 Digital Edition is the only model affected in Europe and the UK, although both models are getting a price increase in Australia and New Zealand, unfortunately.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ps5-price-rises-consoles.jpg?itok=Xhcr_JYv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ps5-price-rises-consoles.jpg?itok=hPGVbS8F 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The PS5 is getting a price hike in some areas.</figcaption></figure><p>Although the PS5 itself is getting a price hike, the PS5 Disc Drive's RRP will be decreasing in all four of the previously-mentioned areas. These price changes kick in today.</p>

<h3>Europe</h3>

<ul><li>PS5 Digital Edition:&nbsp;€499.99</li>
	<li>PS5 Standard Edition: no change</li>
	<li>PS5 Disc Drive:&nbsp;€79.99</li>
</ul><h3>UK</h3>

<ul><li>PS5 Digital Edition: £429.99</li>
	<li>PS5 Standard Edition: no change</li>
	<li>PS5 Disc Drive: £69.99</li>
</ul><h3>Australia</h3>

<ul><li>PS5 Digital Edition:&nbsp;AUD $749.95</li>
	<li>PS5 Standard Edition:&nbsp;AUD $829.95</li>
	<li>PS5 Disc Drive:&nbsp;AUD $124.95</li>
</ul><h3>New Zealand</h3>

<ul><li>PS5 Digital Edition:&nbsp;NZD $859.95</li>
	<li>PS5 Standard Edition:&nbsp;NZD $949.95</li>
	<li>PS5 Disc Drive: NZD $139.95</li>
</ul><p>As you'd probably expect given its price is already pretty high, the PS5 Pro's price isn't going anywhere, at least for now. These price increases are strictly for the base PS5 models (well, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-slim-officially-announced-coming-this-holiday-season" rel="nofollow">newer slim models</a>, at any rate).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ps5-price-rises-pro.jpg?itok=FNgXJ0dR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ps5-price-rises-pro.jpg?itok=RcaptrO5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The PS5 Pro won't be subject to the new price hikes.</figcaption></figure><p>This isn't the first time in the last couple of years that Sony has hiked PS5 prices. Back in October 2023, the company upped the cost of its console's Digital Edition by $50 alongside the announcement of the slimmer redesign.</p>

<p>Sony's PS5 price hikes also come at a time when the price of consoles is a hot topic, largely thanks to two things: the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">announcement of the Nintendo Switch 2</a> and its $449.99 price tag, and President Donald Trump's sweeping economic tariffs, which appear to be in constant flux at time of writing.</p>

<p>At any rate, if you want to buy a PS5 (and not a PS5 Pro) in the aforementioned regions, the new price hikes go into effect today. Bear that in mind before you go shopping!</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marathon-release-date-gameplay-revealed</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marathon-release-date-and-first-gameplay-revealed.1163673/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marathon-release-date-gameplay-revealed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bungie has announced a release date for its&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>reboot, which will reimagine the original 90s series of single-player FPS games as a multiplayer extraction shooter.</p>

<p>As revealed over the weekend, the&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>release date is September 23rd. A closed alpha test is also being held between April 23rd and May 4th, and if you want to get into that, you'll have to sign up to the official&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em><a href="https://discord.gg/marathonthegame" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Discord</a> (it's free, though, don't worry).</p>

<p>Narrative director Julia Nardin describes&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>as "both a reimagining of and a direct successor to the original games"; you'll "recognize characters, locations and events" from the original&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>games in the new title, but "those events played out slightly differently" than you may remember.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marathon-release-date-gameplay-revealed-aiming.jpg?itok=MuiY29OP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marathon-release-date-gameplay-revealed-aiming.jpg?itok=INwxFRWe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bungie's&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>reboot lands in September.</figcaption></figure><p>Bungie's goal with&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>is to inject story into the traditional extraction shooter gameplay template, so "new mysteries and stories" will be available to discover in each season. Some of those moments will happen in-game, and others will "go beyond the game", utilizing the likes of ARGs (alternate reality games) and trailers.</p>

<p>As for the gameplay, well,&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>is an extraction shooter, just as you'd expect. You'll team up with up to two other players, facing off against "AI security forces, otherworldly threats, and rival Runner teams" as you explore a lost colony on the planet of Tau Ceti IV.</p>

<p>You'll choose from a range of Runners, each of whom has "unique abilities, stats, and styles", and you'll further customize them using the loot you find while exploring Tau Ceti IV.</p>

<p>You can take a look at&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>'s debut gameplay trailer, which gives a pretty good sense of what kind of game you can expect in September, right here.</p>




<p><em>Marathon</em>'s road to release began back in May 2023, when the reboot of the beloved 90s series <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-resurrects-marathon-playstation-showcase" rel="nofollow">was first announced</a>. Following that, Bungie <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/learn-what-marathon-is-all-about-in-new-video-from-bungie" rel="nofollow">revealed a little more info about the game</a> before dropping off the radar for "an extended period" to develop&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>further.</p>

<p>In the months between then and now, Bungie seemingly ran into some snags with&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>; the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/destiny-2-developer-bungie-suffers-layoffs-among-reported-delays-for-final-shape-and" rel="nofollow">suffered</a> numerous <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-layoffs-200-employees" rel="nofollow">layoffs</a> as&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>was reportedly internally delayed.</p>

<p>Following that, director Christopher Barrett was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marathon-director-fired-report-bungie" rel="nofollow">quietly fired</a> from the project over misconduct allegations last year. He subsequently brought a lawsuit against Sony regarding the dismissal, although Sony <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-christopher-barrett-lawsuit-evidence" rel="nofollow">has pushed back</a> against the claims he made in that lawsuit.</p>

<p><em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3065800/Marathon/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/marathon/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/marathon/9PB32DKQKZDQ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on September 23rd.</p>
