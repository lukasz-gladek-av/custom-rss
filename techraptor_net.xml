            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Tabletop publishing giant Asmodee now completely owns <em>Exploding Kittens</em>. After several years of a strategic investment in the studio, the publisher recently made a move to purchase the remaining stock of the company, gaining complete control over the party game brand.</p><h2>Asmodee's Complete Control of Exploding Kittens</h2><p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/board-games/asmodee-exploding-kittens-buyout" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Wargamer</a>, Asmodee exercised a call option to purchase the 45% minority stake in <em>Exploding Kittens</em>. Since the publisher already owned a 55% stake in the company back in 2021, this would bring 100% ownership of the company under Asmodee. This was a previously communicated intention by Asmodee.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>Asmodee states that the purchase price of the remaining stake will be determined based on the operational performance of Exploding Kittens Inc. for the full year January-December 2025.&nbsp;</p><p>Asmodee's control of <em>Exploding Kittens</em> is a decision that won't adversely affect the studio's output. Both companies have been working closely since 2016, when Asmodee began distributing the studio's games in Europe. In addition, Asmodee's strategic purchases of tabletop developers has been a consistent business practice by the tabletop giant.</p><p><em>Exploding Kittens</em> has undeniable clout when it comes to party games. The titular party game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/interview-shane-small-exploding-kittens" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">insanely popular</a> on release, spawning an animated Netflix show and countless <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/exploding-kittens-good-vs-evil-card-game-announced" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">spin-offs</a>. It even led to the developer creating other popular party games like <em>Throw Throw Burrito </em>and <em>Hand-to-Hand Wombat</em>.</p><p>Admittedly, the studio has also been known for weird marketing stunts and unusual controversy. They had to do a safety recall on several goggles included in copies of <em>Throw Throw Burrito</em> for being <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/exploding-kittens-goggles-might-explode-on-you-product-recall-issued" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">explosive hazards</a>. Then, back during the hype cycle around NFTs, the studio decided to partner with a 3D printing company for <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/exploding-kittens-to-produce-limited-run-printable-nfts" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">"physical NFTs."&nbsp;</a></p><p>As for how Asmodee will guide <em>Exploding Kittens</em>, both as a creative studio and as a brand, that is something only time will tell.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
