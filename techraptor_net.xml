            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A recent third-party <em>Daggerheart</em> crowdfunding campaign has reached its funding goal. The new supplement, <em>Hope Springs Eternal</em>, is a modest addition to Darrington Press' fantasy TTRPG, introducing new campaign frames to the game.</p><h2>The <em>Hope Springs Eternal</em> Kickstarter Campaign</h2><p>According to its <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ericlazure/hope-springs-eternal?ref=rascal.news" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">campaign page</a>, the <em>Hope Springs Eternal</em> Kickstarter campaign is a 120-page supplement that brings five original campaign frames to <em>Daggerheart</em>. Each frame is complemented by a location that is usable in any campaign. The campaign joins a small group of other third-party material for the game, including the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dungeons-of-drakkenheim-daggerheart-triumphs-on-kickstarter-hitting-funding-goal-in" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Dungeons of Drakkenheim</em></a> conversion.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The first campaign frame is the Ever Rime. As the name implies, the setting is set in a frozen land. The last remaining patches of society survive by living on landmasses attached to gigantic, magic-consuming beasts. Players can play as Shepherds, who guide the beasts to sites of natural magic to keep them alive, or Shamans who commune with the Primordial Fire for guidance. Or...they can chart their own path through the ice.</p><p>The second frame in <em>Hope Springs Eternal</em> is The Eternal Song. This is set in the land of Fermata where the fabled Eternal Song has ceased. As for why The Conductor has stopped the song, it is because the notes have become too old and too worn. The players are tasked with finding new notes for the Eternal Song, all while exploring the role culture plays in society, both large and small.</p><p>Frame number three is Gutterpunk Rhapsody. This gritty, dystopian setting is in a gigantic tower where the players, a group of punks, take matters into their own hands to fight back. It is a setting full of alchemical enhancement and unbound greed. Essentially a fantasy spin on cyberpunk dystopia.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The fourth campaign frame, The Last Curtain, is a more contemplative frame designed for caregivers. Players will join a legendary hero on their final journey, their body and mind slowly decaying over the years. It is a frame that explores themes of trauma and reconciliation.</p><p>Last but not least, <em>Hope Springs Eternal</em> has the Poisoned Roots campaign frame. This frame is an intense land where both beauty and rot coexist, one where the focus is less on combat and more on difficult decisions, ones where the greater good may come at the cost of lives your characters hold dear.&nbsp;</p><p>The design team for this supplement includes Eric Lazure, who has written supplements for the Nordic TTRPG, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/vaesen-lost-mountain-saga-brings-nordic-horror-this-halloween" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Vaesen</em></a>. The book will also include artwork by Hector Rodriguez, Kalin Kadlev, and Galen Pejeau (<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dusk" rel="nofollow"><em>DUSK</em></a>).</p><p>The different pledge tiers for Hope Springs Eternal are as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Digital Backer for $20:</strong> A PDF of the book</li><li><strong>The Book Lover for $36:</strong> A softcover physical copy of the book</li></ul><p>At the time of writing, the <em>Hope Springs Eternal</em> Kickstarter campaign has raised $5,725, well past its initial funding goal of $5,000. If you want some extra campaign frames in your <em>Daggerheart</em> games, or want something extra with the recently announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/darrington-press-announces-daggerheart-hope-fear-its-first-official-expansion" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Hope &amp; Fear</em></a> expansion, you have until January 6, 2026, to back the campaign.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
