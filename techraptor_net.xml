            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-extradimensional-crisis<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has revealed a brand new&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>themed booster pack, with Generation VII's cosmic Ultra Beasts headed to the digital card game next week.</p>

<p>Landing on May 29th,&nbsp;<em>Extradimensional Crisis&nbsp;</em>follows on from other themed booster packs like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mythical-island-expansion" rel="nofollow">Mythical Island</a>&nbsp;</em>or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-expansion-shining-revelry" rel="nofollow"><em>Shining Revelry</em></a>; it's not a full expansion like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-celestial-guardians-set" rel="nofollow"><em>Celestial Guardians</em></a>, but it'll still come with plenty of new cards for you to collect.</p>

<p>As revealed in a brand new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Extradimensional Crisis&nbsp;</em>will bring a number of new Ultra Beasts for you to collect, including the ultra-jacked Buzzwole, the all-consuming Guzzlord, and the ethereal jellyfish-like Nihilego.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-extradimensional-crisis-buzzwole.jpg?itok=pzm2HdDB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-extradimensional-crisis-buzzwole.jpg?itok=-fiEAP6j 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>'s new&nbsp;<em>Extradimensional Crisis&nbsp;</em>themed booster pack is coming next week.</figcaption></figure><p>You can also expect other stars of Generation VII to make an appearance in&nbsp;<em>Extradimensional Crisis</em>, including the likes of the legendary Pokemon Tapu Koko, the experimental creature Type: Null, and Alolan Diglett.</p>

<p>The trailer also gives a glimpse of an adorable full-art Rowlet card, in which everyone's favorite little spherical owl has situated himself in a hanging basket. I wish it was possible to be as comfortable as that Rowlet is in real life.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>, it's essentially a mobile version of the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>trading card game. You can collect cards, trade them with your friends (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trade-tokens" rel="nofollow">up to a point, at any rate</a>), and battle to see who's the better trainer.</p>

<p>While the tabletop card game has some rather complex mechanics,&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket </em>is designed for mobile, so it streamlines things to allow you to get into and out of games quickly.</p>




<p>Released in October,&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-dena-revenue" rel="nofollow">an instant success</a> for The Pokemon Company and for developer DeNA, so you can expect to see new booster packs and expansions appearing in the game for the foreseeable future, at least.</p>

<p><em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.pokemon.pokemontcgp&amp;hl=en_GB" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pok%C3%A9mon-tcg-pocket/id6479970832" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">iOS</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/embracer-renaming-to-fellowship-entertainment-coffee-stain-to-spin-off-this-year.1196214/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-fellowship-entertainment-coffee-stain<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Embracer Group has announced that it plans to spin out Coffee Stain into its own entity by the end of the year, and that the group itself will also be undergoing a name change by that time.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-to-spin-off-coffee-stain-group-remaining-business-to-be-renamed-fellowship-entertainment/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a> on the official Embracer website, Coffee Stain Group will be spun off "into a standalone group of community-driven game developers and publishers" by the end of the 2025 calendar year.</p>

<p>By that same time, Embracer Group will be renamed Fellowship Entertainment, completing the company's plan to spin itself off into three separate companies, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-splitting-three-companies" rel="nofollow">originally announced last year</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/satisfactory-coffee-stain-embracer-group.jpg?itok=L6LnZdIB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/satisfactory-coffee-stain-embracer-group.jpg?itok=JBm-3Fs2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Coffee Stain will soon become its own entity.</figcaption></figure><p>Coffee Stain CEO Anton Westbergh says the move to become its own entity will give the company "the clarity and control" to navigate a "competitive" industry landscape. He goes on to say the goal is still "supporting our developers, staying close to our communities, and building an even brighter future for Coffee Stain".</p>

<p>For his part, Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors says Westbergh's "strategy and leadership" will help Coffee Stain in "attracting and enabling partnerships with like-minded independent game developers and talents".</p>

<p>As for Embracer itself, despite its new name, Fellowship Entertainment won't just be stewarding the&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings&nbsp;</em>IP (although that'll certainly be a major part of its mission statement).</p>

<p>The company will take with it other IPs like&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em>,&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor</em>,&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Dead Island</em>, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/4a-games-zen-studios-embracer" rel="nofollow">the&nbsp;<em>Metro&nbsp;</em>series</a>, for which a new game is currently in the works from developer 4A.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metro-embracer-group-coffee-stain.jpg?itok=D6GIwXz- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metro-embracer-group-coffee-stain.jpg?itok=x_vBraWs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Fellowship Entertainment, formerly Embracer Group, will take properties like&nbsp;<em>Metro&nbsp;</em>with it to its new name.</figcaption></figure><p>Studios under Fellowship Entertainment's stewardship include the aforementioned 4A Games, as well as porting studio Aspyr, publishers Plaion and THQ Nordic, and&nbsp;<em>Remnant&nbsp;</em>developer Gunfire Games, among many others.</p>

<p>Embracer isn't technically going away, however; CEO Lars Wingefors will establish a new privately-owned company by the name of Embracer AB, which will hold shares in the three entities spun off from the former Embracer Group (<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/asmodee-group-saddled-with-eu900-million-debt-by-embracer-group" rel="nofollow">Asmodee</a>, Coffee Stain, and Fellowship).</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what Embracer's business strategy means for the studios under its wing, but for now, it looks like nothing in the immediate term will be changing. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-review-one-man-army</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-review-one-man-army<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I don't think anyone had a turn-based tactics game set in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-shredders-revenge" rel="nofollow"><em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle</em>s</a> universe on their bingo card, but here we are. Perhaps an even more unlikely combination is that <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</em> is developed by Strange Scaffold.</p>

<p>Strange Scaffold is a developer known for robust zaniness and unconventional concepts, so their spin on&nbsp;the half-shell heroes is just that: Unexpected. Known for working as a team, the turtles are a force to be reckoned with, but Strange Scaffold turns the concept on its head and asks, "What if the Turtles split up?"</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-level-changes.jpg?itok=2xCY4qZs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-level-changes.jpg?itok=JcsGcQJG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Gotta get a move it. It's just you, after all.</figcaption></figure><h2>Lone Wolves -- or Rather -- Lone Turtles</h2>

<p>Indeed, rather than taking control of all four Turtles at once, this tactics title asks players to control one character per level. Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael, and Michelangelo are all doing their own thing in a post-Shredder, post-Splinter world, and that's led them down different paths.</p>

<p>In <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</em>, levels feature grid-based tiles a la <a href="https://techraptor.net/series/fire-emblem" rel="nofollow"><em>Fire Emblem</em></a>. Levels are dynamic and throw new obstacles at you as you're told to rush forward to an objective or slay a certain number of enemies. All the while, you have Foot Clan goons ready to pounce on your Turtle. You are, essentially, a lone wolf blazing a path forward against uneven odds.</p>

<p><em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</em>'s greatest strength is the solo aspect of gameplay; it's also the game's greatest weakness. Like I said, each level has a designated character, so you're forced into the role of a specific Turtle. This gives each character an even amount of playtime to explore their diverse set of abilities.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-rooftop-brawl.jpg?itok=A6pw7GrP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-rooftop-brawl.jpg?itok=Vt3e3QVe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Time to kick some baddies.</figcaption></figure><p>That said, I can't help but wish that all four turtles could be played at once. Sure, we've seen the whole gang fight together numerous times, but that's what makes <em>Ninja Turtles</em> what it is. Level design is somewhat toned down to be minimalistic to balance around controlling one unit per level.</p>

<p>The gameplay is very safe and doesn't try anything daring. Would we had all four turtles together fighting against hordes of Foot Clan, I can just imagine the great synergy and chaos that could ensue.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-store.jpg?itok=p6YtRcsI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-store.jpg?itok=TjG6YMCW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You can also buy more abilities in the store!</figcaption></figure><h2>The Turtles' Tools of the Trade</h2>

<p>But for all my gripes, Strange Scaffold does an admirable job of making every Turtle feel distinguished and powerful on their own. The Turtles' abilities reflect that of their personalities: Leonardo is a brutal force to be reckoned with and easily the most powerful of the four. Donatello uses gadgets to maneuver around the map and shock his enemies.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Michelangelo skates around on his board with high mobility, flipping around enemies. Raphael, probably my least favorite of the bunch to play, is still a powerhouse, especially with his Berserker ability, which leeches health from KO'd enemies.</p>

<p>Combat generally revolves around careful consideration of spending your limited amount of action points. Wise usage of these points and positioning your unit well is crucial for survival, especially being one character. You can get surrounded by the Foot Clan pretty easily if you're not careful.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-leonardo.jpg?itok=kPdGvvAi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-leonardo.jpg?itok=hWzoNx0L 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Time to get Radical.</figcaption></figure><p>One crucial component of the Turtles' attacks is buffs and debuffs. Like in Leonardo's case, getting a KO with his Rad Slash attack grants a stack of Radical, which increases the damage of his next attack. In a similar fashion, on KO, Leonardo's Feint Cut adds a stack of Evasion, allowing him to completely dodge an attack.</p>

<p>It's all about the manipulation of these buffs rather than just trying to defeat as many Foot Clan ninjas as you can. Of course, debuffs play a huge part in <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</em> as well. Donatello, for instance, can use Stun Kunai to cause the Stuck debuff, keeping enemies in place for a round.</p>

<p>Playing with debuffs, especially Stuck,<em> Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</em> appeals to the tactical gamer in me. Throwing down Donatello's shock traps, applying Stuck, and watching multiple enemies get KO'd in a single round is cathartic.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/donatello-shock-traps-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown.jpg?itok=wSBwB9sa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/donatello-shock-traps-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown.jpg?itok=mSlfLWmB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>No one's gettin' to me with this impenetrable wall of shock traps.</figcaption></figure><h2>Goin' on a Rampage in<em> Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown </em></h2>

<p>Once you get the hang of how each turtle plays,&nbsp;<em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</em> isn't all that challenging. The first few levels are a little tricky, just because you're not familiar with their skills. After a few rounds, you'll start going through Foot Clan baddies like nothin'.</p>

<p>Leonardo is <em>especially</em> powerful, and for most of his levels, he is nearly invincible if you use your abilities competently. It's great to fulfill that power fantasy, but victory feels like it comes too easily.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-leonardo-gameplay.jpg?itok=S08iu2eb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-leonardo-gameplay.jpg?itok=ntUkd4Vl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The odds are stacked against them.</figcaption></figure><p>Moreover, enemy variety is lacking. There are only a handful of enemies, and most of them are simply standard goons with three health. Those can be taken out in a hit or two. The more powerful ones are just slower and tankier, and a few other enemies thrown into the mix, like ninjas that spawn with their own stack of Evasion, hardly pose a challenge.</p>

<p>It <em>is </em>fun to faceroll these enemies and plow through levels. A lot of the Turtles' abilities allow for you to push enemies. Pushing enemies off the edge of the map for a cheap kill is always satisfying. So, while I do enjoy the combat and variety each of the group brings,&nbsp;<em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</em> is lacking in terms of difficulty and enemy variety.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-donatello.jpg?itok=gqBiErXO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-donatello.jpg?itok=ljMT0LRI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Donatello, always the brains of the operation.</figcaption></figure><h2>A Blasé Adventure for the Gang</h2>

<p>My understanding of <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em> lore is, admittedly, surface level. I dressed up as Leonardo as a kid for dinner every night, enjoyed the occasional episode of the show, and I still play the games that come out. Still, I'm not an expert with the story by any stretch of the imagination.</p>

<p>With that in mind, one of Strange Scaffolds' strengths is writing.&nbsp;Unfortunately, I just don't see that strength on display here. The idea that Shredder and Splinter are dead and the group is out on their own is a concept that opens the door to multiple intriguing narratives. Most of the dialogue just isn't compelling.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Ninja Turtles comprise such strong personalities, and while the tech-geek side of Donatello or the rapscallion nature of Michelangelo shines through in some instances,&nbsp; nothing about it really captivated me. It's a breezy game, too, so there's little time for the narrative to get rolling when it can be completed in five or so hours.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-ost-unlock.jpg?itok=tepbRM_S 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-ost-unlock.jpg?itok=vrh4sEF5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You can unlock songs to listen to at your leisure. The OST in <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</em> is quite excellent!</figcaption></figure>

<p>The art style is something I'm conflicted on. I'm a fan of the classic look of the Turtles, and the figurine-like models of the characters and enemies can be endearing. The UI, with its punk, grafiti-like aesthetic oozes with that <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle</em> charm. The rest of it, well, it's a bit bland.</p>

<p>Levels take place in four areas: The streets of New York, the sewer, the subway, and the rooftops. Spend a moment on the subway as Leonardo, and you've pretty much seen how the rest of his levels will look. The sewers, yeah, they're the same throughout Donatello's handful of levels, too.</p>

<p>Despite some gripes,&nbsp;<em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown </em>is a charming and competently made tactical game. It feels a bit subdued, especially with the focus on controlling one single Ninja Turtle per level. Despite this, the Turtles themselves feel distinct enough, and there's just the right amount of strategy for it to be a good-but-not-radical time.</p>
