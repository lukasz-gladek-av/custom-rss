            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-pre-orders-delayed-canada<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has confirmed that Switch 2 pre-orders in Canada have been delayed, following on from the company's decision last week to push back the pre-order window for the console in the US.</p>

<p>On Friday last week, Nintendo announced that US Switch 2 pre-orders <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/us-switch-2-pre-orders-delayed-tariffs" rel="nofollow">would be delayed</a> in order to give the Japanese gaming giant time to assess "evolving market conditions" brought about by President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs.</p>

<p>Now, in a statement given to Canadian tech news platform <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2025/04/08/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-canada-delay/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">MobileSyrup</a>, Nintendo has confirmed that Switch 2 pre-orders in the US' neighboring Canada will also be delayed. Pre-orders in Canada were originally due to open on April 9th, but a new date hasn't been announced.</p>

<p>Just like in the US, however, Nintendo hasn't given any suggestion that the Switch 2's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">release date of June 5th</a> will be delayed in Canada. It is, however, possible that the console's price will be changed, although no price change has been announced in either country.</p>

<p>This also shouldn't affect pre-orders in any other countries, although as usual, it's worth keeping an eye out for any specific announcements pertaining to your country of residence to be on the safe side.</p>

<p>Just in case you need a reminder, Nintendo fully revealed the Switch 2 last week. Launching on June 5th, the console will cost $450 in the US and around $630 in Canada (at least, as far as we know).</p>




<p>The Switch 2's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-launch-lineup" rel="nofollow">launch lineup</a> will include the likes of racer&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a>, as well as tech demo-style title&nbsp;<em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em>, which, despite its title, won't be a free pack-in game.</p>

<p>As far as we know, the Switch 2 will still be launching on June 5th in Canada. Nintendo will likely announce when pre-orders will open in both the US and Canada in the coming days or weeks, so stay tuned for more.</p>
