            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Gaddy Games has announced the release date for the 1.0 version of terraforming sim&nbsp;<em>Plan B: Terraform</em>, and it's coming pretty soon.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Plan B: Terraform&nbsp;</em>1.0 will be launching on August 29th, by which point the game will have been in Early Access for around two and a half years. That's pretty significantly over and above the originally-intended 1.0 release date of "early 2024", but hey, these things happen.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Plan B: Terraform</em>, Gaddy Games describes it as a "planetary-scale terraforming and resource management game" which, when it hits 1.0, will deliver a "meditative sci-fi simulation, grounded in real climate science and sustainable systems".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/plan-b-terraform-1.0-release-date-overview.jpg?itok=Ogsj-3RB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/plan-b-terraform-1.0-release-date-overview.jpg?itok=E_ZlCSOr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Plan B: Terraform&nbsp;</em>is hitting 1.0 late next month.</figcaption></figure><p>While the Early Access period might have gone on a little longer than Gaddy Games originally intended, that time has been used to implement "continuous evolution", according to the studio.</p>

<p>Features added during Early Access include "overhauled levels and objectives, new transportation systems...and key improvements to the UI and terrain". In short, if you haven't checked this one out since it launched a couple of years ago, you may well find a very different game if you play it now.</p>

<p>As you might expect from a terraforming game,&nbsp;<em>Plan B: Terraform&nbsp;</em>has plenty of realistic environmental simulations for you to enjoy. These include a "dynamically simulated water cycle", a "scientifically grounded climate simulation", and extensive resource gathering systems as well.</p>

<p>It's all wrapped up in a world that contains "over a million hexagons", according to Gaddy Games, and on those hexagons, you'll build settlements that will grow into thriving metropolises. You'd better believe managing the infrastructure for those cities is on the cards as well.</p>




<p><em>Plan B: Terraform&nbsp;</em>launches in full on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1894430/Plan_B_Terraform/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> on August 29th, where it's also currently available via Early Access. If you're a fan of meditative sims like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/planet-crafter" rel="nofollow">The Planet Crafter</a>&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/astroneer" rel="nofollow"><em>Astroneer</em></a>, you'll probably get a kick out of this one, but don't take my word for it; there's a free demo available on Steam right now!</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/magic-inn-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cute-wizard-innkeeper-sim-magic-inn-launches-this-august.1242981/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Magic Inn</em>, a "charming tavern life simulator" from developer and publisher Purpledoor Studios, is officially launching next month, the studio has revealed.</p>

<p>The game was originally slated for release <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2468630/view/538842113820852740" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">in April</a>&nbsp;(which itself constitutes a delay from the originally intended release date), but was subsequently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2468630/view/497193144876532222" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pushed back</a> to the second quarter of 2025. Now, however, Purpledoor Studios is ready to reveal the official release date: August 4th.</p>

<p>As the name suggests,&nbsp;<em>Magic Inn&nbsp;</em>lets you run your very own tavern, but with a twist: you play an "exiled wizard-turned-innkeeper", and your duties involve not only ensuring everything runs smoothly, but also learning and casting the right spells to help you do so.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-inn-release-date-cooking.jpg?itok=lkBs-Bg8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-inn-release-date-cooking.jpg?itok=PKYjkqdm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Magic Inn&nbsp;</em>is a cute life sim with a magical twist.</figcaption></figure><p>After being exiled from your home, you must take on the running of the titular magic inn and gradually build it up into a true 5-star resort. To do so, you'll need to hire great staff, create unforgettable recipes, and befriend the locals in order to secure goods.</p>

<p>You'll have to manage not only the inn itself, but also its individual staff members and rooms, ensuring that everything is up to code, as it were. Purpledoor says even the King himself might visit, and if he does, you'll need to be sure he finds only perfection.</p>

<p><em>Magic Inn&nbsp;</em>will also feature a rather intriguing-looking card battling system that represents the game's conversations; everything from negotiation through to persuasion and even attraction is handled through "conversation-driving card battles", as Purpledoor puts it.</p>

<p>Of course, the card battling system also includes...well, combat. You can send out parties of adventurers to do battle with monsters and gather loot, which you can then use to craft new tools and improve your inn further.</p>

<p>You can wishlist&nbsp;<em>Magic Inn</em> on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2468630/Magic_Inn/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>, and you can also check out a demo for the game if you're on the fence.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Summer Games Done Quick 2025 Raises Over $2.4m for Charity]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/summer-games-done-quick-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/summer-games-done-quick-2025-raises-over-2-4m-for-charity.1242927/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Summer Games Done Quick 2025 has concluded, and the annual charity speedrunning event has racked up an impressive amount of money for medical charity Doctors Without Borders, otherwise known as&nbsp;Médecins Sans Frontières.</p>

<p>Per a press release, SGDQ 2025 raised over $2.4 million for the charity, with over 2,600 people attending the event in person and watching speedruns for games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/sekiro-shadows-die-twice" rel="nofollow"><em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/blue-prince" rel="nofollow"><em>Blue Prince</em></a>.</p>

<p>The amount raised this year is comparable to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/summer-games-done-quick-2024" rel="nofollow">last year's total</a>, which came to around $2.5m, so it looks like SGDQ is just as popular as it's ever been, which will no doubt put a smile on the faces of the Games Done Quick folks.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mario-kart-world-summer-game-fest-2025.jpg?itok=jnrtH5-y 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mario-kart-world-summer-game-fest-2025.jpg?itok=RxabOPZc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>has already made it to Summer Games Done Quick.</figcaption></figure><p>Other highlights of Summer Games Done Quick 2025 included a run of&nbsp;<em>AEW Fight Forever</em>, during which "the audience raised signs and roared with growing excitement as if watching a real wrestling match", as GDQ puts it.</p>

<p>A number of new stalls and features were also present during this year's SGDQ, including a new "artist alley", in which attendees could wander booths set up by indie developers and try out those devs' games, which is a neat touch.</p>

<p>If you were lucky enough to attend SGDQ in person, you may also have caught the live performance by gaming-themed band The Megas, who performed pieces based around games like&nbsp;<em>Mega Man&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Castlevania</em>. Nerd heaven, right?</p>

<p>As for what lies in GDQ's future, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gdq-flame-fatales-118k-malala" rel="nofollow">Flame Fatales showcase</a> is set to air in September. It's a celebration of all things female and femme in gaming, and it starts on September 7th.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sly-cooper-flame-fatales-2024.jpg?itok=m6XikvbT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sly-cooper-flame-fatales-2024.jpg?itok=4ySnG8-F 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Flame Fatales will return later this year.</figcaption></figure><p>After that, it's the new Games Done Queer event, which will celebrate queerness in gaming and which will take place from late October to early November. Of course, Awesome Games Done Quick will be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/awesome-games-done-quick-2025" rel="nofollow">coming back in January</a> as well.</p>
