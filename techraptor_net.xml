            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/my-little-puppy-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Krafton and developer Dreamotion have announced&nbsp;<em>My Little Puppy</em>, an adorable-looking adventure in which you play a corgi who's waiting to greet their owner in the afterlife. Sniff.</p>

<p>Per a press release, the thesis of&nbsp;<em>My Little Puppy&nbsp;</em>is that "when a person departs from this world, the dog who went ahead will warmly welcome them". Dreamotion head Lee Joon-young says the game was created "to offer warmth and comfort" to those whose dogs have passed away.</p>

<p><em>My Little Puppy</em>'s little doggo protagonist must set out on a journey across the afterlife to meet their owner, exploring "oceans, deserts, and snowy plains" along the way.</p>

I don't know if I have the emotional strength for this.</p>

<p>Not only that, but you'll be able to engage in what Dreamotion and Krafton call "interactions based on real dog behaviors", including sniffing other dogs, barking, and, well, just hangin' around as a fluffy lil' dog. What's not to love?</p>

<p>Lest you fear that&nbsp;<em>My Little Puppy&nbsp;</em>won't have the kind of gameplay variation to keep you engaged, however, think again. It'll feature "a range of gameplay genres, from adventure to action and racing", according to the two studios.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>My Little Puppy&nbsp;</em>right here. Just try to make it through the whole thing without welling up.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/yakuza-creator-next-game-time-to-finish<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Toshihiro Nagoshi, the creator of the&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon&nbsp;</em>franchise (formerly known as&nbsp;<em>Yakuza</em>), has revealed some new tidbits of information regarding his next project, and if you're hoping for something less bloated and overstuffed than many modern games, you may well be in luck.</p>

<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202411/23768" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Famitsu</a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/yakuza-creator-says-his-new-game-will-be-an-action-adventure-with-a-rather-high-age-rating-and-complex-game-system/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Automaton Media</a>), Nagoshi says he wants players to be able to complete his new game in "a sensible amount of time", suggesting that the age of games' size being a selling point "is coming to an end".</p>

<p>Nagoshi says that the amount of games available to gamers right now is "bordering on excessive"; he says there are so many games available now that "you can't play them all", and it's hard to disagree with him on that front.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/toshihiro-nagoshi-yakuza-creator-majima-kiryu.jpg?itok=WLhR55Vs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/toshihiro-nagoshi-yakuza-creator-majima-kiryu.jpg?itok=w7jkD6fF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Toshihiro Nagoshi was responsible for creating the&nbsp;<em>Yakuza&nbsp;</em>(now&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon</em>) franchise.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Nagoshi, his new project will achieve a "high level of expression" in terms of its character drama, and the game will be "large scale", although it seemingly won't take you hundreds of hours to finish.</p>

<p>In fact, Nagoshi says that his team is currently trying to find ways to make the in-game map smaller because it's currently "too large", which is a rather endearing thing to admit.</p>

<p>Although Nagoshi says his game's systems are complex, he also says he intends the game to be played by adults; it'll have a "rather high age rating", according to Nagoshi himself, and it'll espouse a unique worldview that will make people "think 'What's that? I need to see more' when they first see it".</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hello-neighbor-3-officially-revealed-original-creator-heading-up-team.1032489/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hello-neighbor-3-revealed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>tinyBuild has officially announced&nbsp;<em>Hello Neighbor 3</em>, a third mainline entry in the cult classic horror series, and what's more, it boasts the involvement of the franchise's original creator.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Hello Neighbor 3</em>&nbsp;is officially in development, and franchise creator Nikita Kolesnikov is heading up "a small team of developers" to help bring to life what tinyBuild calls a game full of "systems-based exploration".</p>

<p>You'll explore the town of Raven Brooks as an outsider, enjoying a "cozy yet eerie adventure" as you get to know the locals and their "distinct personalities, circumstances, and desires". It sort of sounds like the original&nbsp;<em>Hello Neighbor&nbsp;</em>meets&nbsp;<em>Pathologic</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hello-neighbor-3-announced-yard.jpg?itok=ipNR9EN1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hello-neighbor-3-announced-yard.jpg?itok=gXxd6hRw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hello Neighbor 3</em>'s development process apparently closely mirrors that of the first game.</figcaption></figure><p>The publisher promises that you'll be able to "stick to the shadows in a full simulation" in which you can make decisions, and making said decisions can "potentially unleash catastrophic consequences" upon the inhabitants of Raven Brooks.</p>

<p>In the screenshots tinyBuild has released so far, the art style of&nbsp;<em>Hello Neighbor&nbsp;</em>looks like something of a departure from its predecessors, utilizing moodier and more muddy colors, although it's still got the strange, spindly art style you know (and potentially love).</p>

<p>Kolesnikov says he's hoping that early alphas of&nbsp;<em>Hello Neighbor 3&nbsp;</em>will be available to try out soon, and that he's excited to "keep the development of&nbsp;<em>Hello Neighbor 3&nbsp;</em>in an open format", so presumably, we'll be hearing more about how the project is coming along soon.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hello-neighbor-3-announced-original-game.jpg?itok=EhmrSxgg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hello-neighbor-3-announced-original-game.jpg?itok=pEQQNLnK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hello Neighbor 3</em>'s art style looks more realistic and gloomy than that of its predecessors.</figcaption></figure><p>Although&nbsp;<em>Hello Neighbor 3&nbsp;</em>may have that number at the end of its title, it's far from the third&nbsp;<em>Hello Neighbor&nbsp;</em>game overall.</p>

<p>After the first game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hello-neighbor-delayed-to-december-8" rel="nofollow">fully released in late 2017</a>, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hello-neighbor-card-game-lets-you-betray-your-friends" rel="nofollow">number</a> of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hello-engineer-releases-first-on-stadia" rel="nofollow">spinoffs</a> ensued, as well as a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hello-neighbor-2-announced" rel="nofollow">full-blooded sequel</a> in the form of&nbsp;<em>Hello Neighbor 2&nbsp;</em>(which began life in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tinybuild-announces-hello-neighbor-spinoff-hello-guest-and-not-e3-event" rel="nofollow">pre-alpha form as&nbsp;<em>Hello Guest</em></a>).</p>

<p><em>Hello Neighbor 3&nbsp;</em>will be released for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2789680/Hello_Neighbor_3/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, although we don't have a release date for it yet, nor do we know whether it's coming to consoles as well.
