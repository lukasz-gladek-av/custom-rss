            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-duskbloods-fromsoftware-nintendo-switch-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls&nbsp;</em>developer FromSoftware has announced&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods</em>, a multiplayer-focused Switch 2-exclusive PvPvE game with more than a hint of the creator's other franchises about it.</p>

<p><em>The Duskbloods&nbsp;</em>was revealed as part of today's Nintendo Direct presentation, alongside the likes of Switch 2 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">launch lineup game&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">Mario Kart World</a>&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2" rel="nofollow">3D platformer&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></a>, which is coming in July.</p>

<p>The debut trailer for the game looks suitably&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne</em>-esque, with a lot of Victorian-era architecture looming over imposing-looking backstreets, although the arrival of a futuristic-looking train does throw the usual FromSoftware vibe off a little (in a good way!).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-duskbloods-switch-2-fromsoftware-moon.jpg?itok=RjvN1WrO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-duskbloods-switch-2-fromsoftware-moon.jpg?itok=pDjlOX4k 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Yup, that looks like a FromSoftware creation alright.</figcaption></figure><p>There's plenty of classic FromSoftware imagery and music in the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods</em>. Whether it's an imposing-looking cathedral with a massive stained-glass window or a horrific monster crawling towards the camera in an underground lair, it looks like you'll get your money's worth from this one.</p>

<p>While this trailer does show off some of the gameplay you can expect from&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods</em>, it's a typically elliptical FromSoftware creation, so it's not giving too much away. You'll see brief moments of gameplay rather than extended sequences.</p>

<p>Indeed, not much about the game is given away at all in its initial announcement; it'll revolve around something called "moontears", and blood appears to be a prominent theme in&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods</em>, but we'll likely learn more in the coming months.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for FromSoftware's&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods&nbsp;</em>right here.</p>




<p><em>The Duskbloods&nbsp;</em>is one of many games coming to the Switch 2 in the next year or so; others include ports of games like&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6</em>, as well as a new&nbsp;<em>Hyrule Warriors&nbsp;</em>game and many more.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods&nbsp;</em>when it launches exclusively for Switch 2 sometime next year. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, a brand new game in the&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong&nbsp;</em>series and the beloved ape's first 3D platformer since 1999's&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong 64</em>.</p>

<p>As revealed during today's Switch 2 Direct show,&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>will launch exclusively for the Nintendo Switch 2 on July 17th, so it'll just miss the console's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">launch date of June 5th</a>&nbsp;and won't be included as part of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-launch-lineup" rel="nofollow">Switch 2 launch lineup</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, since this is a&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong&nbsp;</em>game, the story of&nbsp;<em>Bananza&nbsp;</em>revolves around DK uncovering a treasure trove of golden bananas, only for them to be stolen away by the nefarious VoidCo, causing him to set out on a quest to retrieve his hoard.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-switch-2-minecart.jpg?itok=5qnpfEqb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-switch-2-minecart.jpg?itok=4kX4NB7v 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>is DK's first 3D platforming outing in many years.</figcaption></figure><p>Donkey Kong sports a design inspired by his old-school arcade self in&nbsp;<em>Bananza</em>, and I think it's pretty cute. He's got a rather expressive face that lends itself well to the world in which he finds himself for this adventure.</p>

<p>The trailer shows DK platforming his way around a few open-looking environments, as well as burrowing down into the ground to explore the level below the surface.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It isn't clear to what extent you'll be able to seamlessly transition between above-ground levels and underground stages, but I'd expect that given the Switch 2's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-specs-revealed" rel="nofollow">still-relatively-modest tech specs</a>, that's not going to be the case.</p>

<p>In any case, you can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, which shows off a fair bit of gameplay and DK's endearing redesign, right here.</p>




<p><em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>is just one of a number of games coming to the Switch 2. Others include&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a>, which is coming at launch alongside new versions of&nbsp;<em>Breath of the Wild&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, as well as games like EA's hugely successful&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>when it <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/featured-games/donkey-kong-bananza/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">launches for Switch 2</a> on July 17th.</p>
