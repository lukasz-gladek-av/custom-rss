            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/11-bit-studios-layoffs-project-8<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>developer and publisher 11 bit studios has laid off an unknown number of staff and canceled an upcoming project previously codenamed&nbsp;<em>Project 8</em>.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://ir.11bitstudios.com/en/news/11-bit-studios-ends-development-of-project-8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message to investors</a>, the studio confirms that its management has "resolved to discontinue the development of the game codenamed&nbsp;<em>Project 8</em>", and that this discontinuation will result in a loss of around 48.4 million Polish zloty (that's about $11 million).</p>

<p>Board president&nbsp;Przemysław Marszał says that&nbsp;<em>Project 8&nbsp;</em>was "conceived under very different conditions" for the industry, during a time when "narrative-driven, story-rich games held stronger appeal".</p>

<p>Together with what&nbsp;Marszał calls "revised sales forecasts, largely reflecting the changing market environment", caused management to harbor "significant doubts" about&nbsp;<em>Project 8</em>'s "overall profitability", hence its cancellation.</p>

<p>Shutting down&nbsp;<em>Project 8&nbsp;</em>will also result in layoffs,&nbsp;Marszał and 11 bit say. The studio doesn't disclose exactly how many employees' jobs are on the line, but&nbsp;Marszał does say that "more than half" of&nbsp;<em>Project 8</em>'s 37 developers will be offered opportunities to work elsewhere within 11 bit.</p>

<p>In closing,&nbsp;Marszał says that despite this setback, 11 bit has what he calls a "clear and well-defined roadmap" for its future projects, including the continuation of work on&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-alters-delayed-2025" rel="nofollow">release of upcoming sci-fi adventure&nbsp;<em>The Alters</em></a>.</p>

<p>The studio itself <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-2-profitable-sales-350k" rel="nofollow">said that the game was already profitable</a> just a few days after launch, but shares in the company plummeted after&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2</em>'s release, with <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/shares-video-game-maker-11-bit-studios-slump-after-frostpunk-2-release-2024-09-23/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an analyst saying</a> the game's Steam player peak was "a negative surprise" compared to expectations.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-kadokawa-biggest-shareholder</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-to-become-fromsoftware-parent-kadokawas-biggest-shareholder.1065213/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-kadokawa-biggest-shareholder<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has acquired more shares in FromSoftware's parent company Kadokawa, which will make the Japanese gaming giant Kadokawa's biggest single shareholder (although it still doesn't have a majority stake).</p>

<p>According to a GamesIndustry.biz <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sony-to-become-largest-shareholder-of-fromsoftware-parent-kadokawa-corporation" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, Sony has agreed to acquire over 12 million Kadokawa shares in January to the tune of about $318 million. This will give Sony a stake of around 10% in Kadokawa, making it the single largest shareholder in the company.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that as GI.biz points out, Sony already has a 14% stake in Kadokawa subsidiary FromSoftware, having <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tencent-and-sony-buy-over-30-shares-in-from-software" rel="nofollow">purchased shares in the studio back in August 2022</a> alongside Chinese gaming monolith Tencent (which has a 16% stake in FromSoftware, but no stake in Kadokawa).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-fromsoftware-kadokawa-sony.jpg?itok=hK0K9CiH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-fromsoftware-kadokawa-sony.jpg?itok=dIPkn9f0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>FromSoftware parent company Kadokawa could be closer to an acquisition deal with Sony.</figcaption></figure><p>According to the GI.biz report, the acquisition deal "goes beyond the sale of shares" and also includes plans for Sony to adapt Kadokawa IP into "live-action films and TV dramas", as well as an expansion of publishing and distribution for Kadokawa's games and anime.</p>

<p>This news comes just a few weeks after Kadokawa <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-kadokawa-purchase-report" rel="nofollow">confirmed that it was in talks</a> for Sony to acquire it outright, but that no decision had been made as yet. This deal could see Sony moving one step closer towards that acquisition.</p>

<p>While Kadokawa is perhaps best known as the parent company of&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>developer FromSoftware, it's also the owner of companies like <i>Zero Escape&nbsp;</i>studio Spike Chunsoft and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kadokawa-acquire-purchase" rel="nofollow"><em>Octopath Traveler&nbsp;</em>developer Acquire</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/octopath-traveler-acquire-kadokawa.jpg?itok=W4n1dMCy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/octopath-traveler-acquire-kadokawa.jpg?itok=d9cC1QRk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Kadokawa also owns&nbsp;<em>Octopath Traveler&nbsp;</em>studio Acquire, among others.</figcaption></figure><p>Still, FromSoftware arguably remains Kadokawa's most well-known and successful subsidiary, especially if the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-25-million" rel="nofollow">sales of open-world action RPG&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-25-million" rel="nofollow">Elden Ring</a>&nbsp;</em>are anything to go by.</p>

<p>Other recent successful Kadokawa releases include&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</em>, another game published by Bandai Namco, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-sales-3m" rel="nofollow">topped three million sales in a single day</a> and which also recently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-update-splitscreen" rel="nofollow">received an update bringing split-screen multiplayer to all of its stages</a>.</p>

<p><em>Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>isn't the only Spike Chunsoft release to land in the last few weeks, either. Roguelike RPG&nbsp;<em>Shiren the Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island&nbsp;</em>also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shiren-wanderer-mystery-dungeon-of-serpentcoil-island-pc" rel="nofollow">netted itself a PC release recently</a>, having netted itself 200,000 sales on Switch in Japan "quickly" after release.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen whether Sony's acquisition of more shares in Kadokawa will eventually lead to an outright purchase. Stay tuned for more on this.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/free-mullet-madjack-update-features-ultrakill<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The high-octane, fast-and-loud shooter <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/mullet-madjack-review-nostalgia-fueled-frenzy" rel="nofollow"><em>Mullet MadJack</em></a> launched to <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/16689/mullet-madjack" rel="nofollow">wide acclaim</a> from critics, and with a new crossover update featuring <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/new-blood-interactive" rel="nofollow">New Blood Interactive's</a> <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/ultrakill" rel="nofollow">ULTRAKILL</a>,</em> there's even more to rave about.</p>

<p>The bulk of new content comes in the form of Boss Rush Mode. Fight against the clock and slay <em>Mullet MadJack</em>'s various bosses and compete with global rankings for the highest score. Make it to the final boss of the Mode and you'll be met with a surprise: a character from <em>ULTRAKILL.</em></p>


<p>V2 from <em>ULTRAKILL</em> makes an appearance and you'll have to fight head-to-head against this extremely lethal machine. Fans of <em>ULTRAKILL</em> will recognize this as a punishing boss encounter, and the crossover makes for an exciting addition to <em>Mullet MadJack</em>.</p>

<p><em>Mullet MadJack</em> is a roguelite first-person shooter featuring fast gameplay. Players have only a handful of seconds to make it to the next floor. Recover precious time by slaying robobillionaires and save the love of your life. With a story-based Campaign mode as well as an endless Survival mode, Boss Rush will make a fine addition to the critically-acclaimed title.</p>



<p><em>ULTRAKILL </em>is an equally fast-paced shooter, with a brutal difficulty curve and plenty of style. Take control of a killer robot called V1 and literally bathe in the blood of your enemies to regain health. It's currently in Early Access and, while the official launch of <em>ULTRAKILL</em> is still up in the air, it's received quite a bit of buzz from fans with over 100,000 Steam reviews.</p>

<p>Whether you're a fan of <em>Mullet MadJack </em>or <em>ULTRAKILL</em>, fans won't have to wait long for this crossover. The update -- featuring Boss Rush Mode and Punished V2 as its final encounter -- is available for download today on PC.</p>

<p>For now, this crossover is exclusive only to <em>Mullet MadJack</em>, but who knows? Maybe we'll see something in <em>ULTRAKILL</em> in the future.</p>
