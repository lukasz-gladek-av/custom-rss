            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Which came first: the first cave painting or the first stone carved by humans? Did the start of the construction of the Great Wall of China happen before or after the invention of the crossbow? These are the questions you and your family will have to suss out over a game of <em>Timeline</em>, a brilliantly simple but wonderfully thought-provoking family game from <a href="https://www.dobblegame.com/en/games/#category-timeline" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Zygomatic</a>. Publisher Asmodee USA sent along a copy of the new 2025 refresh of the game, as well as the new expansion <em>Games &amp; Leisure</em>, to check out - so let's see if it's right for your family and friends.</p><h2>What Is <em>Timeline</em>?</h2><p><em>Timeline</em> is a simple family game for 2 - 6 players (though in all reality, and certainly with additional expansions to the game, you could play this with a much larger group of gamers) the is equal parts guessing game and history lesson! The core mechanic is incredibly simple: you create a growing timeline of events, and need to decide when cards in your hand happen on the timeline as it grows!</p><p>With evocative illustrations and mini-cards keeping this game portable and compact (and at a very reasonable $12.99 USD MSRP), I've found it to be one of the best "throw it in the bag" games to break out either before in between or after a more serious gaming session. It's also an absolute no-brainer for gaming with family and friends who aren't used to heavier games, along with younger kids in the fam!</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>How Do You Play <em>Timeline</em>?</h2><p>As mentioned above, the gameplay loop of <em>Timeline </em>is wonderfully simple, but super-satisfying. The game consists of a deck of mini-cards. On one side is the name of an event, like "The Start of the Black Death" with an illustration depicting the event. On the back is the same name and illustration, but with the date that it occurred.</p><p>Players start the game with four cards in front of them, date-side down. You don't get to peek at when your events happened - that's the whole point of the game! One event from the deck is placed date-side up on the board, and that's the start of the timeline.&nbsp;</p><picture>

  </picture><p>Now it's up to you to choose one of your cards, and decide where it landed on the timeline. This is easier in the beginning of the game, when the timeline isn't that crowded, but as the game progresses you'll find it trickier and trickier to find the right spot!</p><h2>What Does The <em>Timeline </em>2025 Refresh Bring To The Game?</h2><p>As far as I can tell, and it's a bit tricky to determine based on internet searching alone, this refresh of the game includes all-new, gorgeous illustrations for each of the cards, but updates the packaging to a small box (it originally came in a box, then a metal tin, and now it's back - thankfully - to its small-box format) and includes 96 cards.</p><p>I really like the simple, clean illustration-style on display with these new cards, and think the design feels very modern and simple without losing any personality.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>What Is <em>Timeline: Games &amp; Leisure</em>?</h2><p>Also included in this shipment for us to review is the all-new <em>Timeline: Games &amp; Leisure</em>, which serves as a standalone expansion to the game focusing on - as the title suggest - games and leisure activities. When was the serial production of the first mountain bike? When was the Kayak invented? What about six-sided dice?</p><p>It's a simple and fun spin on the classic game, but it truly is just more cards. There are no tweaks or adjustments to the rules, but why mess with a good thing? And while you don't need the original <em>Timeline</em> reviewed above to play, you <em>can</em> combine both into a more challenging experience.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2><em>Timeline</em> Review - Final Thoughts</h2><p><em>Timeline </em>is, without a doubt, one of my favorite "grab-and-go" games. You can bring it just about anywhere, and get just about anyone into the action. You do <em>not</em> have to be a tabletop gamer to immediately understand how to play this game, making it perfect for Elementary School students and befuddled grandparents alike.</p><p>On the flip side, there's not a lot of tactics or strategy here (the only strategy I follow is: save your obvious ones (like the discovery of fire by man, for the end of the game when the timeline's more complicated).&nbsp;</p><p>So if you're looking for something a little meatier, look elsewhere. And player interaction is basically zero, unless you count clogging up the timeline and making it harder for your opponents to guess where their events happen as interaction. But all in all, I cannot recommend <em>Timeline</em> and <em>Timeline: Games &amp; Leisure</em> enough to anyone looking for some educational, family-friendly fun!</p><hr><p><em>The copies of </em>Timeline <em>and </em>Timeline: Games &amp; Leisure<em> used in the creation of this review were provided to us by Asmodee USA.</em></p></div><div><p><span><div>
