            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Italian publishing house Leonardo Interactive has announced&nbsp;<em>Champions Stable: Equestrian Dynasty</em>, an "open-world horse racing management game" that's set to arrive on PC and consoles sometime next year.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Champions Stable: Equestrian Dynasty&nbsp;</em>will marry "adrenaline-fueled competition" with "the calming art of horse care", allowing you not only to hit the track but also to care for your horses while they're not racing.</p>

<p>Leonardo describes its game as "the first horse racing management game to feature realistic and scalable 3D graphics built in Unreal Engine", so you can perhaps expect a slightly higher degree of realism here than you might be used to from the genre.</p>

<p>This being a horse racing management sim, you will, of course, be given control over pretty much every facet of your stable, including breeding, finances, training schedules, and facility upgrades.</p>

<p>It's all in service of simulating what Leonardo Interactive calls "a living, evolving world where every number and gene can make or break your success". The game will even let you take part in horse auctions, scout new horses for your stable, and "carefully plan your genetic bloodlines to breed the next generation of champions".</p>

<p>It wouldn't be much of a horse racing sim if you couldn't race on real tracks, of course, so&nbsp;<em>Champions Stable: Equestrian Dynasty&nbsp;</em>will boast several licensed tracks "in stunning detail", including the likes of Ascot, Flemington, and Capannelle, among others.</p>

No more specific release date has been revealed, and we don't know exactly which consoles the game will appear on, either.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Horizon Steel Frontiers Is a Robo-Dino MMO from NCSoft]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/horizon-steel-frontiers-announcement</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/horizon-steel-frontiers-is-a-robo-dino-mmo-from-ncsoft.1352638/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>NCSoft and Sony have announced&nbsp;<em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em>, an MMO spinoff of Guerrilla Games'&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>series, and it'll offer a twist on the franchise's "signature hunting-action gameplay".</p>

<p>Since NCSoft is responsible for this game's development, it seems that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/horizon-mmo-canceled-report" rel="nofollow">reports of the project's cancellation</a> were greatly exaggerated (assuming this isn't a completely different Sony-NCSoft collaboration, that is), although it doesn't have a release date yet.</p>

<p>When the game does launch, it'll arrive on PC and mobile devices, and it'll give you the chance to experience the&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>series' robo-dino-hunting gameplay with your fellow hunters. Full crossplay will be supported as well, so you can play alongside your buddies on PC or mobile.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/horizon-steel-frontiers-gameplay.jpg?itok=AXypeg7J 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/horizon-steel-frontiers-gameplay.jpg?itok=0FuKtcfh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Horizon Steel Frontiers&nbsp;</em>is a "hunting-action" MMO from Sony and NCSoft.</figcaption></figure><p>In addition to the&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>series' iconic hunting gameplay, you can also look forward to "deeply customizable combat and extensive player freedom", so it sounds as though the open-world component of the games will be maintained as well.</p>

<p>New mechanical creatures and "large-scale battles" will also be introduced as part of the new MMO, and since it's almost certainly a live service-style game, it's likely it will be updated over time with new monsters and quests to tackle.</p>

<p><em>Horizon Steel Frontiers&nbsp;</em>is just one of the spinoff projects being made around Guerrilla's series; there's also a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-helldivers-horizon-movies-ghost-of-tsushima-anime" rel="nofollow">live-action movie in development</a>, and as of late 2022, the studio was also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/guerrilla-working-on-multiplayer-horizon-game" rel="nofollow">making a multiplayer spinoff</a> of its own (although it's possible&nbsp;<em>Steel Frontiers&nbsp;</em>is a reworked version of said project).</p>

<p>One project that certainly won't be taking its place alongside these spinoffs is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/light-of-motiram-announced-tencent-horizon" rel="nofollow">Tencent's&nbsp;<em>Light of Motiram</em></a>, which is currently defending itself in a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-tencent-light-of-motiram-lawsuit" rel="nofollow">copyright and trademark infringement court case</a> brought by Sony.</p>




<p>We don't yet have a release date for&nbsp;<em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em>, but when it does arrive, it'll be available for PC, iOS, and Android. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>
