<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/WarzoneMobile/status/1923470814357385447" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message on Friday</a>, Activision said that while it's proud of its "accomplishment" in creating an "authentic" mobile version of&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em>, the mobile edition of the game hasn't "met [Activision's] expectations" in the same way as the PC and console versions have.</p>

<p>As such, new gameplay updates and seasonal events will no longer be added to&nbsp;<em>Warzone Mobile</em>, and you won't be able to buy in-game points or the BlackCell battle pass using real currency either.</p>

However, if you didn't have&nbsp;<em>Warzone Mobile&nbsp;</em>installed on your device before today, then it's gone for good.</p>

<p>It doesn't sound like you can redownload it if you previously gave it a shot, either; you've got to have it on your device already, or your access to the game has been permanently revoked.</p>

<p>If you're lucky enough to have&nbsp;<em>Warzone Mobile&nbsp;</em>on your phone or tablet, then you can continue to play it, and cross-progression will still be available, as will servers complete with matchmaking for online play.</p>

<p>You can also continue to spend whatever COD Points you have left over on "available content in the Store"; you just can't purchase any more with your real currency.</p>




<p>For a limited time, if you sign up to&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Mobile&nbsp;</em>using your Activision account (and you're a&nbsp;<em>Warzone Mobile&nbsp;</em>player), you can nab yourself some&nbsp;<em>Mobile&nbsp;</em>COD Points by way of an incentive.</p>

<p>More info about this, as well as all other things pertaining to&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile</em>'s shutdown, can be found via Activision's official <a href="https://support.activision.com/warzone-mobile/articles/warzone-mobile-service-changes" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">FAQ</a> on the matter.&nbsp;If you're a&nbsp;<em>Warzone&nbsp;</em>player on PC or console, don't fret; that version of the game isn't going anywhere.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kojima-physint-five-six-years<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Physint&nbsp;</em>creator Hideo Kojima has indicated that it's going to be quite a while before we get to play his new take on the "espionage action" genre he helped to pioneer.</p>

<p>In an interview with French cinema magazine&nbsp;<em>Le Film Francais&nbsp;</em>(thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/hideo-kojima-reveals-his-next-espionage-game-physint-is-5-6-years-away/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">VGC</a>), Kojima talks about his love of film, and he also addresses the multiple video game projects he's currently working on.</p>

<p>As well as the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">set to launch in June</a>, Kojima also named&nbsp;<em>Physint</em>, which he says will "take [him] another five or six years" to make. He's previously stated that the production of the game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideo-kojima-od-physint-strikes" rel="nofollow">heavily impacted by SAG strikes</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/physint-kojima-comments-billboard.jpg?itok=XIPMjIJH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/physint-kojima-comments-billboard.jpg?itok=DvhlVugs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hideo Kojima says he'd like to work on a movie after&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Physint</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Given that&nbsp;<em>Physint&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideo-kojima-announces-next-generation-espionage-action-game" rel="nofollow">only revealed back in February last year</a>&nbsp;and that Kojima's games usually sport both high production values and a lot of polish, I don't think anyone was expecting to see&nbsp;<em>Physint&nbsp;</em>for at least the next few years. Still, knowing it's that far away is a touch disappointing.</p>

<p>After&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Physint&nbsp;</em>are released, Kojima says he might like to try his hand at making a movie; he says he "grew up with cinema" and that he'd prefer to make a film "while still young" if he's going to do it at all.</p>

<p>As VGC points out, Kojima doesn't make any reference to&nbsp;<em>OD</em>, his <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideo-kojima-announces-new-game-od-in-partnership-with-xbox-and-filmmaker-jordan-peele" rel="nofollow">collaboration with filmmaker Jordan Peele</a>, but since he's promoting the Sony-exclusive&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2</em>, that might not be so strange.&nbsp;<em>Physint</em>, too, was announced during a Sony event, so it may well be a PlayStation exclusive.</p>




<p>For the time being, though, Kojima will be focused on the release of&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-gold-kojima-daruma-doll" rel="nofollow">went gold earlier this month</a>, prompting the filling in of the second eye on Kojima's daruma doll.</p>

<p><em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>arrives on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a> on June 26th.&nbsp;<em>Physint</em>&nbsp;will, if Kojima's estimates are correct, launch somewhere around 2030-2031, thus probably making it a PlayStation 6 title at this point. Stay tuned for more.</p>
