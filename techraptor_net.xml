            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile </em>will be shutting down completely in April, publisher Activision has announced, so make sure you get in the games you want to play before it goes away.</p><p>In a <a href="https://support.activision.com/warzone-mobile/articles/warzone-mobile-service-changes" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">blog post</a> on the official <em>Warzone Mobile </em>website, Activision says that the game's servers will be closing on April 17th, after which point you won't be able to play it at all.</p><p>In May last year, <em>Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile </em>was delisted after not meeting Activision's "expectations", so its closure probably shouldn't come as a surprise. Still, it's a little disappointing that <em>Warzone Mobile </em>will be disappearing entirely and that you won't be able to play it at all anymore.</p><figure role="group">

<p>If you still happen to have <em>Warzone Mobile </em>installed, you can use any COD Points you may have left over in order to buy in-game content until the April shutdown, but you can't buy any more of it with real cash.</p><p>You also won't be able to get any refunds for COD Points you've purchased, so it's best to use those points towards anything you might want in <em>Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile </em>before it shuts down.</p><p>It's worth noting that this shutdown won't affect the more popular <em>Call of Duty: Mobile</em>; that game will continue to operate as normal, as will the PC and console-based <em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em>. This shutdown strictly applies to <em>Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile</em>.</p><p>It's a little confusing, but you can remember it this way: if you can currently download and play the game on your platform of choice, then it's probably not shutting down anytime soon.</p>
<p>This is where I'd usually tell you where to download and play <em>Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile</em>, but, well, unless it's already installed on your device, you can't, unfortunately. The game will be shutting down on both Android and iOS on April 17th.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
