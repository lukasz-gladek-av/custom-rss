            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Lies of P&nbsp;</em>developer Neowiz has announced that its puppet-centered Soulslike has reached a brand new sales milestone, just a handful of days after the release of its first big story DLC.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://x.com/Liesofp/status/1935850080948699629" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, the action RPG, which launched back in 2023, has reached three million sales. That means it's picked up another two million for itself since launch month, during which it managed to achieve the impressive milestone of a million copies sold.</p>

<p>It's likely that the shadowdrop of&nbsp;<em>Overture</em>, the game's first story expansion, helped sales along; it was launched without preceding fanfare during the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/summer-game-fest-2025-recap" rel="nofollow">main Summer Game Fest show</a> earlier this month, having been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lies-of-p-dlc-q1-2025-new-ip" rel="nofollow">teased</a> by Neowiz for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lies-of-p-dlc-sequel" rel="nofollow">some time</a> prior to that announcement.</p>

As you've probably guessed, it's an extremely loose adaptation of 1883 children's novel&nbsp;<em>The Adventures of Pinocchio</em>, although the emphasis here is on "loose"; if you're expecting a faithful retelling of Carlo Collodi's classic fable, you'll be disappointed.</p>

<p>Instead, you're getting a fairly straightforward Soulslike setup; the city of Krat, a Belle Epoque-era metropolis full of breathtaking architecture, is now sadly also full of murderous puppets, and it's up to you, a different kind of murderous puppet, to do something about that.</p>

<p>Gameplay-wise,&nbsp;<em>Lies of P&nbsp;</em>hews pretty close to the formula; it's built around parry-focused combat, semi-linear exploration, and an oblique story that drip-feeds clues over the course of the game's running time.</p>

<p>The game's first major DLC,&nbsp;<em>Overture</em>, revolves around a legendary figure in&nbsp;<em>Lies of P</em>'s mythology by the name of Lea Florence Monad. You'll uncover her story while also exploring new areas, battling new enemies, and trying out some new weapons into the bargain.</p>




<p><em>Lies of P</em>&nbsp;is out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1627720/Lies_of_P/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/lies-of-p/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/lies-of-p" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and its&nbsp;<em>Overture&nbsp;</em>DLC is also available on all of those platforms.</p>
