            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hazelight Studios, the company responsible for co-op adventures <em>Split Fiction </em>and <em>It Takes Two</em>, has revealed that it's already hard at work on its next game.</p><p>As revealed by studio head Josef Fares <a href="https://x.com/josef_fares/status/2021163743036486041" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">on social media platform X</a>, Hazelight's "next game [is] in the making". Fares revealed the news alongside a photo of himself in a motion-capture studio, with actors wearing mo-cap suits in the background.</p><p>Fares' arm artfully obscures the faces of the actors in question, however, so we don't know who's going to be in the game, nor do we know what the scene is that the group is working on. Still, it's nice to know Hazelight isn't resting on its laurels.</p><figure role="group">

<p>Unfortunately, Hazelight and Fares haven't revealed any further details about what they might be working on, so we don't know exactly what we can expect from the studio next.</p><p>However, given the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/it-takes-two-sales-almost-27m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="584c9873-b01a-4f97-88c9-bc5b2b3ddb0b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">overwhelming success</a> of all of Hazelight's previous co-op titles (namely <em>Split Fiction</em>, <em>It Takes Two</em>, and <em>A Way Out</em>), it's probably pretty safe to assume that Hazelight's next game will be a co-op adventure along similar lines to its previous three titles.</p><p>Hazelight's last game, <em>Split Fiction</em>, has proven so popular among players that it's already <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-movie-report" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="249fa328-8f25-4975-b468-c4dc37526434" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">netted itself a movie adaptation</a>, with actress Sydney Sweeney <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-movie-sydney-sweeney" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="105b35be-df6f-4f5c-8f24-3e9c7adc0b61" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">already attached to the project</a> alongside <em>Deadpool and Wolverine </em>writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick.</p><p>Indeed, movie and TV adaptations of Hazelight's previous adventure <em>It Takes Two </em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/it-takes-two-movie-and-tv-adaptations-in-works" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e533eb5a-c393-43f4-836a-16e1dbdf765e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">were announced back in 2022</a> as well, although we're yet to hear further details about those projects.</p>

<figcaption><em>Besiege </em>is getting a brand new expansion, <em>The Broken Beyond</em>, this year.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The studio says it'll be offering "a simulation of space that balances realism with the rule of cool" in <em>The Broken Beyond</em>, so while you can expect relatively accurate physics, you can also "take full advantage of gravitational mechanics to slingshot your machines or establish stable orbits".</p><p>While the new expansion is intended to challenge players who've already spent a lot of time with <em>Besiege</em>, it'll also provide "a suite of awesome new space-themed blocks" to help you figure out how best to approach each challenge.</p><p>As Spiderling gets closer to launch, the studio says it'll be releasing a host of new developer diaries that will delve deeper into mechanics and features found in <em>The Broken Beyond</em>, and there will be a new free update for <em>Besiege </em>itself next week as well.</p>
<p>We don't yet know whether the expansion will also be coming to the console versions, and if so, whether that launch will happen at the same time. Given that the console versions lack the PC version's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/besiege-announces-multiplayer-level-editor" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7fb290e7-77d9-4374-8079-dee3b09cc8ec" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">level editor and multiplayer function</a>, however, it seems unlikely.</p><p><em>Besiege: The Broken Beyond </em>is set to launch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3639470/Besiege_The_Broken_Beyond/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC via Steam</a> sometime in the second quarter of this year.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p><span><div>

<figcaption><em>Helldivers 2</em>'s new update tasks you with taking down the Cyborg legions.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You'll be facing these new enemies in <em>Helldivers 2</em>'s new Cyberstan factory cities map, where you'll be battling through "industrial complexes that are heavily defended with hazards around every corner".</p><p>A new mission type, in which you'll be stopping Cyborg production and compromising Automaton defenses, is now available as part of this update, and new objectives include tearing down Cyborg statues anddestroying mega-factories.</p><p>Throughout the Machinery of Oppression campaign, <em>Helldivers 2 </em>will track the total number of player deaths, and if the new Galactic Reinforcement Counter reaches zero, then the Battle for Cyberstan has been lost (and, presumably, you won't get any of the fun goodies associated with it).</p><p>All of this follows on from the release of the latest <em>Helldivers 2 </em>Warbond, Siege Breakers, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-siege-breakers-warbond" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5707f6d2-689f-47a5-99b1-93eca6b7efc0" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">launched earlier this month</a>.

As such, it stands to reason that the next big update for <em>Helldivers 2 </em>will probably pit you against the Illuminate. You have been warned.</p><p><em>Helldivers 2</em>'s Machinery of Oppression update is available across all platforms now.
