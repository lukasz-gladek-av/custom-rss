            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-27-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 2.7 release date has been revealed, so get ready to bid farewell to Penacony and embark on a new adventure to lands unfamiliar.</p>

<p>Version 2.7 of the turn-based gacha RPG officially arrives on December 4th. In&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-26-release-date" rel="nofollow">Version 2.6</a>, you brought the events of a "trailblazing silkpunk saga" to their climax, but now, you'll be wrapping things up in Penacony before heading off to the mysterious land of Amphoreus.</p>

<p>As HoYoverse tells it, you'll be making new memories with your friends in Penacony while Miss Himeko gathers information about Amphoreus in preparation for moving the story to the Eternal Land.</p>

<p>Your first new character is Sunday, a five-star Imaginary fighter who provides powerful buffs to his team and allows other characters to immediately take action. You'll want to add him to your team if you're looking for some solid support.</p>

<p>Joining Sunday in this update is Fugue, a foxian girl who applies a powerful debuff to enemies. When said debuff reaches zero, enemies take damage, and Fugue's abilities also allow her party members to dish out some extra pain, so she's a valuable addition to any lineup.</p>




<p>Two additional characters will feature in reruns for Version 2.7. In the first half of the update, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-gameplay-trailer-celebrates-release-of-new-character-jing-yuan" rel="nofollow">Jing Yuan</a> will make a return, while the second half will see Firefly once again up for grabs.</p>

<p>A number of other major additions and improvements are set to arrive as part of this update as well, including customizable quarters for the Trailblazer. As HoYoverse prepares for&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.0, you'll also get&nbsp;the new Path of Remembrance system and updates to Relics, plus lots more.</p>

<p><em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>is available to play for free right now on PC, PS5, and mobile devices. Version 2.7 arrives on December 4th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-donkey-kong-land<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has added another Game Boy game to the Nintendo Switch Online roster, and if you're looking for a platformer to keep you entertained this Thanksgiving, you could do a lot worse than this one.</p>

<p>As revealed in <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1859764097480355961" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a message on X (formerly Twitter) earlier today</a>,&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Land&nbsp;</em>has found its way to the Switch Online library. It joins the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-zelda-july" rel="nofollow">Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Zelda: Oracle&nbsp;</em>games</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-game-boy-launch" rel="nofollow">Super Mario Land</a></em>, as well as many other Game Boy classics.</p>

<p>Rather intriguingly, the plot for&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Land&nbsp;</em>sees Cranky Kong and King K. Rool working together in order to get Diddy and Donkey Kong to prove they can successfully embark on an adventure on the Game Boy. It's all very meta.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/donkey-kong-land-nintendo-switch-online.jpg?itok=VcjDjt5q 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/donkey-kong-land-nintendo-switch-online.jpg?itok=9U3ysc_K 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Donkey Kong Land&nbsp;</em>takes a decidedly more meta approach to proceedings.</figcaption></figure><p>Much like&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Land</em>,&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Land&nbsp;</em>is an entirely original game rather than a remake or port of&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Country</em>. It features 30 levels across four worlds, and it also features several of the staples of&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong&nbsp;</em>platformers, including collecting K-O-N-G letters, firing yourself from barrel cannons, and more.</p>

<p>The game features similar visuals to&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Country</em>, with developer Rare using the same technology as in the SNES series to transfer pre-rendered graphics into a 2D space.</p>

<p>Despite that, it does also take the Game Boy's limitations into account in some ways; the system is more limited than the SNES from a technical standpoint, for instance, so only one Kong can appear on screen rather than the two of them working in tandem.</p>




<p><em>Donkey Kong Land&nbsp;</em>is available to play right now on Nintendo Switch. All you need is a Switch Online membership; you won't need an Expansion Pack addon like you would to play <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/38-nintendo-switch-online-n64-games-are-planned-dataminer-says" rel="nofollow">N64 games</a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/game-boy-and-game-boy-advance-titles-are-finally-coming-to-nintendo-switch-online" rel="nofollow">Game Boy Advance titles</a>.</p>

<p>Despite several&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong&nbsp;</em>games being made available via Switch Online,&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong 64&nbsp;</em>is yet to make its way to the service. We'll have to wait and see whether it does or not in the coming months.</p>
