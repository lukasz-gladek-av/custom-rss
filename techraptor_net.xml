            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you’re not already familiar with the IP we’re dealing with today, then you’re not alone. Even as a fan of Tabletop RPGs, I hadn’t come across <em>RuneQuest </em>much outside of passive mentions that basically sold it as a more “hardcore” version of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">DnD </a>with deeper lore. Either way, our <em>RuneQuest: Warlords</em> Preview is about this new turn-based strategy title set in the TTRPG’s universe, and whether it’ll stand tall enough to sell some newcomers on this complex and intricate setting.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><em>RuneQuest: Warlords</em> – A Turn-Based Fantasy Throw-Down</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/runequest-warlords-screenshot-showing-various-fantasy-units-hanging-out-in-some-woods.jpg?itok=2FjFmZ2a 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/runequest-warlords-screenshot-showing-various-fantasy-units-hanging-out-in-some-woods.jpg?itok=HTuF7rnm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>These humble beginnings bely a surprisingly deep sense of worldbuilding.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>If you’ve played many strategy titles before, then you’ll probably be pretty familiar with the bread-and-butter of the gameplay in <em>RuneQuest: Warlords</em>. It’s a <a href="https://techraptor.net/genre/strategy-rpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">turn-based strategy RPG</a>/Skirmisher where you control several different units on a grid-based map. Each turn, the various combatants have a certain number of action points to use up, and once you run out, your turn is over, and the other side gets to run around attacking you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There’s also the standard array of special abilities, different stats for the different unit types, and a decent amount of progression brought into the mix from <em>RuneQuest</em>’s TTRPG roots. As you go, both your heroes and your standard army units get stronger, and you’ll have to manage these upgrades and your army in general between each mission of the campaign. Like I said, it’s all relatively standard for a turn-based strategy title, but that’s not to say that the game has nothing interesting or unique to offer.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Welcome to (Fantasy) Flavortown</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/runequest-warlords-screenshot-showing-a-top-down-view-of-a-grid-based-map.jpg?itok=I_Su0jnN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/runequest-warlords-screenshot-showing-a-top-down-view-of-a-grid-based-map.jpg?itok=5GLfQoX7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This tactical view gives you a pretty comprehensive overview of the entire field.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><div><p>A lot of the appeal of <em>RuneQuest: Warlords</em> comes from the lore and storyline. Going into it without any background knowledge, it would be easy to only see a standard ‘European Fantasy’ setting and just shut off your mind during all of the dialogue, but that would be a huge mistake. While there are certainly enough familiar fantasy elements to keep genre fans happy, if you pay attention to the world and the characters, you start to get hints of a pretty deep and involved lore bubbling just under the surface.&nbsp;</p><p>
&nbsp;
There’s clearly a decent focus on religious conflict here, but the tone remains relatively grounded. It is pretty much devoid of any sense of ‘tongue-in-cheek’ or self-parody, meaning things feel genuinely earnest in the way they’re brought across. While this might be an issue if you struggle to take fantasy settings too seriously, if you let yourself go, it can really suck you in. Hell, I only get to play 4 missions and I’m already interested in learning more about everything that’s going on in the larger world setting of the RPG.&nbsp;</p></div>

<h2>Tabletop Pedigree</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/runequest-warlords-screenshot-showing-a-whole-cluster-of-units-fighting-each-other-in-a-narrow-pass.jpg?itok=v1FR9-0O 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/runequest-warlords-screenshot-showing-a-whole-cluster-of-units-fighting-each-other-in-a-narrow-pass.jpg?itok=9X0NL2Qw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sure, my strategy basically boils down to "put all my dudes in a cluster and hope they overwhelm the enemy", but so far, it's working.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>There are other gameplay elements in <em>RuneQuest: Warlord</em> that make it feel even more strongly tied to the tabletop than other physical-to-digital adaptations like this. At the start of each battle, you have to deploy the forces that you’ve managed to keep your hands on in the campaign thus far. All of these units and heroes have a points value, and the mission will have a strict limit on how many points your army is allowed to take up. If you’ve ever played a tabletop miniatures game, then you’ll know this is a pretty common facet of those games, and it leads to some interesting dynamics.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The points limit means you have to be more creative than just dumping all of your points and effort into the same group of characters and units. Sure, they’re going to be killer units, but they’ll cost so much that you won’t be able to cover enough ground on certain missions. It forces you to keep a bit of variety amongst all of your characters, as well as giving you the opportunity to try different approaches on all of the missions, especially if things don’t work in your favor on your first run.</p>

<h2>A High Quality of Life</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/runequest-warlords-screenshot-showing-a-single-unit-left-on-the-field-with-a-large-blood-patch-nearby.jpg?itok=zbclYQ7Z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/runequest-warlords-screenshot-showing-a-single-unit-left-on-the-field-with-a-large-blood-patch-nearby.jpg?itok=qJ2UDMRq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I wonder if the large patch of gore and viscera could be a clue as to what has just occured here.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Another thing that stands out in&nbsp;<em>RuneQuest: Warlords</em>&nbsp;is the quality-of-life additions to the game. Firstly, you can go around handing out commands to all of your units at once instead of having to wait for all of the animations to finish, which is great if you’re itching to see what’s about to happen or you’re going for a speed run. You’ve also got a hotkey that moves onto your next unit, which is pretty standard, but it only works if that unit has any action or movement points left to use up, which is a nice touch that saves you wondering who the hell had AP left when that “are you sure” pop-up hits when you try to end your turn.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On top of that is a layer of polish that sells this as one of the best-assembled fantasy strategy titles in recent memory. Everything from the way the UI notifies you of buffs and debuffs to the intuitive setup of the menus and buttons you need during your turn. You’ve also got a full tactical map from a top-down perspective that gives you an insane tactical advantage over your opponents. Even for hardcore fans of the genre, there’s a lot of promise on display here.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>My Final Thought</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/runequest-warlords-screenshot-showing-a-thick-bundle-of-player-units-in-a-choke-point-between-two-mountains.jpg?itok=5EalYqlS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/runequest-warlords-screenshot-showing-a-thick-bundle-of-player-units-in-a-choke-point-between-two-mountains.jpg?itok=bVnI7WqQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Here I stand again, forcing myself into a choke-point because I refuse to learn any lessons.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>I have managed to hook myself on <em>RuneQuest: Warlords</em>, and I’ve only seen 4 missions so far. This is a fantastic package to experience this world setting, and even if you’re already into turn-based strategy games with a fantasy setting, then you’ll still find that so much of this game has been done right that there’s plenty to get your teeth into. The real test will be if this momentum can be maintained for the rest of the game, and I for one can’t wait to find out.&nbsp;</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Indie Horror Game Vile: Exhumed Banned from Steam Due to "Sexual Content"]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vile-exhumed-steam-removed-sexual-content</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/indie-horror-game-vile-exhumed-banned-from-steam-due-to-sexual-content.1255383/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Solo game dev Cara Cadaver has revealed that her indie horror game&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>has been banned from Steam, and having played the game myself, I can tell you the reason is...a little strange.</p>

<p>Speaking on <a href="https://x.com/dirtlord77/status/1949867514797707531" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">social media</a>, Cadaver says that <i>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</i>was banned from Steam for "sexual content with depictions of real people". As she points out, the game wasn't banned for "its use of gore in storytelling, or the violent themes".</p>

<p>The twist? As Cadaver says in her post, the sexual content for which the game was taken off Steam is "all implied". There's no explicit depiction of any kind of sexual act within the game; there are plenty of shocking and disturbing images, and the narrative is pretty unsettling, but that's about it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vile-exhumed-steam-banned-emails.jpg?itok=uotDK6lT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vile-exhumed-steam-banned-emails.jpg?itok=5CF3h4y2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>isn't coming to Steam anytime soon, it seems.</figcaption></figure><p>Cadaver says she doesn't want to censor&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>or make changes to it; she says she "will not retell a story about these topics in a way to make people who don't understand it more comfortable".</p>

<p>Together with publisher DreadXP, Cadaver says she's currently looking into alternate ways to release&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed</em>, and you can expect to hear "specific details" next week. Make sure to check out Cadaver's X (formerly Twitter) <a href="https://x.com/dirtlord77" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">account</a> or <a href="https://x.com/dreadxpgames" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">that of DreadXP</a> for further info.</p>

<p>For context, Steam delisted a bunch of adult games from its platform earlier this month, citing concern from payment processors regarding the explicit content present in those games. Indie platform Itch.io <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/itch-io-deindexes-adult-pages" rel="nofollow">quickly followed suit</a>&nbsp;(although the original version of&nbsp;<em>Vile&nbsp;</em><a href="https://final-girl-games.itch.io/vile" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">remains intact</a> on that site, ironically).</p>

<p>It all stems from a <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/open-letter-to-payment-processors" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">campaign</a> started by activist group Collective Shout regarding a game by the name of&nbsp;<em>No Mercy</em>, an explicit title the group says "fl[ies] in the face of efforts to address violence against women".</p>




<p>The decision to remove Cadaver's game from Steam is, frankly, bizarre. If the point, as Collective Shout sees it, is to "address violence against women", then removing a game that directly tackles this theme in a frank and open way seems like a big mistake to me.</p>

<p>Of course, it's entirely likely that Steam simply panicked and pulled the plug on any game that might stand even the slightest chance of upsetting its payment processors, even if that game is about as far from "fl[ying] in the face of efforts to address violence against women" as it's possible to be.</p>

<p>Hopefully, Cadaver and DreadXP can find a way to release&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>somewhere else. In the meantime, you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/vile-exhumed-review-dirty-computer" rel="nofollow">read my review</a> to find out why it's not only an important game from a message standpoint, but also a great experience in its own right.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has announced new <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> Secret Lair Chaos Vault drops. This otherwise random subset of Secret Lair drops all appear to be sci-fi themed, thematically connecting them to the newest set, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/ranking-all-new-commanders-in-mtg-edge-of-eternities" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Edge of Eternities</em></a>.</p>



<p>On the official <a href="https://secretlair.wizards.com/us/en/chaosvault#filter-product-1246458|sort-availability_wotc,featured" rel="nofollow">Secret Lair website</a>, there are eight new Chaos Vault drops. Four of those drops contain five cards taken from the <em>Edge of Eternities</em> set. The other four, called Commander Reinforcements, include an <em>Edge of Eternities</em> Commander deck.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-secret-lair-chaos-vault-alien-auroras-promo-image.jpg?itok=A4moVVNN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-secret-lair-chaos-vault-alien-auroras-promo-image.jpg?itok=KpsIRvFe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The first two drops are titled <em>Alien Auroras</em>. This drop features, in both foil and non-foil, five cards with evocative artwork by Ian Permana. The drop contains the following cards:</p>

<ul><li><em>Reprocess</em></li>
	<li><em>Aggressive Mining</em></li>
	<li><em>Sylvan Safekeeper</em></li>
	<li><em>Crucible of Worlds</em></li>
	<li><em>Zuran Orb</em></li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-secret-lair-chaos-vault-featuring-deathburger-promo-art.jpg?itok=iin6Yq-W 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-secret-lair-chaos-vault-featuring-deathburger-promo-art.jpg?itok=lBiLxBb4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>For those who appreciate the elegance of machinery over flesh, the second drop, <em>Featuring: Deathburger</em> may be for you. As the name implies, this foil and non-foil drop features Josan Gonzales aka Deathburger's, provocative cyberpunk artwork. The cards he has reinterpreted are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><em>Ethersworn Canonist</em></li>
	<li><em>Goblin Engineer</em></li>
	<li><em>Dance of the Manse&nbsp;</em></li>
	<li><em>Arcbound Ravager</em></li>
	<li><em>Foundry Inspector</em></li>
</ul><p>The second half of the <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Secret Lair Chaos Vault drops are mostly for those with deep pockets and a love for Commander. The <em>Commander Reinforcements: World Shaper</em> drop contains everything from the Alien Auroras drop as well as the World Shaper Commander Deck.</p>

<p>Similarly, <em>Commander Reinforcements: Counter Intelligence</em> includes everything from the <em>Featuring: Deathbringer&nbsp;</em>drop and the Counter Intelligence Commander deck.</p>

<p>The <em>Alien Auroras</em> and <em>Featuring: Deathburger</em> drops are being sold at MSRPs of $29.99 (non-foil) and $59.99 (foil), respectively. The <em>Commander Reinforcements</em> drops are being sold at MSRPs of $74.98 (non-foil) and $104.98 (foil). These drops will only be available while supplies last. If you are interested in any of these drops, and have the cash to spare, it is better to secure yours now.</p>
