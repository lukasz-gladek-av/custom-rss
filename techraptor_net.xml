            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-sports-college-football-25-best-selling-sports-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>US industry analyst group Circana has released its gaming sales data for November, and it turns out that&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25&nbsp;</em>has earned itself a rather impressive accolade.</p>

<p>According to the indefatigable Mat Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ldljf4czuc2o" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">over on social media platform Bluesky</a>,&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25&nbsp;</em>"became the best-selling sports video game in US history" in dollar sales terms in November.</p>

<p>That's perhaps not particularly surprising given that the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/us-sales-data-july-circana" rel="nofollow">scored the top spot</a>&nbsp;on both PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S in the month of its release. <em>EA Sports College Football 25</em>'s achievement is perhaps even more impressive when we consider that so far, it hasn't been released on PC.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ea-sports-college-football-25-best-selling-sports-game-play.jpg?itok=YoRcFsNA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ea-sports-college-football-25-best-selling-sports-game-play.jpg?itok=bBB3chky 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>EA Sports College Football 25&nbsp;</em>has sold pretty well, and that's an understatement.</figcaption></figure><p>Piscatella goes on to point out that not only is&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25&nbsp;</em>sitting pretty in the sports game hall of fame, but it also now "ranks among the top 50 best-selling tracked video games" of all time according to dollar sales.</p>

<p>While the game may have reached the lofty status outlined above in November (and topped the Xbox charts to boot), it wasn't actually the best-selling PlayStation game of the month; <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ldljf4dbok2o" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">that honor</a> goes to&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>, which apparently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-series-sales-black-ops-6-launch" rel="nofollow">enjoyed the franchise's biggest ever launch</a>.</p>

<p>Since&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25&nbsp;</em>didn't get a release on Switch, the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ldljf7vf2c2o" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">best-selling game on Nintendo's console</a> for November was instead&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em>, with&nbsp;<em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>MySims: Cozy Bundle&nbsp;</em>taking up second and third place.</p>

<p>Overall, consumer spending fell by 7% in November compared <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/circana-sales-data-november-2023" rel="nofollow">to last year</a>, although subscription service spending was up by 8% on a year-on-year basis, which Piscatella attributes to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-will-be-on-game-pass-day-1" rel="nofollow">debut of&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>on Game Pass</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-killzone-crossover<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Arrowhead Game Studios has announced the very first&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>crossover, and it's with a classic Sony first-person shooter franchise we haven't heard from in some time.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/516322672418750491" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam news post</a> earlier today,&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>'s first ever collaboration is with none other than&nbsp;<em>Killzone</em>. More specifically, the crossover introduces items inspired by&nbsp;<em>Killzone 2&nbsp;</em>to the&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>arsenal.</p>

<p>Arrowhead says that this crossover represents the first foray into a "new tier of special Premium content reserved for collaborations and other uniquely-themed work", so it sounds like we'll be getting more crossovers later down the line.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-killzone-crossover-store.jpg?itok=HHrzynCK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-killzone-crossover-store.jpg?itok=JeIrzW0j 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Helldivers 2</em>'s first crossover is with none other than&nbsp;<em>Killzone</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>This new&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2 Killzone&nbsp;</em>crossover doesn't take the form of a Warbond along the lines of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-truth-enforcers-warbond" rel="nofollow">Truth Enforcers</a>&nbsp;or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-chemical-agents-warbond" rel="nofollow">Chemical Agents</a>. Rather, it's a set of new gear and other goodies you can buy from the game's Superstore, which offers individual items for in-game Super Credits.</p>

<p>Given&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>'s theming, it'll probably come as no surprise that this crossover revolves heavily around&nbsp;<em>Killzone</em>'s fascist Helghast, with an armor set, a cape, and other liveries available that echo the logos and visual aesthetic of the Helghan Empire.</p>

<p>Of course, the tones of&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Killzone&nbsp;</em>are somewhat at odds.&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>takes a more&nbsp;<em>Starship Troopers</em>-esque satirical view of fascism, while&nbsp;<em>Killzone&nbsp;</em>plays things more seriously.</p>

<p>Still, it's interesting to see&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>'s first crossover emerge in this way. Could this also be Sony's stealthy way of trying to gauge interest for a potential&nbsp;<em>Killzone&nbsp;</em>revival? We will have to wait and see.</p>




<p>This crossover comes shortly after the release of&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>'s new Omens of Tyranny update, which introduces the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-cloaked-ships-rumor-update" rel="nofollow">long-awaited</a> (and apparently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-blue-beam-attacks-the-illuminate" rel="nofollow">previously-teased</a>) Illuminate faction into the mix.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/helldivers-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>. The first part of the game's&nbsp;<em>Killzone&nbsp;</em>crossover is live now, and a second part is apparently on its way on December 23rd.</p>
