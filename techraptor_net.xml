            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has officially revealed&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>, and it looks like the first-person shooter will be launching across PC and current-gen consoles in October.</p>

<p>As revealed in a new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>will revolve around the conflict between NATO and a fictional private military company known as Pax Armata, which translates to "armed peace" in Latin. How very appropriate.</p>

<p>The new game will bring "high-intensity infantry combat", along with aerial dogfighting, tank combat, and more. Of course, since this is a&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>game, you'll also have the ability to destroy the environment around you "for a strategic advantage", as EA says.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-6-revealed-destruction.jpg?itok=3tx_G83C 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-6-revealed-destruction.jpg?itok=jxhwnGSj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>has officially been revealed.</figcaption></figure><p>Given that the conflict in&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>revolves around NATO and a PMC, it's safe to assume we're in for another modern setting akin to&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 2042&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 4</em>; basically, we're not going to get a period-piece historical warfare game along the lines of&nbsp;<em>Battlefield V&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 1</em>.</p>

<p>If EA's legal disclaimers for&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>are anything to go by, it looks like we can expect an October release for the game as well. As spotted by Wario64 on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3luptwxr5rh2f" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>, pre-sell offers for the game expire on October 10th, so that's likely the release date, although it hasn't officially been announced yet.</p>

<p>That would also chime with the fact that EA has previously revealed the new&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>game will launch <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-sales-4m-battlefield-skate" rel="nofollow">sometime before March next year</a>, as will the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>reboot (which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-skate-reboot-no-offline-mode" rel="nofollow">won't feature an offline mode</a>).</p>

<p>The debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>doesn't give away any gameplay, although it's fair to say we know roughly what to expect from this one if previous <i>Battlefield&nbsp;</i>games are any indication. Nevertheless, you can check out the trailer here.</p>




<p>EA has a lot to prove when it comes to&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>. Following the player base's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/60000-battlefield-2042-players-want-their-money-back" rel="nofollow">hostile reception</a> to&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 2042</em>, EA CEO Andrew Wilson admitted in 2022 that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-ceo-says-battlefield-needs-lot-of-work-restore-reputation" rel="nofollow">it would take "a lot of work"</a> to restore the franchise's reputation.</p>

<p>In April last year, when EA announced the end of&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 2042&nbsp;</em>seasons, the publisher also confirmed that the next installment in the&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>franchise <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-2042-seasons-ending" rel="nofollow">would be a co-development effort</a> between four studios: DICE, Motive, Criterion, and Ripple Effect.</p>

<p><i>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</i>is set to launch sometime in the future for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2807960/Battlefield_6/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10009568/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/battlefield-6/9p2ff14jzll3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. A multiplayer gameplay reveal is due to air next week, so stay tuned for that.</p>
