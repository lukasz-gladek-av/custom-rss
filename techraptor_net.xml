<p>In this article, we're going to look at 5 different expansions for <em>Zombicie White Death</em>. If this is the first time you're hearing about <em>Zombicide</em> or <em>White Death</em>, check out our review <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/zombicide-white-death-review-incessant-march-continues" rel="nofollow">here</a>, or our coverage of the other game entires below. We've been fans of CMON's <em>Zombicide</em> franchise for a while, and along with the first <em>Zombicide</em> fantasy game <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/zombicide-black-plague-review-old-school-zombie-slaying" rel="nofollow">Black Plague</a>, we've also covered the modern <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/zombicide-2nd-edition-board-game-review" rel="nofollow">2nd Edition</a> and the awesomely thematic movie tie-in, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/night-of-living-dead-zombicide-game-review" rel="nofollow">Night of the Living Dead</a> version.</p>

<p>Divine Beasts is an abomination expansion pack for<em> Zombicide White Death, </em>and it can also be used with<em> Black Plague </em>and<em> Green Horde. </em>It adds a divine beasts card to the zombie deck, and when drawn, starts off a chain of divine beasts spawns. The first beast to appear is the Vermillion Bird and it will activate for 3 turns, and if not eliminated, it disappears and the next beast spawns next turn until all 4 have appeared.</p>

<p>Each of the 4 beasts has 3 action cards for each turn they're in the game, along with unique rules to eliminate them. The Vermillion Bird for example needs to be hit with a single ranged attack. They each also have a unique effect, like the Black Tortoise which makes nearby zombies need 2 damage to be removed. Eliminating the beasts before they disappear earns the survivors a permanent skill.</p>

Rather than just having to load up damage on an abomination, the players are pushed to position and bring the right weapons to bear in time and it fits in really thematically to the game.</p>

<p>The Crossfire Pack is an expansion pack for<em> Zombicide White Death, </em>and it can also be used with<em> Black Plague </em>and<em> Green Horde.&nbsp;</em>It includes some crossbow-armed guards and zombies. The guards give the player activating them a Delayed Ranged Action card, which can be discarded any time during the zombies phase to perform a ranged attack on a zone. The Deadbolt Walkers add a new challenge for survivors, and when they activate, they target a zone with the most survivors up to 3 zones away.</p>

<p>Climbers and Terrorcotta Walkers is an expansion pack for<em> Zombicide </em>fantasy series, including<em> White Death,</em><em>&nbsp;Black Plague,&nbsp;</em>and<em> Green Horde. </em>This expansion features 2 new types of Zombies. The climbers can ignore ramparts, barriers, and ledges when moving, and can be a real menace when trying to defend against. The Terrorcotta Walkers are fantastically thematic and offer a great new challenge. At the start of each zombie phase, if there are 1 to 4 Terrorcotta Warriors in a zone, more spawn around them until there are 5. This means that you need to take out all 5 in a turn, otherwise, they'll keep coming back, and if you separate them, they'll start spawning multiple sets of 5.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zombicide-white-death-expansions-7.jpg?itok=asgI099N 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zombicide-white-death-expansions-7.jpg?itok=X2fj96Y- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Zombicide </em>Climbers and Terrorcotta Walkers expansion adds 2 new challenging zombie types to your games.</figcaption></figure><p>This is a great enemy expansion for the <em>Zombicide</em> fantasy games. The Terrorcotta Walkers offer a unique and entertaining challenge, and the climbers add a new element to your games. While not as good as the Divine Beasts expansion, it adds some interesting depth.</p>

<p>The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles<i> Zombiecide Timecrash </i>expansion contains a load of new content and can be used with <em>White Death</em>, <em>Black Plague,</em> or <em>Green Horde</em>. In total, it contains 7 new heroes and their unique equipment, a new enemy type and a new necromancer, 10 new quests, and some new rules.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'll be honest, this is why I'm here. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Timecrash and <em>White Death</em> is my thing, and it doesn't disappoint. Each Turtle feels thematically perfect (as does Splinter, April, and Casey) and each comes with their own unique equipment card, which can be upgraded by taking an ultimate token (a pizza slice, for which there are 6 that sit as a whole pizza when not in use).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Enemy-wise, the Foot Soldiers spawn on objectives to make them more difficult to take, and Shredder, a unique Necromancer, deals damage when survivors miss their attacks against him. These all combine in the 10 new quests, which use the included new map tiles and creates an enjoyable zombie-filled ninja romp through the snow.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zombicide-white-death-expansions-9.jpg?itok=UIxClAgU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zombicide-white-death-expansions-9.jpg?itok=r6Vx3Cin 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Zombicide</em> Timecrash Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles miniaturs are fantastic. Now who is the best turtle and why is it Raphael?</figcaption></figure><p>The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Timecrash expansion is fantastic. Incredibly thematic throughout with a load of content that works great in all <em>Zombicide</em> fantasy games. The fantasy design for all the miniatures works very well and it's obvious that some work has gone into capturing the theme in all aspects of this expansion.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zombicide-white-death-expansions-10.jpg?itok=dkUmyqjg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zombicide-white-death-expansions-10.jpg?itok=t4mFsrYs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Zombicide White Death Eternal Empire</h2>

<p><i>Zombicide Eternal Empire </i>is a fantasy expansion for<i> Zombicide. </i>It contains the most content out of all the expansions we've looked at here, including 6 new survivors, chi rules, and upgraded survivor cards for the <em>White Death</em> survivors (and rules for <em>Black Plague</em> and <em>Green Horde</em> survivors as well). It also includes a new action, meditation, which boosts Chi, and Chi Statues (that come in 2 halves to show when they've been broken by the zombies), and full replacement equipment decks that use the chi rules.</p>

<p>2 new zombie types are also included that play into the Chi theme. Warden Brutes, which make it so zombies can only be eliminated with chi attacks, and the God-Eater Abomination, who go straight for the Chi Statues and sap the chi from the survivors.&nbsp; Eternal Empire also adds new map tiles with ice zones that survivors can't attack in (zombies still can though), 10 new quests, and a campaign sheet and rules for linking your <em>Zombicide</em> games together.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zombicide-white-death-expansions-11.jpg?itok=tTKoGTjs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zombicide-white-death-expansions-11.jpg?itok=FcYWvTbH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Zombicide</em> Eternal Empire adds a huge amount of content to your games, and the Chi Statues that break in half are inspired design.</figcaption></figure><p>If it wasn't for how thematically awesome the Turtles expansion is, this would easily be the best of the new <em>Zombicide</em> fantasy expansions. It adds a huge amount of content to your games, even without the new enemies and survivors. The campaign play is fantastic, and the 10 new quests and their objectives are super fun to play through.</p>

<h2>Zombicide White Death Expansions Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>The 5 <em>Zombicide</em> expansions we've looked at here can be divided into 2 types, the Divine Beasts, Crossfire Pack and Climbers and Terrorcotta Walkers simply add new enemies (and guards) to your games. Out of those Divine Beasts adds the most interesting aspect to games, with the Climbers and Terrorcotta Walkers adding a new great dimension and challenge. The Crossfire Pack is decent, but if you're only picking up one, then I'd recommend Diving Beasts.</p>

<p>The other 2 offer a lot more content in their expansions. Timecrash Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Eternal Empire both have a great amount of content. Turtles is my personal favorite, just because it's so thematically brilliant, but Eternal Empire adds huge depth to your games, with new rules and campaign play. Recommending one over the other would depend on what you're after, but if it's just honest <em>Zombicide</em> fun, then Timecrash Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is fantastic.</p>

<p>In a thread of social media posts on X (formerly Twitter), Tolarian Community College announced this year's <a href="https://give.translifeline.org/campaign/tolarian-community-college-trans-lifeline-2025-fundraiser/c658047" rel="nofollow">Trans Lifeline</a> fundraiser. It started with a simple request. Donate multiples of $4.00 to the fundraiser and you will be eligible to win one of ten <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Masters boxes.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tolarian-community-college-trans-lifeline-fundraiser-giveaway-thumbnail.jpg?itok=IuwXBLyB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tolarian-community-college-trans-lifeline-fundraiser-giveaway-thumbnail.jpg?itok=x6VbLbda 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>An hour later, the fundraiser had raised $5,000. One day later, that amount increased to over $270,000. To commemorate this milestone, Tolarian Community College announced a series of thank-you gifts would be going out to certain donors.</p>

<p>Those gifts included gaming accessories like playmats and Infinitotokens. But mostly the gifts were sought after <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> cards and decks including the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/secret-lair-x-doctor-who-regeneration-brings-15th-doctor-to-magic-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Doctor Who</em></a> Commander Deck, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/secret-lair-x-dungeons-dragons-50th-anniversary-superdrop-announced-by-wizards-of" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em> Secret Lair</a>, a Zendikar Rising Collector's Box, and a Revised Counterspell card signed by Mark Poole.</p>

<p>The most recent update by Tolarian Community College exclaimed surprise at the Trans Lifeline fundraiser raising over $425,000. This puts the fundraiser close to its stated goal of $500,000.</p>

In addition, the organization's members are part of the transgender community. Their stated goals include keeping their members' identities anonymous and confidential, providing peer support, and dismantling the institutional bigotry of white supremacy.</p>

<p>The support for Trans Lifeline comes during a volatile time in the United States. Due to several executive orders by President Trump, transgender identity is being erased or actively overwritten. This includes the removal of "transgender" and "queer" altogether from the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-news/references-transgender-queer-removed-stonewall-monuments-webpage-rcna192204" rel="nofollow">Stonewall National Monument's</a> web page.</p>

<p>The Trans Lifeline fundraiser concludes February 15.</p>
