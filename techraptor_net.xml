            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-update-010e<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Grinding Gear Games has released&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile&nbsp;</em><em>2&nbsp;</em>update 0.1.0e, and it's designed to introduce several oft-requested quality-of-life features to the action RPG, including checkpoint fast travel and more.</p>

<p>The update introduces the ability to travel between an area's checkpoints, and more checkpoints have also been added to areas "generally at all the entrances and exits", so traveling around an area should be a little less painful now.</p>

<p>On the whole, this update is focused on adding lots of little changes to make your&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>experience smoother, rather than one or two bigger additions. It's all in keeping with the promise made by Grinding Gear last week to&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-devs-feedback-early-access" rel="nofollow">address user feedback and implement changes</a>.</p>

Monsters will now deal 40% less bonus damage from critical strikes, for instance, while higher-tier maps no longer have extra elemental resistance penalties.</p>

<p>You'll also find a ton of changes to individual classes and skills, with lots of abilities' damage values and effects being changed to improve the difficulty curve.</p>

<p>There are far too many tweaks in update 0.1.0e to list here, but you can check out the full&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3645467" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">patch notes</a> if you want to read everything that's new. If you're a buildcraft hound, I'd recommend doing so.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2</em>, it's an action RPG that serves as a followup to 2013's popular&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile</em>. Originally planned as a major expansion of the original game, it was instead <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-will-be-standalone-game-closed-beta-date-gameplay-revealed" rel="nofollow">revealed to be a full sequel in July last year</a>.</p>




<p>The sequel released in Early Access <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-early-access-release-delayed" rel="nofollow">earlier this month</a>, proving so popular that its developers <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-early-access-server-issues-warning" rel="nofollow">expressed concern</a> regarding whether or not the game's servers would be able to hold up. Luckily, it seems those issues didn't manifest to any significant degree at launch.</p>
