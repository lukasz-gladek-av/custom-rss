            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/relic-knights-is-getting-relaunch-courtesy-of-ignition-core-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Relic Knights</em> is coming back under new management. The license for the anime-inspired miniatures skirmish game series, which went dormant after a controversial crowdfunding campaign, has been picked up by Ignition Core Games. Better still, it will be on sale at this year's Adepticon.</p>



<p>According to a press release, Ignition Core Games, Relic Knights will relaunch on the 27th of March at Adepticon at the Ignition Core Games/ Scale 75 USA booth.&nbsp; They will offer a 2-Player Starter Set and three additional miniatures to expand the units in the starter set. Those miniatures are Combat Armor Cordelia, Alabaster Automata, and Infiltrator Candy.</p>

If you want to know how it plays before you buy, you'll have plenty of opportunities.</p>

<p>The releases will not end there. Throughout 2025, Relic Knights will have faction releases for Shattered Sword, Black Diamond, and Cerci Speed Circuit.&nbsp; Everything offered will be available via direct sale, at conventions, or on Ignition Core Games' website from a stock of on-hand inventory.</p>

<p>A discount is possible if you were a backer of the <em>Relic Knights Second Edition</em> Kickstarter campaign. If you directly email Ignition Core Games, you can get a "steep discount" on anything in the product line you pledged for during the campaign.</p>

<p>To quote the press release directly, "It's not a perfect solution but we will provide you with your pledged items at the lowest prices possible."</p>

<p>This is important since the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sodapopminiatures/relic-knights-2nd-edition/description" rel="nofollow"><em>Relic Knights Second Edition</em> Kickstarter</a> campaign ended in disaster. It was originally developed by Soda Pop Miniatures and published by Ninja Division, the same studio behind <em>Super Dungeon Explore</em>.</p>

<p>Despite the campaign raising an impressive $386,826, production was stalled and stopped for several years. Ultimately, all Kickstarter Backers were left with nothing as <a href="https://boardgamewire.com/index.php/2024/03/11/thousands-of-kickstarter-backers-left-out-of-pocket-as-super-dungeon-explore-publisher-ninja-division-files-for-bankruptcy/" rel="nofollow">Ninja Division filed for bankruptcy</a>.</p>

<p>For those still interested in enjoying the anime-inspired action of <em>Relic Knights,</em> Adepticon is a few months away.</p>
