      <div><p>Square Enix has announced a new music tour by the name of Magic, Memories, and Melodies, and as you can imagine, it'll feature new arrangements of classic pieces from throughout Square Enix's history.</p>

<p>Tickets for the tour will be available around the world; it'll kick off with two dates in Tokyo on April 25th and 26th at the International Forum Hall A before going to locations around the US, Europe, and Asia.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Let It Die Offline Version Confirmed, Data Will Carry Over]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/let-it-die-offline-version</link>
            <guid>1370542</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Supertrick Games and publisher GungHo Online Entertainment have announced that they're bringing an offline mode to free-to-play action game&nbsp;<em>Let It Die</em>, thus, ironically, refusing to do what the game's title suggests.</p>

<p>During a recent stream focused on upcoming sequel&nbsp;<em>Let It Die: Inferno&nbsp;</em>(thanks, <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/let-it-die-offline-version-announced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gematsu</a>), producer Uncle Death confirmed that an offline version of the game is coming since the studio has "gotten feedback from customers for a long time" asking for the feature.</p>

<p>The producer went on to say that Supertrick doesn't yet know when&nbsp;<em>Let It Die</em>'s offline mode will be available, but that data will be carried over from the online version, so you shouldn't lose any progress when the new mode does arrive.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/let-it-die-offline-mode-store.jpg?itok=DDbVqkPo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/let-it-die-offline-mode-store.jpg?itok=bZRo6xH0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Let It Die&nbsp;</em>is getting an offline mode soon.</figcaption></figure><p>The stream didn't contain any more information about&nbsp;<em>Let It Die</em>'s offline mode, but presumably, when it does arrive, you'll be able to play it on both PS4 and PC, assuming <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pubg-ps4-and-xbox-one-support-ending-in-november" rel="nofollow">support for the former</a> hasn't <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-finals-ps4-support-ending" rel="nofollow">ended by then</a>.</p>

<p>News of&nbsp;<em>Let It Die</em>'s offline mode comes amid controversy surrounding upcoming sequel&nbsp;<em>Let It Die: Inferno</em>, which, according to its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2576150/LET_IT_DIE_INFERNO/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam page</a>, uses generative AI for several assets and elements, including voices, music, background textures, and images.</p>

<p>Of course, GungHo and Supertrick aren't the only companies to be putting their eggs in the AI basket; our <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/examining-generative-ais-usage-in-steam-next-fest-2025" rel="nofollow">very own Don's recent report</a> shows that AI usage is becoming increasingly common in games on Steam, and companies like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-generative-ai-characters-pubg-inzoi" rel="nofollow">Krafton</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-generative-ai-vp" rel="nofollow">Netflix</a> have declared an affinity for the technology as well.</p>

<p>In any case, as far as we know, the original&nbsp;<em>Let It Die&nbsp;</em>doesn't use generative AI. What it does do, however, is offer a free-to-play action experience in which you can watch the Grim Reaper pull some sick skateboard tricks, and what more could you possibly want?</p>




<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Let It Die&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/794600/LET_IT_DIE/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0747-CUSA03769_00-APPLETITDIEUS000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS4</a>, and the sequel,&nbsp;<em>Let It Die: Inferno&nbsp;</em>(which isn't free-to-play), launches on December 4th.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-movie-director</link>
            <guid>1370539</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Fast and Furious&nbsp;</em>director Justin Lin has signed on to direct Sony's upcoming&nbsp;<em>Helldivers&nbsp;</em>movie, it's emerged, and the film will also boast the involvement of an experienced writer.</p>

<p>As revealed in the <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/helldivers-movie-justin-lin-sony-1236438370/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Hollywood Reporter</a>, Lin will both direct and produce the movie, with his production company Perfect Storm Entertainment handling production duties alongside longtime producer Hutch Parker and PlayStation Productions.</p>

<p>Writing duties will be handled by Gary Dauberman, who's best known for his work on movies like&nbsp;<em>Annabelle&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>It</em>. Could this indicate that the&nbsp;<em>Helldivers&nbsp;</em>movie will be heading in a more horror-oriented direction than we might previously have expected? We'll have to wait and see.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-movie-justin-lin-bugs.jpg?itok=Rdh3wDn9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-movie-justin-lin-bugs.jpg?itok=BOg95fr- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The upcoming&nbsp;<em>Helldivers&nbsp;</em>movie now has a director.</figcaption></figure><p>According to the Hollywood Reporter's, erm, report, Lin "leaned into" the fact that he's "not a gamer" in order to make the&nbsp;<em>Helldivers&nbsp;</em>movie, with "insiders" suggesting that Lin is aiming to "find the humanity in the characters and weave timely themes into the story".</p>

<p>I'm not entirely sure I like the inference in that; it sounds to me like finding humanity in characters and finding "timely themes" in stories is somehow antithetical to video games, but perhaps I'm reading too much into things.</p>

<p>In any case, there's a lot we still don't know about the&nbsp;<em>Helldivers&nbsp;</em>movie, including what kind of story it's looking to tell and how it'll reconcile the franchise's satirical approach to individuality and democracy with movies' need to focus on individual characters.</p>

<p>What we do know is that the movie is just one of several visual media projects based on Sony games currently in the works; at the same time as the&nbsp;<em>Helldivers&nbsp;</em>movie was announced, Sony <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-helldivers-horizon-movies-ghost-of-tsushima-anime" rel="nofollow">also revealed a movie based on the&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>franchise</a>, as well as a&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima&nbsp;</em>anime.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Outward 2 Alpha Preview - Dying Was Never So Fun]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/outward-2-preview-dying-was-never-so-fun</link>
            <guid>1370497</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nine Dots Studio is hard at work on <em>Outward 2</em>, but studio founder, CEO, and Creative Director, Guillaume Boucher-Vidal, took a few moments out of his busy schedule to give us at TechRaptor a look at the current game. Giving us a tour of the new character creation, the ins and outs of Haboob, and what begins your adventure in Aurai, the preview was just the beginning. I also got to play a part of&nbsp;the title, feeling my way through the different areas you can explore. Here's all I learned in my&nbsp;<em>Outward 2</em>&nbsp;alpha preview.</p>

<h2><em>Outward 2</em>&nbsp;Alpha Preview | No Hand Holding Here</h2>

<p>I spent a significant amount of time diving into the nooks and crannies of<em> Outward 2. </em>While I can safely say no Trog is safe around me, I died more times than I can count to Recluses, Thespians, Manticores, and falling into the water. I harvested and ate more mushroom soup than anyone probably should. Through it all, I explored most of the Bellowgale, kept finding more stairways in Haboob than I thought possible, and discovered most creatures will absolutely maim you when given the opportunity.</p>

<p><em>Outward 2</em>&nbsp;is currently in alpha phase. There’s still a lot of work to be done on the title, and everything I played through can completely change by the time it’s released in the summer of 2026. I’m going to focus more on the general mechanics, how it compares to the original<em> <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bc51a462-aeac-4113-b056-c6680d213c23" href="https://techraptor.net/games/outward" rel="nofollow">Outward</a></em>, and what is to come for the RPG.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/outward-2-playtest-save-your-house.jpg?itok=hBQ3V8ep 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/outward-2-playtest-save-your-house.jpg?itok=0e01NbTk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This also means I won’t be commenting too heavily on bugs, missing dialogue, game crashes, and other issues that are current works in progress for Nine Dots Studio. Though these issues can have an impact on your gameplay in the upcoming alpha playtest, they should be eradicated by the time launch comes around. These issues should be reported to the dev team so they can be addressed.</p>

<p>To start at the beginning, Character Creation has been significantly expanded. Not only do traits and backgrounds impact character origins, but they also affect starting stats, where you begin your adventure, recipes you inherently know, and can offer unique dialogue choices. On top of that, you’ll no longer have a potato for your face unless you want to. There are multiple options for hair style, eyebrows, face structure, acne, scars, makeup, and more.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/character-creation-outward-2-alpha-playtest.jpg?itok=pEcyV3e9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/character-creation-outward-2-alpha-playtest.jpg?itok=SE9HwAKI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>When it comes to getting into the meat of the game, there are a few mechanics that have stayed the same from <em>Outward</em>. Your health and stamina maximum decrease when you get injured, dying results in a random event bringing you somewhere else on the map, an equipped bag slows down your dodges, and some quests are timed. You'll meet NPCs from the original, and may even be saved by Gep, again.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are plenty more examples of things that have remained the same that you’ll stumble upon as you play, especially the difficult and brutal combat you’ll encounter. Many were worried that combat would begin to follow RTS mechanics, but fans can rest assured that the combat is the same as&nbsp;<em>Outward</em>. You have to unlock mana to use magic, skills are taught by trainers, and your attacks depending on how often you get to swing your weapon.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/outward-2-alpha-playtest-saved-by-gep.jpg?itok=13asAOOq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/outward-2-alpha-playtest-saved-by-gep.jpg?itok=0HXijLdL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>While you only have a single city to begin from during the playtest, there are hours worth of content you can experience. You’ll be able to take on multiple quests, explore at least three distinct areas, and visit a Leyline. If you make it back into Haboob, you'll even see the city change from when you were exiled. After playing through the region three times, spending at least 18 hours in the wilderness of the Bellowgale, I'm still discovering new areas and interactions with NPCs.</p>

<p>What’s available of the narrative has ensnared me completely. I want to know more about the Symposium and their research, see the different regions, and learn why you were framed in the first place. There are two other starting cities to play through their beginning adventure. The story is there in the right portion to not inform me about the world and my current situation, while keeping me on the hook for future narrative.</p>

<p>There’s so much left to uncover, and I am 100% eagerly awaiting <em>Outward 2</em>’s release so I can experience it all. Combat was exciting, exploration kept me on my toes, and completing objectives consistently felt rewarding. Once it releases, I plan on this game taking over my life for quite a while.</p>

<hr><p><em><strong>Outward 2</strong> was previewed on PC over the course of 20 hours with a code provided by Nine Dots Studio. All screenshots were taken during the course of the preview.</em></p>
