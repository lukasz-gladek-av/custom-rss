            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/modiphius-launches-new-fallout-factions-core-rulebook<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Modiphius Entertainment has launched its Fallout: Factions Core Rulebook. This officially licensed miniature skirmish game started with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/modiphius-announces-fallout-factions-nuka-world" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nuka-World</a> Starter Set. The rulebook has expanded to other parts of the Wasteland, bringing more mayhem to the table.</p>

<h2>The <em>Fallout: Factions</em> Core Rulebook Release</h2>

<p>In an official press release, Modiphius explains the contents of the <em>Fallout: Factions</em> Core Rulebook. It expands on the factions found in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/fallout-factions-battle-for-nuka-world-starter-set-review-rolling-dice-for" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Battle for Nuka-World</em></a> starter set, which centered on the three gangs from the <em>Fallout 4 </em>DLC. While that starter set was set in a specific part of the world, this core rulebook will allow battles to take place anywhere in the Wasteland.</p>

The militaristic, power-armored warriors of the Brotherhood of Steel. The overwhelming juggernauts that are teh Super Mutants. The scrappy, resourceful Survivors. And the cutthroat and merciless Raiders. The rules include unique Weapons, Perks, and Legends of the Wasteland.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the biggest additions to the game are what happens off the battlefield. There is an in-depth scenario system that keeps set up for a game interesting, adding hazards and objectives to a battlefield. In addition, there is the Story Phase, which details growing your crew, obtaining perks, buying and upgrading weapons, etc.. All key areas to ensure your legend in the Wasteland.</p>

<p>At time of writing, additional miniatures and terrain for <em>Fallout: Factions</em> aren't out yet. But with the launch of this book, it is only a matter of time before the product line expands. There is also the promise of new legends coming to the game through Prime Video's Fallout TV series which has already been renewed for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-season-3-confirmed-season-2-december" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a third season</a>. After all, Season 1's characters already <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/fallout-tv-show-miniatures-announced-by-modiphius-entertainment" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">have miniatures</a>.</p>

<p>The <em>Fallout: Factions</em> Core Rulebook is available now on Modiphius' webstore. The book is 112-pages and is available both in physical and digital formats. It is currently being sold at an MSRP of $37.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-shutting-down-playstation-stars<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has announced that it's bringing an end to its PlayStation Stars loyalty program, but you'll be able to spend your points for quite a while after the program ends.</p>

<p>In a PlayStation Blog <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/21/playstation-stars-coming-to-a-close-as-sie-evaluates-new-ways-to-evolve-future-loyalty-program-efforts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, loyalty VP Grace Chen says that as a result of "evaluating the types of activities [PlayStation] players respond best to" over the course of the Stars program, Sony will be "winding down" the program's current incarnation in July.</p>

<p>Chen says Sony intends to "continue to evaluate [its] key findings from this program", and that the company is "looking into ways to build upon these learnings", although she doesn't specify what those learnings are.</p>

Additionally, if you cancel your Stars membership, you won't be able to rejoin and you'll lose all your points.</p>

<p>If you are a current Stars member, you'll be able to continue earning points and rewards until July 23rd at 11am Eastern, at which point no new campaigns will be made available and no new rewards or benefits will be added.</p>

<p>The PlayStation Stars program will fully come to an end in November next year, and you'll be able to spend any points you still have lying around until then, so make sure to grab your store credit or other benefits while you can.</p>

<p>If you've managed to accrue any Digital Collectible items with PlayStation Stars, those will still remain accessible to you, even after the program comes to an end.</p>




<p>PlayStation Stars was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-stars-is-new-playstation-loyalty-program-launching-this-year" rel="nofollow">originally announced back in 2022</a>&nbsp;(then released <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-stars-us-release-date-is-suddenly-today" rel="nofollow">later that year</a>)&nbsp;as a way for PlayStation users to earn loyalty points for playing games, earning trophies, or winning tournament-style events.</p>

<p>It sounds like Sony is considering implementing other loyalty-style programs, although we'll probably have to wait quite some time before the company reveals more about its ideas on this front. Stay tuned for more.</p>
