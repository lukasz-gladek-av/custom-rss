The box, the artwork and the components on opening it scream like something out of a dystopian future full of rogue machines and evil corporations. But does this scenario-drive board game feel <em>Cyberpunk</em>? In our review, we'll talk about how some of the mechanics work, and how it feels to play.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tamashii-chronicle-of-ascend-5.jpg?itok=0mwLJrVh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tamashii-chronicle-of-ascend-5.jpg?itok=XuswDyTN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>&nbsp;A part of the game in&nbsp;<em>Tamashii Chronicles of Ascend</em> is played on a hex map (Photo Credit: Awaken Realms).</figcaption></figure><h2>How Do You Play Tamashii Chronicles of Ascend?</h2>

<p>In&nbsp;<em>Tamashii, </em>players represent a group of rebel allies battling against an omnipresent AI. Players have a unique ability to jump into the bodies of others, seeking out and selecting those that are best pace to achieve what they need to.</p>

<p>The first thing you need to do when you start playing <em>Tamashii</em> is to choose a scenario, of which the core box includes 11 (including the prologue and finale). After the prologue, you can play the scenarios in any order, but you can only play the finale once you've gotten certain results on the scenario progress sheet.</p>

<p>In each&nbsp;<em>Tamashii </em>scenario, games&nbsp;are split between 2 key areas. The first is a map made up of hex tiles that represent the areas you will interact with. It works extremely well as a visual representation of how your character interacts with the world. Each tile isn't an area in a building, or even a necessarily linked building or street, but simply areas that your consciousness moves through as you progress. Each map tile offers a reward for being there, but each turn you remain there increases the trace value making it more likely you'll be found, and enemies stronger when they do.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tamashii-chronicle-of-ascend-4.jpg?itok=1zOpzC8Q 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tamashii-chronicle-of-ascend-4.jpg?itok=o_N21miQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The major part of&nbsp;<em>Tamashii Chronicles of Ascend </em>gameplay takes part on the player's dashboards.</figcaption></figure><p>The second area of the game, and the core part, is on the dashboard that sits in front of you. This dashboard has a slot for the current body you inhabit, along with slots for upgrades, the trace track, which details how strong enemies are when they find you, and a place for enemy cards, because they attach to you, and not your character on the map. They also stack and build up on each other.</p>

<p>The final part of the dashboard, and the key part in the center, is the launcher, where you have different colored tokens. The arrangement of these tokens can unlock abilities and allow you to use basic actions along with giving access to the bodies that you can inhabit.</p>

<p>The game takes place over 4 phases, the planning phase, where you can move the tokens around on your dashboard in order to create the required patterns, the action phase, where you move and launch the actions from your dashboard, then combat and then the quest phase.</p>

<p>The rulebook doesn't do a great job of taking you through the game, but honestly, once you've played a game or 2, it all fits together nicely, and you'll enjoy the scenarios immensely, you just need to persevere when learning the rules.</p>

<p>The only characters you can play in <em>Tamashii </em>are those of the bodies you inhabit. There are 8 available initially, plus those built into your dashboard, each with their own pattern cost to inhabit and their own abilities and powers. The first bodies available are:</p>

<ul><li>Assassin</li>
	<li>Knight</li>
	<li>Rogue</li>
	<li>Scout</li>
	<li>Hacker</li>
	<li>Slasher</li>
	<li>Quaminator</li>
	<li>Visionary</li>
</ul><figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tamashii-chronicle-of-ascend-2.jpg?itok=1bo6Tjp6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tamashii-chronicle-of-ascend-2.jpg?itok=A374Sr4P 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The scenarios are what drives&nbsp;<em>Tamashii Chronicles of Ascend </em>and each can be played in whichever order you like, or repeatedly to get different results.</figcaption></figure><h2>Can You Hack In Tamashii Chronicles of Ascend?</h2>

<p>You don't hack as such in <em>Tamashii</em>, but the whole experience combines to create an extremely thematic <em>Cyberpunk</em> vibe. It all feels weirdly disembodied, the enemies attaching to you, the focus on the patterns and launching programs (which can defeat enemies without even going into combat), and the interaction with the world through the map, as well as the different bodies you can inhabit. I was honestly pretty skeptical about it at first, but it's captured the <em>Cyberpunk</em> theme better than any board game I've played previously, and aside from the original <em>Netrunner</em> card game, gives an extremely pleasing mechanics experience for hacking and jacking into bodies.</p>

<h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On Tamashii Chronicles of Ascend?</h2>

<p><em>Tamashii </em>is an incredible <em>Cyberpunk</em> experience, once you get into it. The rulebook feels like hard work, but once you know what you're doing, it all feels incredibly thematic and satisfying. I'm usually slating games for their skin-deep theme, but&nbsp;<em>Tamashii </em>has really captured it, between the two areas of the game, and the scenarios themselves, it's a rich environment that feels completely attuned to the mechanics it uses. It's a rewarding experience overall.</p>

<h2>Should I Buy Tamashii Chronicles of Ascend?</h2>

<p>If you love all that is&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk</em>, then&nbsp;<em>Tamashii Chronicles of Ascend </em>is for you. You will love the look and the rich theme that the mechanics capture throughout. If <em>Cyberpunk</em> isn't your thing, then&nbsp;<em>Tamashii </em>loses some of its flair, as its real focus is on the scenarios that might not carry through on just the mechanics alone.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-update-splitscreen<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has released a new&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>update that adds the ability to play splitscreen across all of the game's stages, as well as new gameplay adjustments and more.</p>

<p>As the update's patch notes reveal, offline splitscreen matches can now be held in any of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</em>'s twelve stages. Previously, splitscreen play was limited to the Hyperbolic Time Chamber stage, but that limitation has officially been removed.</p>

<p>Back in June, Bandai Namco said it would be "difficult" to implement local splitscreen play while retaining&nbsp;<em>Sparking! Zero</em>'s "core elements" of busy effects and terrain destruction, which is likely why splitscreen was previously limited to the largely-empty Hyperbolic Time Chamber.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-update-splitscreen-frieza.jpg?itok=OhDRUS0k 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-update-splitscreen-frieza.jpg?itok=PTdv00ez 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>now lets you play splitscreen on any stage.</figcaption></figure><p>However, now, thanks to this latest update's rather nebulous assertion that the devs have "improved performance and ease of use", it's possible to enjoy splitscreen play across any number of&nbsp;<em>Sparking! Zero</em>'s levels.</p>

<p>Of course, this isn't the only improvement the update brings. You can also expect a number of quality-of-life improvements and gameplay adjustments, including the ability to skip battle animations during online matches, as well as a new High-Speed Dragon Dash move that lets you close distance to your opponent.</p>

<p>If you're interested, you can read the full patch notes for this&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>update <a href="https://www.bandainamcoent.asia/sea/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-free-update-1112" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>. I'd say it's almost certainly worth doing so if you're planning to jump into online play anytime soon.</p>




<p><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>is the latest installment in the&nbsp;<em>Budokai Tenkaichi&nbsp;</em>sub-series of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball&nbsp;</em>fighting games, and the first game in the series since 2007's&nbsp;<em>Budokai Tenkaichi 3</em>. Unlike previous games, it bears the series' original Japanese name of&nbsp;<em>Sparking!&nbsp;</em>in the West as well.</p>

<p>Placing an emphasis on lore-accurate power levels and movesets instead of pure competitive balance,&nbsp;<em>Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>became the&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball&nbsp;</em>series' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-series-best-steam-debut" rel="nofollow">highest-charting Steam debut</a> when it launched in October, going on to sell <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-sales-3m" rel="nofollow">three million copies in a single day</a>.</p>
