            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Level-5 has announced that&nbsp;<em>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road&nbsp;</em>sales have reached a major milestone within the game's first week on sale.</p>

<p>As announced on social media,&nbsp;<em>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road&nbsp;</em>has <a href="https://x.com/InazumaSeries/status/1991397741881356657" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">racked up 500,000 sales</a> across all of the platforms on which it's currently available. Given that it's a niche soccer RPG, that's a pretty impressive number for the game's first seven days.</p>

<p>The figure puts&nbsp;the latest&nbsp;<em>Inazuma Eleven&nbsp;</em>game in some pretty illustrious company as well; it's sold the same amount as indie hits like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-im-not-a-human-500k-sales" rel="nofollow">"anxiety horror"&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-im-not-a-human-500k-sales" rel="nofollow">No, I'm Not a Human</a>&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-sales-500k" rel="nofollow">cozy RPG&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em></a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-sales-500k-match.jpg?itok=NvsFBLDY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-sales-500k-match.jpg?itok=8TIT053i 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road&nbsp;</em>has sold half a million copies since launching last week.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road&nbsp;</em>is Level-5's second major hit this year, following the release of&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em>back in May.</p>

<p>That game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-switch-2-500k-sales" rel="nofollow">managed to pick up half a million sales</a> in its first week as well, and it went on to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-sales-1m-new-update" rel="nofollow">pass the million mark</a> before a month had elapsed, so here's hoping that the studio's latest will achieve the same result as well.</p>

<p>It's certainly been a long and strange journey for&nbsp;<em>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</em>. The game was announced all the way back in 2016 under the name&nbsp;<em>Inazuma Eleven Ares</em>,&nbsp;and in the years between then and now, it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/inazuma-eleven-heroes-great-road-delayed-until-2021" rel="nofollow">delayed numerous times</a>, receiving a couple of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-will-come-west-new-trailer-details-revealed" rel="nofollow">name changes</a> along the way.</p>

<p>This is the latest title in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Inazuma Eleven&nbsp;</em>series, and it follows the journey of new protagonists Destin Billows and Harper Evans, with a story taking place a quarter of a century after the events of the first game.</p>
