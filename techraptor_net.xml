            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic and Unity have announced a collaboration that will allow developers working in the latter engine to release their games within the&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>ecosystem, and it'll have benefits for Unreal Engine developers too, apparently.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/news/unity-and-epic-games-together-advance-the-open-interoperable-future-for-video-gaming" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a>, Unity says the ability for Unity games to be brought into&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>will create "more opportunity and value for players and developers", pointing to&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s status as "one of the world's largest gaming ecosystems".</p>

<p>As part of the collaboration, Unreal Engine support will also be added to Unity's cross-platform commerce management system, which will in turn give Unreal Engine devs "more choice for managing everything from their digital catalogs and payment&nbsp;providers to web shops across PC, mobile, and web".</p>

<p>Epic boss Tim Sweeney, meanwhile, says that companies should work alongside one another "in order to build the open metaverse in a way that's interoperable and fair", and that this partnership allows Epic and Unity to "help developers build fun games, reach bigger audiences, and find success".</p>

<p>News of this collaboration comes after Unity reportedly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/more-unity-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">laid off a number of employees</a> back in February, including the engine's Behavior team, which worked on the "visual tool" of the same name.</p>

<p>Those purported layoffs came after the engine <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unity-runtime-fee-canceled" rel="nofollow">canceled its controversial runtime fee</a> for developers and publishers in September last year, the revision of which caused a firestorm of controversy among industry figures when it was introduced in late 2023.</p>

<p>Earlier in November, the <i>Fortnite&nbsp;</i>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-google-fortnite-joint-proposal" rel="nofollow">announced a new proposal</a>, devised alongside current legal opponent Google, which aims to end the lawsuit between the two companies and open up the Play Store more for third-party stores and payment systems.</p>

<p>More information about this Unity-Epic partnership will be announced next year, the two companies say. Stay tuned for more on that.</p>
