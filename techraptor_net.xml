<p>Confirming the delay in a statement given to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643483/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-delayed-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">G</a><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ameSpot</a>, Nintendo media relations VP Eddie Garcia said the previously-announced pre-order date of April 9th would be pushed back "in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions".</p>

<p>Garcia said Nintendo will "update timing at a later date", but that the Switch 2's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">release date of June 5th</a> remains unchanged. It's unclear whether the My Nintendo Store pre-order date of May 8th will remain in place at time of writing.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Nintendo announced that the Switch 2 would cost $449.99 in the US, with that price rising to $499.99 if you want the console bundled with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">launch title&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em></a>.</p>

<p>However, yesterday, US president Donald Trump introduced a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1jxrnl9xe2o" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sweeping range of tariffs</a> aimed at various countries and economic bodies, including the European Union, China, Vietnam, and Cambodia. Other countries, like the UK, Australia, and Brazil, were hit with a baseline tariff of 10%.</p>

<p>Those tariffs will hit Nintendo in some of its key manufacturing centers, which will inevitably cause the company to raise its prices for consumers (since that's <a href="https://time.com/7274160/trump-reciprocal-tariffs-questions-answered-explainer/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pretty much always</a> what ends up happening when it comes to tariffs).</p>




<p>Nintendo hasn't yet announced that it will delay pre-orders anywhere outside the US, but if you're in one of the countries that's been hardest hit by Trump's tariffs, you may wish to keep a close eye on things in the near future.</p>

<p>In case you missed the announcement, Nintendo officially revealed the Switch 2 earlier this week. It'll come complete with a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-specs-revealed" rel="nofollow">1080p screen, a 4K dock, and 120fps support</a> for some games, and it's launching on June 5th (a date which still appears to be intact around the world). Stay tuned for more.</p>
