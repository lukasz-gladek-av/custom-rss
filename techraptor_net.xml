            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/knightling-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Saber Interactive and developer Twirlbound have announced the release date for 3D action-adventure platformer&nbsp;<em>The Knightling</em>, and it's gracing PC and current-gen consoles (as well as the Switch) this summer.</p>

<p><em>The Knightling&nbsp;</em>was originally unveiled <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/knightling-saber-interactive-2025" rel="nofollow">back in August last year</a>, which feels pretty appropriate given that the game's official release date is August 28th.</p>

<p>In&nbsp;<em>The Knightling</em>, you'll play as the titular hero as he attempts to follow in the footsteps of his missing mentor Sir Lionstone, the legendary guardian of the land of Clesseia. The Knightling must discover what's happened to Sir Lionstone and save him from whoever has taken him prisoner.</p>

To that end, you'll also be unlocking "the extraordinary powers of Sir Lionstone's mighty shield".</p>

<p>You will, of course, be playing as Sir Lionstone's apprentice, but I'm betting that by the time this one is over, you'll have discovered that even young knightlings can exhibit great courage. That's just a guess, mind.</p>

<p><em>The Knightling</em>'s combat will give you the chance not only to press the attack against your enemies, but also to block and parry attacks in order to create your own openings, finishing the fight with "huge attacks and combos".</p>

<p>The shield isn't just a combat weapon, though; you'll also be using it to solve various puzzles, platform your way across the world, and unlock secrets in order to earn new upgrades.</p>




<p>If you'd like to check out&nbsp;<em>The Knightling&nbsp;</em>before you commit to picking it up in August, then there's a free demo for you to try out right now on Steam. Hey, what have you got to lose, eh?</p>

<p><em>The Knightling&nbsp;</em>comes to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1471650/The_Knightling/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10004254/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/the-knightling/9nd5r4j0g5lv" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and Nintendo Switch on August 28th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/united-videogame-workers-union-formed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Communications Workers of America and the American Federation of Musicians have announced the United Videogame Workers Union, the first North American industry-wide union that any employee working within the field can join.</p>

<p>Per a press release on the new UVW <a href="https://uvw-cwa.org/news/20250319-press-release" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, the union will demand "dignity and job security for all video game workers", with the union pointing to the devastating slew of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-studio-visual-arts-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">layoffs</a> that's been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/oxenfree-night-school-layoffs" rel="nofollow">assailing the industry</a> in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-june-14th" rel="nofollow">last couple of years</a>.</p>

<p>The union's mission statement is to "take back our lives, our labor, and our passion from those who treat us like replaceable cogs", and to work to create a gaming industry that "nourishes its talent and invests in its future, rather than constantly seeking short-term profits".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/iwgb-united-videogame-workers-union.jpg?itok=k7JXVRjg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/iwgb-united-videogame-workers-union.jpg?itok=d1tc51UB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The UVW union joins the likes of the UK's IWGB.</figcaption></figure><p>Anyone working in the gaming industry in the US and Canada can join the UVW union, and the organization's mission statement says its structure allows you to do so "without the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ustwo-games-accused-of-union-busting-over-austin-kelmore-dismissal" rel="nofollow">obstacles and delays</a> that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/raven-software-activision-microsoft-labor-complaint" rel="nofollow">employers can impose</a> during the traditional <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activision-blizzard-fights-to-delay-union-vote-tabulation" rel="nofollow">union certification process</a>".</p>

<p>In addition to US and Canada employees, the UVW union will also encompass "video game contractors, freelancers, indie developers, workers who are currently unemployed, and workers who are already organizing their workplaces", so even if you already have a workplace union, you can join up.</p>

<p>CWA senior director of organizing Tom Smith says the new union is a "cumulative effort" by workers to "redefine what it means to stand together and reclaim power", while CWA president Claude Cummings Jr. describes the union as an "exciting next step" in the journey to "help video game workers build power in their industry".</p>
