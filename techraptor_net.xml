            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has released a Psion UA update for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>. This new version of playtest material for the popular fantasy TTRPG introduces tweaks and changes to the Psion class, a casting class that focuses on psychic powers.</p>



<p>In a blog post on <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/2072-designer-insights-from-unearthed-arcana-psion#the-updated-psion" rel="nofollow">D&amp;D Beyond</a> the design team discussed the changes in the Psion UA update. It covers the fundamental parts of the Psion, like its class features and its Psionic Energy dice, as well as tweaks to three of its subclasses. The fourth subclass, the Psi Warper, has been unchanged from the previous <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dungeons-dragons-2024-psion-class-introduced-in-new-unearthed-arcana" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Unearthed Arcana</a>.</p>

Telekinetic Propel and Telepathic Connection are now baseline abilities; you can use them at will as a Bonus Action. They can also be enhanced with Psionic Energy dice. Certain effects have been reworded so you only lose energy dice if your target fails a saving throw. Psionic Modes have been removed, and you have more means of regaining energy dice.</p>

<p>The Metamorph subclass has received some buffs across the board. Now, whenever you use a Psionic Energy dice, you gain temporary hit points. The Life-Bending Weapons feature deals additional damage without spending Psionic Energy dice. Curiously, the UA specifies that if the Psion shows up in a future book, it will include magic items that enhance the subclass' Organic Weapons feature.</p>

<p>The Psykinetic is another subclass that has been bumped up. It has a new feature called Stronger Telekinesis, which enhances the Mage Hand spell, letting it carry up to 20 pounds of weight. The reworked level six feature, Destructive Trance, adds bonus damage to spell attacks. And certain mid-to-late features like Rebounding Field and Heightened Telekinesis either don't use dice, spell slots, or provide temporary hit points.</p>

<p>The most significant changes are reserved for the Telepath subclass. New spells have been added to its spell list, The Potent Thoughts feature greatly extends the use of telepathy to 60 feet. The Scramble Minds feature has been simplified to where enemy behavior is dictated by the caster and not by random dice rolls. This helps add more utility to the subclass without dragging down the pacing of a fight.</p>

<p>The feedback form for the Psion UA update playtest material opens October 9.</p>
