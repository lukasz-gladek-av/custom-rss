            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-chaos-vault-secret-lair-is-for-cats-and-dogs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has dropped a new Chaos Vault Secret Lair for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a>. The new drop of experimental art cards are all about furry companions: cats and dogs. In fact, these two drops are part of a competition.</p>



<p>According to the official <a href="https://secretlair.wizards.com/us/chaosvault#filter-product-1151172|sort-availability_wotc,featured" rel="nofollow">store page</a>, the newest Chaos Vault Secret Lair contains two drops. One drop is called Cats Are Better Dogs. The other is called Dogs Are Better Than Cats. Both drops contain alternative artwork of the same five cards, but showcasing the preferred animal of choice.</p>

<ul><li>Escape to the Wilds</li>
	<li>Rip Apart</li>
	<li>Titanic Ultimatum</li>
	<li>Arcane Signet</li>
	<li>Basilisk Collar</li>
</ul><p>Here is where the competition comes into play for this Chaos Vault Secret Lair. Whichever drop sells more, dogs or cats, will determine a unique Secret Lair drop in 2026. If dogs sell more, the next drop is all dogs. If cats sell more, the next drop is all cats.</p>

<p>At time of writing, it seems that cats may have it. Both the cat and dog drops of the Chaos Vault Secret Lair were available in non-foil (MSRP $29.99) and foil (MSRP $39.99). But the cat foil drop has sold out. Unless new supply comes in or the dog lovers pick up the pace, one of 2026's Secret Lair drops may be full of claws, tuna treats, and hairballs.</p>

<p>This is the third Chaos Vault Secret Lair dropped by Wizards of the Coast. These spin-off drops are for more creative, or esoteric artwork that may not fit other Secret Lairs. The other two Chaos Vault drops included <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/latest-secret-lair-chaos-vault-previews-psychedelic-land-cards" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">psychedelic land cards</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-announces-their-first-chaos-vault-drop-for-magic-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">intricate art deco signage</a> This is in contrast with recent Secret Lairs containing crossovers with <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/spongebob-secret-lair-brings-iconic-cartoon-to-magic-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Spongebob Squarepants</a> and Hatsune Miku,</p>
