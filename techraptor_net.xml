            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-sales-8m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Warhorse Studios has announced that&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance&nbsp;</em>sales have crossed another big sales barrier just a few months before the sequel is due to launch.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance&nbsp;</em>has sold eight million copies since launching back in 2018, which works out at more than a million copies a year (on average, at least; the studio doesn't break down when those sales occurred, of course).</p>

<p>This also means&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance&nbsp;</em>has managed to sell around two million copies in around nine months; back in February, it was announced that the game had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-sales-six-million">crossed the six million mark</a>. Looks like Warhorse's RPG really is a steady seller.</p>

<p>Originally due to arrive this year,&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>will instead be launching on February 11th; it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-delay">delayed back in August</a>&nbsp;owing to a need for "a tiny bit more time" on Warhorse's part.</p>

<p>When it does arrive, however,&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>is promising just as weighty and lengthy an RPG as its predecessor. In late August, it was revealed that the game's script <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-script-words">will have over two million words</a>, so if you like a lot of dialogue and text in your RPGs, you're in luck.</p>




<p>As for the original&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em>, it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/acclaimed-open-world-rpg-kingdom-come-deliverance-coming-to-nintendo-switch">ported to Nintendo Switch</a> earlier this year, which means it's now possible to play the RPG on all major platforms (and I'd recommend you do so if you want to be fully prepared for the followup).</p>

<p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/379430/Kingdom_Come_Deliverance/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP2047-CUSA07238_00-KCDGAME010000000" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 4</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/kingdom-come-deliverance/BNBWFH89FCF1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox One</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/kingdom-come-deliverance-royal-edition-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>, and it's also playable on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S via backwards compatibility. The sequel is due out on February 11th, and you can read <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-preview-bigger-better-and-more-approachable">our preview of it here</a> if you want to know how it's shaping up.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/building-ultimate-captain-america-first-avenger-mtg-deck<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Magic and Marvel are coming together, starting with five secret lairs that are releasing in early November. Five iconic Marvel characters are getting unique <em>Magic: The Gathering </em>cards in their <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-magic-gathering-marvel-crossover-details-revealed-including-new-secret-lair-and" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" New Magic: The Gathering Marvel Crossover Details Revealed, Including new Secret Lair and Set">own secret lairs</a>, paired up with reskins or new arts of other cards to complement them.</p>

<p>A Secret Lair gives you some good cards, but we’re going to go through how to build a Marvel MTG deck around the commanders, starting with Captain America, First Avenger</p>

<h3>Examining Captain America, First Avenger</h3>



<p>Our first step is to examine Cap, who is appropriately Red, White, and Blue (in a nice flavor nod, they rearranged the normal order of color display from blue, red, white to fit the traditional America order). He comes with a solid body as a 3 mana 4/4 and has two abilities, in ‘Throw…’ and ‘…Catch’.</p>

<p>Throw… is the more unique ability of the two, letting you unattach an equipment to deal damage equal to the equipment’s mana value divided among up to three targets. Few cards have ever used <a href="https://scryfall.com/search?q=o%3Aunattach&amp;unique=cards&amp;as=grid&amp;order=name" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="List of cards that have Unattach in their text">unattach in rules text</a>, and none ever in this way. As for …Catch it is a free equip trigger, letting you give Captain America a piece of equipment at the beginning of combat on your turn at no cost.</p>

<p>What this shows us is a commander who is equipment focused, like any number of Boros commanders. Part of what makes Captain America special is that he adds blue to the mix, opening up new cards for this archetype. Combine that with providing a potentially unique take on the archetype, Captain America, the First Avenger provides an interesting tweak on a well known archetype.</p>

<h3>Captain America’s Equipment</h3>



<p>It’s time to suit up Captain America! There are a lot of equipment that can be included but I’m going to focus on a handful that you should look at including in your own Captain America deck.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/acr/72/excalibur-sword-of-eden" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Excalibur, Sword of Eden">Excalibur, Sword of Eden </a>is from the <em>Assassin’s Creed Universes Beyond </em>set, and is the highest mana value equipment in Magic: The Gathering. It also comes down cheaper based on other historic permanents you control (aka legendary cards, saga’s and artifacts). It is perfect for Captain America, First Avenger to throw, but it’s also good for him to wield in combat as it gives the equipped creature +10/+0 and vigilance.</p>

<p>Sword of War and Peace is an automatic inclusion, in its <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/sld/1730/sword-of-war-and-peace" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Shield of War and Peace">Shield of War and Peace</a> styling that comes with the secret lair. You’ll probably want to include at least one other <a href="https://scryfall.com/search?q=otag%3Asword-of-x-and-y" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Swords of X and Ys">Sword of X and Y</a>, as they are very good. I recommend <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/acr/124/sword-of-feast-and-famine" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Sword of Feast and Famine">Sword of Feast and Famine</a> in particular as it untapped lands when you deal damage to an opponent, letting you do some more throwing post-combat or cast more spells, and gives protection from green and black.</p>



<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/rvr/260/illusionists-bracers" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Illusionist's Bracers">Illusionist’s Bracers</a>, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/c21/48/battlemages-bracers" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Battlemage's Bracers">Battlemage’s Bracers</a> are for doubling activating abilities. These are helpful for getting more out of Captain’s Throw… ability, making it far more lethal. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/td2/74/grafted-exoskeleton" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Grafted Exoskeleton">Grafted Exoskeleton </a>is a way to turn those throws into extra lethality by making that damage all poisonous, letting only ten damage wipe out a foe - one Excalibur toss becomes lethal.</p>

<h3>Captain America’s Support</h3>

<p>To get Captain America to battle takes more than just a few weapons however. Luckily, there’s no lack of support that we can supply for him.</p>



<p>With one piece of equipment we really want in <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/acr/72/excalibur-sword-of-eden" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Excalibur, Sword of Eden">Excalibur, Sword of Eden</a>, we need quartermaster’s to fetch the goods. That’s why we are looking at tutors like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/2xm/31/stoneforge-mystic" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Stoneforge Mystic">Stoneforge Mystic</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/woe/230/kellan-the-fae-blooded-birthright-boon" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Kellan, the Fae Blooded">Kellan, The Fae-Blooded</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/cmm/59/steelshapers-gift" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Steelshaper's Gift">Steelshaper’s Gift</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/cmr/34/open-the-armory" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Open the Armory">Open the Armory</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mrd/35/fabricate" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Fabricate">Fabricate</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/afr/222/fighter-class" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Fighter Class">Fighter Class</a>, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dmr/6/enlightened-tutor" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Enlightened Tutor">Enlightened Tutor</a>. These all can grab Excalibur, or whichever piece of equipment is most useful at any given moment.</p>

<p>For other equipment support we’re looking to a mix of creatures, and enchantments to get extra value, cheapen the cost and return them. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ltr/17/forge-anew" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Forge Anew">Forge Anew </a>is a staple of equipment decks for good reason, resurrecting one equipment, giving instant-speed equipping, and giving you a free equip each turn. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/pip/698/puresteel-paladin" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Puresteel Paladin">Puresteel Paladin</a> lets us draw cards for playing them (just like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/nec/88/sram-senior-edificer" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Sram, Senior Edificer">Sram</a>, who’s also invited to the party), and skip equipment costs as long as we have three or more artifacts.</p>



<p>Reinforcing Captain America, First Avenger we also bring <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mul/65/zirda-the-dawnwaker" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Zirda the Dawnwaker">Zirda, the Dawnwaker </a>to cheapen the cost of his ability, and of all of the equip costs. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/otj/203/ertha-jo-frontier-mentor" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Ertha Jo, Frontier mentor">Ertha Jo, Frontier Mentor</a> provides another ability doubler, as well as a pair of bodies to pick up dropped equipment. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/pip/14/codsworth-handy-helper" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Codsworth, Handy Helper">Codsworth, Handy Helper</a> is an under the radar helper as well, as it can freely equip things once a turn, gives Captain America Ward 2, and can tap for two mana to play equipment.</p>

<p>Captain America also needs protection, and for that a mixture of creatures and instants come to mind, in addition to some equipment you can include. In the realm of creature cards, there’s the likes of <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/one/33/skrelv-defector-mite" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Skrelv, Defector Mite">Skrelv, Defector Mite</a> (who I prefer here over <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/clb/702/mother-of-runes" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Mother of Runes">Mother of Runes </a>due to being an artifact, and a legendary creature), and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ltr/669/pippin-guard-of-the-citadel" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Pippin, Guard of the Citadel ">Pippin, Guard of the Citadel</a> who can cheaply stop removal spells. A relatively new option is <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mh3/240/hydroelectric-specimen-hydroelectric-laboratory" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Hydroelectric Specimen">Hydroelectric Specimen </a>which can redirect a single target spell to itself, and as a modal dual-faced card, is optionally playable as a land instead.</p>



<p>Spellwise we have some counterspells and protection spells. The counterspell suite should look at <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dsc/110/arcane-denial" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Arcane Denial">Arcane Denial</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dsc/114/counterspell" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Counterspell">Counterspell</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/cmm/94/fierce-guardianship" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Fierce Guardianship">Fierce Guardianship</a>, and the modal card <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mh3/241/sink-into-stupor-soporific-springs" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Sink into Stupor">Sink into Stupor </a>(another bonus land option), though you can modify this for your preferred counterspells, with the focus being stopping spells that can remove Captain America or key equipment. Protection spells should complement that and include options like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/2x2/32/teferis-protection" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Teferi's Protection">Teferi’s Protection</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/sld/1728/flawless-maneuver" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Flawless Maneuver">Flawless Maneuver</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/znr/37/sejiri-shelter-sejiri-glacier" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Sejiri Shelter">Sejiri Shelter</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/Deflecting%20Swat" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="https://scryfall.com/card/cmm/214/deflecting-swat">Deflecting Swat</a>.</p>

<p>Using what's above I made an example list, and included a list of later cuts in the maybeboard. Here is <a href="https://archidekt.com/decks/9743049/captain_america" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Captain America Deck">the list </a>for your use to consider ideas for your own list.</p>

<h2>Budget Marvel MTG Options For Captain America, First Avenger</h2>

<p>A lot of the options above aren’t necessarily the cheapest so let’s do a quick budget ($2.00 or less) rundown of cards for some areas.</p>

<p><strong>Equipment</strong><br><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/afc/198/argentum-armor" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Argentum Armor">Argentum Armor</a>: A solid expensive equipment you can use to help deal with problematic permanents.<br><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/one/197/bladehold-war-whip" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Bladehold War Whip">Bladehold War-Whip</a>: A way to give double strike, and cheapen equip costs.<br><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/pip/225/basilisk-collar" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Basilisk Collar">Basilisk Collar</a>: This gives Captain America, First Avenger deathtouch, and lifelink, making his throw a board wipe.<br><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/onc/14/hexplate-wallbreaker" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Hexplate Wallbreaker">Hexplate Wallbreaker</a>: Getting free combat’s each turn is useful if you are relying more on voltroning.</p>

<p><strong>Support</strong><br><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ddu/42/trophy-mage" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Trophy Mage">Trophy Mage</a>: A tutor for expensive artifacts that can also wield the weapons itself.<br><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/khm/211/forging-the-tyrite-sword" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Forging The Tyrite Sword">Forging The Tyrite Sword</a>: A slow tutor that also provides a couple mana.<br><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/Bureau%20Headmaster" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Bureau Headmaster">Bureau Headmaster</a>: Cheapen Equipment, and equip costs.<br><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/cmr/460/brass-squire" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Brass Squire">Brass Squire</a>: Can tap to attach equipment and bypass equip costs.<br><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dmu/15/danitha-benalias-hope" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Danitha, Benalia’s Hope">Danitha, Benalia’s Hope</a>: Resurrect or cheat out equipment, and get them attached for free.<br><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/cmm/335/akiri-fearless-voyager" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Akiri, Fearless Voyager">Akiri, Fearless Voyager</a>: Provides the ability to protect equipped creatures, and draw cards.<br><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ltc/162/bastion-protector" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Bastion Protector">Bastion Protector</a>: Grows Captain America, and makes him indestructible, even if a 3/3 is a bit vulnerable itself.<br><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/sta/18/negate" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Negate">Negate</a>: Cheap, solid protection in counterspell form.<br><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ala/173/hindering-light" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Hindering Light">Hindering Light</a>: Counters stuff that targets your stuff.</p>

<p>Hopefully all of this helps you build the best Captain America, First Avenger deck to lead against all the challengers you will face.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/runemasters-review-punishingly-fun<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>What is it about sacred temples that make them such juicy targets for roving monsters and villains? That’s a question you… won’t have time to answer in <i>Runemasters</i>, a new <a href="https://funforge.fr/en/products/runemasters">cooperative game by Funforge</a>. I’ve been on a real hot streak reviewing great new board games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/chandigarh-board-game-review-colorful-and-think-y"><i>Chandigarh</i></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/botanicus-review-it-grows-on-you"><i>Botanicus</i></a>, and now the good folks at Flat River Group sent me the slim-but-tricky <i>Runemasters </i>to check out, so follow along for my <i>Runemasters</i> Review!</p>

<h2>What Is <i>Runemasters</i>, And How Do You Play<i>?</i></h2>

<p>Designed by Antoine Prono with illustrations by Paul Mafayon, Théo Guillot, and Adrien Martinez, <i>Runemasters</i> is a cooperative tower defense game for 1 - 4 players, where players take on the role of guardians protecting a temple from hordes of enemies. Each of the four guardians has a different distinct special ability and ultimate power, which you’ll need to use against the incoming threat.</p>

<p>And believe me, that threat will, indeed, be incoming! One of the things I find most interesting about <i>Runemasters </i>is that it is, quite simply put, extremely punishing. I feel like many cooperative games, over the past five years or so, have softened their difficulty levels. This makes sense when so many of them are more narratively driven, inviting users to explore a world and story.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/runemasters-review-characters-1.jpeg?itok=CikAl8Pi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/runemasters-review-characters-1.jpeg?itok=gRAE-BMw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Each hero brings unique skills to the table... will they be enough?</figcaption></figure><p>But sometimes you just want to bash your head against a wall in a coop game that’ll leave your gaming group in shambles, like <i>Pandemic</i> or <i>Spirit Island</i>. <i>Runemasters</i>, I’m happy to report, is a return to that classic form.</p>

<p>In the game, you’ll flip over cards depicting monsters and place them on a colored track that matches their card color. Each turn, they’ll move one space closer to the temple, and automatically deal damage to any hero blocking their path. If no hero’s on the path, they’ll damage the temple. If all your heroes die, or the temple takes too much damage, you lose!</p>

<p>To defeat these monsters, you’ll roll custom six-sided dice. The dice allow you to deal a point of damage to the first enemy in your track if one of their “weak points” matches a symbol you rolled. Or you can use those symbols to power up your ultimate power, perform a special ability, or swap spaces with another guardian.</p>

<h2>The Pleasure Of Difficulty In <i>Runemasters</i></h2>

<p>Maybe I’m a chronically bad dice roller (FACT), but it was such a challenge to get the right symbols at the right time. There are many clever, interlocking mechanics in this little game that add to your strategic options - you can spend the dice you roll to build a wall, or expend mana points to re-roll dice - but I was still left struggling again and again.</p>

<p>But I want to be clear: <i>this is not a bad thing</i>! Cooperative games in this style have lead to some of the most fun, joyfully anguishing moments in my gaming career, and when we finally did beat the game after multiple tries, we were left feeling utterly triumphant. I really enjoy the way the game doesn’t overload you with options, while still managing to give you a few key tools in your hero’s toolkit.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/runemasters-review-characters-2.jpeg?itok=bGcYfnQL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/runemasters-review-characters-2.jpeg?itok=L3wS_IGj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ismoros's ability to shield heroes from enemies is not to be overlooked.</figcaption></figure><p>The one major downside with <i>Runemasters</i>, however, is also intrinsically tied to the difficulty and design of the game - and that’s player elimination (Boo! Hiss!). In this game, if your hero is killed - that’s it, you’re done! One of the heroes can resurrect other characters twice in the game, but A. that takes a lot of work to build up the magic power to do so and B. if <i>that</i> hero dies, there’s no resurrection happening.</p>

<p>I would like to see a mechanic where you come back after you die, but suffer some sort of penalty. Even if the penalty imposed made the game equally as hard as losing a character, at least that player wouldn’t have to sit around and wait for everyone else to finish the game. In most cooperative games, if your character dies the entire game is a loss (that’s how they do it in the gloriously chunky <i>Cthulhu: Death May Die</i>, which is of course an entirely differently scoped game, but I just played it so it’s fresh in my mind).</p>

<p>The flip side to this, which solves the problem of player death, is that this game can just as easily be played solo mode. You don’t need to make any adjustments, and if one of your characters dies, you’ve still got plenty of game to go!</p>

<p>The illustrators Paul Mafayon, Théo Guillot, and Adrien Martinez have truly outdone themselves with the quirky, angular designs on all of these cards. The heroes look extremely stylized and have a lot of kinetic movement to them, the monsters are all great renderings of classic dungeon threats, and there’s overall a clean, unfussy look to the game.</p>
