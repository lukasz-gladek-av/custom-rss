            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There's an old saying: "You never truly quit&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/world-of-warcraft" rel="nofollow"><em>World of Warcraft</em></a>. You just take really long breaks.<em>"&nbsp;</em>Well, some breaks have been longer than others, but this saying does have some truth to it, at least from my personal experience. But in comes&nbsp;<em>Fellowship</em>, a game that may just make me end my decade-spanning addiction.</p>

<p>The hype for&nbsp;<em>Fellowship</em>&nbsp;is quite big in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/genre/mmorpg/games" rel="nofollow">MMORPG</a> circles I frequent, and for good reason. Let me emphasize, <em>Fellowship</em>&nbsp;is not an MMORPG; rather, it's described as a "multiplayer online dungeon adventure" (MODA). It aims to capture the dungeon-delving experience of popular MMOs like&nbsp;<em>WoW</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv" rel="nofollow"><em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></a>, and make that the sole focus of the game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Doing challenging dungeons was always my favorite aspect of&nbsp;<em>WoW</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Fellowship'</em>s<em>&nbsp;</em>vision to capture that feel is, thus far, resulting in a familiar, yet delightfully fun experience. After my<em>&nbsp;</em>private play session with&nbsp;<em>Fellowship</em>, I'm ready: I need this game to come out&nbsp;<em>now.</em>&nbsp;Thankfully for you, dear readers, it's already out in Early Access, but for me, writing this a few weeks in advance, I'll just have to impatiently wait.</p>

<p>My thoughts on&nbsp;<em>Fellowship</em>&nbsp;are based on one play session through a never-before-seen dungeon, using a brand new, freshly announced hero: Elarion. Rather than creating characters like an MMORPG,&nbsp;<em>Fellowship</em>&nbsp;features pre-made heroes with their own distinct look and feel.</p>

<p>In Elarion's case, he's an archer with lunar/celestial magical abilities to enhance his bow attacks. Like&nbsp;<em>WoW&nbsp;</em>or other MMORPGs, player classes typically fall into DPS, healers, and tanks. In Elarion's case, he's a ranged DPS, which is something I would almost exclusively play in&nbsp;<em>WoW</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fellowship-ui-2.jpg?itok=2flzZD8g 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fellowship-ui-2.jpg?itok=P05WK2eG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Here's the UI in combat.</figcaption></figure><p>There's a hub where you can get acquainted with your hero. Walking to the target dummy area, I was able to test Elarion's abilities and immediately felt at home. He has his builder ability to gain resources, spenders like an instant-shot (this felt like Cobra Shot in&nbsp;<em>WoW),&nbsp;</em>various AoEs, and self-buffs.</p>

<p>Something a bit more unique to&nbsp;<em>Fellowship</em>&nbsp;are ultimates -- each hero has their own, and in Elarion's case, after a duration, he gains the ability to cast what is essentially a haste or bloodlust buff. If I had to draw comparisons once more, Elarion felt like a cross between a Marksmanship and Beast Mastery Hunter from&nbsp;<em>WoW</em>.</p>

<p>Elarion aside, MMO players will immediately understand the controls and UI. The UI is actually highly customizable, so you can rearrange windows the way you see fit; likewise, you can assign hotkeys for your two rows of abilities. I&nbsp;<em>believe</em>&nbsp;abilities are all contained within those two rows, so you won't need a bunch of extra action bars.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ui-fellowship.jpg?itok=vBWhiP_i 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ui-fellowship.jpg?itok=c7cEVanR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Here's an example of the customizable UI.</figcaption></figure><p>Baked into the game already are useful tools like damage and healing meters. That's right, no mods are needed for this one. The meters track overall damage and healing done, so you can see who's slacking off! Jokes aside, this is a great inclusion and one that most MMORPG players will appreciate.</p>

<p>Other than that, your party's health and status are above the action bars on the default UI, so what&nbsp;<em>Fellowship</em>&nbsp;gives players are all the tools to succeed in its dungeons. Developer Chief Rebel absolutely knows what players want, based on the ability to rearrange UI and what we're given right from the start.</p>

<p>My play session took me through the dungeon Ransack of Drakheim, a Norse-inspired region with a mix of grassy, hilly terrain and snow. Normally, this is one of&nbsp;<em>Fellowship</em>'s most difficult dungeons, only available after you've put some work in, but we were given a preview-exclusive difficulty mode to ease us into the game's mechanics.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Difficulty-wise, it's hard to gauge since it was put on an easier mode for the purposes of this playtest. I don't believe there are difficulty options in the Early Access version of&nbsp;<em>Fellowship;&nbsp;</em>rather, you can take on increasingly challenging dungeons&nbsp;through the Game Finder (the matchmaking) and going to Challenge mode.</p>

<p>In Challenge mode, players will be able to increase their rank from Contender all the way to Paragon. As you rise in rank, dungeons will have various modifiers that up the challenge -- think of these like Mythic+ modifiers in&nbsp;<em>WoW</em>&nbsp;dungeons. The greater the risk, the greater the reward, as completed dungeons always grant loot for players at the end.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fodir.jpg?itok=uhZC9OGB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fodir.jpg?itok=PpCNqTmo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>He's bigger than I thought.</figcaption></figure><p>But yes, the Ransack of Drakheim. It's a fairly open dungeon with no straightforward path, and the non-linearity makes it feel more intriguing. You're able to skip or take on a number of mobs in the dungeon as you make your way to each boss.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our tank would gather up packs of enemies, and I could use one ability to shoot an arrow that pulls mobs into one neat central point. That helped the team consolidate their AoE attacks on one spot and decimate the enemy. Aided by my volley-like ability and a multi-shot attack, Elarion excels at AoE especially.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/treasure-boss-fellowship.jpg?itok=WRb2c7mn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/treasure-boss-fellowship.jpg?itok=BhSvv2N5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Treasure boss? He ought to have some good loot.</figcaption></figure><h2>Bosses and Sweet, Sweet Loot</h2>

<p>There are several bosses in this dungeon, each with their own mechanics that challenge players' ability to fulfill their role. My favorite boss in this area was Chilgar the Drowned, a big frost elemental that spawns crashing waves from many different directions.</p>

<p>These waves will absolutely hurt you, so tanking the hit isn't really a great option. There are gaps in between the waves, but as the fight goes on, more and more spawn, and it becomes chaotic. Add to it water tornadoes and a pillar that freezes enemies in its radius, and Chilgar was quite the challenge.</p>

<p>It took a couple of tries to defeat Chilgar; thankfully, a nice quality-of-life feature included in&nbsp;<em>Fellowship</em>&nbsp;is bonfires. You can activate these and use them as your new spawn point, so you don't have to run all the way back from the start of the dungeon. I realize bonfires in video games come with certain Soulsy connotations, but that's where the similarities begin and end. It's just a spawn point, nothing more.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sylvie-heals-fellowship1.jpg?itok=IqT91Vsv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sylvie-heals-fellowship1.jpg?itok=TcdkCdoi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sylvie's heals came in handy!</figcaption></figure><p>Eventually, we defeat the final boss of the dungeon, who has their own distinct abilities and patterns for players to contend with. At the end of each dungeon, players are given personal loot, so unlike&nbsp;<em>WoW</em>, you don't have to hope and pray you get a drop.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The main source of progression, then, seems to be from the loot at the end. Higher difficulties yield better loot, so the progression is clear and straightforward. My character was fast-tracked with all abilities unlocked, but I believe you'll unlock abilities as you progress from the start, rather than begin with every single one.</p>

<p>Then there's a skill tree to further enhance your character, though I didn't have time to delve into that. Still, progression systems are there, and they seem simple enough, meaning your progress isn't likely to be stalled for very long, especially if you're struggling to get that one piece of loot you need.</p>

<p><em>Fellowship</em>&nbsp;has me all kinds of excited. It's launching in Early Access, but I'm glad it is: It's certainly not finished, and player feedback will be essential to ensure every character is tuned well, every dungeon is balanced, and all that jazz that many&nbsp;MMORPGs depend on. Well, I'll be there day one, so if anyone needs a DPS, I'm your guy.</p>
