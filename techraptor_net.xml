            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><i>Life Is Strange&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage&nbsp;</em>developer Don't Nod has announced that it's signed a development deal with Netflix to produce a new game based on one of the streaming giant's IPs.</p>

<p>The news was announced as part of Don't Nod's <a href="https://www.dontnod-bourse.com/en/financial-information/press-releases/?ID=ACTUS-0-94850" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">financial results</a> for the first half of the 2025-26 fiscal year, which show that revenue has increased by a factor of 3.8 when compared to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-nod-financials-first-half-2024" rel="nofollow">the same period last year</a>.</p>

<p>The studio puts its revenue growth down to the "solid progress of its operational transformation" and the signing of the aforementioned Netflix deal, although I'm not sure the employees who <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-nod-employees-strike" rel="nofollow">lost their jobs</a> as part of that "operational transformation" would be particularly happy with their part in things.</p>

<p>It's not clear what the IP in question is, but my money's on 80s throwback horror property&nbsp;<em>Stranger Things</em>. Back in 2018, it was announced that <i>The Walking Dead</i>'s Telltale <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/telltale-is-making-stranger-things-adventure-game-with-netflix" rel="nofollow">would work on a&nbsp;<em>Stranger Things&nbsp;</em>adventure game</a>, but the project was closed when the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/updatedtelltale-games-begins-closing-entering-assignment-proceedings" rel="nofollow">closed its doors that same year</a>.</p>

<p>Don't Nod's experience with games like&nbsp;<em>Life Is Strange</em>,&nbsp;<em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Tell Me Why&nbsp;</em>would arguably make them the ideal choice for reviving that project, although since nothing official has been announced yet, this is all just speculation.</p>

<p>The Netflix game will take its place alongside two other in-development projects at Don't Nod, namely narrative-led action-adventure title&nbsp;<em>Aphelion&nbsp;</em>and a mysterious game known only as "P14" at present.</p>

Stay tuned for more.</p>
