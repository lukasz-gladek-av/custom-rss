            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Pre-orders are now live for Osprey Games' newest skirmish game. <em>Hide, Stone, and Bone</em> is a notable departure from the studio's historical and fantastical routes, tasking players with ensuring the survival of early man during the Ice Age.</p><h2>The <em>Hide, Stone, and Bone</em> Pre-Order Announcement</h2><p>According to its store page, <em>Hide, Stone, and Bone</em> is a skirmish wargame of prehistoric survival. Players lead tribes of early men as they hunt and survive during the brutal conditions of the Ice Age.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>These moments of survival are broken up into Big Days. Big Days represent substantive events like mammoth hunts, cave bear attacks, and clashes with rival tribes. Between these events, you must gather food, craft tools and weapons, and consult shamans for guidance. Once these events happen, break out the miniatures and the dice. These skirmishes and hunts are resolved using a d10-based alternating activation system.</p><p>The core experience of <em>Hide, Stone, and Bone</em> is its detailed campaign system. The ultimate goal is survival. This means, even if the dice are against you while fighting other tribes, your group can still thrive in the long run.</p><p>The game is the tabletop debut of Austin Hunt. According to his bio, Hunt has been a war gamer for over two decades, playing in multiple games across different genres. The book features illustrations by Netherlands artist Mars Oosterveld, whose work has also featured in <em>Paleomythic</em>.</p><p>Osprey Games is known for a diverse catalog of skirmish games. Their work has ranged from the miniature agnostic sci-fi dogfights of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/voidfighter-review-sci-fi-dogfights-done-right" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Voidfighter</em></a> to the fantasy battles of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/frostgrave-limited-deluxe-edition-celebrates-10-years-of-skirmish-mayhem" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Frostgrave</em></a>. The studio has even produced historical wargames through its <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/undaunted-normandy-north-africa-and-reinforcements-review" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Undaunted</em></a> series, which covers various theatres of battle in WW2, and the beloved <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/bolt-action-third-edition-breathes-new-life-to-wwii" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Bolt Action</em></a>.</p><p><em>Hide, Stone, and Bone</em> is available for pre-order now on Osprey Games' website. It is available in both softcover (MSRP $25) and Ebook (MSRP $20) formats. The books are expected to ship in January, 2026.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Steam Best of 2025 list has been announced, and it includes a list of the top-selling games on the platform this year, as well as other stats for the storefront.</p><p>According to the list, Steam's top-selling game in 2025 was <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em>, a feat that perhaps isn't too surprising given the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-3m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c5a6dab0-4602-48f3-8a89-7254df3e04d7" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">impressive sales total</a> just a few months out from its launch.</p><p>Technically speaking, <em>PUBG: Battlegrounds </em>is the top-selling game of the year, but since it's a free-to-play title, I'm skipping over it. Strangely, despite its impressive performance in the sales stakes, <em>PUBG </em>isn't the most-played game of the year; that honor goes to <em>Grand Theft Auto V </em>(and, by extension, <em>GTA Online</em>).</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>GTA V</em>, and thus presumably <em>GTA Online</em>, has made it onto Steam's Best of 2025 list.</figcaption>

<p>It's a real live-service jamboree in the top sellers list; other titles include <em>Arc Raiders</em>, which also managed to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/arc-raiders-sales-4m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="08dd5792-c4a8-4824-90f6-27b50a7dc7fa" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">hit a pretty impressive sales milestone</a> in its first couple of weeks, as well as <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, <em>Battlefield 6</em>, and <em>Apex Legends</em>.</p><p>The first non-multiplayer title on the list after <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II </em>is the drug-dealing simulator <em>Schedule I</em>, followed by <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, which is arguably on the borderline given its cycle of frequent updates (although it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-10m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3047bd12-37c9-4b65-bd39-064968be79fa" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">certainly is a big seller</a>).</p><p>When it comes to the Steam Deck, the most-played games of the year skew much more towards time sink-style single-player adventures, including the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-v-has-sold-over-195-million-units-red-dead-redemption-2-at-61-million" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="79f14bf8-3a01-4742-90f0-f879fca71b70" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Red Dead Redemption II</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/baldurs-gate-3-has-way-over-10-million-players-mod-support-has-been-in-works-since" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a6faddb2-01d3-46aa-a769-c7be021e6a4f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a>, and <em>Hollow Knight </em>(although two of those do indeed support multiplayer).</p><p>The list even tracks the games most often played with a controller, and it won't shock you to learn that the likes of <em>Split Fiction</em>, <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>, and, yes, <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 </em>figure heavily on that particular list.</p><figure role="group">
