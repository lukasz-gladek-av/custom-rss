            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Creative Assembly and publisher Sega have announced that&nbsp;<em>Total War: Warhammer III</em>'s upcoming&nbsp;<em>Tides of Torment&nbsp;</em>DLC has been delayed to "later this year".</p>

<p>Originally,&nbsp;<em>Tides of Torment&nbsp;</em>was intended to launch this summer, but as Creative Assembly reveals in a <a href="https://community.creative-assembly.com/total-war/total-war-warhammer/blogs/75" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">new blog post</a>, the DLC won't be meeting that release window. Instead,&nbsp;<em>Tides of Torment&nbsp;</em>will be launching sometime later in 2025, although the studio doesn't commit to a more specific release window than that.</p>

<p>Creative Assembly says that during recent playtesting for&nbsp;<em>Tides of Torment</em>, the studio's developers asked themselves if the DLC "met the standards...set in recent releases", and as you've probably gathered from the delay, the answer was no.</p>

<p>That also means that the info shared as part of the Slaanesh and Norsca previews released back in May is probably "no longer accurate", according to Creative Assembly. More will be shared about these factions, as well as the third and final DLC faction, when the final What's Next video for&nbsp;<em>Tides of Torment&nbsp;</em>arrives.</p>

<p>The studio acknowledges that this year "has been a slower year" for many&nbsp;<em>Total War: Warhammer&nbsp;</em>fans, and that while <i>Warhammer III&nbsp;</i>"is in a better space" this year than in previous years, Creative Assembly is "currently not meeting [its] commitments" to transparency, pledging to address this issue over the next few months through new updates, hotfixes, and preview videos.</p>

<p>With regards to the future of&nbsp;<em>Total War: Warhammer III</em>, Creative Assembly closes by saying that "one of the biggest <em>Total War: Warhammer</em> content packs ever created in the trilogy" is coming next year, and that the possibility of smaller DLC packs that include certain legendary lords or hero units is also on the table.</p>




<p><em>Total War: Warhammer III&nbsp;</em>is available to check out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1142710/Total_War_WARHAMMER_III/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, and you can remind yourself of what our very own Andrew thought of the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/total-war-warhammer-3-review" rel="nofollow">right here</a>. The&nbsp;<em>Tides of Torment&nbsp;</em>DLC is set to launch sometime later this year.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/helldivers-2-control-group-warbond-brings-brutal-new-weaponry-and-more-next-week.1240404/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Sony and developer Arrowhead have announced a new&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Warbond by the name of Control Group, and as usual, this one's packing plenty of new gear to help you give those troublesome Terminids, Automatons, and Illuminate what for.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/10/helldivers-2-control-group-warbond-launches-july-17/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation Blog post</a>, Control Group launches across PC and PS5 on July 17th, which is next Thursday at time óf writing. The Warbond's first major addition is the VG-70 Variable, a three-mode gun with seven barrels. You can fire on auto, choose to fire one barrel at a time, or discharge all of your ammo at once.</p>

<p>A new support weapon, the PLAS-45 Epoch, will also be added as part of this Warbond. It fires a plasma sphere that will explode if you overcharge it, so as with many of&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>'s other weapons, you should be careful not to misuse this gun.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-control-group-warbond-plas-45-epoch.jpg?itok=nR3BijWt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-control-group-warbond-plas-45-epoch.jpg?itok=is0Iinli 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Control Group Warbond has plenty of new toys for you to try out.</figcaption></figure><p>A new electric grenade will also be introduced in the form of the G-31 Arc grenade, which discharges electricity that hits everything in its proximity. That includes your fellow Helldivers, so once again, be careful when it comes to friendly fire.</p>

<p>If you're one for turret deployment, then you may want to give the new&nbsp;A/LAS-98 Laser Sentry a try. It'll continuously fire a laser beam to devastate your enemies, but it will overheat and explode if it isn't put on cooldown, so you'll have to watch for that as well.</p>

<p>Most excitingly, the LIFT-182 Warp Pack allows you to teleport short distances without needing to jump. You should, however, be aware that the singularity you're generating with the pack will deteriorate with each jump, and you may "experience death should the singularity fully collapse". Uh-oh.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-control-group-warbond-warp-pack.jpg?itok=-mTcyGA4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-control-group-warbond-warp-pack.jpg?itok=h9kaFJQj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>What if I told you you could teleport short distances with the new&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Warbond?</figcaption></figure><p>As always, the new Warbond also brings some new armor for you to kit yourself out with, as well as new capes and other extras. Let it never be said you're not being given the opportunity to express your individuality within the Super Earth ranks.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>news, an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-xbox-series-xs-august" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S version</a> of the game was recently confirmed; it's launching in August, on the same day as both&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gears-of-war-reloaded-announced" rel="nofollow">Gears of War: Reloaded</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-ps5-release-date-enhancements" rel="nofollow">Senua's Saga: Hellblade II</a>&nbsp;</em>land on the PS5.</p>
