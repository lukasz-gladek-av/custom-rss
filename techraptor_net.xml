</figure>
<p>Several individuals, including influencer Cyberboi, a number of journalists, and some Build a Rocket Boy employees, will apparently be "served in person, criminal complaints, shortly", with those complaints alleging "espionage, sabotage, and criminal interference".</p><p>Insider Gaming contacted Ritual Network for comment, and the platform told the publication that it is "not involved in the matter". It goes on to say that it's "not aware of any legitimate legal action" brought by Build a Rocket Boy, and that any suggestion it's connected to the aforementioned sabotage is "incorrect".</p><p>Build a Rocket Boy, however, insists that it's on the right track; in a statement, it told Insider Gaming that it has "evidence that there has been a co-ordinated campaign to purposefully and maliciously damage" both the studio and the game, and that it's "taking steps" to address the issue.</p><p>In case you need a reminder, <em>MindsEye </em>launched last year to a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mindseye-launch-messy" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="090d2e26-517c-4b1d-81d8-0c4c40228804" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">pretty negative reception across the board</a>, seemingly leading to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mindseye-build-a-rocket-boy-layoffs-report" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="cc20a09e-a602-4466-a53f-4fb3ccf68d58" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">layoffs at Build a Rocket Boy shortly after the game's launch</a>, as well as publisher IO Interactive seemingly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/io-interactive-mindseye-third-party-publishing" rel="nofollow">pulling back from third-party publishing</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Celebrated CRPG franchise <em>Baldur's Gate </em>is getting its very own TV show, according to a new report, and it'll be brought to you by none other than <em>The Last of Us </em>co-creator and showrunner Craig Mazin.</p><p>Per a <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/baldurs-gate-3-tv-show-craig-mazin-hbo-1236710583/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">new Deadline report</a>, the show is being developed for HBO and seems to be based on the series as a whole, although it will apparently take place directly after the events of <em>Baldur's Gate 3 </em>and will deal with the ramifications of those events.</p><p>Mazin won't just be the showrunner, either; he's also attached as a writer and executive producer, alongside folks from Wizards of the Coast and its owner Hasbro, as you'd expect from a TV show based on a <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons </em>property.</p><figure role="group">

<p>According to Mazin, he's a big fan of Larian's latest entry into the iconic CRPG series; he says he's put "nearly 1000 hours" into the game, and that he's a "devoted fan" not only of <em>Baldur's Gate </em>but of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons </em>in general.</p><p>Although the show will be based on <em>Baldur's Gate</em>, Deadline says it won't draw from the first two games in the series too much, since they're not "official source material", according to the publication.</p><p>With that said, there will be "some commonalities across those games" that also refer to general <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons </em>lore, and those might come into Mazin's new <em>Baldur's Gate </em>show.</p><p>It's worth noting that this is a distinct entity from the upcoming <em>Forgotten Realms </em>TV show, which is being made for Netflix. It's unlikely, therefore, that the two will cross over in any meaningful way, at least not to begin with.</p>
<p><em>Baldur's Gate </em>is just one of the video game franchises getting itself a TV adaptation. It joins the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/far-cry-tv-series-apparently-in-works" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c0708981-d3ea-4448-9169-c69c7a5dddba" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Ubisoft's <em>Far Cry</em></a>, Sony's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/god-of-war-tv-series-not-filming-this-year" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="89ed31a0-2f47-4441-a213-ecc7281c72b1" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>God of War</em></a>, and Bethesda and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wolfenstein-tv-series" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e313e89f-98da-4b59-a46d-ae9d64ca0fe3" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">MachineGames' <em>Wolfenstein</em></a>, among many others.</p><p>We're still likely a long way away from the <em>Baldur's Gate </em>TV show being released, but stay tuned for more info about this as and when we get it.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
