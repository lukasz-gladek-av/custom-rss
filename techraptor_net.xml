            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fromsoftware-single-player-games-miyazaki-duskbloods<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>FromSoftware president Hidetaka Miyazaki has gone on the record to put fans' fears to rest following the announcement of multiplayer Switch 2 exclusive&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods&nbsp;</em>earlier this week.</p>

<p>In a new <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/creators-voice-the-duskbloods-part-1/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Creators' Voice interview</a> with Nintendo about the game, Miyazaki says that despite multiplayer experiments like&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nighreign-release-date" rel="nofollow">the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></a>, FromSoftware has no plans to abandon its usual fare.</p>

<p>According to Miyazaki, these games "[don't] mean that we as a company have decided to shift to a more multiplayer-focused direction", and that the company "still intend[s] to actively develop single-player focused games" like&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>"that embrace our more traditional style".</p>

He goes on to say said structure allows FromSoftware to "leverage our experience of designing challenging enemy encounters" in new ways.</p>

<p>He also provides some more info about&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods&nbsp;</em>itself; you'll play as a vampire-like creature called a Bloodsworn, and you'll be competing with other Bloodsworn for "First Blood" amidst an apocalyptic event known as the Twilight of Humanity.</p>

<p>That's why you'll see a range of different technologies and time periods in&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods</em>; you can think of the game's world as a sort of societal version of&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls 3</em>'s The Dreg Heap, with various different times and places collapsing into one another.</p>

<p>Over the course of a match in&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods</em>, you'll fight both other players and enemies in the environment to accrue Victory Points, and the player with the most Victory Points at the end of the match wins.</p>




<p>Miyazaki says that because he's "not much of a PvP person", he wanted to design a multiplayer game that could be played by those who aren't keen on PvP without depriving those players of a fair chance at winning.</p>

<p>We don't yet have a release date for&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods</em>, but the game will be coming to <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/The-Duskbloods-2789410.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch 2</a> sometime in 2026, and it won't represent the end of FromSoftware's single-player catalog either. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cult-of-lamb-composer-narayana-johnson-dies<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Cult of the Lamb&nbsp;</em>composer Narayana Johnson, who worked under the pseudonym River Boy, has passed away, leading developer Massive Monster to call for fans to give them "some space and some kindness".</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1313140/view/524213474678538839" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the game's Steam page, Massive Monster says it's "impossible to describe how much of a void" Johnson's passing will leave at the studio. He was Massive Monster's audio director, but the dev says he was "more than" that; he was also a "creative powerhouse", a "friend", and "[their] silly little guy".</p>

<p>Massive Monster goes on to say that Johnson is "woven into the soul of&nbsp;<em>Cult of the Lamb</em>" thanks to his audio work on the game, and that both the game and the studio "won't be the same" without him.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cult-of-the-lamb-composer-narayana-johnson-dies-game-shot.jpg?itok=DS4JjmvW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cult-of-the-lamb-composer-narayana-johnson-dies-game-shot.jpg?itok=Eve1pUu8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Cult of the Lamb&nbsp;</em>composer Narayana Johnson has sadly passed away.</figcaption></figure><p>No cause of death was given for Johnson, and no illness was previously revealed either, so it's not entirely clear how he passed away at present.</p>

<p>Massive Monster says it recommends that you "take a moment to look at nature" and "touch your feet to the earth" to celebrate Johnson's life, and that "he would want you to listen to his music and remember how much it meant to him to share it".</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with Johnson as a composer, he often worked under the pseudonym River Boy, and he was also half of the duo Willow Beats.</p>

<p>According to his website, Narayana Johnson made music that "draws extensively on his childhood and teenage years spent roaming creeks, forests and mountains in the Northern Rivers, New South Wales".</p>




<p>His work on&nbsp;<em>Cult of the Lamb&nbsp;</em>feels very evocative of the game's tone; it's dark, eerie electronica, but there's a playful element to it as well, reflective of the game's mixture of sacrificial rituals and cutesy animals.</p>

<p>If you'd like to hear Johnson's work on&nbsp;<em>Cult of the Lamb&nbsp;</em>(and play a pretty great game into the bargain), you can check it out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1313140/Cult_of_the_Lamb/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/cult-of-the-lamb/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/cult-of-the-lamb/9PNLPMP1GGH5" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/cult-of-the-lamb-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.
