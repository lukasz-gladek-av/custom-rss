<p>Like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-update-155" rel="nofollow">previous</a>&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-update-152" rel="nofollow">updates</a> before it, the star of the show when it comes to Update 1.56 is the cars, and this time around, you're getting an "elegant convertible", a multi-purpose truck, and an old reliable rally legend.</p>

<p>First up, it's the BMW Z4 3.0i '03, a convertible sports car that debuted back in 2002. You can see the competition version of this model in action at iconic racetracks like the legendary&nbsp;Nürburgring.</p>

<p>Of course, the new update also brings the usual slew of extras with it, including a new Cafe menu, new World Circuits events, and more track compatibility for&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>AI Sophy, so you can test your skills against it.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7</em>, it's...well, it's actually the eighth main installment in the <i>Gran Turismo&nbsp;</i>series thanks to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-sport-delisted" rel="nofollow">now-delisted</a>&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo Sport</em>.</p>

<p>Like its predecessors, the game is a sim-style racer that emphasizes verisimilitude. It offers the chance to drive a ton of real-world cars, including the ones listed above, as well as plenty of others from iconic real-world brands.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pathologic-3-quarantine-prologue-gets-march-release-date-and-new-trailer.1119294/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pathologic-3-quarantine-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Ice-Pick Lodge and publisher HypeTrain Digital have revealed the release date for upcoming not-quite-a-demo&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3: Quarantine</em>, a free-to-play prologue that will introduce the world of the game.</p>

<p>Revealed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pathologic-3-quarantine-2025-prelude-demo" rel="nofollow">back in December</a>,&nbsp;<em>Quarantine&nbsp;</em>will be arriving for PC via Steam on March 17th, giving what the two studios call "a chilling glimpse into the dark and immersive world of&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3</em>".</p>

<p><em>Pathologic 3: Quarantine&nbsp;</em>will tell the story of how Daniil Dankovsky, also known as the Bachelor, came to leave his "acclaimed lab" and kick off the events of&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3</em>&nbsp;proper.&nbsp;<em>Quarantine&nbsp;</em>will also introduce the core gameplay mechanics that will make up the basis of&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pathologic-3-quarantine-release-date-bachelor.jpg?itok=rfWmWtlf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pathologic-3-quarantine-release-date-bachelor.jpg?itok=j8ck-Ldn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pathologic 3: Quarantine&nbsp;</em>is officially coming in March.</figcaption></figure><p>As Ice-Pick and HypeTrain tell it,&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3: Quarantine&nbsp;</em>will ask you to "examine patients, uncover strange secrets, and make first steps towards defeating Death". That's a pretty tall order for a prologue demo.</p>

<p>You'll be able to examine and diagnose patients with the mysterious Sand Plague, but you'll also be prying into their personal lives to see what kind of unsavory secrets they're hiding.</p>

<p>As you play, you'll also be building Dankovsky's mental map of the world around him; the two studios say the Bachelor is a "sharp mind in search of the truth", and it's that very truth you'll have to uncover throughout&nbsp;<em>Quarantine</em>.</p>

<p>You can check out the release date reveal trailer for <i>Pathologic 3: Quarantine&nbsp;</i>right here.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3</em>, it's the third game in the&nbsp;<em>Pathologic&nbsp;</em>series, although technically, it's actually sort of the first.</p>

<p>Announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pathologic-3-announced-2025" rel="nofollow">in October</a>,&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3&nbsp;</em>is actually an expanded and revised version of the long-awaited&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 2&nbsp;</em>Bachelor Route, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pathologic-2-bachelors-scenario-announced" rel="nofollow">intended as an expansion for the second game</a> but which appears to have taken on a life of its own, appropriately enough for&nbsp;<em>Pathologic</em>.</p>

<p>It gets more complicated, though, because&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 2&nbsp;</em>is sort of an expanded and reworked version of the original&nbsp;<em>Pathologic</em>. It's best to think of each game in the series as a reimagining of the first rather than a true sequel.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3&nbsp;</em>is due to arrive on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3199650/Pathologic_3/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> sometime this year. The free&nbsp;<em>Quarantine&nbsp;</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3389330/Pathologic_3_Quarantine/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">demo-slash-prologue</a> will be available on March 17th.</p>
