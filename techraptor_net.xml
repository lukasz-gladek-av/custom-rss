Foam storage either has the miniatures sitting between two layers or has shapes in the foam that the miniatures sit in. Magnetic has metal in a part of it, and after attaching magnets to your miniatures, they'll sit securely on the metal plate in the carry case.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.safeandsound.pl/" rel="nofollow">Safe and Sound</a> decided that if you're going to the trouble of selecting and carrying a case, it might as well be useful once you get to your gaming area. The&nbsp;<em>Infinity</em> Action Box, once it's done the job of transporting your miniatures securely, also doubles as a piece of scenery during the game. In this article, we'll look at the <em>Infinity</em> Action Box, and see how many <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/infinity-operation-sandtrap-review-launch-of-infinity-n5" rel="nofollow">Infinity</a></em> miniatures we can get in it, and we'll also look at some of the larger magnetic boxes Safe and Sound offers.</p>

<p>The Safe and Sound<i> Infinity </i>Action Box is a magnetic miniatures transportation box, that also doubles as a scenery piece for your games. It's officially sanctioned by Corvus Belli, the makers of <em>Infinity</em>, so you'll see lots of Infinity markings all over it. The box also comes with a removable internal element that acts as walls if you want to use the case an internal building, and also a card shipping container.</p>

<p>As you can see in the image above, we got nearly our entire <em>Infinity</em> JSA collection into a single <em>Infinity</em> Action Box. That was 65 miniatures, including 5 on large bases. The only ones we couldn't get in were 2 bikes, 2 remotes, and the old&nbsp;O-Yoroi Kidobutai T.A.G. (which doesn't fit in the box standing up and needs to be laid down). If we had the box with the magnetized back plate or lid, we could have easily put these in as there was loads of space above the standard units in the larger area.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/safe-and-sound-3.jpg?itok=gh0sZP3S 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/safe-and-sound-3.jpg?itok=WfdQfzCn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Once your miniatures are magnatised, the Safe and Sound <em>Infinity</em> Action Box keeps them secure during movement.</figcaption></figure><p>The <em>Infinity</em> Action Box also held the miniatures securely when sideways or upside down, the magnets holding well to the metal plate. To magnetize your miniatures, pick up some&nbsp;5x2mm magnets, which are pretty small and very cheap for packs of 100 or more. The standard <em>Infinity</em> bases (because Corvus Belli are awesome), actually have a round slot for the magnet to fit in, so once a small bit of super glue is on the base, it keeps the magnet from sliding around while it dries, giving you a solid connection. Some of the older larger, metal <em>Infinity</em> miniatures like the bikes and the O-Yoroi need 2 of the smaller magnets, but as the new larger <em>Infinity</em> miniatures are made from a lightweight resin, one 5x2mm is perfect to hold them in place.</p>

<p>When you think about a card box, it probably doesn't sound very durable over a plastic box, but the <em>Infinity</em> Action Box can take a knock and still keep your miniatures safe. More so because they're stuck to the base, so they're not moving around inside when it is moved or bashed. When closed, two card folds slide into slits, and a velcro fastener keeps it shut while traveling. The thickness of the sides also helps with durability, keeping the lid straight across the top, even with heavy miniatures placed on it (like you might when using it during games).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.safeandsound.pl/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Safe and Sound</a> makes a whole range of boxes, storage, and transport products for your wargaming needs. They even make foam inserts for the boxes and bags that you can stack multiple boxes in. You can see in the image above the size comparison of the <em>Infinity</em> Action Box, and the Sci-Fi Strike Force Box, which is two Action Boxes long, and a bit higher for the taller miniatures. Safe and Sound offers a range of sizes and styles of magnetized and standard boxes to suit your army transportation requirements. I generally play skirmish games, with smaller army sizes, like <em>Infinity</em>, <em>Bushido</em>, and <em>Kill Team</em>, and the Army Box is perfect for carrying my entire collection for that game's faction, to give me some list-building variety while I'm there.</p>

<h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On The Safe And Sound Infinity Action Box?</h2>

<p>The <em>Infinity</em> Action Box is a solid transportation option, that fits a lot of miniatures for its small size. The fact that it doubles as a scenery piece is a bonus and that you get another scenery piece and the internal walls is awesome. I would definitely invest in the Action Box with the metal lid, just for the extra capacity and to maximize the use of the space, and also because having your JSA ninjas hanging off the roof is very on-theme.</p>

<h2>Should I Buy The Safe And Sound Infinity Action Box?</h2>

<p>If you want a magnatised transport option, that also looks great during games of <em>Infinity</em>, then the <em>Infinity</em> Action Box is a great purchase. The box doesn't suit fantasy settings, but Safe and Sound do offer other box styles. It also fits a lot of miniatures for a skirmish game. If you only play with 10-15 miniatures, it might be too big, and if you roll out with 70+ miniatures and large vehicles, then the other size boxes might be a better option.</p>
