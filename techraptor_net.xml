            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Gamefound has acquired the crowdfunding platform, Indiegogo. This is a major change for Indiegogo, which was one of the earliest pioneers of crowdfunding platforms. This acquisition will lead to new features and improvements, as well as new conveniences for users.</p>

<h2>The Gamefound Indiegogo Acquisition</h2>

<p>In an official <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/blog/post/gamefound-acquires-indiegogo" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>, Gamefound discussed the changes that would be coming to both platforms as a result of the acquisition. First, much like Roll20 and Demiplane's acquisition, you will be able to log in to Gamefound using either your Indiegogo or Gamefound credentials. In addition, Indiegogo will be adopting Gamefound's business terms and policies, which are generally friendlier to the end user.</p>

Campaigns include both pre-launch and late pledges. The platform provides integrated tax tools, providing more transparent prices for various regional taxes and national tariffs. Lastly, users have access to stretch pay and direct currency exchange.</p>

<p>“It’s time for crowdfunding to be a forward-facing industry again,” said Julie dePontbriand, CEO of Indiegogo. “Gamefound’s technology is unrivaled, and we’re thrilled to bring it to Indiegogo’s diverse community. Together, we’re making crowdfunding more innovative, creator-friendly, and exciting than ever before.”</p>

<p>These changes aside, not much will change for either platform. Gamefound is still dedicated to providing a platform for tabletop crowdfunding projects. It has been their mission statement since it was founded in 2016, and that is still their focus. Their track record speaks for itself with successes like board game adaptations of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cyberpunk-2077-board-game-campaign-raises-over-1-million-in-one-day" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/helldivers-2-board-game-fully-funded-in-12-minutes-on-gamefound" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Helldivers 2</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/blasphemous-board-game-brings-penitence-to-gamefound" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Blasphemous</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hearts-of-iron-board-game-reaches-gamefound-success-in-13-minutes" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Hearts of Iron</em></a>.</p>

<p>As for Indiegogo, it will continue as a platform for various tech and arts projects. Projects as diverse as Steam Deck competitors or board game projects like the original <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/steamforged-games-announces-street-masters-champion-edition" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Street Masters</em></a> board game. The difference now is that the platform's userbase of about 38 million will be enjoying some quality-of-life improvements.</p>

  <div>
      <div><p>As Critical Role's San Diego Comic-Con panel continued, they debuted footage from the upcoming Season 4 of <em>The Legend of Vox Machina</em> alongside a release window, and the confirmation that the fifth season has been greenlit, but that it will also be the last.</p>

<p>In addition to this announcement, a short clip was played from the upcoming season highlighting Vox Machina's plan to rob the Cobalt Soul with the help of Taryon Darrington. This is the first time we've seen Taryon and his construct companion, Doty, in motion for <em>The Legend of Vox Machina</em>.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Executive Producers and Critical Role Co-Founders Sam Riegel and Travis Willingham had the following to say on the announcement of the final season of <em>The Legend of Vox Machina.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"It's so rare for any television series to get to tell a complete story, beginning to end, exactly as it was envisioned, we're so grateful to our fans, the critters, our partners at Prime Video, and the original Kickstarter backers for bringing this show to life, and turning the numbskulls of Vox Machina into animation legends."</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>What's next after <em>The Legend Of Vox Machina</em>?</h2>

<p>This wasn't the only piece of Critical Role animation news at the San Diego Comic-Con panel as a teaser animation and release date for the first season of <em>The Mighty Nein</em> was also announced.</p>

<p>Additionally, even though there is no specific announcement, fans of Critical Role are waiting with bated breath for any potential announcements of animated adaptations of their third campaign, Bells Hells, and any of the spin-off series like Calamity or Downfall.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today at San Diego Comic-Con, Critical Role and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1183ce14-1675-44b1-af00-4d7855d7f06c" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/chris-prynoski-talks-drunkards-druggies-and-delinquents-how-420-joke-became" rel="nofollow">Titmouse </a>announced the release date for the first season of <em>The Mighty Nein</em>. An animated TV show based on Critical Role's second streamed campaign focusing on the seven members of <em>The Mighty Nein</em>. The announcement of a <em>Mighty Nein</em> TV show came in early 2023 after reaching success with the first few season of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a49b5305-f71e-4b04-a989-6db6823aa8cc" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/critical-role-and-legend-of-vox-machina-s3-cast-discuss-changing-story" rel="nofollow"><em>The Legend of Vox Machina</em></a>, a similarly animated show based on the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3579fb91-ffa9-4c99-a750-de9f92ba642f" href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> group's first campaign.</p>

<p>The release date for <em>The Mighty Nein</em> on Prime Video will be November 19th. It will be releasing in more than 240 countries and territories worldwide. Alongside the release date announcement, a short sequence from the show was also released showing the majority of the player characters being interrogated. Here we get to see at a glance what each of the characters is about with Beau the monk showing off her guns, Nott the Goblin intoxicated and (poorly) flirting with her interrogator, and Jester being absolutely chaotic.</p>


<p>The description of the show provided reads as:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>The Mighty Nein</em> follows a group of fugitives and outcasts, bound by secrets and scars. But when a powerful arcane relic known as "The Beacon" falls into dangerous hands, they must learn to work together to save the realm and stop reality itself from unraveling.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In addition to the short clip fans were also treated to artwork of the full party of <em>The Mighty Nein</em> including our first look at Yasha, played by Ashley Johnson (The Last of Us Part II).</p>

<p>Interestingly, Mark Strong was credited in an episode of <em>The Legend of Vox Machina</em> for a single episode as an Assembly Mage, this will likely develop into a larger role as Trent Ikithon, a recurring foe for <em>The Mighty Nein.</em></p>
