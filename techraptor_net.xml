            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alan-wake-2-sales-control-2-action-rpg<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remedy has revealed that&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</em>sales have almost hit the two million mark since its release last year, and the studio has also unveiled some more info about an interesting new direction in which&nbsp;<em>Control 2&nbsp;</em>is headed.</p>

<p>Speaking to investors <a href="https://x.com/remedygames/status/1858851495493403094" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on its recent Capital Markets day</a>, Remedy revealed that&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alan-wake-2-has-been-slightly-delayed" rel="nofollow">released in October last year</a>, has reached "over" 1.8 million sales, although the company doesn't give an exact figure. By contrast,&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake: Remastered&nbsp;</em>apparently sold around 1.7 million copies.</p>

<p>Last we heard,&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</em>had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-q3-financials-alan-wake-2" rel="nofollow">almost recouped its development and marketing costs</a>. Presumably, this is still the case, as if the game had done so since that announcement, it's likely Remedy would have told its investors.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/alan-wake-2-sales-control-2-rpg-saga.jpg?itok=wvtB6L7N 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/alan-wake-2-sales-control-2-rpg-saga.jpg?itok=dSndfuWZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</em>has hit 1.8 million sales since its release last year, Remedy has revealed.</figcaption></figure><p>Given that&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</em>had sold 1.3 million copies <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alan-wake-2-sales" rel="nofollow">back in February</a>&nbsp;(apparently making it the fastest-selling Remedy game thus far), that means a further half a million copies have been sold since that point, which isn't too bad for a game that is, in the end, fairly niche.</p>

<p>Remedy also had some info to share about the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Control 2</em>&nbsp;on its Capital Markets day. The game, which will be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-annapurna-control-2-tv-movies" rel="nofollow">produced in conjunction with Annapurna</a>, will apparently be "an action RPG".</p>

<p>It's worth saying that the phrase "action RPG" is a fairly broad one; this could mean pretty much anything from a light leveling system all the way through to a full looter-shooter framework, so we'll have to wait and see exactly what Remedy means by that.</p>

<p>However, it does represent a shift in direction from the original&nbsp;<em>Control</em>, which is perhaps best described as an action-adventure game tinged with Metroidvania elements.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/control-2-action-rpg-original-control.jpg?itok=ssxjKL7A 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/control-2-action-rpg-original-control.jpg?itok=pTFbYKoa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Control 2&nbsp;</em>will head in a more RPG-ward direction than its predecessor.</figcaption></figure><p>What's more, a free update for the original&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em>is coming in early 2025, and it will unlock "some previously released content", although Remedy doesn't specify exactly what that content might be. Better watch out for that one, I suppose.</p>

<p>As a reminder, we still don't have a release date for&nbsp;<em>Control 2</em>, nor do we know exactly when the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fbc-firebreak-control-spinoff-announced" rel="nofollow">recently-announced multiplayer spinoff&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fbc-firebreak-control-spinoff-announced" rel="nofollow">FBC: Firebreak</a>&nbsp;</em>will be arriving.</p>

<p>Remedy did, however, reveal the kind of budget&nbsp;<em>Control 2</em>&nbsp;has, suggesting that as a triple-A action RPG, it has a budget somewhere in the realm of&nbsp;€50 million.&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>, meanwhile, as a "mid-price" multiplayer title, has a more modest&nbsp;€30m budget.</p>

<p>According to Remedy,&nbsp;<em>Control 2&nbsp;</em>would need to sell around three to four million copies across its lifetime to guarantee a 100% return on investment, while&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>would need to rack up about three million. Whether or not that's realistic, we'll have to wait and see.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Real-Life Minecraft Immersive Attractions Announced by Legoland Company]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/minecraft-attractions-merlin-entertainments</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/real-life-minecraft-immersive-attractions-announced-by-legoland-company.1039446/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/minecraft-attractions-merlin-entertainments<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Legoland parent company Merlin Entertainments has announced a series of real-life immersive&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>attractions, with the first set to debut in the UK and US sometime between 2026 and 2027.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://www.merlinentertainments.biz/newsroom/news-releases/2024/merlin-minecraft-in-real-life/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an official announcement</a> on the Merlin Entertainments website, the attractions will involve "<em>Minecraft</em>-themed guest accommodation, retail, and food &amp; beverage", as well as "a&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>-themed ride" at existing Merlin locations in both countries.</p>

<p>In the long term, Merlin says it intends to extend these experiences to other countries as well, but they'll just be in Merlin locations in the US and UK to start with.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/minecraft-attractions-merlin-entertainments-village.jpg?itok=1S9kkGKx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/minecraft-attractions-merlin-entertainments-village.jpg?itok=0xX1eR7J 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You could be visiting this&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>attraction (or something like this mockup, anyway) sometime in the future.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as the experiences themselves, Merlin says it'll be introducing "touchpoints" that you can use to augment your&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>experience and add "exclusive in-game content".</p>

<p>The rides and experiences will be costing Merlin somewhere in the region of $110 million to start with, and that number will obviously climb as more rides and&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>attractions are introduced around the world.</p>

<p>We're a long way away from the&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>theme park map that was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/minecraft-theme-park-map-released-as-part-of-10-year-anniversary-celebration" rel="nofollow">created as part of the game's 10th anniversary celebrations</a> back in 2019; these are proper, physical&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>experiences you'll be able to enjoy at actual brick-and-mortar Merlin locations.</p>

<p>Naturally, Merlin hasn't announced exactly what the attractions will be yet, nor when they'll actually be arriving. It's likely we'll be waiting a little while for that info, since the rollout is at least a year and a half or so away.</p>




<p>It's quite possible the&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>experiences will find their home in Merlin's Legoland; after all, you can't say that doesn't make a lot of sense.</p>

<p>However, Merlin also owns the likes of Alton Towers, Thorpe Park, and Chessington, all of which are very popular UK theme park destinations, so the rides could be appearing in those locations, too.</p>

<p>Given that Legoland has US locations in New York and California, though, my money's on there for the inaugural&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>attraction rollout. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sony Reportedly In Talks to Buy FromSoftware Parent Kadokawa]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-kadokawa-purchase-report</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-reportedly-in-talks-to-buy-fromsoftware-parent-kadokawa.1039380/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-kadokawa-purchase-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report claims that Sony is in talks to buy FromSoftware parent company and media giant Kadokawa, with a deal potentially just weeks away.</p>

<p>The report comes from <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/sony-talks-buy-media-powerhouse-behind-elden-ring-sources-say-2024-11-19/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Reuters</a>, which, in turn, cites the age-old "sources familiar with the matter". As ever, take that with as big a pinch of salt as you like.</p>

<p>According to Reuters' report, talks between Sony and Kadokawa are ongoing, and if the talks are successful, then "a deal could be signed in the coming weeks", so it may not be very long before Kadokawa - and, by extension, FromSoftware - officially belongs to Sony.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dark-souls-3-sony-kadokawa-talks.jpg?itok=fJI5fqBp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dark-souls-3-sony-kadokawa-talks.jpg?itok=FDtKn41p 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Kadokawa subsidiary FromSoftware is best known for the&nbsp;<em>Souls&nbsp;</em>series, as well as offshoots like&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>In light of the apparent talks, Kadokawa's shares rocketed up 23%, and Sony's closed 0.6% higher than before the report emerged. Naturally, both Sony and Kadokawa declined to comment when asked to do so by Reuters.</p>

<p>Sony already owns a stake in Kadokawa, having purchased shares <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tencent-and-sony-buy-over-30-shares-in-from-software" rel="nofollow">back in August 2022</a> (alongside Chinese gaming giant Tencent). It's possible Sony wants to make a move before Tencent does, but of course, that's pure speculation.</p>

<p>In gaming terms, Kadokawa is perhaps best known as the parent company of&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>developer FromSoftware, although that's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kadokawa-acquire-purchase" rel="nofollow">not the only studio it owns</a>, and as a media conglomerate, the company has its fingers in plenty of other pies as well.</p>

<p>If the report turns out to be true, then Sony's desire to acquire Kadokawa makes perfect sense; FromSoftware's most recent release&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-25-million" rel="nofollow">clocked 25 million sales</a> at last count, while DLC expansion&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>racked up <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-sales" rel="nofollow">five million sales in under a week</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-sony-kadokawa.jpg?itok=KsGJZSFX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-sony-kadokawa.jpg?itok=l3QH3BS8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>is just one of FromSoftware's many successes.</figcaption></figure><p>Sony could probably do with the kind of boost that purchasing Kadokawa would likely provide right now.</p>

<p>Recently, the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-shuts-down-two-studios-including-concord-creator" rel="nofollow">shut down two of its studios</a>, including&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>developer Firewalk, and earlier this year, the Sony Interactive department <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-layoffs" rel="nofollow">laid off almost a thousand employees</a> around the world.</p>

<p>Subsidiaries like Bungie also arguably <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-layoffs-200-employees" rel="nofollow">aren't in a good place</a> right now, so if Sony could snap up the parent company of not only FromSoftware but also the likes of Spike Chunsoft and&nbsp;<em>Octopath&nbsp;</em>developer Acquire, then things may well improve. We'll have to wait and see what happens next.</p>
