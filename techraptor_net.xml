            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has released a new&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 2042&nbsp;</em>update in preparation for the release of&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>later this year, and it's packed with stuff, including a new map, new weapons, and more.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1957412193198100646" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">social media post</a>, this latest&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 2042&nbsp;</em>update is intended to be one of the first steps on "the road to&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>", which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-6-revealed-release-date-october-maybe" rel="nofollow">due to launch in October</a>&nbsp;(and which, mercifully enough, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-6-no-80-pricing" rel="nofollow">won't cost you $80</a>).</p>

<p>The first big thing you're getting in this update is a new map in the form of Iwo Jima, which was, as EA says, "a fan favorite previously seen in&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 1942</em>,&nbsp;<em>1943</em>, and&nbsp;<em>V</em>".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-2042-update-iwo-jima.jpg?itok=9n-zLMWZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-2042-update-iwo-jima.jpg?itok=hU59xsQr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Battlefield 2042</em>'s latest update is bringing a brand new map, plus more.</figcaption></figure><p>The new version of the map is a "reimagined" space that EA says will "give you plenty of options to flex your tactical muscles", and it comes complete with an "active volcano" that you'll have to watch out for as well.</p>

<p>As well as Iwo Jima, you can also look forward to two new weapons in the form of the KFS2000 assault rifle and the Lynx sniper rifle.</p>

<p>The former is a "highly accurate" rifle that's also easy to control, and the latter is a "vicious semi-automatic anti-material rifle" that will be given to players who joined&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>'s open beta. If you didn't, however, you'll still get a chance to get this weapon "later down the line".</p>

<p>Two new vehicles are also being added: the A10 Warthog and the SU-25TM Frogfoot, both of which are attack jets that will be available in All-Out Warfare. They'll join a free battle pass that comes complete with 60 tiers of cosmetics to earn.</p>

<p><em>Battlefield 2042&nbsp;</em>is available now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1517290/Battlefield_2042/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/battlefield-2042/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/battlefield-2042-xbox-series-xs/9p0t51bddwvt" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>, meanwhile, is due for launch across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2807960/Battlefield_6/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/battlefield-6/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/battlefield-6-standard-edition/9pjxv87jtsvq" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on October 10th, and you can read our Erren's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/battlefield-6-multiplayer-preview-good-company" rel="nofollow">preview of it here</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-sales-500k</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-sales-top-500k-worldwide.1272555/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Marvelous has announced that&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma&nbsp;</em>has reached a major sales milestone across all platforms worldwide.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://prtimes.jp/main/html/rd/p/000002093.000016719.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a> (which is in Japanese, so we're using machine translation),&nbsp;<em>Guardians of Azuma&nbsp;</em>sales have managed to hit 500,000 around the world. As a reminder, the game was released on June 5th, having been delayed slightly from its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-release-date" rel="nofollow">originally-intended May 30th date</a>.</p>

<p><em>Guardians of Azuma</em>'s sales numbers aren't too shabby when considering that the game, which belongs to a reasonably niche genre in the first place, is only available on PC and Nintendo's Switch family of consoles; at time of writing, there's no PS5 or Xbox Series X|S version of the farming RPG.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-sales-500k-combat.jpg?itok=EMsZ5Mw3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-sales-500k-combat.jpg?itok=qhSovPbl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma&nbsp;</em>is doing alright for itself, sales-wise.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em>, it's the latest entry in Marvelous' long-running&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory&nbsp;</em>series, which combines the farming sim aspects of&nbsp;<em>Story of Seasons&nbsp;</em>with RPG-style exploration and combat.</p>

<p>While the game is the latest&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory&nbsp;</em>title, it's technically a spinoff, with&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory 6&nbsp;</em>still yet to be officially announced. For now, though, this is all the&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory&nbsp;</em>you're getting.</p>

<p>The game revolves around one of two protagonists, Kaguya and Subaru, between whom you can choose at the outset of your playthrough. They must restore balance to the titular land of Azuma by befriending its spirits and uncovering the mysteries of the Celestial Collapse.</p>

<p>This being a farming sim-RPG hybrid, you can expect all the usual activities in your journey; growing crops, befriending NPCs, and crafting, as well as battling monsters and exploring the world around you.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Pokemon TCG Pocket Mega Evolution Confirmed for Fall]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mega-evolution-fall</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mega-evolution-confirmed-for-fall.1272552/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has announced that&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>is getting Mega Evolutions this fall, and there are some pretty powerful mechanics attached to them as well.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/uk/pokemon-news/mega-evolved-pokemon-arrive-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket-this-fall" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>website, Mega-Evolved Pokemon will be arriving later this year, although we don't have a more specific release date. Presumably, we'll be seeing them in the game somewhere between September and December.</p>

<p>As well as new Pokemon cards, you can also expect new "Mega Evolution ex rules" to make their way into the digital card game, and you'll need to be careful with the way you use your Mega-Evolved Pokemon, because a slip-up could easily cost you a game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mega-evolution-fall-blaziken.jpg?itok=ADCmP6WI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mega-evolution-fall-blaziken.jpg?itok=JCgaErsD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Mega Evolution is coming to&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>this year.</figcaption></figure><p>A quick look at some of the Mega Evolution cards announced thus far reveals that if a Mega-Evolved Pokemon is knocked out, the opposing player earns themselves three points.</p>

<p>As a reminder, the first player to reach three points wins the match, so that means that knocking out an opponent's Mega Evolution ex card is essentially a guaranteed victory.</p>

<p>To compensate for that kind of power, though, the Mega-Evolved Pokemon in question will have higher HP totals than your average 'mon, and they'll have access to some pretty powerful attacks as well. It's very much a high-risk, high-reward strategy.</p>

<p>It's not clear yet whether Mega Evolution will arrive alongside a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-wisdom-of-sea-and-sky-expansion" rel="nofollow">major expansion</a>, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-eevee-grove" rel="nofollow">smaller booster set</a>, or just as its own update, but given that it's bringing specific new cards with it, I think the first option in that list is a safe bet.</p>




<p>News of Mega Evolution in&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>comes just a few weeks after accusations of plagiarism saw in-game art of Gen 2 legendaries Ho-Oh and Lugia <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-ho-oh-production-issue-plagiarism" rel="nofollow">removed from the game</a>, with placeholder art being added while permanent replacements were sought.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.pokemon.pokemontcgp&amp;hl=en_GB" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pok%C3%A9mon-tcg-pocket/id6479970832" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">iOS</a>. Mega Evolution arrives this fall.</p>
