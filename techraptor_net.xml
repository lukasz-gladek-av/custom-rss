            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Star Wars: Eclipse&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Detroit: Become Human&nbsp;</em>developer Quantic Dream has teased another project in the works, and according to studio head David Cage, it's a departure from what the company is known for.</p>

<p>That's according to a new blog post on Quantic Dream's official website, titled "Writing a New Chapter". In the post, Cage says his studio has "decided to take a new step" after "years as a single-project studio", and that new step is a "competitive multiplayer experience".</p>

<p>Cage acknowledges Quantic Dream's lack of experience in the area, but he says that together with the community's "support and feedback", he believes the studio can create "something truly unique".</p>

<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: Eclipse</em>, Cage provides a rather disappointingly brief update on that game's development. He says&nbsp;<em>Eclipse</em>'s development "continues", and that he and Quantic Dream are "eager to share more" at some point in the future.</p>

<p>Just as a quick reminder,&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: Eclipse&nbsp;</em>was first revealed during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-announcement-from-game-awards-2021" rel="nofollow">2021's Game Awards ceremony</a>, and since then, Quantic Dream has been rather quiet about the game, although reports from early 2022 suggested that the announcement had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-eclipse-failed-to-attract-new-talent-at-quantic-dream-report-says" rel="nofollow">failed to attract new talent</a> to the French developer.</p>

<p>Quantic Dream itself was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/quantic-dream-acquired-by-netease" rel="nofollow">subsequently acquired</a> by Chinese gaming giant NetEase, but the developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/quantic-dream-unaffected-netease-layoffs" rel="nofollow">remained "unaffected"</a> by the layoffs and cancellations that have recently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-studio-shockingly-closed-by-netease-laying-off-everyone" rel="nofollow">swept</a> many of that company's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rich-vogel-t-minus-zero-entertainment-netease-shut-down" rel="nofollow">subsidiaries</a>.</p>

Let's just hope it goes a little better for them than it did for a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-fbc-firebreak-launch-sales-financials" rel="nofollow">certain other studio</a> known for its narrative-heavy single-player titles.</p>
