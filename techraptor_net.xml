            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/free-mullet-madjack-update-features-ultrakill<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The high-octane, fast-and-loud shooter <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/mullet-madjack-review-nostalgia-fueled-frenzy" rel="nofollow"><em>Mullet MadJack</em></a> launched to <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/16689/mullet-madjack" rel="nofollow">wide acclaim</a> from critics, and with a new crossover update featuring <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/new-blood-interactive" rel="nofollow">New Blood Interactive's</a> <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/ultrakill" rel="nofollow">ULTRAKILL</a>,</em> there's even more to rave about.</p>

<p>The bulk of new content comes in the form of Boss Rush Mode. Fight against the clock and slay <em>Mullet MadJack</em>'s various bosses and compete with global rankings for the highest score. Make it to the final boss of the Mode and you'll be met with a surprise: a character from <em>ULTRAKILL.</em></p>


<p>V2 from <em>ULTRAKILL</em> makes an appearance and you'll have to fight head-to-head against this extremely lethal machine. Fans of <em>ULTRAKILL</em> will recognize this as a punishing boss encounter, and the crossover makes for an exciting addition to <em>Mullet MadJack</em>.</p>

<p><em>Mullet MadJack</em> is a roguelite first-person shooter featuring fast gameplay. Players have only a handful of seconds to make it to the next floor. Recover precious time by slaying robobillionaires and save the love of your life. With a story-based Campaign mode as well as an endless Survival mode, Boss Rush will make a fine addition to the critically-acclaimed title.</p>



<p><em>ULTRAKILL </em>is an equally fast-paced shooter, with a brutal difficulty curve and plenty of style. Take control of a killer robot called V1 and literally bathe in the blood of your enemies to regain health. It's currently in Early Access and, while the official launch of <em>ULTRAKILL</em> is still up in the air, it's received quite a bit of buzz from fans with over 100,000 Steam reviews.</p>

<p>Whether you're a fan of <em>Mullet MadJack </em>or <em>ULTRAKILL</em>, fans won't have to wait long for this crossover. The update -- featuring Boss Rush Mode and Punished V2 as its final encounter -- is available for download today on PC.</p>

<p>For now, this crossover is exclusive only to <em>Mullet MadJack</em>, but who knows? Maybe we'll see something in <em>ULTRAKILL</em> in the future.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fablecraft-npc-homebrew-features-arrives-this-week.1064874/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/fablecraft-npc-homebrew-features-arrives-next-week<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Official <em>Fablecraft</em> NPC homebrew support is coming. The developers of the digital TTRPG, Riftweaver, announced they would be rolling out more custom features for Game Masters earlier this year, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/developers-of-digital-ttrpg-fablecraft-announce-homebrew-tools" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">starting with music</a>. Starting this week, making custom NPCs will be added to their tools.</p>

<h2>The <em>Fablecraft</em> NPC Homebrew announcement</h2>

<p>The first phase of the <em>Fablecraft</em> NPC homebrew update was announced via <a href="https://x.com/FablecraftGame/status/1869417434958205409" rel="nofollow">social media post</a> on X (formerly Twitter) through the official <em>Fablecraft</em> account. The post was a one minute, forty-seven second video showing the feature in action.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fablecraft-custom-npc-menu-image.jpg?itok=46B0licP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fablecraft-custom-npc-menu-image.jpg?itok=o0FY1M-Y 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The video shows one of the features called NPC Copy &amp; Customize. As the name entails, it allows you to take a preexisting NPC statblock, replicate it, then add custom text and images.</p>

<p>The video demonstrates this by taking a Meadow Hound creature and making it appear as one of the developer's dogs, Skipper. Players can give the NPCs custom names, subtitles, background information, description, token size, whether they are friend or foe, and their preferred region.</p>

<p>Notably, the <em>Fablecraft</em> NPC homebrew feature allows you to import images into the game. The image in question is limited to 10 MB and a JPG or PNG at 1920x 1080 resolution is recommended. The image can be adjusted and cropped in-game once it is uploaded.</p>

<p>There is also a check box that must be hit stating the image adheres to <em>Fablecraft's</em> Terms of Service. Obviously this is in place to prevent bad actors from uploading offensive, inflammatory, or otherwise transgressive images into the game.</p>

<p>The feature is one more step towards <em>Fablecraft's</em> intended goal of making a digital RPG where players can enjoy the fantasy of a tabletop experience without in-depth knowledge of a certain RPG system. It's a fantasy so appealing the professional Game Master service <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/fablecraft-startplaying-partnership-announced-by-developers" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">StartPlaying</a> partnered with them.</p>
