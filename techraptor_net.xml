            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/aetherdrift-top-10-vehicles-and-mounts<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Aetherdrift </em>is almost here, and it’s time to zoom across the race course with the best vehicles and mounts you can find. Over 50 new rides are making their premiere Aetherdrift, and in this article I’ll be sharing my picks for the top 10 Vehicles and Mounts in <em>Aetherdrift</em>, from the vehicles of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/aetherdrift-brings-wacky-races-and-new-name-for-old-plane-to-magic-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Avishkar">Avishkar</a> to the dinosaurs of Muraganda. Due to their similarity in mechanics, we’ve grouped these sweet rides together to be sorted out, and then list them in classic top 10 form.</p>



<p>#10) <strong><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dft/158/district-mascot" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="District Mascot">District Mascot</a></strong></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/district-mascot-duo.jpg?itok=J0LozQT3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/district-mascot-duo.jpg?itok=PLbpaC9f 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Kicking off our list is the cutest entry, as well as the cheapest as a 1 mana doggo, who jumps onto the field with a +1/+1 counter. This adorable little corgi gets an additional +1/+1 counter whenever it attacks when saddled. So if you drop this on turn 1, and then another creature on turn 2, you can saddle the good dog, and grow it to attack, and it becomes a 2/2. Beyond that, you also have bonus flexibility here, as <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dft/158/district-mascot" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="District Mascot">District Mascot</a> can remove two +1/+1 counters to destroy artifacts. And who could refuse that face?</p>

<p>9) <strong><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dft/168/lumbering-worldwagon" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Lumbering Worldwagon">Lumbering Worldwagon</a></strong></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lumbering-worldwagon.jpg?itok=wZGSqZmb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lumbering-worldwagon.jpg?itok=agXAsoiG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>What happens when you strap a win condition onto a ramp spell at a reasonable rate? You make it onto this list, though to be fair the Worldwagon probably will need some help to close out the game. At 3 mana it does a <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dsc/193/rampant-growth" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Rampant Growth">Rampant Growth</a>, and whenever it attacks, it will do another one. After that early game ramp it can lurk in the background, until later on you can activate it’s Crew 4 ability, and send a creature with power equal to the number of lands you have running down at your opponent, while fetching another basic land.</p>

<p>8) <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dft/295/salvation-engine" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Salvation Engine"><strong>Salvation Engine</strong></a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/salvation-engine.jpg?itok=1Ur7J-jL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/salvation-engine.jpg?itok=6XtU1sbG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/2xm/34/tempered-steel" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Tempered Steel">Tempered Steel</a> got strapped onto an engine and given a giant crane running over players. While it’s unlikely to see much play in 60-card formats, it will become a common sight in white artifact creature heavy decks with a big pump for the creatures, and the capability of resurrecting any artifact to the battlefield.</p>

<p>7) <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dft/183/thunderous-velocipede" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Thunderous Velocipede"><strong>Thunderous Velocipede</strong></a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/thunderous-velocipede.jpg?itok=EaLwMHaT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/thunderous-velocipede.jpg?itok=paZg0x5q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Sometimes, everyone just wants to let their inner Timmy out, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dft/183/thunderous-velocipede" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Thunderous Velocipede">Thunderous Velocipede </a>heartily approves. This 3 mana vehicle can become a 5/5 trample with Crew 3, but while that is impressive, it’s less important than its other ability. In short, whenever you play a creature that costs 4 or less it gets one +1/+1 counter, while anything bigger than that gets a big 3 +1/+1 counters.</p>

<p>6) <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dft/298/valors-flagship" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Valor's Flagsip"><strong>Valor's Flagship</strong></a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/valors-flagship.jpg?itok=0P4h88UK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/valors-flagship.jpg?itok=rQR5FOnZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dft/298/valors-flagship" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Valor's Flagship">Valor’s Flagship </a>calls back for me to a card that was important in competitive magic when I began playing: <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mh3/263/decree-of-justice" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Decree of Justice">Decree of Justice</a>, which could be played as an expensive wincon or cycled for an army of creatures. It’s a strong capstone for Vehicle decks, and its ability to be highly adjustable makes it much more playable then it might seem. In Commander, it is going to be best buddies with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/neo/220/greasefang-okiba-boss" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Greasefang, Okiba Boss">Greasefang</a> who will love its ability to drop to the grave on its own, along with its 7/7 flying, first strike, lifelink body</p>

<p>5) <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dft/113/boommobile" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Boommobile"><strong>Boommobile</strong></a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/boommobile.jpg?itok=zY7CtoNW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/boommobile.jpg?itok=S97smFCi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Kaboom, this vehicle is going to be a limited bomb, but it should see some constructed play either casually or competitively. A solid size to cost, it also refunds itself on playing, which invites it to be abused in combo decks that might reduce its cost or bounce it back and forth. On the fair side of things (well outside of limited), it can also do a single <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/j22/499/blaze" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Blaze">Blaze</a> type effect with X damage to anything, possibly burning out an opponent or one of their creatures. As a small bonus on top of that, it also gets a +1/+1 counter for doing it.</p>

<p>4) <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dft/313/gastal-thrillroller" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Gastal Thrillroller"><strong>Gastal Thrillroller</strong></a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gastal-thrillroller.jpg?itok=IetfQDTI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gastal-thrillroller.jpg?itok=BZGcXlbx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>We continue with another red entry, but this one is going to be likely seeing more constructed play, as a a take on your 3 mana hasty red threat (a tradition that dates back to <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fdn/618/ball-lightning" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Ball Lightning">Ball Lightning</a>). <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dft/313/gastal-thrillroller" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Gastal Thrillroller">Gastal Thrillroller</a> is an impressive fast attacker, it comes in as a 4/2 trample haste vehicle, during its first turn it doesn’t even need to be crewed. Then, later in the game, you can pay 3 mana, and discard a land or something to resurrect it with a finality counter to run right over your opponent.</p>

<p>3) <strong><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dft/28/skyseers-chariot" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Skyseer's Chariot">Skyseer's Chariot</a></strong></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skyseers-chariot.jpg?itok=Yn3UJdaD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skyseers-chariot.jpg?itok=byku62GX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>A vehicular take on a hatebear (even if it's not a 2/2), as a 2 mana creature that interferes with the opponent. Making activated abilities from a particular card cost 2 more can really disrupt a game plan. It’s more likely to be playable in low to mid power casual, but it could make an appearance in the right Standard metagame.</p>

<p>2) <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dft/7/bulwark-ox" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Bulwark Ox"><strong>Bulwark Ox</strong></a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bulwark-ox.jpg?itok=Bpf-ZSvB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bulwark-ox.jpg?itok=g57XoIm3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Everyone loves protection, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dft/7/bulwark-ox" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Bulwark Ox">Bulwark Ox </a>provides plenty of it. This Ox is more than just a <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/10e/268/grizzly-bears" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Grizzly Bears">Bear </a>(a 2/2 for 2), as when saddled and attacking he gets to hand out a +1/+1 counter to a creature. This grows something, while also marking it under Ox Insurance Services. Those with counters are protected when he sacrifices to give them indestructible and hexproof for a turn. A solid protection piece for white weenie type decks to boost wrath resistance, and it fits right into counters matter decks.</p>

<p>1) <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dft/83/demonic-junker" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Demonic Junker"><strong>Demonic Junker</strong></a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/demonic-junker.jpg?itok=-ebJ5WAG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/demonic-junker.jpg?itok=k1e8jVWR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>My top pick is this black vehicle that promises to be a constant sight in black aligned artifact decks at multiplayer tables for the foreseeable future. Coming down as cheaply as one mana due to Affinity, it can destry a creature from each player, and if you picked one of your own, it gets bigger. Already a 4/3 with Crew 2, it has decent enough size, but as a 6/5 that triggers all your Aristocrats effects it gets crazy. It is essentially a black version of <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dmu/24/leyline-binding" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Leyline Bundle">Leyline Binding</a> + <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/cmm/823/grasp-of-fate" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Grasp of Fate">Grasp of Fate</a>, trading flexibility of permanent type for the ability to turn into a truck and run you over.</p>
