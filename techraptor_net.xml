            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Amazon has revealed who's going to be taking the role of Lara Croft in its upcoming live-action&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>series, as well as when the show is expected to begin production.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/tomb-raider-live-action-series-filming-2026-sophie-turner-1236506192/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Variety</a>,&nbsp;<em>Game of Thrones&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>X-Men: Dark Phoenix&nbsp;</em>star Sophie Turner will be playing Lara in the show, which is set to start production on January 19th next year. It's not yet known whether the series will adapt an existing game or tell a new, original story.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>live-action series was first announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tomb-raider-live-action-series" rel="nofollow">back in May last year</a>.&nbsp;<em>Fleabag&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>James Bond&nbsp;</em>writer and star Phoebe Waller-Bridge is attached to the project as one of its showrunners and executive producers, alongside Chad Hodge, whose credits include the likes of Fox's&nbsp;<em>Wayward Pines&nbsp;</em>and TNT's&nbsp;<em>Good Behavior</em>.</p>

<p>The live-action&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>series also isn't the only Lara Croft-starring show currently on the scene; it joins Netflix's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-releases-first-look-at-tomb-raider-and-devil-may-cry-animated-series" rel="nofollow">animated series&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft</em></a>, which is set in the same timeline as Crystal Dynamics' rebooted games.</p>

<p>As for the games, the latest release in the franchise is&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered</em>, which, as the name suggests, collects <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tomb-raider-4-6-remastered-announced" rel="nofollow">remastered versions of the final three games</a> in the original Core Design series of&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>titles.</p>

<p>Another&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>game is also apparently in the works, and according to developer Crystal Dynamics, the project <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crystal-dynamics-layoffs" rel="nofollow">wasn't affected by a recent round of layoffs</a> that hit the studio following the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">cancellation of The Initiative's&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</em>reboot</a>, on which Crystal Dynamics was serving as a co-development outfit.</p>




<p>Amazon's&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>series will begin production in January, but we don't have an air date for it yet. Stay tuned for more on this one and on all things&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider</em>-related.</p>
