<p>Per a <a href="https://x.com/Respawn/status/1917267367144423543" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Respawn announces its decisions to "step away" from the aforementioned projects and to "make some targeted team adjustments" to teams working on&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Jedi&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends</em>. The projects in question aren't named, though.</p>

<p>The studio says it's "offering meaningful support to those impacted, including exploring new opportunities within EA", and that the decisions to cancel the projects and lay off the staff members in question "[weren't] easy".</p>

<p>The <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-zero-company-respawn-bit-reactor" rel="nofollow">recently-revealed&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Zero Company</em></a>, a turn-based tactics game set in the dying days of the Clone Wars, also won't be affected; it's not an early-stage incubation project, after all, but one that's been fully unveiled.</p>

<p>Rumors are swirling that&nbsp;a third&nbsp;<em>Titanfall&nbsp;</em>game is in development, but those rumors are fairly insubstantial at the moment, so it's impossible to say whether that was one of the games Respawn decided to can.</p>

<p>We do, however, know that this isn't the first time in the last year or so that Respawn has been hit by layoffs. In March last year, it was revealed that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/electronic-arts-to-lay-off-5-of-its-workforce-amid-refocus-on-owned-ip-and-sports-games" rel="nofollow">EA would lay off 5% of its workforce</a>, and that a&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>FPS in development at Respawn would be canceled, with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/apex-legends-developer-respawn-hit-by-layoffs-among-cuts-at-electronic-arts" rel="nofollow">layoffs also hitting the studio</a>.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see how these layoffs and project cancellations affect Respawn. Stay tuned for more on this as soon as we get it.</p>
