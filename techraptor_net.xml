            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/knightling-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Saber Interactive and developer Twirlbound have announced the release date for 3D action-adventure platformer&nbsp;<em>The Knightling</em>, and it's gracing PC and current-gen consoles (as well as the Switch) this summer.</p>

<p><em>The Knightling&nbsp;</em>was originally unveiled <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/knightling-saber-interactive-2025" rel="nofollow">back in August last year</a>, which feels pretty appropriate given that the game's official release date is August 28th.</p>

<p>In&nbsp;<em>The Knightling</em>, you'll play as the titular hero as he attempts to follow in the footsteps of his missing mentor Sir Lionstone, the legendary guardian of the land of Clesseia. The Knightling must discover what's happened to Sir Lionstone and save him from whoever has taken him prisoner.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-knightling-release-date-water.jpg?itok=8XfO8I0a 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-knightling-release-date-water.jpg?itok=oXXWq50C 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Knightling&nbsp;</em>launches in August for PC and current-gen consoles.</figcaption></figure><p>Saber Interactive and Twirlbound promise the chance to explore the lands of Clesseia, where you'll find plenty of miscreants waiting for a shield bash to the head. To that end, you'll also be unlocking "the extraordinary powers of Sir Lionstone's mighty shield".</p>

<p>You will, of course, be playing as Sir Lionstone's apprentice, but I'm betting that by the time this one is over, you'll have discovered that even young knightlings can exhibit great courage. That's just a guess, mind.</p>

<p><em>The Knightling</em>'s combat will give you the chance not only to press the attack against your enemies, but also to block and parry attacks in order to create your own openings, finishing the fight with "huge attacks and combos".</p>

<p>The shield isn't just a combat weapon, though; you'll also be using it to solve various puzzles, platform your way across the world, and unlock secrets in order to earn new upgrades.</p>




<p>If you'd like to check out&nbsp;<em>The Knightling&nbsp;</em>before you commit to picking it up in August, then there's a free demo for you to try out right now on Steam. Hey, what have you got to lose, eh?</p>

<p><em>The Knightling&nbsp;</em>comes to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1471650/The_Knightling/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10004254/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/the-knightling/9nd5r4j0g5lv" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and Nintendo Switch on August 28th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/united-videogame-workers-union-formed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Communications Workers of America and the American Federation of Musicians have announced the United Videogame Workers Union, the first North American industry-wide union that any employee working within the field can join.</p>

<p>Per a press release on the new UVW <a href="https://uvw-cwa.org/news/20250319-press-release" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, the union will demand "dignity and job security for all video game workers", with the union pointing to the devastating slew of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-studio-visual-arts-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">layoffs</a> that's been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/oxenfree-night-school-layoffs" rel="nofollow">assailing the industry</a> in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-june-14th" rel="nofollow">last couple of years</a>.</p>

<p>The union's mission statement is to "take back our lives, our labor, and our passion from those who treat us like replaceable cogs", and to work to create a gaming industry that "nourishes its talent and invests in its future, rather than constantly seeking short-term profits".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/iwgb-united-videogame-workers-union.jpg?itok=k7JXVRjg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/iwgb-united-videogame-workers-union.jpg?itok=d1tc51UB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The UVW union joins the likes of the UK's IWGB.</figcaption></figure><p>Anyone working in the gaming industry in the US and Canada can join the UVW union, and the organization's mission statement says its structure allows you to do so "without the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ustwo-games-accused-of-union-busting-over-austin-kelmore-dismissal" rel="nofollow">obstacles and delays</a> that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/raven-software-activision-microsoft-labor-complaint" rel="nofollow">employers can impose</a> during the traditional <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activision-blizzard-fights-to-delay-union-vote-tabulation" rel="nofollow">union certification process</a>".</p>

<p>In addition to US and Canada employees, the UVW union will also encompass "video game contractors, freelancers, indie developers, workers who are currently unemployed, and workers who are already organizing their workplaces", so even if you already have a workplace union, you can join up.</p>

<p>CWA senior director of organizing Tom Smith says the new union is a "cumulative effort" by workers to "redefine what it means to stand together and reclaim power", while CWA president Claude Cummings Jr. describes the union as an "exciting next step" in the journey to "help video game workers build power in their industry".</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Palworld Crossplay Update Released, Full Patch Notes Revealed]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-crossplay-update-patch-notes</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/palworld-crossplay-update-released-full-patch-notes-revealed.1138923/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-crossplay-update-patch-notes<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Pocketpair has released the&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>crossplay update, and as you can probably imagine, it adds crossplay to the creature-collecting survival game, as well as more Pal storage and lots of other goodies.</p>

<p>The developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-crossplay-update-late-march" rel="nofollow">announced last week</a> that the update would be coming sometime in late March, and while it's up for debate whether the 19th constitutes "late March", the update is here, and there's plenty to enjoy.</p>

<p>As you've probably already surmised, the main attraction in this update is crossplay; you can now enjoy&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>alongside your friends on other platforms, and every platform is supported, so PC players can play with PlayStation and Xbox gamers, who can also enjoy the game with one another.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-crossplay-update-pal-and-player.jpg?itok=y205TYic 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-crossplay-update-pal-and-player.jpg?itok=1CZFIF73 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Palworld</em>'s crossplay update has arrived, and it's letting you play with your friends on different platforms at last.</figcaption></figure><p>Despite the update's name, however, crossplay isn't all it's bringing. You can now transfer Pals between worlds using the new Global Palbox feature, and you'll also find that there's a new Pal storage system with "10 times the capacity of a regular Palbox".</p>

<p>A new cosmetic armor system has also been added, so you can switch up your look without worrying about whether your stats will be affected. You can also take advantage of the new Photo Mode if you want a snap of yourself wearing your new snazzy threads.</p>

<p>Other new features include a new drafting table that lets you combine multiple lower-rarity blueprints for a higher one, as well as lots of balance adjustments and bug fixes. It's worth reading the full patch notes if you want to know everything, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1623730/view/571499455390418195" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">you can do so here</a>.</p>




<p><em>Palworld</em>'s latest update comes as developer Pocketpair continues to fight a legal battle against Nintendo, with the Japanese gaming giant <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-palworld-pocketpair-lawsuit" rel="nofollow">suing the indie developer</a> over several <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-lawsuit-patents-demands-nintendo" rel="nofollow">allegedly infringed patents</a>.</p>

<p>The lawsuit did not, however, stop Pocketpair from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-pocketpair-monster-hunter-wilds-day-off" rel="nofollow">granting its employees the day off</a> last month to mark the release of&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, which the studio jokingly suggested its employees would simply call in sick to play anyway.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>and its latest update right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/palworld/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/palworld-game-preview/9NKV34XDW014" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>. A mobile version of the game is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-mobile-version-krafton" rel="nofollow">also in development</a>.</p>
