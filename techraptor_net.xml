            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pacific-drive-sales-1m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Ironwood Games and publisher Kepler Interactive have announced that their survival drive-'em-up&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>has managed to hit a brand new sales milestone.</p>

<p>Per a press release, the game has officially passed the one million sales mark. That means it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pacific-drive-sales-update" rel="nofollow">picked up another 400,000 sales</a> for itself since July last year, which definitely isn't too shabby for an indie studio like Ironwood.</p>

<p>As Ironwood itself says in the aforementioned press release, the studio has "less than 20 staff", and&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>is its first game, which I think makes the game passing the million mark even more impressive.</p>

The game has already <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pacific-drive-update-customization" rel="nofollow">received</a> three major updates since release, and the developer is teasing that the "fourth and most substantial update" will launch soon.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Ironwood doesn't provide a specific release window for that update, so we could be waiting quite a while for it. Still, given that this isn't a live service game, it's nice to see the studio supporting it with any kind of post-launch plan.</p>

<p><em>Pacific Drive</em>'s success means it's also caught the eye of Hollywood filmmaker James Wan, best known for the likes of&nbsp;<em>Insidious&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Saw</em>. His <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pacific-drive-tv-series-rights-james-wan" rel="nofollow">production company acquired the rights</a> to a&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>TV show back in December.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive</em>, it's an indie survival game in which you must drive your car across the Olympic Exclusion Zone, foraging for resources and dodging anomalies as you go. If you can imagine&nbsp;<em>Stalker&nbsp;</em>meets&nbsp;<em>Driver</em>, you're not far off.</p>




<p>The game is as much about repairing your car and making sure it runs alright as it is dodging the horrors of the Zone, so if you're in the market for a game that mixes vehicle maintenance with desperate struggles for your life, this is the one for you.</p>

<p><em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1458140/Pacific_Drive/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/pacific-drive/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>.
