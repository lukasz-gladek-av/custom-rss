            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-mans-sky-beacon-update-switch-2-edition<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hello Games has released a brand new update for&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>by the name of Beacon, and what's more, the studio has also announced that the game is getting a Switch 2 Edition upgrade on Nintendo's new console.</p>

<p>Beacon follows on from major&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>updates like March's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-mans-sky-relics-update" rel="nofollow">Relics</a> and January's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-mans-sky-worlds-part-2-update" rel="nofollow">Worlds Part 2</a>, and it's on a pretty similar scale to those updates, adding some pretty major features to the game.</p>

<p>First up, the settlement system has been overhauled; you can now become the overseer of "multiple planetary settlements", according to Hello Games, and the systems for things like base management, upgrades, and decision-making have also been improved.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/no-mans-sky-beacon-update-switch-2-running.jpg?itok=agxaBPVQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/no-mans-sky-beacon-update-switch-2-running.jpg?itok=zH0jmtKJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>No Man's Sky</em>'s new Beacon update is bringing a major overhaul to settlements.</figcaption></figure><p>You can now also view your settlements' history and achievements thanks to "improved record-keeping", which will also show you the happiness of the citizens who live in your settlements, as well as other stats.</p>

<p>Not only that, but disputes between those citizens have also been overhauled, with more resolutions now available to you when citizens have a disagreement in your settlements. If you want to see why those disagreements got started, you can check the new settler personality info page.</p>

<p>There are tons of other changes to&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky</em>'s settlement system as part of the Beacon update, and plenty of other features have been added as well. Make sure to check out the <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/beacon-update/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">full patch notes via the game's official website</a> for more info.</p>

<p>As well as the Beacon update, Hello Games has also revealed that a Switch 2 Edition upgrade is coming for&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky</em>, and it adds some features that are missing in the original Switch version.</p>




<p>First and foremost, multiplayer will be available in the Switch 2 version, as will settlements. Both features are missing from the Switch version of the game.</p>

<p>Of course, the Switch 2 Edition version of&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>will also boast better visuals and performance, as well as touch controls, gyro aiming, and cross-save support. What's more, the Switch 2 upgrade will be entirely free.</p>

<p><em>No Man's Sky</em>'s Beacon update is available for the game right now. You can check out&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/275850/No_Mans_Sky/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/no-mans-sky/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/no-mans-sky/BQVQTL3PCH05" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/no-mans-sky-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>, with the Switch 2 version on the way tomorrow.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-movie-blumhouse</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/phasmophobia-movie-adaptation-in-the-works-at-blumhouse.1206552/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-movie-blumhouse<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Horror film studio Blumhouse and&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>developer Kinetic Games have announced that the spooky multiplayer horror game is getting its very own movie adaptation.</p>

<p>Per a press release, the movie will be a co-production between Blumhouse and James Wan's production company Atomic Monster, whose works include&nbsp;<em>The Conjuring</em>&nbsp;and its associated spinoffs, as well as&nbsp;<em>M3GAN&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Malignant</em>. Of course, Kinetic Games is also involved in the production.</p>

<p><em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>lead developer Daniel Knight says the movie is "a big moment for the whole Kinetic team, and the start of something really exciting", promising to share more "as the project develops" (although stopping short of a timeline for said info).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/phasmophobia-movie-blumhouse-room.jpg?itok=QfOmcXQC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/phasmophobia-movie-blumhouse-room.jpg?itok=tjz7g5CK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Blumhouse is producing a&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>movie.</figcaption></figure><p>We don't yet have a release window for the movie, nor do we know who any of the creative personnel involved with it will be. We'll likely have to wait quite a while before we learn things like the director, the writers, and the stars of the&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>movie, unfortunately.</p>

<p>What we do know, however, is that this is just one of several video game movies that have been greenlit recently, and it's not even the only one in the horror space, either.</p>

<p>Back in April, it was revealed that a movie based on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortuary-assistant-movie-announced" rel="nofollow">horror work sim&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortuary-assistant-movie-announced" rel="nofollow">The Mortuary Assistant</a>&nbsp;</em>is in development, and, of course, Sony recently released a movie based on its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/until-dawn-movie-first-look" rel="nofollow">interactive narrative adventure&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn</em></a>.</p>

<p>Outside of the horror world, movies based on the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-movie-sydney-sweeney" rel="nofollow">EA's co-op platformer&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em></a>, Ubisoft's extreme sports sim&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/riders-republic-movie-report" rel="nofollow"><em>Riders Republic</em></a>, and FromSoftware's mega-hit&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>have all also been confirmed to be on the way.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-movie-phasmophobia.jpg?itok=rCJ-fsHE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-movie-phasmophobia.jpg?itok=E8Tcgb0W 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's not just&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>getting the movie treatment.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're wondering why so many games are getting movie adaptations, look no further than the box office numbers drummed up by existing adaptations.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog&nbsp;</em>movies <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-the-hedgehog-movies-1b-box-office" rel="nofollow">cumulatively crossed the $1 billion mark</a> in January, and the&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>movie, despite critical skepticism (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-minecraft-movie-trailer" rel="nofollow">not least from me</a>), made almost $1 billion by itself, second only to the&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Bros.&nbsp;</em>movie in terms of video game adaptation box office figures.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak Sales Top 10m]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak-sales-10m</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak-sales-top-10m.1206540/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak-sales-10m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has revealed that&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Rise&nbsp;</em>expansion&nbsp;<em>Sunbreak&nbsp;</em>has topped a major sales milestone, and no, you're not reading that wrong; I do mean <i>Monster Hunter Rise&nbsp;</i>and not&nbsp;<em>Wilds</em>.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1930202980927623265" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>X account,&nbsp;<em>Sunbreak&nbsp;</em>director Yoshitake Suzuki says the expansion has "finally surpassed" the 10 million sales mark, which means that it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-rise-13-million-sales" rel="nofollow">picked up another four million sales or so</a> for itself in the last two years.</p>

<p>As a reminder, at <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/business/million.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">last count</a>, the base&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Rise&nbsp;</em>game itself stood at around 17.1 million sales. It's pipped to the post by&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter World</em>, which, at 21.5 million units sold, is still the best-selling game in the series (and Capcom's best-selling title overall).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak-sales-10m-celebration.jpg?itok=xVd1ZQAz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak-sales-10m-celebration.jpg?itok=UoNxLWMf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak&nbsp;</em>is still picking up sales for itself.</figcaption></figure><p>Neither of these games is the latest in the series, however; that honor goes to&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, which launched across PC and current-gen consoles <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-release-date" rel="nofollow">back in late February</a>.</p>

<p>On release, the game quickly broke Capcom records, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-8m" rel="nofollow">amassing eight million sales</a> within a three-day period. In late March,&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-10m" rel="nofollow">broke ten million sales</a>, and that's where it still stood at last count, although I wouldn't be surprised if it's picked up a lot more sales for itself since then.</p>

<p>Continuing sales for&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak&nbsp;</em>suggest that it's not just&nbsp;<em>Wilds&nbsp;</em>that's doing very well for Capcom, but the series as a whole. It is, after all, one of Capcom's biggest moneyspinners, alongside <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-sales-10m-village-11m" rel="nofollow">the <em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>series</a>.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak</em>, it's the sole major expansion for&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Rise</em>, introducing new areas, new monsters, and more to the game.</p>




<p>The expansion was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak-release-date-announced" rel="nofollow">released back in mid-2022</a>, a few months after the PC release of the base game and a few months before it would land on consoles other than the Nintendo Switch.</p>
