            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Netflix has just greenlit an official <em>Clue</em> TV show. The major streaming platform's latest show will be an unscripted competitive experience where players will need to solve a murder mystery straight from the iconic social deduction board game.</p>

<h2>The Clue TV Show Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official report <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/10/clue-competition-series-netflix-1236571635/" rel="nofollow">by Deadline</a>, the <em>Clue</em> TV show will feature a competitive game show experience. Contestants will face physical and mental challenges to collect clues. Those clues will aid them in a real-life game of social deduction. Contestants will need to outwit their opponents and identify who killed whom, where, and with what.</p>

If they guess incorrectly, they are eliminated. The report does confirm that the usual suspects from the Clue board game, Colonel Mustard, Professor Plum, Mrs. White, and Miss Scarlett, will be present for these sections. The show will be produced by&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Like so many families and friends over the years, we’ve gathered around the table trying to figure out who did it—making Clue a source of nostalgia that everyone shares,” said Jeff Gaspin, VP of Unscripted Series, Netflix. “Thanks to the incredible vision of our partners at Hasbro Entertainment, IPC, and B17, we’re delivering a fresh, imaginative whodunit competition that will invite today’s audiences into that iconic world.”</p>

<p>The Netflix <em>Clue</em> TV show is a notable departure from the board game's roots. It was originally a broad tabletop experience imitating posh Agatha Christie murder mysteries.</p>

There was the 1985 feature film directed by Jonathan Lynn starring major stars like Tim Curry and Christopher Lloyd. The film was a dark murder mystery satire,, complete with outrageous murder methods, convoluted character motivations, and farcical slapstick. It even had three different endings, meant to invoke the replayability of the <em>Clue</em> board game.</p>

<p>The <em>Clue</em> TV show is in keeping with company Hasbro's recent stint of adapting their various properties to film and tv. Those projects include another game show based on Monopoly and a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-movie-screenwriters-have-been-summoned" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">feature film</a> based on the iconic card game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a>.</p>
