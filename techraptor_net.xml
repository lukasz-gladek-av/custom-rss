            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/echo-generation-review" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4ae52c58-bf27-4725-a955-cfd07a88e454" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Echo Generation</em></a> was a game that immediately captured me when I first played its demo in 2020, and I was even more excited to see that a sequel was on the way. <em>Echo Generation 2</em> is an RPG where kids go on an adventure, discover the supernatural, and have a fun time along the way. I got my hands on the <em>Echo Generation 2</em> demo that shows a shift from traditional RPG combat to deckbuilding, and a story that hits the ground running with intrigue and larger stakes than before.</p><p dir="ltr">In the <em>Echo Generation 2</em> demo, you start as 'Sister M', a girl raised in a secret facility, having her psychic powers tested by scientists. While she's normally ok to go with the flow, the disappearance of her friends that she was raised with causes her to want to confront the director of the program.</p><p dir="ltr">This demo was only a few hours long, so not too much of the story was explored. You could travel around the various locations in the facility, interact with a lot of the world and other scientists to learn what life has been like, and it ended with a tease of something much larger going on behind the scenes that has been interesting to dive into when the full game releases.</p><picture>

  </picture><p dir="ltr">It already feels like the adventure and the stakes of the journey will be far larger. While I'm excited to be able to set out on a new big adventure, I do think I'll miss the small town 'kids on bikes' vibes of the original game.</p><p dir="ltr">World exploration is quite standard, with plenty of humans and objects to interact with. The player is rewarded by fully exploring areas, allowing them to find various items and prompts for side-quests with beneficial rewards. The biggest change to the <em>Echo Generation</em> formula is in the combat.</p><h2>Build Decks And Unleash Combos In <em>Echo Generation 2</em></h2><p dir="ltr">Combat in <em>Echo Generation 2</em> is a turn-based deckbuilding experience. As Sister M, you can build up a deck of ten cards with different damage and healing effects, target parameters, status, and more. One card might deal 30 damage to every enemy and inflict a burn status and be usable three times in a single combat, while another can allow you to heal slightly better and get a regen effect for two turns and can be used twice per combat.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/echo-generation-2-combat-1.jpg?itok=k38ADqzm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/echo-generation-2-combat-1.jpg?itok=gYG2OPcR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p dir="ltr">It's clear very early on that inflicting status effects is going to be extremely important as you progress through the game. Sister M's base ability lets her inflict two random statuses, and from fighting soldiers around the facility, you get a large number of cards that will inflict Burn, and then cards that will consume Burn for additional damage.</p><p dir="ltr">From the upgrade tree action economy will also play a major role as leveling up lets you play more cards through a turn, you'll go through your deck faster but have more chances to deal fast and powerful combos against your enemies.</p><p dir="ltr">The boss of the demo was one that I took a few tries to beat just to make sure I was able to find the right speed of dealing damage, building up combos, and also routinely setting up shields or healing myself. Thankfully, with any defeat, the game will put you right back to before you initiated that combat, so you can go right back into the fight or spend some time reworking your cards.</p><picture>

  </picture><p dir="ltr">At this level, I was already having fun toying with combos, so as more cards and more playable characters are added to the party, I'm excited for the future.</p><p dir="ltr">One aspect of the battles that does seem a bit underbaked is the reactions to enemy attacks. When an enemy is attacking, an icon will briefly appear that you need to press the interact button with before it disappears. At the end of my turn, I could start mashing the A button and clear the icon just as quickly as it appeared, allowing myself to always successfully block. I wonder if there will be enemies that will have icons that you want to not interact with, but for now, it seems a bit trivial.</p><p dir="ltr">Cococucumber continues to craft some of the prettiest games out there, with their high-quality voxel designs creating blocky characters and worlds, but ones that are filled with personality and detail. I sat back and watched blocky electricity pulse out of a mech after defeating it in awe.</p><p dir="ltr">For the few moments where there are things that aren't brick-based, it also really conveys the idea of "this is something strange in this world."</p><p dir="ltr">Knowing it would be carrying on the legacy of <em>Echo Generation</em> I was already excited for this sequel, and after sinking a few hours into the game, it's just not releasing soon enough.</p><hr><p><em><strong>TechRaptor </strong>previewed Echo Generation 2 on PC via Steam with a code provided by the publisher.

            <guid>1432312</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Code Violet</em>, the dino horror game that probably wanted to hoover up players still disappointed in the lack of a <em>Dino Crisis </em>remake or sequel, is getting a followup, and it's got a very good name, if nothing else.</p><p>As revealed by developer <a href="https://x.com/TeamKillMedia/status/2021293486377431222" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TeamKill Media on X</a>, the sequel, which is currently in development, will be called <em>Code UltraViolet</em>. It's hard to argue with sequel naming like that, although I'm sure TeamKill will be hoping this one garners a better reception.</p><p>For context, <em>Code Violet </em>is an action-horror game that sees protagonist Violet battling through swarms of hostile dinosaurs in a bid to uncover the secrets of Aion, a colony that "harnesses cutting-edge time-travel technology to abduct women from the past to be surrogates" in order to save humanity from extinction.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Code Violet </em>is getting itself a sequel somehow.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Presumably, <em>Code Violet</em>'s sequel must be happening because the game sold enough copies to make a followup viable, although if it did, I'm not sure everyone who bought it is entirely happy with their purchase.</p><p>A quick glance at the game's <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/code-violet/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Metacritic page</a> shows that it's currently sitting at an aggregate score of 29/100, which Metacritic rather drily says indicates a "generally unfavorable" reception, with user reviews coming in even lower at 26.</p><p>A number of professional critics and users alike describe <em>Code Violet </em>as the "worst game" they've ever played, with some describing it as "unplayable" and others using even less kind language than that. It looks like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/code-violet-pc-vulgar-mods" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3b4a9b19-13fb-46ea-8565-3704316c3d25" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">vulgar PC mods were the least of the dev's worries</a> after all.</p><p><em>Code Violet </em>fares a little better on its official <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012908" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation Store page</a>, where more than 4,000 reviewers scored it at a 2.88 out of 5 cumulatively, although you'll find similarly excoriating text reviews if you delve a little deeper.</p>
<p>In any case, we'll have to see whether TeamKill Media can improve things for <em>Code UltraViolet</em>. With a name like that, I have to admit I'm kind of rooting for the devs. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

<figcaption><em>Mewgenics </em>has proven a big success for Edmund McMillen and Tyler Glaiel.</figcaption>

<p>It seems as though Steam players are enjoying the game immensely, too. <em>Mewgenics </em>has attracted an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/686060/Mewgenics/#app_reviews_hash" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Overwhelmingly Positive rating</a> on the platform across more than 3,600 reviews at time of writing, which is impressive given it hasn't even been out for a day yet.</p><p>If you're wondering exactly what <em>Mewgenics </em>is, it's a turn-based tactical roguelite created by <em>Super Meat Boy </em>and <em>The Binding of Isaac </em>creator Edmund McMillen, in conjunction with designer Tyler Glaiel.</p><p>The game promises the ability to "build the ultimate cat army through tactical breeding" before sending the cats you've created into "deep, challenging turn-based adventures" with a touch of <em>Final Fantasy Tactics </em>about them.</p><p><em>Mewgenics </em>has a range of classes for you to choose from, each of which has around 75 abilities, as well as more than 900 items and "countless environmental interactions". Depth is very much the watchword here, which might explain why the game has taken off like it has.</p>
