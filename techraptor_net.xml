            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The creator of the most popular <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> setting has announced a new project. Ed Greenwood, the creator of the Forgotten Realms, has announced Realmsbound, a series of books designed to flesh out the iconic setting further.</p><p>According to its official <a href="https://mythmakers.com/realmsbound/dalelands" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">web page</a>, Realmsbound is a project intended to bring new lore, stories, and adventures to the land of the Forgotten Realms. These books will be available on DMs Guild both as PDFs and in physical copies through print-on-demand.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The books in question will flesh out certain locations in the setting and highlight areas that have never been seen before. As the page itself states, this is not a journey into uncharted lands, but a deepening of what was always there, waiting to be found.</p><p>This is an admirable project given the current state of the Forgotten Realms in <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. Despite decades of supplements, &nbsp;prewritten adventure modules like <em>Waterdeep: Dragon Heist</em>, award-winning video games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/baldurs-gate-3" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a>, and one <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-honor-among-thieves-review-adaptation-that-understands-its-roots" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">feature film</a>, the worldbuilding and lore are centered on one small part: the Sword Coast. Even the new <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-forgotten-realms-heroes-of-faerun-and-adventures-in-faerun-review" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">2024 supplements</a> stay within this region of the land of Faerun.</p><p>This is where the Realmsbound project comes in. The first region getting the long-awaited glow-up is the Dalelands. The first book, <em>Guide to the Dalelands</em>, expands upon the material in the <em>Adventures in Faerun</em> book, adding more texture and history to the region. This will include detailed maps of regions like Cormanthor, as well as information on local economies, secretive factions, and echoes of long-lost power.</p><p>The second supplement, included in this book, is a Player's Guide meant to help ground players in the setting. The three remaining supplements focus on other aspects of play. <em>Inn Sites of the Dalelands</em> focuses on social encounters, local holidays and regional events, fleshed out NPCs and inns, and casual mini-games. <em>Delves of the Dalelands</em> focuses on areas of interest full of legendary danger.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>Lastly, <em>Adventures in the Dalelands</em> is an anthology book. It will contain several prewritten adventures up to level 12. All of these books will be released over the course of a year. Guide to the Dalelands will release in Q1 2026, Inn Sites releases in Q2 2026, Delves releases in Q3 2026, and Adventures will release in Q4 2026.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/dnd-realmsbound-forgotten-realms-2026/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Polygon</a>, Greenwood spoke more about the Realmsbound project. He states that, much like the original creation of the Forgotten Realms, the project is a collaborative effort. The team includes creative director Eric Menge, who produced the Moonshae campaign for Adventurer's League, and senior designer Savannah Houston McIntyre (<em>City of Greyhawk</em>).</p><p>Ed Greenwood returning to expand on a setting he helped create isn't unheard of for a <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> setting. The creator of Eberron, Keith Baker, has published multiple supplements as well on DMs Guild for the game's latest edition. His latest book, <em>Frontiers of Eberron: Quickstone</em>, expands upon the latest 2024 <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/eberron-forge-of-artificer-review-minor-tweaks-overall-but-fun-new-subclass" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Forge of the Artificer</em></a> supplement, adding new player options and more history to the setting's Western Frontier.</p><p>At the time of writing, it is unclear how much the Realmsbound supplements will be sold for. It can be speculated that, based on the current prices of theEberron books, they may be sold for around $35 for PDFs and $75 for physical copies.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

  </picture><h2>Third Place - Elden Ring Nightreign: The Forsaken Hollows</h2><p>Developer: FromSoftware | Release Date: December 3rd, 2025</p><p>Written by Joe Allen</p><p><em>Forsaken Hollows</em> offers more of what made<em> Elden Ring Nightreign</em> so strangely compelling, which is to say more opportunities to fail.</p><p>The expansion’s new map (which is technically a Shifting Earth condition, yes, but it’s pretty transformative) is a labyrinthine maze of crystals, chasms, and vertiginous falls, and new bosses like the Lord of Blood and the Demon Prince give no quarter.</p><p>Two new classes slot nicely into proceedings as well, especially the Scholar, which plays a support role you won’t find anywhere else in <em>Nightreign</em>’s already-diverse cast of playables.</p><p>All of this gloriously difficult adventuring culminates in two new Nightlords, both of whom provide a different challenge for you and your two buddies (or randoms), necessitating that special mixture of forward planning and seat-of-your-pants, howling improvisation that <em>Nightreign </em>excels at.</p><p>In short, if you liked <em>Nightreign</em>, you’ll almost certainly like<em> Forsaken Hollows</em>, and hey, more of the same ain’t no bad thing in this case.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Second Place - No Man's Sky: Voyagers</h2><p>Developer: Hello Games | Release Date: August 27th, 2025</p><p>Written by Andrew Otton</p><p><em>No Man's Sky</em> has been a consistent nominee and sometimes winner in both this category and Best Evolving Game since 2018. In 2025, <em>Voyagers </em>released, which was a massive update to the game. Truly amazing just how much this continues to evolve over the years.</p><p>The biggest part of this update brought fully customizable ships to the game. You probably saw some of the meme ships people created posted somewhere on social media, as we now have the tools to make pretty much whatever we want. That includes the interior of the ship as well, which you can walk around after stylizing it however you want.</p><p>Beyond just the look, there's a lot of utility you can put in your ship as well, and can even fly around with your friends on missions or just exploring. All in all, <em>Voyagers </em>was a huge update that brought a lot of life to <em>No Man's Sky</em>.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Winner - Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: The Order of Giants</h2><p>Developer: MachineGames | Release Date: September 4th, 2025</p><p>Written by Andrew Stretch</p><p>It was great to break out the hat and whip again in <em>The Order of the Giants</em> DLC for <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>. This DLC returned Indy to the Vatican with a smaller side-adventure to take on.</p><p>While the DLC didn't have as much chance to explore an open hub area, what it did have was the kind of historical intrigue and tomb delving that best suits the third act in most Indy adventures. Platform through tunnels, clobber those trying to stop you, and navigate through a series of puzzles to learn a bit more about the mysterious Nephilim.</p><p>Above all is Machina Games' ability to make incredible set pieces to explore, and hearing Troy Baker's fantastic Harrison Ford impersonation.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
       
    <p>There's no I in TEAM!! We're all on the case, and this is how you know it :)</p>
