            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Payday&nbsp;</em>developer Starbreeze has canceled&nbsp;<em>Project Baxter</em>, its in-development live-service&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;</em>game, and a number of employees are being laid off across the studio as well.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://corporate.starbreeze.com/en/press/press-releases/starbreeze-sharpens-focus-on-payday-franchise-baxter-discontinued-as-part-of-strategic-shift/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a>,&nbsp;<em>Project Baxter</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-dnd-game-2026" rel="nofollow">first announced back in December 2023</a>, has been shut down so that the studio can deploy its resources to "accelerate the growth" of its "flagship&nbsp;<em>Payday&nbsp;</em>franchise".</p>

<p>The cancellation will cost Starbreeze around SEK 255 million (roughly $27.2 million) in "non-cash impairment" form, and it'll also result in the laying off of around 44 employees. Both decisions will, according to Starbreeze, allow the studio to become "cash-flow positive" next year.</p>

<p>According to Starbreeze, the new strategy will revolve around "deepening player engagement, broadening platform reach, and diversifying revenue streams", and it'll include expanding&nbsp;<em>Payday&nbsp;</em>"across platforms and experiences".</p>

<p>As part of this new strategy, Starbreeze says it will create "new games and experiences that broaden the heisting genre" beyond the studio's "core projects". These will include "spin-offs, narrative-driven projects, and franchise expansion to new platforms".</p>

<p>Another pillar of the developer's new strategy is work-for-hire operations, through which Starbreeze will complete work on projects for other publishers and studios. That work could well cross over with&nbsp;<em>Payday&nbsp;</em>in future, as well, such as in the case of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/payday-pubg-crossover-starbreeze-krafton" rel="nofollow">upcoming&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>crossover</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/payday-3-starbreeze-layoffs-baxter-canceled.jpg?itok=GDPBlpeA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/payday-3-starbreeze-layoffs-baxter-canceled.jpg?itok=wEtxbbRp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Starbreeze wants to refocus its business around&nbsp;<em>Payday</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>News of Starbreeze's strategy shift comes just days after the company was widely pilloried for the introduction of a&nbsp;<em>Payday 2&nbsp;</em>DLC subscription, which itself was introduced following a price hike for a one-off purchase of all currently-available DLC for the game.</p>

<p>Starbreeze, however, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-we-dropped-the-ball-starbreeze-admits-it-botched-payday-2-subscription-rollout" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">says</a> that the price increase was unrelated to the introduction of the subscription model, although commercial exec Gustav Nisser admitted the studio "dropped the ball" with regards to the subscription's rollout.</p>

<p>The shift to a focus on<i>&nbsp;Payday&nbsp;</i>also follows a pretty dismal couple of years for&nbsp;<em>Payday 3</em>, the latest game in the series, with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-financials-2024-payday-3" rel="nofollow">plummeting sales</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/payday-3-game-director-steps-down" rel="nofollow">departing executives</a>&nbsp;not exactly contributing to an optimistic overall outlook for the game.</p>
