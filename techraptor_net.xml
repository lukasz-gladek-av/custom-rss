<p>According to Ubisoft, the project's cancellation is part of what the studio refers to as a "major organizational, operational, and portfolio reset" which is "designed to reclaim [Ubisoft's] creative leadership" and renew the publisher's "trajectory towards sustainable growth".</p><p>Said initiative will consist of three pillars, namely a new operating model, a "refocused portfolio", and the "rightsizing" of the company as a whole. Naturally, this reorganization will also include increased investment in generative AI.</p><p>Ubisoft also reiterates its commitment to restructuring <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-creative-houses-q1-financials" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="acd9f3a1-9a63-4e42-9b91-122a243964e9" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">into Creative Houses</a>, each of which will steward a set of the studio's IPs, including Vantage Studios, which will oversee <em>Assassin's Creed </em>and <em>Far Cry</em>.</p><p><em>Prince of Persia</em>, meanwhile, will fall under the watchful eye of Creative House 4, which, according to Ubisoft, is "dedicated to immersive fantasy worlds and narrative-driven universes". That's also the Creative House that will look after <em>Rayman</em>, which Ubisoft says it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rayman-remake-2026-rayman-4-report" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="781293f6-dc00-4c8e-aa6f-0f302cc5b8b6" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">currently working on</a>.</p>
<p>Notably, Creative House 4 is also responsible for <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil</em>, and Ubisoft doesn't say anything about the status of the long-awaited <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</em>, although if <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/beyond-good-and-evil-2-new-job-postings" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3c16fa0c-81d9-45f0-9b15-3df2fe6adb4a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">recent job listings</a> are to be believed, the project is still in development.</p><p>We'll have to wait and see what this new restructuring effort means for Ubisoft and for those who play its games. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
