            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/seafarer-the-ship-sim-astragon<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Construction Simulator&nbsp;</em>studio Astragon has announced&nbsp;<em>Seafarer: The Ship Sim</em>, and as the title suggests, it'll put you in command of your very own ship.</p>

<p>Built in Unreal Engine 5,&nbsp;<em>Seafarer&nbsp;</em>promises to do for maritime simulation what&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/get-to-work-in-construction-simulator-this-september" rel="nofollow"><em>Construction Simulator&nbsp;</em>did for, well, construction</a>. Astragon describes the game as a "fully interactive ship experience" with a variety of missions and two different game modes to enjoy.</p>

<p>In Story Mode, you'll take on "unique missions" and receive rewards from different factions. You might be transporting cargo one minute, then fighting fires on open waters the next. Astragon is even promising treasure retrieval missions, which...well, who hasn't dreamt of that at some point?</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/astragon-seafarer-the-ship-sim.jpg?itok=4dkITpVZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/astragon-seafarer-the-ship-sim.jpg?itok=aauKboA9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Seafarer: The Ship Sim&nbsp;</em>promises "breathtaking visuals" and a variety of missions.</figcaption></figure><p>If you don't fancy taking on missions, though, you can always hop into&nbsp;<em>Seafarer: The Ship Sim</em>'s Quick Play mode, in which you can simply sail around to your heart's content without anyone telling you what to do.</p>

<p>You won't just be piloting one type of ship, either. Astragon is promising a variety of different ships, "from small tugboats to gigantic freighters", so you'll be able to get a sense of what it's like to sail ships big and small.</p>

<p>The game will offer a variety of different tasks to complete, as well. You won't just be sailing your ship; you'll also have to operate machinery and even use water cannons to put out fires.</p>

<p>If you're expecting ship combat from&nbsp;<em>Seafarer: The Ship Sim</em>, though, you might want to look elsewhere. This is very much not a pirate sim, nor is it an arcade-style ship battler; it's an Astragon simulation through and through, by the looks of things.</p>




<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Seafarer: The Ship Sim&nbsp;</em>when it launches for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2582140/Seafarer_The_Ship_Sim/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a> and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/seafarer-the-ship-sim-bbbc39" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Epic Games Store</a> this summer. It'll set you back $24.99 and will be an Early Access release to begin with.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/humble-games-showcase-2025-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Indie publisher Humble Games has announced that it's hosting a new Humble Games Showcase next week, and it'll feature updates on some of the publisher's upcoming games, plus two brand new titles.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/03/humble-games-showcase-2025-set-for-march-12" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gematsu</a>, the 2025 Humble Games Showcase will air on March 12th, which is exactly one week today. It'll be available at 12pm Eastern, which works out as 9am Pacific and 5pm GMT.</p>

<p>The showcase will be hosted by content creator and streaming personality <a href="https://www.ashsaidhi.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">AshSaidHi</a>, and it's set to feature reveals for a number of games being published by the Humble Games label in the next few months.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monaco-2-humble-games-showcase-2025.jpg?itok=fNsCYaeA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monaco-2-humble-games-showcase-2025.jpg?itok=lj5-2SMm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Monaco 2&nbsp;</em>is one of the games that will be featured during next week's Humble Games Showcase.</figcaption></figure><p>First up, you'll be getting some new info about the Bossa Studios game&nbsp;<em>Lost Skies</em>. The developer, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bossa-studios-layoffs-restructuring" rel="nofollow">hit by layoffs earlier this month</a>, recently announced it would focus on launching&nbsp;<em>Lost Skies&nbsp;</em>before pivoting towards smaller projects that could be released sooner.</p>

<p>Developer Pocketwatch Games will also unveil new information about stealth game&nbsp;<em>Monaco 2</em>, and since both games are yet to get a concrete release date, I wouldn't be surprised if just such a thing were to be announced next week.</p>

<p>We'll also get some more information about the heavily&nbsp;<em>Chrono Trigger</em>-inspired&nbsp;<em>Threads of Time</em>, as well as a new look at musical 3D platformer&nbsp;<em>Billie Bust Up</em>. Updates on recently-released games&nbsp;<em>On Your Tail&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Wizard of Legend 2&nbsp;</em>are also expected.</p>

<p>Lastly, Humble Games says it will reveal two "never-before-seen world premieres", so we'll be getting a look at two brand new Humble Games titles as well. Of course, we'll have to wait for the show to find out what they are.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/threads-of-time-humble-games-showcase-2025.jpg?itok=EwLkY4-b 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/threads-of-time-humble-games-showcase-2025.jpg?itok=unPVigBj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>More info about throwback JRPG&nbsp;<em>Threads of Time&nbsp;</em>is coming next week.</figcaption></figure><p>The showcase will be the first Humble Games presentation since the indie publisher laid off more than 30 employees and restructured its operations <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/humble-games-lays-off-over-30-employees-as-it-restructures" rel="nofollow">back in July last year</a>. At that time, it was believed that Humble Games was to shut down, but that demonstrably turned out not to be the case.</p>

<p>The Humble Games Showcase airs on March 12th at 9am Pacific/12am Eastern/5pm GMT. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-and-4-remasters<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Activision has announced&nbsp;<em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</em>, which, as you might imagine, contains remastered versions of the third and fourth games in the acclaimed&nbsp;<em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater&nbsp;</em>series.</p>

<p>The collection was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-tony-hawks-remasters-potentially-leaked-by-pro-skater" rel="nofollow">leaked via an interview</a> with pro skater Tyshawn Jones, but it's now been <a href="https://www.tonyhawkthegame.com/blog/2025/03/tony-hawk-pro-skater-three-plus-four-launch-announcement" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">officially revealed</a>. Launching on July 11th,&nbsp;the remastered collection will be hitting last-gen platforms as well as current-gen consoles (and PC, of course).</p>

<p>In addition to everything you'd find in the original&nbsp;<em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>4</em>, the collection will also include new skaters and parks, new tricks, and cross-platform online multiplayer that supports up to eight simultaneous players.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-and-4-remasters-skaters.jpg?itok=L3F7jtyd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-and-4-remasters-skaters.jpg?itok=yf5mFnQ6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4&nbsp;</em>is officially coming in July.</figcaption></figure><p>That's not all, though. If you plump for the Deluxe Edition of&nbsp;<em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</em>, you'll also get access to two characters from celebrated FPS franchise&nbsp;<em>Doom</em>.</p>

<p>You can rip and tear it up as the Doom Slayer, who comes with two outfits: Standard and Retro. He also has two unique tricks up his sleeve, as well as the unique Unmaykr Hoverboard, which was presumably gifted to him by the Maykrs in order that he should be approximately 100% more sick.</p>

<p>If the Doom Slayer doesn't float your boat, then perhaps you'd prefer to play as the Revenant, who comes with unique tricks as well. You can even make him pull the Doot move, for which he literally produces his very own infernal trumpet.</p>

<p>You can check out the reveal trailer for&nbsp;<em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</em>&nbsp;right here. It shows off the new visuals the games will sport, and you'll also catch a glimpse of some of the skaters and parks featured in the collection.</p>




<p>Development on the remaster collection will be handled by Iron Galaxy Studios, which recently became one of the many companies across the industry <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rumbleverse-and-killer-instct-studio-iron-galaxy-suffers-layoffs" rel="nofollow">to be hit by layoffs</a>. Hopefully, more reductions for the studio aren't on the cards anytime soon.</p>

<p><em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2545710/Tony_Hawks_Pro_Skater_3__4/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0002-PPSA18010_00-TH34RSTNDBUNDL01" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4/9N1WK33QNSRJ/0010" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-plus-4-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> on July 11th.</p>
