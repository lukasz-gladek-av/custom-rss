            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Saber Interactive and publisher Focus Entertainment have announced that&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>will get a second year of free updates and paid DLC.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/229-june-community-update" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">community update</a>, the studios say that a second yearly season pass is in the works, made possible by the "unwavering support" of the&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>community. The new pass will offer "new PvE missions, enemies, weapons, and...more", according to Focus, but it's too early for the studio to pin down exactly what's coming.</p>

<p>As well as that second year of content,&nbsp;a major&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>update is coming in September. Update 10.0 will include a brand new PvP mode, with the intervening Update 9.0 bringing "only balancing changes".</p>

You will also be able to pilot a Helbrute, which pretty much justifies the new mode in and of itself.</p>

<p>As part of this new mode, you can also expect new Chaos-themed armor sets to be added to&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>, and a new melee weapon will also be added in the form of the Power Axe, so you'll have another way to cleave heretics in twain (or followers of the False Emperor, whatever your poison may be).</p>

<p>Update 10.0 will additionally bring a new class in the form of the Techmarine, which Focus and Saber say they'll reveal more about in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>The latest community update also contains lots of information about how Saber and Focus learned from the new Siege Mode's public test period, so if you had strong opinions about that mode, you might want to check out their thoughts on that.</p>




<p>Elsewhere in&nbsp;<em>Space Marine&nbsp;</em>news, it was revealed recently that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-space-marine-3-revealed" rel="nofollow">a third&nbsp;<em>Space Marine&nbsp;</em>game</a> is in development, and while not much has been revealed about it yet, we do know that it will likely see protagonist Captain Titus returning from the previous two installments.</p>

<p>Not only that, but the devs behind&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>are currently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-marine-2-devs-hasbro-tentpole-ip" rel="nofollow">working on a brand new AAA-level game</a> using a "tentpole" Hasbro IP. If it doesn't turn out to be a&nbsp;<em>Monopoly&nbsp;</em>Soulslike, I'll be very sad indeed.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Backyard Baseball '01 Release Date and Returning MLB Stars Revealed]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/backyard-baseball-01-release-date-mlb-stars</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/backyard-baseball-01-release-date-and-returning-mlb-stars-revealed.1231848/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Cult classic baseball game&nbsp;<em>Backyard Baseball '01&nbsp;</em>is due for a re-release next week, and according to a new report, just three of the game's original 31 licensed stars will not be returning.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://www.sportico.com/leagues/baseball/2025/backyard-baseball-2001-game-release-date-mlb-players-list-1234858525/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Sportico</a> (which cites new <em>Backyard Baseball&nbsp;</em>series owner Playground Productions), 28 of the players who appeared in the original&nbsp;<em>Backyard Baseball 2001</em>, including icons like Derek Jeter and Jose Canseco, will be returning for the new re-release, which is coming to Steam and mobile devices on July 8th.</p>

<p>According to Sportico, while some players were easy to track down, others were more difficult. Playground CEO&nbsp;Lindsay Barnett (that's Playground Productions, not&nbsp;<em>Forza&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/fable-2025" rel="nofollow">Fable</a>&nbsp;</em>developer Playground Games) says that the studio contacted some of&nbsp;Álex González's current coaching students to track him down, for example.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/backyard-baseball-01-mlb-stars-gameplay.jpg?itok=ir5tGdpD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/backyard-baseball-01-mlb-stars-gameplay.jpg?itok=10HRX4PJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Backyard Baseball '01&nbsp;</em>will feature 28 of the original game's 31 players.</figcaption></figure><p>The three players who won't be featuring in this re-release are Ken Griffey Jr., Frank Thomas, and Barry Bonds. As Sportico points out, Bonds hasn't appeared in an MLB-related game since <a href="https://ryanferguson.co.uk/blogs/blog/why-was-barry-bonds-not-in-video-games" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">backing out</a> of a group licensing agreement in the early 2000s.</p>

<p>Barnett said that working with MLB on&nbsp;<em>Backyard Baseball '01&nbsp;</em>"just could not have been easier", and that the league "really love[s] this brand", referring to the&nbsp;<em>Backyard Baseball&nbsp;</em>series.</p>

<p><em>Backyard Baseball&nbsp;</em>belongs to the wider&nbsp;<em>Backyard Sports&nbsp;</em>series, which also includes takes on sports like American football, association football (or "soccer", though the word feels hollow in my mouth as a Brit), and basketball.</p>

<p>As well as re-releasing&nbsp;<em>Backyard Baseball '01</em>&nbsp;and other games in the&nbsp;<em>Backyard&nbsp;</em>series, Playground is also currently working on a <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/backyard-sports-new-video-game-tv-film-adaptations-1236213649/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">brand new title</a>, although we don't know around which sport the new game will revolve yet.</p>




<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Backyard Baseball '01&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3104970/Backyard_Baseball_01/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> on July 8th, so make sure to wishlist it if you're after a slice of nostalgic sports action.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-king-is-watching-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/roguelite-kingdom-builder-the-king-is-watching-gets-july-release-date.1231809/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Hypnohead and publisher tinyBuild have announced the release date for roguelite city-builder&nbsp;<em>The King Is Watching</em>, and it's set to arrive on PC next month.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>The King Is Watching&nbsp;</em>will arrive on July 21st. According to tinyBuild, the game has enjoyed 300,000 demo downloads and has amassed over 200,000 wishlists from hopeful fans. That's a lot of people who'll be over the moon to discover a release date has been revealed, I'm sure.</p>

<p>With&nbsp;<em>The King Is Watching</em>, tinyBuild and Hypnohead promise to "[take] the base-building genre in a new direction" by "adding in roguelike elements to make each reign fresh". I suspect games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/against-storm" rel="nofollow">Against the Storm</a>&nbsp;</em>would have something to say about that, but I see what they're driving at.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-king-is-watching-city-building.jpg?itok=H2ypKkKg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-king-is-watching-city-building.jpg?itok=RZ7fzUWi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The King Is Watching&nbsp;</em>comes to Steam next month.</figcaption></figure><p>The game's name comes from a mechanic whereby you must be watching certain facilities and buildings for them to be productive; the moment your gaze moves elsewhere, those facilities essentially slack off, so you'll need to keep your eyes on the places you most need to be productive.</p>

<p>You'll also need to manage resources carefully, choosing which resources to prioritize and which ones to put on the back burner for different situations. Hypnohead and tinyBuild say that every decision you make will shape your reign.</p>

<p>The roguelike elements in&nbsp;<em>The King Is Watching&nbsp;</em>manifest in the form of new challenges and variables for each run; you may, for instance, be confronted with "cursed cemeteries", or you may need to do battle with generals you've never faced in combat before.</p>




<p>However, you'll unlock permanent bonuses like increased troop limits and new facilities between runs, ensuring that you're constantly increasing the scope and range of your power.</p>

<p><em>The King Is Watching&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2753900/The_King_is_Watching/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> on July 21st. There's no word yet of ports to other platforms.</p>
