            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new round of layoffs at Microsoft has apparently begun, and employees at studios like&nbsp;<em>Candy Crush Saga&nbsp;</em>developer King and Bethesda's parent company ZeniMax are losing their jobs, with up to 9,000 company-wide employees reportedly in the firing line.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-02/microsoft-begins-deep-job-cuts-across-xbox-division" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a>'s Jason Schreier, 200 staffers at King will lose their jobs, which represents around 10% of the company's total headcount. We don't yet know the number of layoffs at ZeniMax's European location.</p>

<p>Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-02/microsoft-to-cut-9-000-workers-in-second-wave-of-major-layoffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">says</a>&nbsp;these cuts are part of a wider layoff wave at Microsoft, in which "about 9,000 workers" will be caught up. A spokesperson told the publication that the layoffs will represent less than 4% of the company's workforce, but that the cuts are - say it with me - part of "best position[ing] the company...for success in a dynamic marketplace". Yuck.</p>

<p>This is the start of the layoff wave <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-layoffs-next-week-report" rel="nofollow">predicted by Bloomberg last week</a>, and it's also not the first time Microsoft has laid off a large number of employees in the last eighteen months or so.</p>

<p>The company's most recent layoff round came in May, when Microsoft reportedly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-3-percent-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">let go of around 3% of its workforce</a>&nbsp;"across all levels, teams, and geographies" (according to news platform CNBC).</p>

<p>Prior to that, another wave of layoffs <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-layoffs-january-2025" rel="nofollow">took place in January</a>, although a smaller number of employees were apparently affected by those layoffs than in subsequent job shearing efforts.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/microsoft-layoffs-july-2025-zenimax.jpg?itok=ag33jupa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/microsoft-layoffs-july-2025-zenimax.jpg?itok=jzBOm8lz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>ZeniMax and King are almost certainly not the only studios affected by these layoffs.</figcaption></figure><p>I could go on, but the point is that Microsoft has laid off a lot of employees in recent months, and the company is showing no signs of stopping on that front.</p>

<p>Of course, none of these layoffs stopped CEO Satya Nadella scoring himself an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-ceo-payrise-layoffs" rel="nofollow">eye-wateringly high payrise</a> back in October, and given <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-ceo-payrise-andrew-wilson" rel="nofollow">recent CEO payrise trends</a>, I'd be extremely surprised if that doesn't happen again this year. Stay tuned for more on this as it develops.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nexus Mods Introducing Age Verification and More Due to UK and EU Laws]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nexus-mods-age-verification-uk-eu</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nexus-mods-introducing-age-verification-and-more-due-to-uk-and-eu-laws.1233837/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Modding site Nexus Mods has announced it's going to be making some changes in the near future thanks to UK and EU laws, and those changes will include age verification for users in those areas, plus more.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15319" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a>, Nexus Mods content team lead SlugGirl says that the updates in question are part of Nexus Mods' "legal obligation to comply" with the UK's <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-safety-act-explainer/online-safety-act-explainer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Online Safety Act</a> and the EU's <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-services-act_en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Digital Services Act</a>, plus new guidance issued by UK regulator Ofcom.</p>

<p>This legislation means Nexus Mods must, in SlugGirl's words, "ensure [it continues] to remove illegal content and add additional restrictions to children's access to certain adult content".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nexus-mods-age-verification-uk-eu-homepage.jpg?itok=jnBAiHOB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nexus-mods-age-verification-uk-eu-homepage.jpg?itok=Gh5m68w4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nexus Mods is introducing a number of changes thanks to UK and EU law, including age verification.</figcaption></figure><p>In the UK and the EU, users will be required to verify their age "in the future". Nexus Mods says "the specifics of this are being carefully considered", as the site "want[s] to get this right" and ensure that adult content is still available for those of appropriate age. Those outside of these regions won't be subject to age verification.</p>

<p>Other upcoming changes include "a clearer, more detailed definition of what counts as illegal content" in Nexus Mods' terms and conditions, as well as new automated detection for child sexual abuse material (CSAM).</p>

<p>Adult content guidelines and categorization will also be overhauled, with new revised tags being introduced for mods that feature adult subjects like pornography, extreme violence, or suicide and self-harm.</p>

<p>Nexus Mods' block and mute systems will be rebuilt "to make them clearer and more effective", and the site's automated spam detection tools will be expanded to other site areas, including comments, which will now be "manually reviewed by staff/moderators", according to SlugGirl.</p>
