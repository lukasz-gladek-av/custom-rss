            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has announced that&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>Title Update 2 will arrive next week, bringing with it two new monsters to fight, new layered weapons, and extra quality-of-life features, plus more.</p>

<p>This update is the game's second major content drop, following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-1-release-date" rel="nofollow">March's Title Update 1</a>. Its first major new addition is Lagiacrus, who is available to fight as part of an extra mission. You'll have to reach Hunter Rank 31, and you'll need to complete the missions A World Turned Upside Down and Forest Doshaguma.</p>

<p>Your fight against Lagiacrus won't just take place on the ground, either; you'll also be able to play through "a special underwater sequence" when you're fighting it, so you should have a spectacular battle on your hands.</p>

<p>Once again, you'll need to be Hunter Rank 31 or above, and you'll need to complete A World Turned Upside Down to fight him. He's known for inflicting the Bleeding status effect, so make sure you've got stuff with you to get rid of that.</p>

<p>Other additions in this update include new layered weapons to collect, the ability to swap between Alma and Erik as your handler, and a new Support Hunter, plus the ability to select the Support Hunter you want to join you on your quests.</p>




<p>A new update for&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>is all well and good, but it might not do much to allay the mounting criticism being leveled at the game by fans; it's currently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sitting at an Overwhelmingly Negative score</a> across recent Steam ratings.</p>

<p>Criticisms range from poor performance through to a lack of content and complaints about the streamlined nature of the game, and while some of these issues appear to have plagued&nbsp;<em>Wilds&nbsp;</em>since its launch, some seem to be rearing their heads as more players reach the endgame.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>is available now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/monster-hunter-wilds/9NMT6XFN0LVD" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. Title Update 2 will be released on June 30th.

            <title><![CDATA[Arc System Works Reveals Two Intriguing New Non-Fighting Games]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/arc-system-works-two-new-games</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-system-works-reveals-two-intriguing-new-non-fighting-games.1229952/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Arc System Works, best known for fighting games like&nbsp;<em>Guilty Gear&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy Versus</em>, have announced two brand new projects, and they both look like they're pretty far out of the developer's usual wheelhouse.</p>

<p>Both games were announced during the developer's showcase yesterday. The first,&nbsp;<em>Dear Me, I Was</em>, is a Switch 2 exclusive that Arc describes as an "interactive adventure" featuring a "story woven with beautiful visuals".</p>

<p>It features the distinctive art style of Taisuke Kanasaki, the artist behind the cult classic DS adventure games&nbsp;<em>Hotel Dusk&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;Another Code</i>. As a reminder, the latter, along with its Wii sequel, received a re-release on the Switch last year courtesy of Arc System Works.</p>




<p>We don't know too much about how&nbsp;<em>Dear Me, I Was&nbsp;</em>will play yet, but we do know that the game's launch is scheduled for sometime this summer. That means we can likely expect a release sometime before mid-September, at least.</p>

<h2>Arc System Works' second new game is "an action game, not a fighting game"</h2>

<p>As well as&nbsp;<em>Dear Me, I Was</em>, Arc System Works also announced&nbsp;<em>Damon and Baby&nbsp;</em>during yesterday's showcase. It's "the first step" towards a new future for the company, one in which it diversifies and makes games other than the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/guilty-gear-strive" rel="nofollow">fighters</a> for which it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/granblue-fantasy-versus" rel="nofollow">known</a>.</p>

<p><em>Damon and Baby&nbsp;</em>revolves around the Demon King, who is "cursed to never be able to part from a human child". He must embark on a journey to lift the curse and rid himself of his burden, although I'm betting he'll grow to love the little scamp by the end of the game.</p>




<p>Gameplay-wise, it looks like&nbsp;<em>Damon and Baby&nbsp;</em>will mostly take the form of a top-down-slash-sidescrolling action game, with plenty of variety in the form of setpieces and boss fights to enjoy.</p>

<p>Neither game has a concrete release date yet, but Arc System Works has promised more information soon. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/super-mario-strikers-switch-2</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/super-mario-strikers-is-the-switch-2s-first-post-launch-gamecube-game.1229937/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has revealed the first post-launch GameCube game coming to the Switch 2 as part of the Nintendo Switch Online service, and it's none other than arcade sports classic&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Strikers</em>.</p>

<p>As revealed in a new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Strikers&nbsp;</em>will be joining <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-gamecube-switch-2-online" rel="nofollow">the console's GameCube lineup</a> on July 3rd, taking its place alongside games like&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;SoulCalibur II</i>.</p>

<p>Just like with other GameCube games, as well as titles available on systems like the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fire-emblem-the-sacred-stones-nintendo-switch-online" rel="nofollow">Game Boy Advance</a> and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/streets-of-rage-nintendo-switch-online" rel="nofollow">Sega Genesis</a>, you're going to need an Expansion Pack addon if you want to enjoy&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Strikers</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/super-mario-strikers-switch-2-game.jpg?itok=NAhtA9Nt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/super-mario-strikers-switch-2-game.jpg?itok=tK4OBeQI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Super Mario Strikers&nbsp;</em>is the next GameCube game coming to Nintendo Switch Online for Switch 2.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Strikers</em>, it's a soccer (or football, if you're from the same sceptred isle as me) game that stars characters from the&nbsp;<em>Mario&nbsp;</em>franchise. Playables include Mario himself, of course, as well as Donkey Kong, Waluigi, and more.</p>

<p>Originally released in 2005,&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Strikers&nbsp;</em>was developed by Next Level Games, who, at that point, were known only for 2003 sports title&nbsp;<em>NHL Hitz Pro</em>. The studio would go on to work alongside Nintendo on games like the Wii's&nbsp;<em>Punch-Out!!&nbsp;</em>remake, as well as the two&nbsp;<em>Luigi's Mansion&nbsp;</em>sequels.</p>

<p>Naturally,&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Strikers&nbsp;</em>puts a characteristically Nintendo spin on soccer; while the basic rules remain largely intact, you can use&nbsp;<em>Mario</em>-themed items to gain an advantage, and characters also have access to special attacks to turn the tide of play.</p>




<p><em>Super Mario Strikers&nbsp;</em>serves as the first in a series of three games; the first followup, 2007's&nbsp;<em>Mario Strikers Charged</em>, was released for the Wii, but it would take another fifteen years before&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/mario-strikers-battle-league" rel="nofollow">Mario Strikers: Battle League</a>&nbsp;</em>would appear on the Switch, once again developed by Next Level Games.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Strikers&nbsp;</em>as part of the Nintendo Switch Online GameCube lineup when it takes to the pitch on July 3rd. Again, though, you'll need a Switch Online Expansion Pack addon to enjoy it.</p>
