            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alzara-radiant-echoes-studio-camelia-shuts-down<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Studio Camelia, the team behind Kickstarted RPG&nbsp;<em>Alzara Radiant Echoes</em>, has announced it will be closing its doors, and that development on the game is now "on an indefinite pause".</p>

<p>In a Kickstarter <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/studiocamelia/seed-a-vibrant-tribute-to-jrpg-classics/posts/4411421" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">update</a> posted earlier today, Studio Camelia says that prior to the Kickstarter's commencement, it had secured funding for "half the development" of&nbsp;<em>Alzara Radiant Echoes</em>, and that the crowdfunding campaign was intended to "reduce the perceived risk" for potential partners.</p>

<p>The studio says it used the Kickstarter money to create a new demo, but that no discussions with potential partners resulted in a publishing contract, "despite having a playable demo, a senior team, half of the funding secured, and the Kickstarter campaign".</p>

<p>Studio Camelia says there's a "slim chance that a third party might one day step in and offer to take over the project", but that this would result in a "different direction" for the game, although the studio says it hopes that direction would be "for the better".</p>

<p>Backers who gave their money to&nbsp;<em>Alzara Radiant Echoes</em>' campaign won't be refunded, the studio says, and given that the game managed to make almost three times the amount the studio asked for, that's got to sting for a lot of folks.</p>

<p>Indeed, many backers are incandescent in the comments section of the aforementioned post, variously calling the campaign "scammy", "a bold-faced lie", and "full of BS".</p>




<p>Some users accuse Studio Camelia of a lack of transparency; as recently as February, an update was posted that made no mention of&nbsp;<em>Alzara Radiant Echoes</em>' ongoing financial trouble, although Studio Camelia would surely have been well aware of its problems by then.</p>

<p>Additionally, some commenters say that it wasn't clear the funds they were contributing wouldn't necessarily be put towards the development of a full game, but rather a demo for investors and publishers.</p>

<p>Kickstarter is often used to fund video game development; notable success stories include the excellent&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloodstained-ritual-of-night-crowdfunding-closes-may-14" rel="nofollow">Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night</a>&nbsp;</em>and Larian Studios'&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/divinity-original-sin-2-quickly-funded-explains-gameplay" rel="nofollow"><em>Divinity: Original Sin 2</em></a>, which laid much of the groundwork for&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>.</p>

<p>Still, Studio Camelia and&nbsp;<em>Alzara Radiant Echoes&nbsp;</em>are a cautionary tale of the ways in which crowdfunding can go wrong, although that won't be very reassuring to the backers who won't see their money returned.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crash-team-racing-nitro-fueled-10m-sales</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crash-team-racing-nitro-fueled-10m-sales<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Activision has announced that&nbsp;<em>Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled&nbsp;</em>has reached a brand new sales milestone, but unfortunately, it looks like there's still no PC port on the horizon.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/CrashBandicoot/status/1934657226846724255" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on social media, the publisher says that the game has sold ten million units around the world, which naturally includes both physical and digital shipments. It also accounts for all three platforms on which the game is available.</p>

<p>Sadly, it looks as though Activision's appreciation for the game starts and ends with its sales figures; there's no accompanying announcement of a PC version for the game, nor is there any word of whether performance improvements will be implemented for newer-gen consoles.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/crash-team-racing-nitro-fueled-sales-10m-race.jpg?itok=6LasRSaB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/crash-team-racing-nitro-fueled-sales-10m-race.jpg?itok=wOhWQFGA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled&nbsp;</em>has reached a new sales milestone, but it has not reached PC.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled&nbsp;</em>is, it's a remake-slash-remaster of the classic 1999 kart racer, often considered to be one of the&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart&nbsp;</em>series' biggest rivals.</p>

<p>Revealed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/game-awards-2018-crash-team-racing-nitro-fueled-revealed-updated" rel="nofollow">during the 2018 Game Awards</a>,&nbsp;<em>Nitro-Fueled&nbsp;</em>is somewhere between a remake and a remaster; it includes a full visual overhaul for the game, as well as tweaks to its gameplay, but otherwise, it hews pretty faithfully to the original&nbsp;<em>CTR</em>.</p>

<p>As well as all of the tracks from the original game,&nbsp;<em>Nitro-Fueled&nbsp;</em>also includes extra tracks and characters from sequels&nbsp;<em>Crash Nitro Kart&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;Crash Tag Team Racing</i>. Of course, since we can't have all nice things all the time, it also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crash-team-racings-second-grand-prix-brings-microtransactions-despite-past-promises" rel="nofollow">came complete with microtransactions</a>.</p>

<p>Updates for&nbsp;<em>Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/there-wont-be-another-crash-team-racing-nitro-fueled-update-beenox-says" rel="nofollow">came to an end in late 2020</a>, meaning no new tracks or characters have been added since then. It seems that Activision is content to allow&nbsp;<em>Nitro-Fueled&nbsp;</em>to remain in its current state, and also for PC players to miss out on it entirely.</p>
