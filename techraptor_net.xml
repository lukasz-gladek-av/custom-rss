<p>Two new Agents will make their debut in <em>Zenless Zone Zero </em>Version 2.6. The first, Sunna, is an S-Rank Physical Support Agent who can grant big buffs to party members and facilitate quicker switching of characters with her Ultimate.</p><p>She's joined by Aria, the lead vocalist of the Angels of Delusion, who's an Ether Anomaly Agent with two distinct forms. Unlike Sunna, Aria is all about dealing big damage, so if you like to tackle problems head-on, she's your fighter.</p><p>Reruns for Yixuan and Yuzuha will be appearing as part of this Version cycle's banners, and the Bangboo Biggest Fan will also be added to the game as part of this update, complete with an HP restoration ability and an attack boost around Angels of Delusion.</p><p>A number of other bonuses and activities, including a chance to earn Polychromes for logging in and completing daily challenges, will be introduced as part of Version 2.6 as well. Suffice it to say that it's all go in <em>Zenless Zone Zero </em>land.</p>
<p><em>Zenless Zone Zero </em>is available to <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/en-us/main" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">play right now for free</a> on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and mobile devices.
