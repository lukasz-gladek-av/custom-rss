            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-54-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has revealed the&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.4 release date, and the latest update for the gacha RPG is landing next month, bringing the Flower Festival back to Inazuma.</p>

<p><em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.4 lands on February 12th, just in time for Valentine's Day. Following hot on the heels of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-5-3-release-date" rel="nofollow">this month's Version 5.3</a>, this update's main attraction is the return of the Mikawa Flower Festival, which gives you the chance to engage with a variety of exciting minigames and exchange the rewards you get from them for some cool stuff.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to the addition of a brand new five-star character in the form of Yumemizuki Mizuki, a "dedicated clinical psychologist and major shareholder of the Aisa Bathhouse".</p>

<p>She can also create snacks that can either heal party members or explode to deal further damage, depending on how much health your party has left. It sounds like she'll be a pretty valuable addition to your team.</p>

<p>You can expect Yumemizuki Mizuki to debut in the first half of&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.4, alongside a rerun of Sigewinne. The second half will bring reruns of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-furina-gameplay-video" rel="nofollow">Furina</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-wriothesley-gameplay-demo" rel="nofollow">Wriothesley</a>, just in case you haven't added them to your roster yet.</p>

<p>As well as the new character and the Flower Festival, Version 5.4 will also bring new slice-of-life vignettes that will revolve around some of your "favorite characters", and of course, you can expect system improvements and gameplay optimizations too.</p>
