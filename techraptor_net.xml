            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-godzilla-hatsune-miku<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega has revealed two new DLC characters for chaotic party platformer&nbsp;<em>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble</em>, and you couldn't hope to find two more contrasting pop culture icons.</p>

<p>Both characters are being added on November 26th, and they'll join the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-sonic-dlc" rel="nofollow">the&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog&nbsp;</em>crew</a>,&nbsp;<em>Crazy Taxi</em>'s Axel, and&nbsp;<em>Jet Set Radio</em>'s Beat&nbsp;as downloadable, er, "monkeys" for the game.</p>

<p>First up, nuclear monster Godzilla is joining the&nbsp;<em>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble&nbsp;</em>roster. Of course, this is a cutesy chibi-fied version of Godzilla rather than the fully-sized creature you might see in the likes of&nbsp;<em>Godzilla Minus One</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/godzilla-super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble.jpg?itok=S8Ei2Gqe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/godzilla-super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble.jpg?itok=4_YKO6l- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Yep, that really is Godzilla himself in&nbsp;<em>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>This is far from Godzilla's first video game appearance, and it's not even his first foray into the realms of DLC or update crossovers; he's also appeared in games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dave-diver-godzilla-dlc-coming-next-week" rel="nofollow">Dave the Diver</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/king-kong-and-godzilla-will-take-up-fight-in-world-of-warships" rel="nofollow"><em>World of Warships</em></a>, battling his old archnemesis King Kong in the latter.</p>

<p>Your second new DLC character for&nbsp;<em>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble&nbsp;</em>is none other than Vocaloid star Hatsune Miku, who seems a little better-suited to the adorable world of&nbsp;<em>Monkey Ball</em>.</p>

<p>Much like Godzilla, Miku has also made appearances in other properties alongside starring in her own games; memorably, she was part of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/mtg-secret-lair-summer-superdrop-2024-brings-assassins-creed-and-hatsune-miku" rel="nofollow">major&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering&nbsp;</em>collaboration</a> earlier this year.</p>

<p>First, here's the trailer for Godzilla, which shows off what he'll look like in&nbsp;<em>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble</em>.</p>




<p>Now that you've had your fill of kaiju antics, you can check out the altogether more anime-style trailer for Hatsune Miku.</p>




<p>Both of these characters will arrive alongside&nbsp;<em>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble</em>'s 2.0 update, which brungs a number of new adventure challenges, battle stages, and modes. It's all launching on November 26th.</p>

<p><em>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble&nbsp;</em>is available right now, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">exclusively for Nintendo Switch</a>. Stay tuned for more on this.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/binding-of-isaac-repentance-plus-update-co-op</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-binding-of-isaac-repentance-update-brings-online-co-op-and-more.1039563/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/binding-of-isaac-repentance-plus-update-co-op<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nicalis has released the long-awaited&nbsp;<em>The Binding of Isaac&nbsp;</em>Repentance+ update, finally bringing online co-op to the dungeon-crawling roguelike, as well as a host of other new stuff.</p>

<p>As noted in a Steam post announcing the update's launch, you're going to need all of the game's previous DLC in order to enjoy this update, and you're also going to need to be playing&nbsp;<em>The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth&nbsp;</em>rather than the original base game.</p>

<p>Assuming you tick all of those boxes, the Repentance+ update brings four-player online co-op to&nbsp;<em>The Binding of Isaac</em>, and it works across the game's Normal, Hard, Greed, Greedier, and Challenge modes, as well as daily runs and seeded runs.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-binding-of-isaac-repentance-update-online-co-op.jpg?itok=3uTgmAGx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-binding-of-isaac-repentance-update-online-co-op.jpg?itok=dfBgGw8J 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Binding of Isaac&nbsp;</em>now supports four-player co-op, assuming you're playing&nbsp;<em>Rebirth</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>There are a few differences to watch out for in online play. Bosses will drop items for all players, and if you join a run in progress, you'll be given items to catch you up "based on how far along the run is".</p>

<p>You can also spend coins at a revive machine to bring back dead players, but the cost will increase every time you do so, so make sure you consider carefully whether or not it's worth bringing back your friends.</p>

<p>Mods will be disabled online, and you also won't be able to unlock achievements in online play if you join mid-run (although joining at the very start of a run will be fine).</p>

<p>Pay no mind to the "beta" tag attached to this update; Nicalis says it's a "full-featured release", but that the beta tag has been attached because the studio is "still looking to refine things and squash any remaining bugs".</p>




<p>As well as online co-op, this update also brings a veritable treasure trove of item buffs and reworks for solo players, as well as a number of fixes that should make your&nbsp;<em>Binding of Isaac&nbsp;</em>experience a bit smoother. You can read <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/250900/view/7119722540407193807" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the full patch notes here</a> if you want to.</p>

<p>The Repentance+ update is available right now, but you'll need all of the game's previous DLC to run it. That includes&nbsp;<em>Rebirth</em>, as well as its&nbsp;<em>Afterbirth&nbsp;</em>DLC and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/binding-of-isaac-rebirth-repentance-update-is-its-biggest-yet" rel="nofollow">original Repentance update</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/farming-simulator-25-sales-2-million-one-week<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Giants Software has revealed that&nbsp;<em>Farming Simulator 25&nbsp;</em>hit a very impressive sales milestone within its first week on release, demonstrating (if demonstration were truly needed) the staying power of the long-running franchise.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Farming Simulator 25&nbsp;</em>managed to sell two million copies <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/farming-simulator-25-announced-november" rel="nofollow">inside a week</a>. Not only that, but the game's concurrent Steam <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2300320/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">player count record</a> is at 135,970 at time of writing, with a 24-hour peak of 114,176.</p>

<p>By contrast,&nbsp;<em>Farming Simulator 22</em>, the previous mainline entry in the series, has an <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1248130/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">all-time player count record of 105,636</a> on Steam, so it looks like the new game has comfortably beaten its predecessor, which will likely come as a relief to Giants.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/farming-simulator-25-sales-vehicle.jpg?itok=MXShq8QN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/farming-simulator-25-sales-vehicle.jpg?itok=q54NeWR6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Farming Simulator 25&nbsp;</em>has managed an impressive sales performance in its first week.</figcaption></figure><p>What's more, according to the aforementioned press release,&nbsp;<em>Farming Simulator 25&nbsp;</em>has broken&nbsp;<em>Farming Simulator 22</em>'s sales record of 1.5 million copies in its first week, so the new kid on the block really has triumphed over the old hand.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Farming Simulator 25</em>, well, I'm sure you can work out what we're dealing with here, but just in case, it's...well...a farming simulator.</p>

<p>Created by Giants Software, a studio that's pretty much known for this franchise and not a whole lot else,&nbsp;<em>Farming Simulator 25&nbsp;</em>introduces East Asian landscapes to the series, allowing you to farm rice paddies, sell your goods to neon-drenched port cities, and more.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to new weather patterns like hail and twisters, forcing you to change up your farming strategy in response to extreme weather (a challenge that I'm sure real-life farmers are also having to grapple with more and more these days).</p>




<p>You can pick up&nbsp;<em>Farming Simulator 25&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2300320/Farming_Simulator_25/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/farming-simulator-25/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/farming-simulator-25/9nmcdq6rcjkh" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things&nbsp;<em>Farming Simulator</em>-related.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alan-wake-2-sales-control-2-action-rpg</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/alan-wake-2-sales-hit-1-8m-new-control-2-direction-revealed.1039449/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alan-wake-2-sales-control-2-action-rpg<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remedy has revealed that&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</em>sales have almost hit the two million mark since its release last year, and the studio has also unveiled some more info about an interesting new direction in which&nbsp;<em>Control 2&nbsp;</em>is headed.</p>

<p>Speaking to investors <a href="https://x.com/remedygames/status/1858851495493403094" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on its recent Capital Markets day</a>, Remedy revealed that&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alan-wake-2-has-been-slightly-delayed" rel="nofollow">released in October last year</a>, has reached "over" 1.8 million sales, although the company doesn't give an exact figure. By contrast,&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake: Remastered&nbsp;</em>apparently sold around 1.7 million copies.</p>

<p>Last we heard,&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</em>had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-q3-financials-alan-wake-2" rel="nofollow">almost recouped its development and marketing costs</a>. Presumably, this is still the case, as if the game had done so since that announcement, it's likely Remedy would have told its investors.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/alan-wake-2-sales-control-2-rpg-saga.jpg?itok=wvtB6L7N 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/alan-wake-2-sales-control-2-rpg-saga.jpg?itok=dSndfuWZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</em>has hit 1.8 million sales since its release last year, Remedy has revealed.</figcaption></figure><p>Given that&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</em>had sold 1.3 million copies <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alan-wake-2-sales" rel="nofollow">back in February</a>&nbsp;(apparently making it the fastest-selling Remedy game thus far), that means a further half a million copies have been sold since that point, which isn't too bad for a game that is, in the end, fairly niche.</p>

<p>Remedy also had some info to share about the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Control 2</em>&nbsp;on its Capital Markets day. The game, which will be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-annapurna-control-2-tv-movies" rel="nofollow">produced in conjunction with Annapurna</a>, will apparently be "an action RPG".</p>

<p>It's worth saying that the phrase "action RPG" is a fairly broad one; this could mean pretty much anything from a light leveling system all the way through to a full looter-shooter framework, so we'll have to wait and see exactly what Remedy means by that.</p>

<p>However, it does represent a shift in direction from the original&nbsp;<em>Control</em>, which is perhaps best described as an action-adventure game tinged with Metroidvania elements.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/control-2-action-rpg-original-control.jpg?itok=ssxjKL7A 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/control-2-action-rpg-original-control.jpg?itok=pTFbYKoa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Control 2&nbsp;</em>will head in a more RPG-ward direction than its predecessor.</figcaption></figure><p>What's more, a free update for the original&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em>is coming in early 2025, and it will unlock "some previously released content", although Remedy doesn't specify exactly what that content might be. Better watch out for that one, I suppose.</p>

<p>As a reminder, we still don't have a release date for&nbsp;<em>Control 2</em>, nor do we know exactly when the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fbc-firebreak-control-spinoff-announced" rel="nofollow">recently-announced multiplayer spinoff&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fbc-firebreak-control-spinoff-announced" rel="nofollow">FBC: Firebreak</a>&nbsp;</em>will be arriving.</p>

<p>Remedy did, however, reveal the kind of budget&nbsp;<em>Control 2</em>&nbsp;has, suggesting that as a triple-A action RPG, it has a budget somewhere in the realm of&nbsp;€50 million.&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>, meanwhile, as a "mid-price" multiplayer title, has a more modest&nbsp;€30m budget.</p>

<p>According to Remedy,&nbsp;<em>Control 2&nbsp;</em>would need to sell around three to four million copies across its lifetime to guarantee a 100% return on investment, while&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>would need to rack up about three million. Whether or not that's realistic, we'll have to wait and see.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Real-Life Minecraft Immersive Attractions Announced by Legoland Company]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/minecraft-attractions-merlin-entertainments</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/real-life-minecraft-immersive-attractions-announced-by-legoland-company.1039446/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/minecraft-attractions-merlin-entertainments<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Legoland parent company Merlin Entertainments has announced a series of real-life immersive&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>attractions, with the first set to debut in the UK and US sometime between 2026 and 2027.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://www.merlinentertainments.biz/newsroom/news-releases/2024/merlin-minecraft-in-real-life/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an official announcement</a> on the Merlin Entertainments website, the attractions will involve "<em>Minecraft</em>-themed guest accommodation, retail, and food &amp; beverage", as well as "a&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>-themed ride" at existing Merlin locations in both countries.</p>

<p>In the long term, Merlin says it intends to extend these experiences to other countries as well, but they'll just be in Merlin locations in the US and UK to start with.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/minecraft-attractions-merlin-entertainments-village.jpg?itok=1S9kkGKx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/minecraft-attractions-merlin-entertainments-village.jpg?itok=0xX1eR7J 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You could be visiting this&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>attraction (or something like this mockup, anyway) sometime in the future.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as the experiences themselves, Merlin says it'll be introducing "touchpoints" that you can use to augment your&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>experience and add "exclusive in-game content".</p>

<p>The rides and experiences will be costing Merlin somewhere in the region of $110 million to start with, and that number will obviously climb as more rides and&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>attractions are introduced around the world.</p>

<p>We're a long way away from the&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>theme park map that was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/minecraft-theme-park-map-released-as-part-of-10-year-anniversary-celebration" rel="nofollow">created as part of the game's 10th anniversary celebrations</a> back in 2019; these are proper, physical&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>experiences you'll be able to enjoy at actual brick-and-mortar Merlin locations.</p>

<p>Naturally, Merlin hasn't announced exactly what the attractions will be yet, nor when they'll actually be arriving. It's likely we'll be waiting a little while for that info, since the rollout is at least a year and a half or so away.</p>




<p>It's quite possible the&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>experiences will find their home in Merlin's Legoland; after all, you can't say that doesn't make a lot of sense.</p>

<p>However, Merlin also owns the likes of Alton Towers, Thorpe Park, and Chessington, all of which are very popular UK theme park destinations, so the rides could be appearing in those locations, too.</p>

<p>Given that Legoland has US locations in New York and California, though, my money's on there for the inaugural&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>attraction rollout. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>
