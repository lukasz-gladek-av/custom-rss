            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Splatoon 3 </em>is getting a major update later this week, and if you thought Update 11.0.0 would just be bringing insubstantial quality-of-life improvements, think again, because some pretty major gameplay changes are coming.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/News/2026/January/What-s-new-in-the-Splatoon-3-Version-11-0-0-update-3011546.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">news post</a> on the official Nintendo website, the company reveals that <em>Splatoon 3 </em>Update 11.0.0, which is set to arrive on January 29th (that's this Thursday at time of writing), will introduce "new mechanics and other changes to freshen things up in the Splatlands".</p><p>First up, the update will add a new system called Flow Aura, which is essentially a killstreak system. Racking up splats in quick succession will put you in the Flow Aura state, which will increase your speed and defense, and you can keep this state going by scoring more splats or assists.</p><figure role="group">

<p>To help you work out how close you might be to a KO in <em>Splatoon 3</em>, the new update will also make enemy health bars visible, although the bar will only show when an enemy has just been hit. You won't be able to see it if they're in cover or if they've jumped into their ink (short of certain specials).</p><p><em>Splatoon 3</em>'s hitboxes are also being adjusted to compensate for players' increased expertise with motion controls; landing a shot on an opponent in swim form will be harder, but attacks are easier to land on enemies in kid form with certain weapons.</p><p>If you'd like to see exactly what's changing, you can check out the full patch notes for <em>Splatoon 3 </em>Update 11.0.0 <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Support/Nintendo-Switch/Game-Updates/How-to-Update-Splatoon-3-2266003.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">right here</a>. The list has some fairly straightforward quality-of-life tweaks alongside the flashier stuff.</p>
