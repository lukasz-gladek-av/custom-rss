            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/apple-games-revealed-fall<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Apple has officially revealed its new Apple Games app, which the Cupertino tech giant says is intended to become "a dedicated destination for people who love playing games on their Apple devices".</p>

<p>The app was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/apple-gaming-acquisition-rac7" rel="nofollow">reported to be in development by Bloomberg</a> earlier this year, but in a new <a href="https://developer.apple.com/games-app/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>, Apple confirms that the Apple Games app is available now in developer beta, with all iOS, iPadOS, and macOS users getting the new app this fall.</p>

<p>Apple Games will consist of five distinct tabs: Home, Play Together, Arcade, Library, and Search. Home shows things like highlights, "personalized recommendations", and "editorial selections", as well as friend activity and other game-related info.</p>

<p>Finally, your Library tab collects all of your games in one place, and the Search tab lets you look for specific games, collections, or charts. It's all pretty self-explanatory stuff, really.</p>

<p>With Apple Games, it looks as though Apple wants to create a unified hub for all things gaming on your iOS or macOS device, so if you're the kind of person who routinely whips out your phone for a quick go on an Apple Arcade game, this app is for you.</p>

<p>We don't have a release date for Apple Games yet, but it's likely that it'll roll out alongside iOS, macOS, and iPadOS 26, so whenever that major update for your device's operating system arrives, that's also when you'll be able to check out Apple Games.</p>

Could this all culminate in the release of a dedicated Apple gaming console? Probably not, but we can dream, right?</p>

<p>In other Apple-related gaming news, Epic's battle royale game&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-ios-app-store-returns" rel="nofollow">finally restored to iOS devices</a> last month following a protracted spat between the two companies. Epic previously alleged that Apple blocked the release of&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>on its devices, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-offline-worldwide-ios-apple-block" rel="nofollow">causing a worldwide outage</a>.</p>
