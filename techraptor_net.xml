            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-squid-game-crossover<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Activision Blizzard has announced a&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty Squid Game&nbsp;</em>crossover for January, and if that one was on your bingo card, then I'm going to need you to tell me where you get your bingo cards from.</p>

<p>We don't know too much about the crossover yet; it's presumably set to coincide with the start of&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6</em>'s Season 2, so we likely won't learn more until we're just a couple of weeks away from that season's commencement.</p>

<p>However, we do know that the worlds of&nbsp;<em>Squid Game&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>will collide in some way. Presumably,&nbsp;<em>Squid Game&nbsp;</em>will worm its way into both&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Warzone</em>, but we'll have to wait and see.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-duty-squid-game-paper.jpg?itok=qpX5rIBU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/call-of-duty-squid-game-paper.jpg?itok=fqCLmqDW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The worlds of&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Squid Game&nbsp;</em>are about to collide.</figcaption></figure><p>In the very brief teaser trailer released earlier today, a soldier walks into a room and sees two other soldiers on the floor, presumably dead.</p>

<p>Between the soldiers' bodies, he sees a small piece of paper, which he picks up. On that paper are three symbols: a circle, a triangle, and a square. They're not PlayStation symbols, though; they're the distinctive&nbsp;<em>Squid Game&nbsp;</em>shapes that appear on workers' masks in the show.</p>

<p>We then cut to a rather clever variation on the&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>logo that includes the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Squid Game&nbsp;</em>symbols. It's really not much to go on, but hey, if you're a&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>fan, you can have some fun theorizing what the crossover might entail before it lands.</p>




<p>This is, of course, far from&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em>'s first weird crossover. The franchise has previously entertained the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shredder-from-tmnt-stalks-into-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-warzone-2" rel="nofollow"><em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em>' Shredder</a>, noted gamer fuels <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-teams-up-with-mt-dew-and-doritos-for-charity-and-loot" rel="nofollow">Mountain Dew and Doritos</a>, and other strange collaborations as guests.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>news, the franchise's latest game&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>apparently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-series-sales-black-ops-6-launch" rel="nofollow">enjoyed the biggest launch</a> the series has ever seen, helping to catapult&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>as a whole over the 500 million sales mark.</p>

<p>That's despite a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-paid-audio-option" rel="nofollow">rather dubious audio pack</a> announced prior to the game's launch, one that seemingly enhances in-game audio like gunshots and footsteps for players willing to fork out a little extra cash.</p>
