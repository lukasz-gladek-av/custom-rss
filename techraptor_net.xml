            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With <em>Battlefield 6</em> out now and doing quite well for itself in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/battlefield-6-multiplayer-preview-all-out-warfare-in-mirak-valley-and-operation" rel="nofollow">multiplayer</a> action sphere – as we detailed in our <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/battlefield-6-review-war-on-unprecedented-scale" rel="nofollow">full review</a> – it’s time to turn our attention towards what’s next for EA’s biggest game of the year. We’re just under a week away from Season 1. Launching on October 28 and across three phases over time in an effort to bring high-quality content to players at regular intervals.</p>

<p>The first phase of content will open with Rogue Ops, which includes a new map known as Blackwell Fields, and a new 4v4 mode called Strikepoint. In the second phase, starting on November 18, we’ll see California Resistance and the addition of another new map called Eastwood.</p>

<p>Then, on December 9, Winter Offensive will begin with a seasonal update to the existing Empire State map.</p>

All of this content is being promised for free from the start, or is earnable on free tiers in the Battle Pass.</p>

<p>Digging into Rogue Ops specifically, it’s themed around high-stakes ops in pursuit of military secrets in the first all-new map: Blackwell Fields. While it’s a large map set in the Californian Chaparral and built for all-out warfare, there’s a good amount of structures that lean heavily into standoff with outdoor combat.</p>

<p>We got to try out this map in the Close-Quarters Battle mode, which meant smaller team sizes and up close and personal fights. Right away, it’s easy to see why this map is ideal for the selected mode.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can duck in and out of military installations and homesteads scattered across the land. Everything is dusty and dirty, and fires scatter the area, which makes it harder to see clearly in some aspects.</p>

There’s also the Glock 22 and the Mini Fix Bolt-Action rifle for long-distance attacks.</p>

<p>There’s also a new vehicle available – an APC called the Traverser Mark 2, which operates as an Infantry Support vehicle that offers up a spawn point and a supply station or other vehicles on your team. Rogue Ops and the Blackwell Fields map will run from October 28 to November 11, with Phase 2 to follow.</p>

<p>California Resistance is an apt name for the next round of Season 1 because it further explores another area of the region where both NATO and the local militia are trying to defend California from PAX’s incursion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The map coming up here is called Eastwood, is set in a quiet and upscale Southern California neighborhood – well, formerly quiet because now there’s a warzone running through it, and every part of it can be chaotic but also used to your advantage.</p>

<p>Trying out the All-Out-Warfare mode, it’s easy to see how this area has become a complete battlefield, and you’ll be fighting in and around houses, blowing them apart, and riding around in tanks and other vehicles to add to the destruction.</p>

Attackers and defenders will swap sides after each round to mix things up, and destroying the most caches will net a win for the match.</p>

<p>Battle Pickups will also debut during this phase, which are high-value, rare weapons with limited ammunition but can do major damage to enemies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>New weapons will include the DP-12 shotgun, which has different ammo types in each of its tubes, and the 8-shot S&amp;W M327 revolver.</p>

<p>Phase 3 of the season will turn towards winter, and while details remain sparse for now, it’ll launch ahead of the holidays with a winter-themed Empire State map. Following that, players can expect Season 2 to drop within the new year.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Marvel Cosmic Invasion Release Date Confirmed for December]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Dotemu and developer Tribute Games have announced the release date for their upcoming star-studded superhero brawler&nbsp;<em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em>, and it won't be long before you get to check it out.</p>

<p>As revealed in a press release,&nbsp;<em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em>, which was first announced as part of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-march-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Direct show earlier this year</a>, will be launching across PC and consoles on December 1st.</p>

<p>Not only that, but the two studios have also announced the two final characters to round out the game's 15-fighter-strong roster: Phoenix and Invincible Iron Man. They join a lineup that also includes iconic characters like Venom, Spider-Man, Storm, and Wolverine.</p>

<p>Published by&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/absolum-200k-sales" rel="nofollow"><em>Absolum&nbsp;</em>outfit Dotemu</a>,&nbsp;<em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion&nbsp;</em>sees Marvel heroes banding together to fight the villainous Annihilus (the clue's in the name, I suppose), who's "launched an unprecedented attack across the galaxy".</p>

<p>You'll choose a team of two Marvel heroes, swapping between them as necessary and creating "unique team-ups" to deal "devastating damage" to your foes.</p>

<p><em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion&nbsp;</em>supports co-op play for up to four players, and you can play either locally or online. Drop-in-drop-out co-op is supported as well, so if you can't enjoy the entire adventure alongside the same people, it's no big deal.</p>




<p>Each player chooses their own team of two heroes, too, so you may well have up to eight heroes battling through the streets of New York towards the sinister-sounding Negative Zone to defeat Annihilus.</p>

<p><em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion&nbsp;</em>launches across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2753970/MARVEL_Cosmic_Invasion/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012545" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/marvel-cosmic-invasion/9n79tqtztqq4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and Nintendo Switch (although not for Switch 2, it seems) on December 1st. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>
