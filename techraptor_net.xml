            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warner-bros-games-david-haddad-stepping-down<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Warner Bros. Games head David Haddad is to leave his position after 12 years, according to a new report. His successor has not yet been appointed.</p>

<p>According to a Variety <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/warner-bros-games-chief-david-haddad-exit-1236283177/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, Haddad plans to stay on with Warner Bros. Games for a three-month period while the company searches for a successor. He'll also be helping to oversee the transition to said successor, which is pretty standard behavior for departing corporate execs.</p>

<p>Streaming and games head JB Perrette says Haddad's departure comes at a time when the company's "release schedule is lighter", which, Perrette says, will help "minimize disruption" and allow the WB Games team to "smoothly prepare for its next record-breaking title".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warner-bros-games-david-haddad-suicide-squad.jpg?itok=8nNMI2tm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warner-bros-games-david-haddad-suicide-squad.jpg?itok=cOthYWxV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>David Haddad, who oversaw the release of games like&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&nbsp;</em>during his tenure, is leaving Warner Bros. Games.</figcaption></figure><p>Later today, Perrette and Haddad will hold a town hall meeting to brief WB Games employees on Haddad's decision and provide additional information.</p>

<p>Variety, citing a source "close to the situation", says that there aren't any plans for the wider Warner Bros. to sell off its gaming division, and that the goal is to focus on finding a replacement for Haddad.</p>

<p>Unlike <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/plaion-koch-media-ceo-stepping-down" rel="nofollow">other execs</a> who have recently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/insomniac-ceo-founder-ted-price-steps-down" rel="nofollow">departed their companies</a>, Haddad won't be retiring full stop; he says he's looking forward to the "next chapter" of his career and that he will continue to enthusiastically support the studio's future work.</p>

<p>While Haddad's departure may have been voluntary, he and WB Games haven't had the best year on the whole. February's&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&nbsp;</em>served as the company's flagship title for the year, but it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-kill-justice-leagues-sales-disappointed-hogwarts-legacy-is-big-win" rel="nofollow">performed disastrously</a>, contributing to a massive writedown for Warner Bros.</p>

<p><em>Suicide Squad&nbsp;</em>wasn't the only failure for Warner Bros. this year, either; the full release of fighting game&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus&nbsp;</em>also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-flop-warner-bros-100m" rel="nofollow">proved a disastrous flop</a>, costing the company $100 million.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hogwarts-legacy-warner-bros-games-david-haddad.jpg?itok=f9_zYjwX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hogwarts-legacy-warner-bros-games-david-haddad.jpg?itok=XxdEgnYI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Haddad also oversaw successes like&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Suicide Squad</em> and&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus</em>&nbsp;may have been a failure (and one that reportedly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rocksteady-layoffs-end-of-2024" rel="nofollow">contributed to layoffs</a> at developer Rocksteady), but Haddad also oversaw massive successes at WB Games during his tenure.</p>

<p>Wizarding World RPG&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>has proven an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-sales-30m" rel="nofollow">enduring commercial hit</a> for the company, and it was also revealed recently that fighting game&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1&nbsp;</em>has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortal-kombat-1-sales" rel="nofollow">passed the five million sales mark</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Aggregation Platform CriticDB Wants to Go "Beyond Traditional Aggregation"]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/criticdb-announced-beyond-traditional-aggregation</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-aggregation-platform-criticdb-wants-to-go-beyond-traditional-aggregation.1089954/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/criticdb-announced-beyond-traditional-aggregation<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>TechRaptor's very own Rutledge Daugette, along with several other members of the editorial team at our lovely little site, have announced CriticDB, a brand new review aggregator site that plans to "go beyond" traditional aggregation.</p>

<p>Rutledge describes <a href="https://criticdb.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">CriticDB</a> as a "new video game review aggregation and game discovery platform". As you've probably guessed from that, it'll aim not only to aggregate professional reviews, but also to help you find games you might have missed.</p>

<p>At launch, the site will aggregate over 75 outlets' reviews (and that includes us here at TechRaptor, of course), and the team anticipates it will launch with more than 20,000 reviews across over 2,000 game pages.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/criticdb-game-page-lies-of-p.jpg?itok=quPyEsCI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/criticdb-game-page-lies-of-p.jpg?itok=sepylObG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll be able to check out over 2,000 game pages at launch on CriticDB.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Rutledge's brief, CriticDB puts three pillars at the center of its mission:</p>

<ul><li>Collecting reviews and previews from around the web</li>
	<li>Connecting gamers with games they might have missed</li>
	<li>Helping outlets and PR to connect more easily</li>
</ul><p>Rutledge also says he wants the site to be a "positive force in the industry", highlighting "great work and games" that may otherwise go unnoticed. The site is also geared towards its users; the point is to create a "community-driven" platform.</p>

<p>On CriticDB, you'll be able to browse professional and user reviews (although Rutledge says user reviews will only be submittable by those who subscribe to the paid Pro user tier), follow outlets and creators, and create lists with various different parameters.</p>

<p>Those lists include favorites, wishlists, and even played and beaten games, so it looks like CriticDB might also be gunning for the crowns of the likes of Backloggd.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/criticdb-search-function-insert.jpg?itok=69Dilk6P 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/criticdb-search-function-insert.jpg?itok=Gk88Z9KE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>CriticDB will feature a robust search function as well as plenty of user-centric features.</figcaption></figure><p>CriticDB users can create game pages for titles that are missing from the site's database, and they can also create links between similar games, helping other users to find games in their niche. Leaderboards will be available for users who create and link the most games, too.</p>

<p>Game pages consist of info like game release dates, listings for developers and publishers, and genres, as well as which platforms you can play the game on. Naturally, you'll also find CriticDB's signature "similar games" list, which will, if all goes well, have been at least partially curated by the site's community.</p>

<p>If you've ever found yourself wanting to find certain outlets, such as minority-owned platforms or independent sites, CriticDB will feature outlet tags to let you search for specific terms as well.</p>

<p>When it comes to the platform's future, Rutledge says the new site has a "robust roadmap" through which it will "expand...its features" throughout 2025. Some of the features coming to the platform include the following:</p>

<ul><li>An XP system and&nbsp;badges for profiles</li>
	<li>Outlet and&nbsp;author following</li>
	<li>On-site notifications for new releases of your wishlisted games and&nbsp;more</li>
</ul><p>If you're an outlet or a creator, you can also apply to be included on the platform when the <a href="https://criticdb.com/" rel="nofollow">review aggregation platform</a> launches on January 30th, so make sure you add it to your bookmarks for then.</p>

<hr><p><em>Disclosure: CriticDB was created and is run by several members of the TechRaptor editorial team.</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-circana-us-sales-data-reveals-2024s-top-selling-games.1089882/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/circana-us-sales-data-2024-top-selling-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>US sales analysis group Circana has released its gaming industry sales data for 2024 as a whole, and you'll never guess which of the year's biggest releases topped the charts.</p>

<p>As ever, this data comes from Circana's Mat Piscatella on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lgg2dhbzzk2n" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>, and it crowns none other than&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>as the year's best-selling title.</p>

<p>That's not surprising given that Microsoft has called&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6</em>'s launch <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-series-sales-black-ops-6-launch" rel="nofollow">the franchise's biggest yet</a>, but it will probably come as something of a relief given that the game was also made available <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-will-be-on-game-pass-day-1" rel="nofollow">on Game Pass on day one</a>. Looks like that decision didn't do much to dampen its sales.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-selling-game-us-sales-data-circana.jpg?itok=dA1uCHGo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-selling-game-us-sales-data-circana.jpg?itok=f442NDfx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>has, perhaps unsurprisingly, taken the crown of 2024's best-selling game in the US.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Black Ops 6</em>'s performance will also doubtless come as a relief to Microsoft and Activision given how much the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ballooning-call-of-duty-budgets" rel="nofollow">series' budgets appear to have ballooned</a> in recent years;&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>really is too big to fail, so it'll be reassuring that this one didn't.</p>

<p>In second place on the all-format sales chart, it's&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25</em>, which, again, won't come as much of a surprise given that the game recently swiped the crown of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-sports-college-football-25-best-selling-sports-game" rel="nofollow">best-selling sports game in US history</a>.</p>

<p><em>Helldivers 2</em>, which was sitting at <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-financials-helldivers-2-sales" rel="nofollow">12 million sales at last count</a>, takes third place, while the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-sales-3m" rel="nofollow">hugely successful</a>&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>takes fourth place.&nbsp;<em>NBA 2K25&nbsp;</em>is in fifth.</p>

<p>In terms of platform-specific charts, it's a tussle between&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25&nbsp;</em>for PlayStation and Xbox, with&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>topping <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lgg2djbuyk2n" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Sony's chart</a> and&nbsp;<em>College Football&nbsp;</em>reaching number one on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lgg2dkxnp22n" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Microsoft's</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ea-sports-college-football-25-circana-us-sales-data.jpg?itok=Bn96CzFP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ea-sports-college-football-25-circana-us-sales-data.jpg?itok=DUTTzKXX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>EA Sports College Football 25&nbsp;</em>has sold remarkably well.</figcaption></figure><p>Since neither game was released on the Nintendo Switch, it probably won't come as a surprise to learn that both&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>College Football 25&nbsp;</em>are completely absent from Nintendo's table.</p>

<p>Instead, it's topped by&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em>, with&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&nbsp;</em>taking up second place and&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>in third.&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart&nbsp;</em>really is unstoppable, eh?</p>

<p>You can check out Piscatella's full Bluesky thread, which begins with data specific to December 2024 then widens up to encapsulate the whole year, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lgg2ddgpqc2n" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>. As always, it's worth a look if you're a numbers nerd!</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-records-bloom-rage-part-2-delayed</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dont-nods-lost-records-bloom-rage-part-2-delayed-by-a-month.1089879/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-records-bloom-rage-part-2-delayed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Don't Nod has delayed the second part of upcoming adventure game <i>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</i>. The game's second chapter is now set to launch around a month later than its originally-intended release date.</p>

<p>In an FAQ answering questions about&nbsp;<em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</em>, Don't Nod says the delay was put into effect in order to give the devs time to "refine the experience, address more bugs, and enhance the storytelling". It sounds like the usual delay reasoning, by and large.</p>

<p>The studio says that it's "confident" the delay will allow it to "provide you with a richer experience", and that it has "a little something up [its sleeve] on social media to keep you entertained in the time between the two Tapes" (i.e. chapters).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dont-nod-lost-records-bloom-rage-second-part-delayed.jpg?itok=MXcUjlpo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dont-nod-lost-records-bloom-rage-second-part-delayed.jpg?itok=v_Hv5wXx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</em>'s second part will be delayed by around a month.</figcaption></figure><p>The second part of&nbsp;<em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</em>, which is also known as "Rage",&nbsp;is now set to arrive on April 15th. This delay won't affect the first part (also known, surprisingly enough, as "Bloom"), which is still set to launch on February 18th.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage&nbsp;</em>is, Don't Nod's FAQ explains it pretty succinctly: it's a "single-player experience focused on narrative exploration" that revolves around four friends confronting the dark secrets of something that happened to them 27 years ago.</p>

<p>You'll be able to navigate between the 1995 and 2022 timelines and "shape both narratives" as you go, uncovering the truth of the sleepy Michigan town of Velvet Cove and what may or may not lie beneath its surface (spoilers, though: something definitely does).</p>




<p>This isn't the first time the game has been delayed in some form or another. <em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage&nbsp;</em>was originally set for release in 2024, but back in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-records-bloom-and-rage-delay" rel="nofollow">June last year</a>, Don't Nod pushed its launch back to 2025.</p>

<p>The studio will no doubt be banking on&nbsp;<em>Lost Records</em>' success for two reasons: to offset the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-nod-financials-first-half-2024" rel="nofollow">recent underperformance</a> of some of its games and to launch what is supposed to be a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-records-bloom-and-rage-by-life-is-strange-devs-is-first-game-in-much-larger" rel="nofollow">wider universe of interconnected media</a>.</p>

<p><em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage&nbsp;</em>will launch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1902960/Lost_Records_Bloom__Rage/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/lost-records-bloom-and-rage/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/lost-records-bloom-rage/9n3f1lw9hc6c" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. The first part is due to arrive on February 18th, and the second will be released on April 15th.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/earthblade-canceled-celeste-devs</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/celeste-devs-cancel-next-game-earthblade-due-to-studio-disagreement.1089843/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/earthblade-canceled-celeste-devs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Celeste&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Towerfall&nbsp;</em>studio Extremely OK Games has revealed that its ambitious Metroidvania platformer&nbsp;<em>Earthblade&nbsp;</em>has been canceled owing to an internal studio dispute.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://exok.com/posts/2025-01-22-earthblade-final-update/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the official EXOK website titled "Final&nbsp;<em>Earthblade&nbsp;</em>Update" (just in case you weren't absolutely sure the game was done), the studio describes the cancellation as "a huge, heartbreaking, and yet relieving failure". EXOK head Maddy Thorson says the decision to cancel was actually made in December.</p>

<p>According to Thorson, a "fracture" began forming in 2024, with her and coworker Noel Berry on one side and art director Pedro Medeiros on another. Specifically, the dispute revolved around "the IP rights of&nbsp;<em>Celeste</em>", and it's a dispute Thorson says she "won't be detailing publicly".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/earthblade-canceled-celeste-developers-platforming.jpg?itok=VVIxJQhI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/earthblade-canceled-celeste-developers-platforming.jpg?itok=MB3WBn6G 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ambitious-looking Metroidvania&nbsp;<em>Earthblade&nbsp;</em>has been canceled.</figcaption></figure><p>The dispute, which Thorson calls "a very difficult and heartbreaking process", was eventually resolved, but she and Berry eventually agreed to go their separate ways with Medeiros, who originally announced his departure from EXOK <a href="https://x.com/saint11/status/1857481536335131092" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">back in November</a>.</p>

<p>Thorson says that the dispute with Medeiros caused her and Berry to take a look at&nbsp;<em>Earthblade&nbsp;</em>and ask themselves whether continuing its development would be "worth the pain". Together, they concluded that working on the game had become "exhausting", leading them to "admit defeat".</p>

<p>She also goes on to say that fans shouldn't blame Medeiros, and that he and the team on his game&nbsp;<em>Neverway&nbsp;</em>"aren't the enemy". Treating them as such will make you unwelcome "in any EXOK community", she says.</p>




<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Earthblade&nbsp;</em>is (or was), it was an exploration-based action platformer that would have offered "seamless exploration, challenging combat, and countless mysteries to pick apart".</p>

<p>Originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/earthblade-revealed-as-new-game-from-celeste-developers" rel="nofollow">revealed in 2021</a>, EXOK announced in early 2024 that&nbsp;<em>Earthblade&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/celeste-creator-earthblade-delayed" rel="nofollow">wouldn't be coming out that year</a>. It's very likely the studio had already begun to grapple with the problems that would cause the game's cancellation even then.</p>

<p>As for what's next for EXOK, Thorson says the goal now is to "wipe the slate clean" and to "refocus...back to smaller-scale projects". We'll have to wait and see where that goes in future.</p>
