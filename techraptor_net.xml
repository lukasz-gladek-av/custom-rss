            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-howl-soulslike-deckbuilder-11-bit<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>publisher 11 bit studios has announced&nbsp;<em>Death Howl</em>, a "Soulslike deckbuilder" which marries a gloomy atmosphere with run-based gameplay and card crafting.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Death Howl&nbsp;</em>promises "grid-based, turn-driven battles" that will demand "tactical precision" from you. In addition, you'll be battling "formidable enemies and fearsome bosses" which you'll need to build tactically sound decks to surmount.</p>

<p>The game will offer the chance to explore a grim open world in which you'll find biomes like the "Meadows of Delusion" or the "Forest of Howling Shadows". It's safe to say this isn't the kind of game you should play if you're looking for a cozy atmosphere.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/death-howl-soulslike-deckbuilder-combat.jpg?itok=7q2w-dbK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/death-howl-soulslike-deckbuilder-combat.jpg?itok=kUPb82Jc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Death Howl&nbsp;</em>marries Soulslike atmosphere with deckbuilding gameplay.</figcaption></figure><p>As you explore each of&nbsp;<em>Death Howl</em>'s regions, you'll unlock new cards to craft, and you'll also be able to piece together elements of protagonist Ro's backstory, which the devs say is "steeped in themes of love and loss".</p>

<p>Each realm you visit will present you with different challenges, necessitating the construction of various different deck types in order to overcome those challenges. You'll also be given the chance to use "shamanic totems" to deepen&nbsp;<em>Death Howl</em>'s "strategic layer" in order to expand your options.</p>

<p><em>Death Howl&nbsp;</em>comes to us from&nbsp;<em>Mind Scanners&nbsp;</em>developer The Outer Zone, a three-person-strong studio based in Copenhagen. Director&nbsp;Malte Burup describes the game as a "fresh take" on deckbuilders, something I think will probably be needed given the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/breachway-release-date" rel="nofollow">crowded market</a> into which&nbsp;<em>Death Howl&nbsp;</em>is <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/slay-spire" rel="nofollow">hurling itself</a>.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Death Howl</em>, which gives a sense of the kind of hopeless atmosphere and turn-based deckbuilding gameplay the game is going for, right here.</p>




<p>I'm honestly not sure&nbsp;<em>Death Howl&nbsp;</em>is doing itself any favors by describing itself as a Soulslike; we are, after all, a million miles away from the kind of reflex-based stamina management-reliant combat for which the&nbsp;<em>Souls&nbsp;</em>games and their offshoots are known.</p>

<p>Still, you'll get the chance to find out whether I'm right or not on Monday, when a demo for the game will be made available via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2825880/Death_Howl/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>. The game will also be coming to <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/death_howl" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a>. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ace-combat-7-sales-6m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has announced that flight sim&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat 7&nbsp;</em>has reached a new sales milestone on the eve of the game's sixth anniversary.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/ace-combat/news/ace-combat-7-skies-unknown-reaches-6-million-units-sold-6th-anniversary" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">notice</a> on the game's official website,&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat 7&nbsp;</em>has officially reached the six million sales mark, which feels particularly appropriate given that the game is about to turn six years old. This latest figure was no doubt helped by&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat 7</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ace-combat-7-skies-unknown-deluxe-edition-announced-for-nintendo-switch" rel="nofollow">launch on Nintendo Switch last year</a>.</p>

<p>Back in November 2023, Bandai Namco revealed that the game had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ace-combat-7-skies-unknown-has-sold-5-million-copies" rel="nofollow">hit the five million sales milestone</a>, which means it's sold another million copies between then and now. It looks like&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat 7&nbsp;</em>is a nice and stable little earner for the studio.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ace-combat-7-sales-shooting.jpg?itok=NMZF7vtp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ace-combat-7-sales-shooting.jpg?itok=_lEw9UtD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Ace Combat 7&nbsp;</em>sales have topped six million.</figcaption></figure><p>Game producer Kazutoki Kono, who's well-known for his work on the&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat&nbsp;</em>franchise, said the milestone meant that his team had achieved its goal to "connect with as many people as possible" through the game. He also thanked everyone who bought&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat 7</em>, as well as those involved with its creation.</p>

<p>Also included in Bandai Namco's milestone announcement post are some digital wallpapers you can download if you want your love of&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat 7&nbsp;</em>to be reflected every time you're looking at your desktop. It's a pretty neat extra!</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat 7</em>, it's the latest major entry in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat&nbsp;</em>series, which began back in 1995 with the PlayStation flight sim&nbsp;<em>Air Combat&nbsp;</em>(released in Japan as&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat</em>).</p>




<p>After&nbsp;2014's&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat Infinity&nbsp;</em>took the series away from its fictional setting of Strangereal,&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat 7&nbsp;</em>returns to that world once again, telling the story of fighter pilot Trigger as he tries to clear his name of a murder he didn't commit.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat 7&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/502500/ACE_COMBAT_7_SKIES_UNKNOWN/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0700-CUSA05636_00-AC7STANDARDED000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 4</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/ace-combat-7-skies-unknown/BRVM8RNWLXH1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox One</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/ace-combat-7-skies-unknown-deluxe-edition-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> (and also on current-gen consoles thanks to backwards compatibility).

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/veilguard-director-corinne-busche-leaving-bioware<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>director Corinne Busche will depart BioWare, although it seems as though the studio won't be undergoing any other changes alongside her departure.</p>

<p>We don't know the exact reasons for Busche's departure, but according to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-game-director-leaving-bioware" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>, which also confirmed the news, the commercial performance of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>&nbsp;- which, as the publication notes, is rumored to be "decent" but modest - isn't a factor.</p>

<p>It's also not known whether or not Busche will be leaving EA as a whole, where she's worked for over 18 years, or whether she'll be moving to another department within the company.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-director-corinne-busche-leaving-bioware-emmrich.jpg?itok=DZ9qQ67o 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-director-corinne-busche-leaving-bioware-emmrich.jpg?itok=uo8k6jus 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>'s director Corinne Busche is to leave BioWare.</figcaption></figure><p>Although rumors were also swirling that BioWare Edmonton was to shut down, Eurogamer says it understands this isn't the case and that the studio will be "unaffected by any other changes".</p>

<p>Busche began her career with EA in 2006, where she's worked on a number of games, including titles in the&nbsp;<em>Sims&nbsp;</em>series. Per her own <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/corinnebusche/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">LinkedIn page</a>, she specializes in "systems, gameplay, and UX", so she's very much on the technical side of things.</p>

<p>Alongside longtime BioWare staffer John Epler, who's been with the studio for more than 18 years, Busche helmed the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-release-date-leaked-trailer" rel="nofollow">recently-released</a>&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, which "enjoyed" a protracted development cycle and went through several iterations before the version we know was released.</p>

<p>It's not clear what's next for Busche; since we're not sure whether she's still with EA or not, her name may pop up on a future project by the studio, or we may see her joining <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-bethesda-bioware-naughty-dog-near-studios-hawthorn" rel="nofollow">several</a> other <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-ea-staffers-three-thousands-studio" rel="nofollow">industry figures</a> who've <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-capcom-staffers-birdkin-hideaki-saori-utsumi" rel="nofollow">started their own studios</a>.</p>

Only time will tell.</figcaption></figure><p>Last September, we spoke to Busche about her work on&nbsp;<em>The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>and how the game handled player choice. I'd strongly recommend <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/veilguard-game-director-corinne-busche-on-player-choice-and-companion" rel="nofollow">giving that interview a read</a> if you want to know more about Busche and her approach to working on such a high-profile project.</p>

<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>itself, you can check it out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1845910/Dragon_Age_The_Veilguard/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/dragon-age-the-veilguard/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/dragon-age-the-veilguard/BSDX4FNNC0DK" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and our reviewer Erren <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/dragon-age-veilguard-review-homecoming" rel="nofollow">very much recommends that you do</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-live-service-games-canceled<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has canceled two more live service games that were in development at two of the company's internal studios, and one of them was reportedly based on&nbsp;<em>God of War</em>.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-16/sony-cancels-two-more-playstation-projects" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a>, live service projects in development at&nbsp;<em>Days Gone&nbsp;</em>developer Bend Studio and&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls&nbsp;</em>remake outfit Bluepoint have been shut down. According to a Bluesky <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lfvfm2febc2e" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> by Schreier, the game on which Bluepoint was working was a "live service&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>game".</p>

<p>Schreier then provides <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lfvguewrts2i" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">more context</a> regarding what Bluepoint has apparently been up to for the last couple of years. He says the studio was providing support for&nbsp;<em>God of War Ragnarok</em>'s development between 2020 and 2022 and that it then shifted to work on the aforementioned live service project.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/god-of-war-ragnarok-sony-live-service-cancellations.jpg?itok=J7jBtcDQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/god-of-war-ragnarok-sony-live-service-cancellations.jpg?itok=30Uzz2tQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bluepoint was apparently working on a&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>live service game, which has now been canceled.</figcaption></figure><p>In a statement to Bloomberg, Sony says it won't be closing down either Bend or Bluepoint, and says it's "working closely" with both studios in order to determine what their next projects will be.</p>

<p>According to Bloomberg's report, which cites an internal Sony memo seen by the publication, the tech giant will be doing everything it can to make sure the cancellations result in "minimal business impact". It's not clear whether the decision will result in layoffs or not.</p>

<h2>Sony's live service strategy continues to flounder</h2>

<p>Things aren't looking great for Sony on the live service front right now. In 2023, the company committed to releasing 12 live service games in the coming years, but that number was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-revised-its-live-service-ganes-plans-with-only-6-games-coming-by-fy-2025" rel="nofollow">then halved to six</a> by the 2025 fiscal year, with the other six under review.</p>

<p>Since those comments were made, Sony has released precisely one successful live service game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-financials-helldivers-2-sales" rel="nofollow">namely&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em></a>. The company has also suffered one of the most high-profile live service flops in history in the form of&nbsp;<em>Concord</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds" rel="nofollow">taken offline</a> just a couple of weeks after its initial launch.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-sony-live-service-cancellations.jpg?itok=kf-ahLNM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-sony-live-service-cancellations.jpg?itok=dVXjHcFk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>arguably remains Sony's sole live service success.</figcaption></figure><p>The cancellation of these two projects leaves the future of Sony's other live service experiments in doubt.</p>

<p>Currently, the publisher has three other live service games in development that we know of: Haven Studios'&nbsp;<em>Fairgame$</em>, Bungie's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-resurrects-marathon-playstation-showcase" rel="nofollow"><em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>reboot</a>, and an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/guerrilla-working-on-multiplayer-horizon-game" rel="nofollow">online multiplayer game</a> based on the&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>IP.</p>

<p>As far as we know, these projects aren't affected by the cancellation of Bluepoint and Bend's games, but it may well be that they, along with the embarrassment surrounding&nbsp;<em>Concord</em>, cause Sony to rethink its live service strategy entirely.</p>

<p>We know that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shuhei-yoshida-leaving-playstation" rel="nofollow">ex-PlayStation legend Shuhei Yoshida</a> isn't a fan of the live service direction; during a <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/shuhei-yoshida-resist-playstation-live-service-push/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">recent interview</a>, he suggested that he would have resisted Sony's live service push. It turns out he'd probably have been right to do so.</p>
