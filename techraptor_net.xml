Real-life messes are no fun, but for some reason, power-washing that house is just too satisfying. The upcoming&nbsp;<em>Ambrosia Sky</em>&nbsp;provides that same satisfaction, but with a deadly twist.</p>

<p>Indeed, usually nothing is fighting back against you as you clean, but in&nbsp;<em>Ambrosia Sky</em>, a deadly fungus seeks you out. A so-called first-person, immersive "clean 'em up" from developer Soft Rains,&nbsp;<em>Ambrosia Sky's&nbsp;</em>fungal foe is truly terrifying.</p>



<h2>It's Time for Cleanup&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Let's set the stage. It's far into the future and you're a "Scarab," essentially an undertaker that helps the deceased pass on. She's also something of a space "disaster specialist," armed with tools to clean up the contamination.</p>

<p>We begin the demo in a space station. The aim is to find a body and help it pass on, but this fungus is everywhere. Working our way through the space station, going past deadly fungus some of it is electric, and other variants literally&nbsp;<em>seek you out</em>.</p>



<p>This is where&nbsp;<em>Ambrosia Sky&nbsp;</em>really impressed me. This fungus is forming around you quickly, and it's so fast that you become surrounded. Just seeing this amalgamation build up around you is an impressive technical feat.</p>

<p>Not only that, it's how you can clean up this fungus that is equally impressive. Soft Rains has developed a technology called "Quantized Impact Field." It's a mouthful, but hey, it works quite well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The fungus are voxels, but the tech hides it very well. Cleaning the fungus with various sprays at your disposal break it down; in other words, volumetric cleaning.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Spray it All Away</h2>

<p>The sprayer you have is a cool tool. Like I said, cleaning is satisfying, and so is spraying down the fungus and having it crumble away. There are various sprays, like the basic, which is great for cleaning, but also others like fire and electric.</p>

<p>Fire can spread, by the way, and I haven't found a good use for it yet. Electric spray, on the other hand, allows players to activate doors without a direct line to power. Shoot spray at the top of the door and keep spraying until it hits an active power source, and there you go, it's on!</p>

<p>You can also change the nozzle, so the spray can go straight, vertical, or horizontal. In one segment, the gravity in the space station is turned off. Because of that, the spray no longer arcs due to gravity and allows you to clean all the more effectively.</p>



<h2><em>Ambrosia Sky</em> Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>It's also worth nothing, the developers aren't necessarily aiming for a highly detailed art style, but the Quantized Impact Field makes up for a lot of it. Combined with excellent use of lighting,&nbsp;<em>Ambrosia Sky</em>&nbsp;is a promising game.</p>

<p>While it'll likely take several more years to develop, a demo is available today on Steam, so if cleaning up some deadly shrooms tickles your fancy, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3716830/Ambrosia_Sky_Demo/" rel="nofollow">check it out</a>!</p>
