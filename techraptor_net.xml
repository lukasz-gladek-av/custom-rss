We got to hear about <em>Riftbound's </em>release plans, organized play strategy, and design principles as the "physical fandom expression of <em>League of Legends</em> for all fans out there."</p>

<p>If you're interested in learning what we thought about the game be sure to <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a63f9b90-cea7-4679-9c53-8cdd7c0159bd" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/riftbound-league-of-legends-tcg-mixes-fast-gameplay-consistent-resource-system" rel="nofollow">check out our preview</a>, if you're interested in learning a bit more about Deckbuilding you can check out the rules and styles of decks that will be available as part of Set One, and if you're a collector wondering what cards you'll want to be looking for be sure to check out our guide on the rarity of cards and the incredibly exclusive Overnumbered cards.</p>

<p>If you're interested in learning about the release of Set One, Origins, what it will take to make it to <em>Riftbound Worlds</em>, or what kinds of steps were taken during the development process then continue below.</p>

<p>Set one of <em>Riftbound </em>will be called <em>Origins</em>, this set is being designed as a warm welcome not only to fans of <em>League of Legends</em> and it's spin-off games and media, but also an introduction to TCG players, featuring Legends with a wide variety of mechanics.</p>

<p>Dave Guskin, Game Director for <em>Riftbound</em>, explained that while future Sets may have more theming that Origins is meant to be "good honest <em>Riftbound</em>… whatever that means."</p>

<p>While we at the event got our hands on the four Trial Decks there is a lot planned for the release including Booster Packs and Sets, a Proving Grounds 'board-game-like' experience for 2-4 players with everything you need to play, and three Champion Decks (<em>Riftbound's </em>version of a pre-con) featuring Jinx, Victor, and Lee Sin.</p>

<h2>The Road To Release</h2>

<p>Talking more about where <em>Riftbound </em>came from it was explained that while investigating ways to bring Legends of Runeterra to China they discovered that while bringing in a Video Game was difficult, that a physical TCG would be a completely different story.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riftbound-league-of-legends-tcg-conference-room.jpg?itok=-lD1m7Ep 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riftbound-league-of-legends-tcg-conference-room.jpg?itok=emEjnVTY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Once the basics of the gameplay had been ironed out it became very apparent, internally and externally, that <em>Riftbound </em>was a fun game that there was a desire to bring to a global audience. From there Riot Games was able to continue to develop <em>Riftbound </em>at a rapid pace, what helped even further was that they were able to leverage all of the art from Legends of Runeterra to feature on cards, allowing them to find a release pace that would be impossible otherwise.</p>

<p>While the core mechanics had been nailed down through pre-release events the team at Riot had continued to hear feedback that the art wasn't looking enough like something that shows off the flair of <em>Riftbound</em>.</p>

<p>With this feedback changes were implemented including a new design to make all of the cards look more recognizable from a distance and also add things like a border filigree that represents the rarity of a card or have artwork that 'breaks' out of the frame as they get rarer.</p>

<p>There was also an aim to appease to both Western and Eastern players where by "for the west [Riot] wanted everything to be clear, for the East [Riot] wanted to have full art and the flash."</p>

<ul><li aria-level="1">June 9th to July 18th - There will be a "spoiler season" where <em>Riftbound </em>cards will be getting slowly previewed</li>
	<li aria-level="1">June 27th to July 12th - <em>League of Legends Mid-Season Internationals</em>, taking place in Vancouver this year, will offer demos</li>
	<li aria-level="1">July 31st to August 3rd - GenGon</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Summer - China launch for <em>Riftbound</em></li>
	<li aria-level="1">October - English Release, including Organized Play</li>
	<li aria-level="1"><em>League of Legends World Championships</em> in China and the <em>TFT Paris Open</em> in France</li>
</ul><h2><em>Riftbound </em>Preview Season</h2>

<p>If you're wanting to learn more about the cards that will be accessible to you the Card Gallery will be getting updated with two to three cards every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday up until 2 weeks before the official Chinese launch of <em>Riftbound</em>. Once the card previews are over Riot Games will then start releasing Deckbuilding and Gameplay content to help you begin as a pro.</p>

<p>Each of these card groupings will have mechanics in common or be specifically shown off to get your TCG strategy brains working to try to come up with different strategies that you might want to implements in your own deck when <em>Riftbound </em>fully releases.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riftbound-league-of-legends-tcg-activating-a-card.jpg?itok=p_2nYSyZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riftbound-league-of-legends-tcg-activating-a-card.jpg?itok=sZQApBq1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Some cards won't just be released via the Card Gallery but will be revealed by Press, Influencers, and members of the community so be sure to also be following creators.</p>

<p><em>Riftbound: Origins</em> will release with an impressive 377 cards total.</p>

<h2><em>Riftbound Set 2</em> and Beyond</h2>

<p><em>Riftbound </em>plans to support continued sets with plans for a total of four sets a year and localization into new languages being explored. That being said the team is also very aware of not wanting to overload players or the market.</p>

<p>With each new set there plans to be new Champion decks (whether it's two or three with each new set is currently in flux, but there was a reinforcement that they always wanted a Champion Deck with every new Set release) and potentially new iterations of the beginner friendly 2-4 player Proving Grounds box set.</p>

<p>While the current plans are for the Chinese and English release of <em>Riftbound </em>to reach release parity by Set 3 there's always global events that can shift those plans. Riot Games has stated that they want to meet that parity ASAP.</p>

<h2><em>Riftbound </em>Organized Play</h2>

<p>There will be two levels of <em>Riftbound </em>Organized Play, the Local Play that occurs at your game shop, and Premier that starts with Regional Qualifiers and moves all the way up to the World Championship.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riftbound-league-of-legends-tcg-influencers.jpg?itok=88yR2s4V 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riftbound-league-of-legends-tcg-influencers.jpg?itok=zN5I_AXC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>To support local playing there will be Release Events for each Set, Nexus Night (a weekly event) where participating players will get a three card booster pack, and Summoner Skirmish. Summoner Skirmish will take place at release, and then a month after and is focused at competitive play.</p>

<p>A unique approach to these Summoner Skirmishes is that you won't just be rewarded based on your final placing. But if you reach the Top 8, Top 4, etc you'll earn all of those rewards. That means if your deck is powerful enough to win you the Summoner Skirmish you'll walk away with a Participation Card, Top 8 Card, Top 4 Card, Finalist Card, Winner Card, and a Champion Playmat.</p>

<p>A key philosophy behind the Organized Play at the local level was also to give players a sense of momentum. Wins at the local level will offer you byes if you visit the Regional Qualifiers promoting your involvement in <em>Riftbound </em>at every level.</p>

<p>Regional Qualifiers are starting early in December. Based on how many participants attend a certain number of invites to Regional Championships will be distributed. An example given was that a Qualifier with 129 players might offer 4 players a spot in the Championship, but an event with 512 players might offer 16 invites.</p>

<p>This means that whether you're playing in a busy city with a bustling competitive scene or in a quieter area that there's a chance to earn that qualification.</p>

<p>There will be less Regional Championships for the first year; one in America and one in Europe. Past the first year they hope to reach two to three a year. You can attend the event as a participant, but for spectators they want to hold all kinds of other events.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riftbound-league-of-legends-tcg-play-mats.jpg?itok=4jNqHjnZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riftbound-league-of-legends-tcg-play-mats.jpg?itok=67kD3wM5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Prizes at the Regional Qualifiers include higher level promos, additional swap, cash prizing, and even 'Best of' prizing. This is intended to promote play that might be not the current optimal meta. If a player is using a Teemo deck, and is able to demonstrate skill at being the best Teemo and making it a long way even if they don't win, then there's opportunities for that player to be rewarded with swag themed for the Legend they're using.</p>

<h3>Organized Play Formats</h3>

<p>A number of Organized Play formats have been announced, those are:</p>

<ul><li aria-level="1">Constructed - This is the standard tournament format for all solo Premier events, set rotation is only planned to begin in 2028</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Teams - A tournament format for Duo Premier events and side events</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Sealed - A format for pre-release events and side events</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Multiplayer - For weekly events and will be a staple for side events</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Draft is currently still being worked on, but it will be intended for weekly events and side events</li>
</ul><p>While there's no timeline to any news on it at the Pre-Launch summit we also heard that there had been some testing internally about a PvE mode to allow players of different skill levels to participate together without fear of unfair competition.</p>

<p>Additional jokes were thrown around about a 5v5 format, consisting of two 2v2 battles and one 1v1 battle, where the aim is to "win two lanes."</p>



<p>While this is all we can currently discuss, expect to see additional images and updated articles from us on June 9th</p>

<p><em>Riftbound</em>, featuring well-known characters from the world of <em>League of Legends</em>, is a fast-paced TCG where at any moment you can have your momentum reset, resulting in a game filled with entertaining highs where even when I was down, I never felt like I was 'out'.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<h2>How Does <em>Riftbound </em>Work?</h2>

<p>In <em>Riftbound</em>, players use Runes to summon units and cast spells. The objective of play isn't to set up attacks to levy at your opponents directly, but instead, the game is about conquering and holding objectives called Battlefields to earn points.</p>

<p>At the beginning of a player's turn, they're able to trigger all Beginning of Turn text, refresh all of their cards, draw two additional mana, and then draw a card into their hand. From there, each player is free to take any other action. That could be to cast a spell, summon a unit, or move any active Units from your Base out to a Battlefield to begin a Showdown.</p>

<p>Summoning Units take up a certain number of Runes, and sometimes can also cause Runes to be recycled (returning it to the bottom of your Rune deck.)</p>

<p>The Rune system in <em>Riftbound </em>is unique, working perfectly to ramp up the speed of a game of <em>Riftbound </em>while also giving all decks a level of consistency. Every turn, you draw two more, letting your available resources grow from two to four, to six, etc. Games beginning with playing a single unit exhausted end up in larger turns where you're able to combine the strengths of Units and Spells to create entertaining combos.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"You'll never have to worry about not drawing a Land or Energy when playing <em>Riftbound</em>."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once you have Units ready, you'll be able to move them to a Battlefield. If one is unoccupied, you'll automatically Conquer it, earning yourself a point. If you hold the Battlefield until your next turn, you'll earn another point.</p>

<p>When players' Units collide on a Battlefield, that's when you'll have a Showdown. At its core, the Showdown is just a matter of "Are my Units' might numbers higher than your Units?" If one side has two Units of 3 and 4 Might, and you move a powerful creature with 8 Might onto the Battlefield, then without the intervention of any spell (or other player), the weaker units will perish.</p>

<p>In a situation where each side has multiple units, you might not be able to successfully hold or conquer the Battlefield, but you could defeat one or two of your opponents' Units, weakening their side.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riftbound-league-of-legends-tcg-battlefield.jpg?itok=RhOc1UJ9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riftbound-league-of-legends-tcg-battlefield.jpg?itok=JZW79jg8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>While the Viktor Side will win this Showdown based on Might (8) the opposition's 4 Might will lead to the death of Viktor's two 1 Might Units</figcaption></figure><p>A nice touch about the win condition, of earning eight points, is that you need to win your final point by holding a Battlefield uncontested for a turn or by capturing all Battlefields simultaneously (this means two in a standard game). This adds a fun level of tension as you can view your opponent creeping closer and closer to their eighth point, and can work to deny them.</p>

<p>With an ever-progressing mana system and a tweaked final point/win condition, it gives players a lot of chances to regain ground while stalling their opponent on their final point. It also means that the game is always progressing towards its conclusion. Even while being taught the game, a standard 1v1 only took 20 minutes, and even less time once everyone really started to understand the ins and outs of their decks.</p>

<h2>Losing The Final Point Isn't Exciting</h2>

<p>One downside of the point system, and how scoring the final point is done, is that the writing is normally on the wall on the losing player's final turn. They'll be able to look at their hand, available Runes, and Units out on the field and know if they're going to win or lose.</p>

<p>Unlike other TCGs where players are in the game until it's over, there's a recognizable "There's nothing I can do here, I surrender" on the final point.</p>

<p>There are scenarios where combat can take place, and spells can fly, shifting the final battle one way or another, but that's going to be far less likely in comparison to a recognizable defeat.</p>

<p>Overall, I think to have a very tense battle for 90% of the game, to have a bit of a weak ending is far more valuable to me as a player who is very interested in playing this game when compared to playing a different TCG where not pulling certain cards or resources can lead the competition to really even begin.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riftbound-league-of-legends-tcg-viktor-trial-deck.jpg?itok=-KehfPjL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riftbound-league-of-legends-tcg-viktor-trial-deck.jpg?itok=8Tp7zBM6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The components of Viktor's deck including the Legend, Champion Unit, Battlefields, Core Deck, Rune Deck, and Recruits</figcaption></figure><h2>Differences Between 1v1 and Multiplayer <em>Riftbound</em></h2>

<p><em>Riftbound </em>is designed to be played not only 1v1 but also multiplayer with four players, either as a 2v2 or a free-for-all. There are only a few rule differences when it comes to multiplayer, but it also changes a lot of the mentality behind the game.</p>

<p>When playing a free-for-all or 2v2, rules-wise, the first player doesn't draw on their first turn, and there's a third Battlefield placed in the center of the players. With more Battlefields to conquer, you can stay out of each other's way a little bit longer, but if you want to be making points then you'll need to be advancing your units.</p>

<p>The change in mentality comes from the final point/win condition. There's clear visibility on who has how many points, and as one person is creeping towards winning, it's in the best interest of the other players to stop them. This combined effort of all players to stop one person winning creates shifting allegiances and the ability to team up and betray one another.</p>

<p>Interestingly, in Multiplayer, there are also rules that while the Showdown will always be against the two players whose Units are at the Battlefield, a participating player can invite another to cast spells to help turn the tide of victory.</p>

<p>This kind of gameplay stirs discussion at a table, asking others if they move their weaker units into a Battlefield if someone would be able to help them win it over.</p>

<p>In a 2v2 game, the descriptions on some cards expand. Card text normally doesn't say "Your Units" but instead "Friendly Units." The effects of these cards in a 2v2 game will allow you to trigger abilities that assist you and your partner.</p>

<h2><em>Riftbound </em>Decks And Their Playstyle</h2>

<p>Each of the Trial Decks we got to use had its own unique mechanics:&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li aria-level="1">Jinx is a Red/Purple deck whose purpose is to always be going full out. When you start a turn with only one card in your hand, you'll get a chance to draw twice.</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Volibear is a Red/Orange deck that ramps quickly to pull out singular, powerful creatures that you'll have trouble coming up with the Might to take on</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Viktor is a Blue/Yellow deck that is all about building up recruits to create a small army to hold Battlefields, even if they may not hold it for long</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Yasuo is a Green/Purple deck where a number of cards have the Ganking ability, which allows them to traverse from one Battlefield to another (instead of having to return home first). This allows for attacks to come from anywhere with speed and precision.</li>
</ul><figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riftbound-league-of-legends-tcg-legends-and-their-cards.jpg?itok=zK15fgG0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riftbound-league-of-legends-tcg-legends-and-their-cards.jpg?itok=qpowPI4u 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Legend, Champion Unit, and Signature Spell of the Trial Decks will give you an idea of the core mechanics of each</figcaption></figure><p>Of the decks that I played, the one that I had the most difficulty with was Jinx. While I understood the benefit of milling out cards and drawing more to unleash powerful attacks, I always felt like I was in a situation with less flexibility due to having fewer cards in my hand.</p>

<p>Volibear and Viktor were both extremely interesting sides of the same coin. Is it better to have eight Units with 1 Might or to have a giant bear with 8 Might? Depending on the Battlefields in play and the speed at which each can activate the deck's engine, I found these two decks to be very evenly matched.</p>

<p>Yasuo, I had the least experience. There was talk about Yasuo games where he swept across each of the Battlefields, resetting every opponent's momentum, but I didn't get to experience that firsthand.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At launch, there will be three pre-made decks, four weaker decks as part of a Proving Grounds 4-player set aimed at beginners, and twelve Champions available from Booster Packs</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Outside of the Trial Decks, I also got to try out a pre-made Darius deck that was Red and Yellow. This deck was an absolute powerhouse and one that I can't wait to build when <em>Riftbound </em>fully releases. Darius had a mix of powerful cards that could Accelerate allowing them to be ready on their first turn, as well as a 1 Might Recruit generating engine like the Viktor trial deck.</p>

<p>Another powerful keyword of the Darius deck was the Legion ability, these are effects that only activate if another card has already been played that turn. You could summon Darius's Champion Unit card, play a card with a Legion ability to generate a 1 Might Recruit, and then trigger Darius's Unit Card's effect that if a second card is played, he's readied. Your side could go from nothing to a 7 Might Unit ready to move, and two additional Units currently Exhausted but ready to move up next turn.</p>

<h2><em>Riftbound League of Legends</em> TCG Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>The speed with which Riot has been able to create <em>Riftbound </em>has been insane, and the final product feels insanely polished. With quick-to-complete games that always feel like you're only just ahead or slightly behind, and wide mechanical variety, <em>Riftbound </em>is a game that can appeal to a hardcore TCG player while also being entertaining for new players to pick up a game and get started.</p>

<p>The Battlefield mechanics and movement in general in a TCG is novel but easy to understand. It also keeps you engaged as you try to shift tactics to win over one instead of another.</p>

<p>For collectors or players, whether you're into the world of <em>League of Legends</em> or not I would definitely recommend picking up a few decks and trying them out with your friends when it releases in October.</p>
