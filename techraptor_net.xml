            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>2K has announced that&nbsp;<em>NBA 2K26</em>, the latest installment in the long-running&nbsp;<em>NBA 2K&nbsp;</em>series of basketball sim games, will be launching in September, and that the game is coming to the Nintendo Switch 2 as well.</p>

<p>Judging by the <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250709742024/en/NBA-2K26-Unveils-2025-MVP-and-Finals-MVP-Shai-Gilgeous-Alexander-WNBA-All-Star-Angel-Reese-and-Hall-of-Famer-Carmelo-Anthony-as-Cover-Athletes" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a> in which the game was revealed, the Switch 2 version will boast the same features as the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions, so for the first time in many years, Nintendo's platform won't be getting the last-gen edition.</p>

<p>Those features include an updated ProPLAY system, which 2K says will allow you to "experience the immersive technology like never before", as well as the City hub, the WNBA-focused The W game mode, and the MyNBA mode, in which you can lead your own franchise to legendary status.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nba-2k26-shai-gilgeous-alexander.jpg?itok=yy1vmEts 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nba-2k26-shai-gilgeous-alexander.jpg?itok=0L2guqkw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>NBA 2K26&nbsp;</em>will feature Shai Gilgeous-Alexander as its cover star.</figcaption></figure><p>The cover athlete for the Standard Edition of&nbsp;<em>NBA 2K26&nbsp;</em>will be none other than Oklahoma City Thunder point guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, while WNBA star Angel Reese will adorn the cover of the GameStop-exclusive WNBA Edition of the game. Finally, the Superstar Edition's cover star is Hall of Famer Carmelo Anthony.</p>

<p>As well as all of the above, 2K says you can look forward to "a reimagined MyCAREER journey" in&nbsp;<em>NBA 2K26</em>, in addition to "a fresh and more optimized City" in the current-gen versions of the game. This iteration's MyNBA mode will feature "30 unique storylines", as 2K tells it.</p>

<p>Otherwise, you know what to expect from&nbsp;<em>NBA 2K26&nbsp;</em>if you're a fan of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nba-2k25-release-date" rel="nofollow">the series</a>:&nbsp;a slick basketball sim with plenty of improvements and new features, plus the usual egregious microtransactions, I'd imagine. You can check out the debut trailer for the game right here.</p>




<p><em>NBA 2K26&nbsp;</em>launches across PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch consoles on September 5th. Picking up the Superstar Edition or the Leave No Doubt Edition of the game will allow you to check it out a week early, as has become customary among new releases.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/subnautica-2-delayed-2026</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/subnautica-2-delayed-to-2026-new-gameplay-trailer-revealed.1240257/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Krafton has announced that upcoming underwater survival sequel&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>has been delayed to next year, but we've got a new gameplay trailer to keep us going in the meantime.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1962700/view/528724684296950298" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on Steam, Krafton and developer Unknown Worlds (which Krafton <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pubg-owner-krafton-buys-subnautica-dev-unknown-worlds" rel="nofollow">acquired back in 2021</a>) say that while early player feedback convinced the studios they were "swimming in the right direction", more development time is needed to "improve" in "a few areas", as well as to provide "a little bit more content" for the Early Access release.</p>

<p>This new content will, according to Krafton, include "more biomes, more vehicle upgrades, additional tools", and an expanded story, as well as "more creatures to discover". Given the breadth of the biological phenomena in the original&nbsp;<em>Subnautica</em>, I'd call that a good reason for a delay.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/subnautica-2-early-access-delayed-2026-lava.jpg?itok=98lLW2Ye 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/subnautica-2-early-access-delayed-2026-lava.jpg?itok=mWXu_PLk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Subnautica 2</em>'s Early Access release has been delayed.</figcaption></figure><p>Although&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2</em>'s Early Access release won't be happening in 2025 anymore, Krafton says it doesn't intend to change anything about the game's creative direction or the team working on it, although that presumably doesn't include the former leaders of Unknown Worlds, who <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/subnautica-developer-unknown-worlds-loses-leadership-team" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">left the studio</a> earlier this month. No reason was provided for their departure.</p>

<p>Additionally, Krafton says you can look forward to a new&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>devlog that will provide more information about the game soon, although it'll be coming out "a little later than intended".</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2</em>, it's the upcoming sequel to the 2018 survival game&nbsp;<em>Subnautica</em>, which has already had one standalone followup in the form of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/subnautica-below-zero" rel="nofollow">2021's&nbsp;<em>Below Zero</em></a>.</p>

<p>Unlike the original game,&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>will emphasize co-op play, although it will also feature a solo play option. The game will tell a new story set on a brand new planet full of strange aquatic life to discover (and run away from screaming, if it's anything like the first game).</p>




<p><em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>is due to launch for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1962700/Subnautica_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/subnautica-2/9PJPCB188SVG" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> via Early Access in 2026. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-review-kick-push-kick-push-glide.1240191/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I remember walking around a yard sale I got dragged to as a nine-year-old and spotting a copy of <em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3</em> for the original PlayStation. Begging my parents to buy it for me, I spent countless hours skating around Foundry and Suburbia (not even sure I ever made it to Canada). With the release of <em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4</em>, I was so excited to hop back into mostly familiar levels, listen to some incredible music, and rack up a high score.</p>

<p>Starting off with the Career Mode, this is everything you should expect returning to <em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3</em> and 4. Each game is its own separate career track so you can start at the beginning of <em>THPS 3</em> in the Foundry, or in <em>THPS 4</em>'s College.</p>

<h2>Relive the Classics</h2>

<p>You'll have two minutes to attempt to complete a variety of goals; the more goals you complete, the more levels you'll unlock. There isn't really some big "end goal" or celebration at the end, it's a Career Mode but not a Story Mode.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-goals.jpg?itok=oJ8WYL33 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-goals.jpg?itok=ugGvg1Be 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The most basic goals are to simply rack up a high score or a high combo. Past that there's objectives to pick up the letters S-K-A-T-E which are a fun challenge that also normally teaches you an interesting line in each level, and a number of very specific challenges to complete.</p>

<p>In London, you'll be performing wall rides on double-decker buses, College lets you hassle frat kids, and you'll be trying to collect stray rivets in the Shipyard. Each of these challenges will prompt players to explore different kinds of tricks, hunt interesting collectibles, or seek out secret spots based on context clues. It does a great job of teaching the player and prompting exploration.</p>

<p>While most of the collectibles to pick up are floating objects that glow and are extremely easy to spot, there's also a number of collectibles that are a bit more vague, like photobombing tourists in Alcatraz. These are definitely the 'harder to come by' objectives, but you'll likely stumble into a few of them while playing the level normally, then it's just up to you to remember where they are and get them all in a single run.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For those who played <em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 and 4</em> on the original PlayStation, expect to see some differences in map layouts and even ordering as we have to remember this was a time where there would be wild differences between ports of the same games.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An aspect of many of the levels in <em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4</em> that I loved, and maybe just something I'm appreciating returning to these games as an adult, is there's normally so much more to a level than what you first experience. In London, a variety of buildings can be grinded to the top of revealing hidden half pipes, and there's a reward for exploration on Skater Island that's <em>Spongebob Squarepants</em> inspired.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-bikini-bottom.jpg?itok=aNM5I5Uu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-bikini-bottom.jpg?itok=LicR83P7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Thi isn't where I parked my boat...</figcaption></figure><h2>New Levels, Skaters, and More</h2>

<p>There are a few new additions to the game for those who have already explored the originals from top to bottom. Of course, the most basic change is that the game handles fantastically; secondly, there is the addition of two new levels. Pinball, a track that begins with you getting boosted out into a downhill style track, and Waterpark, set in a derelict and shut-down waterpark.</p>

<p>Once you've completed the game, you'll also unlock new, more difficult goals for each level. Just when you think you've mastered a track, don't be surprised when a COMBO line or new objective has you stumped. This is a great addition for a pseudo post-game, letting those who know the game like the back of their hands be tested in a whole new way.</p>

<p>I loved exploring Waterpark. There are handrails to slide over, the remains of what I can assume was a lazy river creating a halfpipe through the whole track, and each ride has doors that you can skate into at the bottom, allowing you to pop out at the top.</p>

<h2>Free Skate and Level Creator</h2>

<p>If you don't want to set yourself a two-minute time limit, you can also skate around in Free Skate. Here you'll have access to all of the levels you've unlocked from the campaign as well as access to the directory of fan-created levels.</p>

<p>The fan-created levels are something that I'm most looking forward to. Unfortunately, at the time of review, there hasn't been much movement there. In addition to having the full freedom to create levels like those in the main campaign, the Level Creator has new objects like the boost pads found in Pinball, but also the ability to make goals.</p>

<h2>The Soundtrack Is Some of the Same, and a Lot New</h2>

<p>It wouldn't be <em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</em> without a fantastic soundtrack, and while not all of the original tracks are returning, new ones have been added that fit the tone and vibe of the original game fantastically.&nbsp;Skating through each level, two minutes at a time, you're able to really enjoy all of the music without it getting repetitive.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-massive-bail.jpg?itok=ovBdKT7b 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-massive-bail.jpg?itok=T5zE1hS- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>I enjoyed a lot of the new tracks. They all fit the vibe of the game fantastically, but there's a special bit of nostalgia that hits when one of the classic tracks comes on.</p>

<h2>Visual Upgrades Across the Board</h2>

<p>An extremely satisfying aspect of revisiting these levels ~23 years later is that, comparing the visuals of the original game, even that of the PS2 ports, you can see what the team was going for dialed up to 11 with this remake.</p>

<p>You can see it as soon as you drop into the Foundry. The predominantly grey slabs have been replaced with a factory floor. Flashing lights, workers standing around, and more dynamic scenery (including things to skate on or around). All of these improvements show how much care was put into taking what was already a fun playground and filling it with shiny new toys.</p>

<h2><em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>This is the kind of remaster that you want to see. It looks like a shinier version of all of your best memories playing the original and adds just a bit more for new and old players alike to experience.</p>

<p>Even two minutes at a time, it's a delight to skate around the world, interact with all of the different elements of the world, hunt down secrets, and hopefully score some top scores.</p>

<p>After the incredible success of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="74d91fb2-42d4-403a-99bf-6dd4d42182c9" href="https://techraptor.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-12" rel="nofollow"><em>1+2</em></a> and now <em>3+4</em>, all I can hope for is <em>THUG </em>to grace our screens again.</p>
