<p>Borgit's Beastgrabbaz are a five-unit warband comprising of Borgit, Snagz, Rigg and Shamm, Uglug, and Dregg. These Grots are all out on an adventure to find Trugg, the Troggoth King, and while they might not have pure strength at their disposal they instead work together to empower one another to constantly be on the move and attacking.</p>

<p>There are a number of mechanics that are constantly in play; At the start of each Action Step you'll pick an enemy with Health of 3 or higher and mark it for +1 Attack dice when trying to hit it, your leader will be constantly put in danger, and there are different reactions that you'll be taking based on other actions that your fighters will be using.</p>

<p>While there's a lot to be keeping an eye on, it is also a lot for an opponent to be planning around. Something as simple as using one of Uglug's Core abilities then lets you push every friendly minion up to three hexes ending up adjacent to Uglug. This kind of swarming can very quickly sure up defences and turn the tides of battle.</p>

Interestingly though when these fighters become empowered they don't actually get stronger, they're just able to move further.</p>

<h2>Edge of the Knife Rivals Deck</h2>

<p>Pairing well with the frantic gameplay style of Borgit's Beastgrabbaz is the Edge of the Knife Rivals Deck. This deck is "tailor-made for those who prefer dirty fighting and high-risk maneuvers."</p>

<p>An additional mechanic that is part of this Rivals Deck is that "While using this Rivals deck, fighters with a Health characteristic of 2 or less and/or 2 or more damage tokens are tempered."&nbsp;The Rivals Deck is filled with cards that interact with those in the tempered state.</p>

<p>Some Objective cards that interact will have you making sure all tempered fighters are in neutral or enemy territory, if you're holding a feature token in enemy territory, or if every fighter is tempered.</p>

You can stop them being pushed, swap units across the battlefield, and you can even draw additional Power Cards allowing for more options in the battle.</p>

<p>There's a lot of very situational cards which makes this a difficult kind of game to play. While there are a lot of actions at your disposal you'll need to predict the kinds of situations your opponent will throw you into to ensure you always have the upper hand.</p>

<p>This deck will reward a player with knowledge of their opponent's Warband and Rivals Deck abilities so it might take some practice.</p>

<h2>Borgit's Beastgrabbaz and Edge of the Knife Rivals Deck Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>There are some excellent ideas here for a seasoned professional at Warhammer Underworlds. With both the Warband and the Rivals Deck both being centered around risky play even a few mistakes will throw you well behind in the battle.</p>

<p>If you have the patience to learn the strategies and read your opponents there's a lot that you can do to always turn the tide of battle.</p>
