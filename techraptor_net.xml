<p>New overland locations and "repeatable Testing Stations with escalating difficulty" will also be introduced in Chapter 3, alongside a fresh chunk of story that picks up where <em>Dune: Awakening</em>'s second chapter left off and adds "hours more story-driven survival gameplay".</p><p>At the same time as Chapter 3's release, the new <em>Raiders of the Broken Lands </em>DLC pack will launch, and it'll come complete with new building pieces to make your base even more resplendent, as well as new armor sets, new emotes, and other accouterments.</p><p>Additionally, <em>Dune: Awakening </em>is taking part in the upcoming Steam Winter Sale, where you'll be able to pick it up at a pretty impressive 35% off.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Xbox has denied that it has any kind of partnership with controversial streaming service Kick, following a string of social media posts by the latter that could be construed to mean otherwise.</p><p>Yesterday, the official Kick X account <a href="https://x.com/KickStreaming/status/2001095322265862315/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">posted an image</a> of two people shaking hands, one of whom is holding a package that bears both the Xbox and Kick logos. The image was accompanied by text that simply read "kick (handshake emoji) xbox".</p><p>That image was preceded by <a href="https://x.com/KickStreaming/status/2000732922005848225" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">an animation</a> that resembles the original Xbox's startup sequence (but with the Kick logo replacing the Xbox branding, of course), and was succeeded by <a href="https://x.com/KickStreaming/status/2001458279126532297" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">a video</a> showing someone unboxing a Kick-themed original Xbox. It's not hard to see how all of this could have been interpreted as an official partnership between the two brands.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Kick's recent social media posts seem to strongly imply a partnership with Xbox.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In response to <a href="https://x.com/SnarkingIsLegal/status/2001124399596937292" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">an allegation</a> that Microsoft had partnered with Kick, Xbox <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/2001399524238020705" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">confirmed</a> that it has no partnership with the streaming service, and that a Kick app was instead "independently published" on Xbox's platform. The app is currently being "actively evaluated", and if it's found to breach Xbox's policies, it will be removed.</p><p>Kick has <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-66044165" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">garnered controversy</a> since its foundation in 2022, partly due to its close links to the gambling industry; while Twitch has banned gambling-related content from its platform, Kick still hosts gambling streams, and its founders, Ed Craven and Bijan Tehrani, are also behind crypto casino Stake.</p><p>The platform has also become known for welcoming creators who have been banned or censured by other services, including the likes of&nbsp;Félix "xQc" Lengyel and Kaitlyn "Amouranth" Siragusa, among others.</p><figure role="group">

<p>It remains to be seen whether the Kick app will be allowed to remain on the Xbox platform, so stay tuned for more on this and all other things Xbox-related.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Unity has reportedly introduced a new fee that it's asking some of its Enterprise customers to pay, and the "minimum commitment" for which the engine is apparently asking is not small.</p><p>According to <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/unity-risks-fresh-backlash-with-new-fee-demands-this-feels-like-blackmail/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Mobilegamer.biz</a>, emails have been sent out by Unity this week targeting "bigger Unity customers" and detailing a new fee that begins at $250,000 and rises to $2 million for the largest proponents.</p><p>The fee, apparently referred to as a "minimum commitment program" by Unity, supposedly "requires that [developers] pay Unity a specified minimum commitment amount at the commencement of each Subscription Year", with the fee based on gross revenue earned by the developer in question.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong </em>is just one of the many games that was made in Unity.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>According to Mobilegamer.biz's sources, developers with revenue between $25 million and $50 million will need to pay $250,000 to Unity, with the amount rising in direct proportion to revenue. Those who have made over $250 million will need to pay $2 million of that to Unity.</p><p>The engine says that the fees will go towards "your purchase of Unity subscription license and support products", and Mobilegamer.biz's sources claim that developers are threatened with termination if they fail to pay the new fee.</p><p>It probably goes without saying that Unity can ill afford another hit to its public relations right now; the company is arguably still recovering from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unity-apologizes-for-confusion-and-angst-due-to-runtime-fee-policy-promises-changes" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c2e9dbd5-693e-4701-a45d-1f172ca61b44" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">the controversy</a> that was ignited after <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unity-developers-outraged-after-major-pricing-change" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5d8418f6-6d83-477d-97b7-f18aa50e0a89" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">the introduction</a> of the so-called "runtime fee" in 2023.</p><p>In that particular case, Unity <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unity-announces-revised-pricing-policy-following-massive-backlash-from-developers" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ed48a89b-b13e-4d2a-b975-298530ddbc6a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">reversed its decision</a> fairly swiftly, and then-CEO John Riccitello subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unity-ceo-john-riccitiello-retiring-after-runtime-fee-controversy" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="61146301-1035-4016-acad-04d27c632ca1" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">stepped down from the company</a>. Whether this fee will have a similar effect remains to be seen, but it would seem to be an ill omen for Unity's future direction, at any rate.</p>
<p>Unity hasn't technically announced this new fee in a public-facing capacity, so we'll have to wait and see if it decides to do so and what the reaction will be if and when that happens. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
