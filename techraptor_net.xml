            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s another set release, and with over 100 different new commander options we debated what to do with a set that had more Commander options than there are episodes of the show. In the end, we decided on not repeating the odyssey of ranking over 100 commanders like we did with <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/ranking-all-of-magic-gathering-final-fantasy-legendary-creatures-part-1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Ranking ALL of Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy Legendary Creatures Part 1"><em>Final Fantasy Magic The Gathering </em>Parts 1</a> <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/ranking-all-of-magic-gathering-final-fantasy-legendary-creatures-part-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/ranking-all-of-magic-gathering-final-fantasy-legendary-creatures-part-2">and 2</a> because a lot of the individual uncommons aren’t really that interesting.</p>

<p>Instead, we’ll be doing a bit of a medley: looking at a handful of the commanders in <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender </em>for <em>Magic: The Gathering&nbsp;</em>(from both the main set and Jumpstart), discussing lore of Avatar with the representation of them (like we once did with <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/best-lore-deep-cuts-of-doctor-who-commander-universes-beyond" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Doctor Who Commander: Deep Lore Only True Whovians Would Notice"><em>Doctor Who MTG</em></a>), and ranking some of the characters who got significant representation.</p>

<h2><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tla/207/avatar-aang-aang-master-of-elements" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Avatar Aang">Avatar Aang</a></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avatar-aang.jpg?itok=Pym2Zejr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avatar-aang.jpg?itok=RDE7JIkk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Kicking it off is Aang depicted at the end of the series, where he is fully realizing his powers in a duel with Ozai. This representation of Aang is a powerful 5 color value engine on the front face with him providing solid size as a 4/4 flier, who draws whenever you do bending – such as when you firebend by attacking with Aang! He’s the perfect leader for an ‘all-Avatar’ Commander deck with the 5 color identity, and being generally powerful caring about prominent set mechanics.</p>

<p>He gets stronger when you can do all of them, and flip him over for a large cost reduction mechanic that can give you a bevy of resources while returning your card draw engine, as well as being a beating. Unlike most colored cost reducers, Aang, Master of Elements also reduces the cost of generic mana, which means is incredibly strong with cards that have buyback, like doing infinite damage with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tmp/201/searing-touch" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Searing Touch">Searing Touch</a>. You can also trigger his avatar mode in emergency form without having mastered bending with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/isd/195/moonmist" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Moonmist">Moonmist</a>&nbsp;to get to that sweet cost reduction even quicker.</p>

<h3>Ranking All Aang Commander Options&nbsp;</h3>

<p>There are 8 unique legendary Aang cards in the Avatar sets and here they are ranked:<br>
8) <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tle/146/aang-a-lot-to-learn" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Aang, A Lot to Learn">Aang, a Lot to Learn</a><br>
7) <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tla/4/aang-the-last-airbender" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Aang, the Last Airbender">Aang, the Last Airbender</a><br>
6) <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tle/210/aang-air-nomad" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Aang, Air Nomad">Aang, Air Nomad</a><br>
5) <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tla/204/aang-swift-savior-aang-and-la-oceans-fury" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Aang, Swift Savior /// Aang and La, Ocean's Fury">Aang, Swift Savior</a><br>
4) <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tle/74/aang-airbending-master" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Aang, Airbending Master">Aang, Airbending Master</a><br>
3) <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tla/203/aang-at-the-crossroads-aang-destined-savior" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Aang, at the Crossroads //  Aang, Destined Savior ">Aang, at the Crossroads</a><br>
2) <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tle/69/aang-and-katara" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Aang and Katara">Aang and Katara</a><br>
1) <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tla/207/avatar-aang-aang-master-of-elements" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Avatar Aang /// Aang, Master of Elements">Avatar Aang</a></p>

<p>Any of the top 5 are good or better Commander options, with 2 and 4 providing Ally centric gameplay, while Aang, at the Crossroads shows Aang at the end of Book 2/Season 2 in a wonderfully flavorful card that manages to capture the fight going on, and how Aang was unable to enter the Avatar state until someone he cared for was hurt, and how even then a <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/8ed/200/lightning-blast" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Lightning Blast">Lightning Blast</a> could take him down (if it hits the right rock...).</p>

<h2><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tle/130/avatar-kyoshi-earthbender" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Avatar Kyoshi, Earthbender">Avatar Kyoshi, Earthbender</a></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avatar-kiyoshi-earthbender.jpg?itok=svxxC6bT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avatar-kiyoshi-earthbender.jpg?itok=Cbft5ssR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Kyoshi is one of the past avatars represented by a saga in the main set (<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tla/186/the-legend-of-kyoshi-avatar-kyoshi" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="The Legend of Kyoshi /// The Legend of Kyoshi">The Legend of Kyoshi</a>, which transforms into Avatar Kyoshi), and gets a full card in the Jumpstart product. Kyoshi is famed in the world of Avatar for her conviction and seeking justice she created a peaceful world, in contrast to Aang’s struggles and ties to the other people he loves and considers friends. Famously, she killed Chin, the Conqueror with a powerful feat of earthbending when she split the peninsula of her home off from the main land of the Earth Kingdom, and the cliff edge he stood on collapsed under him.</p>

<p>In Magic, we see Kyoshi shown at this height of her power, and focused on her use of earthbending. 8 Mana is a lot, but green is able to ramp like no one, and she wants to be in a deck with a lot of lands that she can animate with her earthbending each turn. She is one of the only repeatable earthbenders in the set, and each turn she can earthbend 8, turning a land into an 8/8. Her saga is also a perfect inclusion in the deck for double the Kiyoshi representation</p>

<h3><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tle/112/avatar-roku-firebender" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Avatar Roku, Firebender">Avatar Roku, Firebender</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avatar-roku-firebender_0.jpg?itok=hrGlBy6s 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avatar-roku-firebender_0.jpg?itok=TOGwzo2c 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>After Kyoshi’s status as the Avatar for 230 years, the next Avatar was Roku from the Fire Nation. Born on the same day as <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tla/117/the-rise-of-sozin-fire-lord-sozin" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="The Rise of Sozin ///  Fire Lord Sozin ">Fire Lord Sozin</a>, the two would be friends with Roku tempering his friend’s tendency to extremism, until he leaves for training as the Avatar. Without Roku, Sozin would continue his descent, even when his friend returned. Those old ties would make Roku reluctant to confront his old friend, letting the firelord prepare for his strike in secret, with only occasional confrontations between the two old friends. His <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tla/145/the-legend-of-roku-avatar-roku?back" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="The Legend of Roku ///  Avatar Roku ">saga card</a>, which works well with Avatar Roku, Firebender, depicts him giving the advise to Aang to be more decisive than he was, as well as showing how he was close to dragons who Fire Lords would have largely killed off.</p>

<p>Roku’s card shows his part in a world that was growing closer together, and how he was less confrontational than Kyoshi. Getting 6 mana whenever anyone attacks for that combat is obviously useful, and Roku himself provides the ability to tilt combat and play politics with his +3/+0 to target creature. Use it to punish aggressors by buffing blockers, or to help take on a stronger foe with the attacker, or to fund your <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tle/64/fire-nation-turret" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Fire Nation Turret">Fire Nation Turret</a>.</p>

<h3><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tla/211/bumi-unleashed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Bumi, Unleashed">Bumi, Unleashed</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bumi-unleashed.jpg?itok=RsGjgwBV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bumi-unleashed.jpg?itok=Sv-PW5Nn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The King of Omashu got 3 cards in the Avatar set, showing him at different times during the series. This old man was in fact a friend of Aang’s before the Avatar hid away in an iceberg, and in his first appearance is a trickster mentor to Aang and friends as shown in <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tla/169/bumi-king-of-three-trials" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Bumi, King of Three Trials">Bumi of Three Trials</a>, while <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tle/248/bumi-eclectic-earthbender" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Bumi, Eclectic Earthbender">Bumi, Eclectic Earthbender</a>&nbsp;shows him at the end of that when they chose to duel the old man instead of his obviously muscular <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tla/179/flopsie-bumis-buddy" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Flopsie, Bumi's Buddy">Ape-Goat pet Flopsie</a>. An eccentric and openminded thinker, Bumi is also a brilliant tactician and strategist, who after the capture of Omashu waited his time to take action against the fire nation.</p>

<p>Bumi, Unleashed shows him breaking out and leading an assault to retake his city at the end of the series, around the same time that Aang is fighting Ozai as depicted in Avatar Aang. He gives you 9 power for 5 mana over two creatures, and will provide double combat opportunities for all your earthbended and otherwise animated land. There’s a lot of competition in <em>Avatar </em>for land attack leaders, but Bumi is one of the best, and just wants you to invite&nbsp;<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dsc/170/ashaya-soul-of-the-wild" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Ashaya, Soul of the Wild">Ashaya, Soul of the Wild</a>&nbsp;to the party as well.</p>

<h3><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tla/220/fire-lord-azula" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Fire Lord Azula">Fire Lord Azula</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fire-lord-azula_0.jpg?itok=E9GYf-x4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fire-lord-azula_0.jpg?itok=Jkk1NVbW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>One of the most prominent villains of <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em>, Azula is the younger sister of Zuko. She begins appearing in the second season, and is perhaps at the height of her power at the end of that season when she takes over Ba Sing Se. While the other young characters in Avatar grow, Azula fails to and it is a bit sad that this card depicting her at the end of the third season doesn’t really capture her fall into paranoia and general mental break, although she remains a formidable bending prodigy, which it does aptly capture as she is going to duel her brother.</p>

<p>Leaving aside it being one of the weaker flavor alignments, Fire Lord Azula is a powerhouse. A 4/4 for 4 in Grixis color identity, she will copy any spells you cast while she’s attacking, and fuel those spells with firebending 2. This can work well for a lot of strategies like storm combo, spell slinger, or even something along the lines of voltron making use of pump spells. Note that she copies any type of spell, including creatures like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/c21/165/dualcaster-mage" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Dualcaster Mage">Dualcaster Mage</a>&nbsp;if you want to make all the copies.</p>

<h3>Ranking All Azula Commander Options</h3>

<p>There are 4 unique Azula cards across the Avatar product line, and I would rank them:</p>

<p>4) <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tla/85/azula-on-the-hunt" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Azula, On the Hunt">Azula, On the Hunt</a><br>
3) <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/Azula,%20Ruthless%20Firebender" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="https://scryfall.com/card/tle/101/azula-ruthless-firebender">Azula, Ruthless Firebender</a><br>
2) <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tla/208/azula-cunning-usurper" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Azula, Cunning Usurper">Azula, Cunning Usurper</a><br>
1) <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tla/220/fire-lord-azula" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Fire Lord Azula">Fire Lord Azula</a></p>

<p>(Side note: Firebending does not add red to the color identity of these cards. It is part of the reminder text, thus like <a href="https://scryfall.com/search?q=o%3Aextort&amp;unique=cards&amp;as=grid&amp;order=name" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Extort">extort</a>&nbsp;its not counted as part of the card's rule text setting its color identity in Commander.)</p>

<p>Azula, Cunning Usurper shows Azula at the height of her power at the end of Season 2, as mentioned above when emerges victorious after a fight with Aang and friends. This version of the card though has less color identity, and really wants you to be playing a blink deck to reset the cards she has exiled. As a bonus, there is a fifth Azula on the bonus sheet, which is a new version of <em>Portal Three Kingdom</em> card <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tle/27/diaochan-artful-beauty" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Azula, Flame of Ember Island">Diaochan, Artful Beauty</a>.</p>

<h3><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tla/221/fire-lord-zuko" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Fire Lord Zuko">Fire Lord Zuko</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fire-lord-zuko.jpg?itok=LwYQXPpZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fire-lord-zuko.jpg?itok=lzBlZx2l 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Of all characters in Avatar, none has a greater character arc than Zuko. Beginning as an exile seeking to return home by accomplishing an impossible task (find the Avatar who had been missing for a century), he eventually evolves into the character we see depicted in Fire Lord Zuko. At the very end of the series, this shows Zuko as the new leader of the Fire Nation having defeated his sister and setting the nation on a path that ends the war, and lead to a more prosperous future.</p>

<p>In Mardu colors, Fire Lord Zuko is a payoff for exile casting or blinking of permanents. Take advantage of impulse draw (like Prosper, Tome Bound), and blink spells to grow your creatures and as you do Zuko gets bigger and firebends even more mana.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Ranking All Zuko Commander Options&nbsp;</h3>

<p>There are 8 unique legendary Zuko cards in the Avatar sets (in addition to a bonus sheet printing of <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tle/52/rhys-the-redeemed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Zuko, Redeemed">Zuko, Redeemed, an overlay of Rhys, the Redeemed</a>)&nbsp;and here they are ranked:</p>

<p>8) <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tle/150/zuko-seeking-honor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Zuko, Seeking Honor">Zuko, Seeking Honor</a><br>
7) <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tla/163/zuko-exiled-prince" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Zuko, Exiled Prince">Zuko, Exiled Prince</a><br>
6) <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tle/246/zuko-avatar-hunter" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Zuko, Avatar Hunter">Zuko, Avatar Hunter</a><br>
5)&nbsp;<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tla/253/zuko-conflicted" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Zuko, Conflicted">Zuko, Conflicted</a><br>
4) <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tle/90/the-blue-spirit" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="The Blue Spirit">The Blue Spirit</a><br>
3) <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tle/127/zuko-firebending-master" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Zuko, Firebending Master">Zuko, Firebending Master</a><br>
2) <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tle/68/mai-and-zuko" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Mai and Zuko">Mai and Zuko</a><br>
1) <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tla/221/fire-lord-zuko" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Fire Lord Zuko">Fire Lord Zuko</a></p>

<p>For those who don’t know the show, the inclusion of the Blue Spirit here may be slightly confusing. In Season/Book 1, Aang is captured by Admiral Zhao, and Zuko, who needs to bring home himself to restore his honor and place in the family, realizes that Zhao will now get that credit. So, in the titular episode, Zuko dresses up as The Blue Spirit, and frees Aang from captivity, beginning the process of the two of them wondering if they could be friends, a trend which will eventually see culmination in Book 3: Fire. As for the card, flash appearing creatures is very much fitting the surprise appearance of The Blue Spirit, and the drawing represents the reinforcements.</p>

<hr><p><em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em>&nbsp;is a set and Jumpstart set made with clear love of the source material. With a lot of great and flavorful design hits, there are also some excellent&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering</em>&nbsp;shoutouts like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tla/258/meteor-sword" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Meteor Sword">Meteor Sword</a>&nbsp;lining up with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fdn/256/meteor-golem" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Meteor Golem">Meteor Golem</a>.</p>
