            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/street-fighter-6-sales-5m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has announced that&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>sales have topped another major milestone around the world, including sales across all platforms and on both digital and physical platforms.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e250611.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on the official Capcom website,&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>has managed to sell five million copies since launching back in June 2023. The new sales milestone means that&nbsp;the fighting game has picked up another million sales for itself <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/street-fighter-6-sales-4-million" rel="nofollow">since September last year</a>.</p>

<p>Sales may well have accelerated thanks to the launch of&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>as a Switch 2 launch title. The console, which launched on June 5th, racked up 3.5 million sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-fastest-selling-nintendo-console" rel="nofollow">within its first four days</a>, making it Nintendo's fastest-selling console around the world.</p>

<p>The game largely continues the one-on-one fighting game trappings of its predecessors, although it naturally boasts new characters in its roster, as well as new mechanics and a more newcomer-friendly approach (which, incidentally, is one of the things Capcom credits with the new game's popularity).</p>

<p><em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>also features a single-player mode by the name of World Tour, in which players can create their own avatars and explore various environments from both the&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Final Fight&nbsp;</em>universes.</p>

<p>Like many modern fighting games,&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>also features <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/street-fighter-6-rollback-netcode-will-be-better-open-worlds-detailed" rel="nofollow">rollback netcode</a>, as well as cross-platform play. A host of new characters have also been added to the roster as part of post-launch DLC, many of which are included in the Switch 2's&nbsp;<em>Years 1-2 Fighters Edition&nbsp;</em>package.</p>




<p><em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>is available right now for PC, PlayStation, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch 2. You can check out <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/street-fighter-6-review" rel="nofollow">our review of the game here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-ceo-lars-wingefors-steps-down<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Embracer Group has announced that its CEO Lars Wingefors will step down later this year, with current deputy CEO Phil Rogers set to take on the role when Wingefors departs.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/lars-wingefors-proposed-to-be-elected-as-executive-chair-of-the-board-of-embracer-phil-rogers-appointed-new-ceo/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on its official website, Embracer says that Wingefors' departure and Rogers' appointment are both part of the "transformation process", which will see Embracer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-splitting-three-companies" rel="nofollow">becoming three separate entities</a> in charge of different aspects of the current company structure later this year.</p>

<p>That ongoing process also saw Embracer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-fellowship-entertainment-coffee-stain" rel="nofollow">renaming itself to Fellowship Entertainment</a> last month, with current subsidiary Coffee Stain also due to spin off into its own entity sometime later this year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/satisfactory-coffee-stain-embracer-group_0.jpg?itok=l--LqEHi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/satisfactory-coffee-stain-embracer-group_0.jpg?itok=-mrteLVK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Coffee Stain, publisher of games like&nbsp;<em>Satisfactory</em>, will spin off from parent Embracer Group later this year.</figcaption></figure><p>Wingefors says that while Embracer's "road has&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-financials-q2-2024" rel="nofollow">not always been straight</a>", he's "incredibly proud" of the company's achievements under his direction. He then says his move away from the CEO position will allow him to focus on "strategic initiatives, M&amp;A, and capital allocation", which I can't imagine was his response when asked what he wanted to be as a child.</p>

<p>Despite his departure, Wingefors won't be completely absent from Embracer (or Fellowship Entertainment, as it will be known by the end of the 2025 calendar year). He'll take the position of the board's executive chairman, with current chair Kicki Wallje-Lund moving to the deputy chair role.</p>

<p>Changes in Embracer's management come after a fairly turbulent time for the company. As part of a company-wide restructuring effort, Embracer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-has-laid-off-8-of-its-employees-and-it-isnt-done-yet-despite-record-quarter" rel="nofollow">laid off hundreds of employees</a> last year, additionally closing studios like&nbsp;<em>Saints Row&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Agents of Mayhem&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-shuts-down-saints-row-developer-volition" rel="nofollow">Volition</a>.</p>

<p>Despite this, Embracer has enjoyed a couple of recent successes, most notably Warhorse Studios'&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-3m" rel="nofollow">managed to sell three million copies</a> in its first three months on sale.</p>

Stay tuned for more on this.</p>
