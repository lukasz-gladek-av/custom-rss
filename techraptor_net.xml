It's not clear exactly which departments will be most affected by this latest round of staff cuts.</p><figure role="group">

<p>According to GI.biz, the aforementioned voluntary redundancy program "had some takeup", but Ubisoft deemed "additional steps" were necessary in order to further cut costs.</p><p>An internal email sent by Ubisoft to staffers apparently states that the layoffs are nothing to do with staff performance and that the direction of both studios remains the same.</p><p>Just in case you need a reminder, Massive Entertainment is the studio behind 2024's <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/star-wars-outlaws" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fdd3085d-9457-4fdd-8120-72f7ba52b3c0" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></a>, and it's also the developer responsible for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="0d6d339e-943d-4392-8a44-bd5f8ec47fda" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</em></a><em> </em>and the <em>Division </em>franchise. A third installment of said franchise is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-quietly-drops-tom-clancys-division-3-announcement" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e673ceae-2dd8-421f-9ea7-ad4b555e54c5" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">currently in the works</a>.</p><p>It's been a shaky start to the year for Ubisoft. Just last week, the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-halifax-shutdown" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5c381dd9-8d80-4d19-ac2f-5c64bbb6ef55" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">shut down its Halifax branch</a>, a decision that carried with it some pretty unfortunate timing; Halifax had become the first North American Ubisoft <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-halifax-union" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="22333ad9-7422-4ae5-b9c7-e8c3a1c689d3" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">studio to unionize</a> just weeks before its closure.</p><figure role="group">

<p>These layoffs and studio closures are part of a wider set of cost-cutting measures for Ubisoft; the publisher also cut staff at <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-layoffs-redlynx-restructuring" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c40ca2ba-0c2c-453f-a503-eb81293d2704" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Trials </em>developer RedLynx in October</a> as well, so I wouldn't be surprised if more cuts are on the way.</p><p>We'll have to wait and see how else Ubisoft plans to reduce its spending, but I'm betting we haven't heard the last of job losses (and potentially even studio closures) from the publisher. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
