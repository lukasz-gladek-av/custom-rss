            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/mantic-games-announces-assassins-creed-animus-is-coming-to-kickstarter<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mantic Games is partnering with Ubisoft for an Assassin's Creed board game. The tabletop developer behind Halo: Flashpoint will be developing <em>Assassin's Creed: Animus</em>, a game spanning multiple eras and protagonists from across the franchise.</p>

<h2>The <em>Assassin's Creed: Animus</em> Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, <em>Assassin's Creed: Animus </em>is an ambitious tabletop adaptation where 2-4 players work together using fan-favorite Assassin's Creed characters. The press release included characters like Ezio Auditore, Conner Kenway, Altair Ibn-La'Ahad, and Eivor Varinsdottir. Furthermore, it will feature "enjoyable, challenging, and choice-rich gameplay."</p>

Given developer Mantic Games history of complex but accessible miniatures games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/overdrive-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Overdrive</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/halo-flashpoint-rise-of-banished-brings-alien-exiles-to-battlefield" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Halo: Flashpoint</em></a>, it is likely this board game will be in that mold.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time <em>Assassin's Creed</em> has gotten a tabletop adaptation. Back in 2021 there was <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/assassins-creed-board-game-raises-shipping-costs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood of Venice</em></a> developed by Triton Noir, which focused more on Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood.</p>

<p>Since <em>Assassin's Creed</em> is about secret orders of assassins taking out targets with parkour, gadgets, and hidden blades across different eras of history, that kind of gameplay loop can translate well to a miniatures environment. A focus on spatial and environmental awareness, planning your moves. Choosing the right time to strike and escape. With some time and consideration, Mantic's style can mesh well here.</p>

<p><em>Assassin's Creed</em> is one of publisher Ubisoft's most popular action franchises. It began in 2007 and has continued to the present. The franchise has covered multiple historical eras, including The Crusades, the Italian Renaissance, the American Revolution, the Golden Age of Piracy, the French Revolution, the British Industrial Revolution, the time <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/assassins-creed-valhalla" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">of Vikings</a>, and recently, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/assassins-creed-shadows" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Feudal Japan</a>.</p>

<p>The Kickstarter campaign for Assassin's Creed: Animus will be going live at some point later this year.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ready-or-not-sales-hit-9m-ahead-of-summer-console-launch.1171548/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ready-or-not-sales-9m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher VOID Interactive has announced a major&nbsp;<em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em>sales milestone just a few months before the game's launch on consoles in summer.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em>has managed to hit nine million sales since launching on Steam <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ready-or-not-release-date-coming-2021-gameplay-tutorial-shown" rel="nofollow">back in 2021</a>. The game spent two years in Early Access before its 1.0 release in 2023, and it's likely this figure includes Early Access sales as well as those the game has accrued since its full launch.</p>

<p>Still, that sales figure is pretty impressive when considering that&nbsp;<em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em>is currently only available on PC; the game is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ready-or-not-ps5-xbox-summer" rel="nofollow">due to launch on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S in summer</a>, although we don't have a specific release date for its console launch yet.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ready-or-not-sales-9m-hostage.jpg?itok=bTOUK9x9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ready-or-not-sales-9m-hostage.jpg?itok=ZOXpm_rS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em>has hit a big new sales milestone.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as hitting nine million sales, VOID Interactive CEO Julio Rodriguez says the game is "approach[ing] 10 million units sold", so don't be surprised if you hear&nbsp;<em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em>has broken the 10 million barrier in the next few weeks or months.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Ready or Not</em>, it's a tactical shooter in which players are thrust into "high-risk and realistic scenarios involving SWAT teams".</p>

<p>Your duties might include defusing bombs, dealing with hostage-takers, or working around "barricaded suspects", with plenty of other scenarios available as well. If you like your shooters gritty and realistic,&nbsp;<em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em>is very much for you.</p>

<p>While the game seems overwhelmingly designed to be played in multiplayer, it is also possible to approach missions on your own, although you will be dealing with AI (that's CPU-controlled rather than generative AI) squadmates if you decide to do so.</p>




<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1144200/Ready_or_Not/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>. The game is also due to come to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S sometime this summer.</p>
