            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Circana has released its US gaming sales data for both December and 2025 as a whole, and it turns out that a game released towards the end of the year was the best-selling title across the whole year.</p><p>As revealed by the venerable Mat Piscatella on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3mczdusovdk2b" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bluesky</a>, EA's <em>Battlefield 6 </em>was 2025's best-selling game across all platforms, a feat that probably shouldn't come as a surprise given its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-6-sales-7m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7f54e66c-a1d7-49c6-a458-a64a557a9323" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">impressive sales performance</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-6-october-best-selling-circana" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="15da8cce-653d-4fe6-aa54-3cae8b3a0758" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">chart dominance</a> during its launch month.</p><p>In second place for the year is <em>NBA 2K26</em>, thus proving that sports games truly are evergreen, followed by Gearbox's <em>Borderlands 4 </em>in third place. Looks like those <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/randy-pitchford-borderlands-4-performance-comments" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ee451f31-ff9e-4b56-9889-1f0581a00b2d" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">performance complaints</a> didn't do the game any harm in the long run.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Borderlands 4 </em>was, according to Circana, the US' third best-selling game of 2025.</figcaption>

<p>Continuing down the top ten, Capcom's <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>is in fourth place for 2025, which demonstrates <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-10m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3047bd12-37c9-4b65-bd39-064968be79fa" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">just how strong initial sales were</a> (even if things did start to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-ps5-barrier-capcom" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a0c5ff11-5fb9-4929-804b-8a8d4f7adae0" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">peter out after a few months</a>).</p><p>Fifth place goes to <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>, which may be a little worryingly low for Activision and Microsoft, especially since the game's biggest rival is in the top spot.</p><p>In sixth, seventh, and eighth place are three EA sports titles, namely <em>Madden NFL 26</em>, <em>EA Sports College Football 26</em>, and <em>EA Sports FC 26 </em>respectively, with the final two spots in the top ten taken up by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/oblivion-remastered-sales-circana-april-2025" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="64e25692-338e-455e-b91a-4b1b51fbb682" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">the <em>Oblivion </em>remaster</a> and <em>Black Ops 6</em>.</p><p>Hardware-wise, it probably won't come as a surprise to learn that the Switch 2 led the year in both unit and dollar terms; it's a new piece of Nintendo kit, after all, so there was almost no chance it was going to be outperformed by two five-year-old consoles (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-sales-wii-u-vita-dreamcast" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="91ebec60-06fa-4b54-b925-a0fb963092d1" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">almost being the operative word</a>).</p><figure role="group">

Wonder </em>will be arriving in March, bringing with it a number of fun new activities for you and your friends to try out.</p><p>The Switch 2 version of <em>Super Mario Bros.

<p>Bellabel Park, which gives the Switch 2 Edition of <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder </em>the second half of its name (<em>Meetup in Bellabel Park</em>), will play host to a range of new multiplayer attractions and activities, both co-op and competitive.</p><p>If that's not your speed, then you can enjoy the new Toad Brigade Training Camp, where you'll find a range of new challenges to try out across <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em>'s many courses.</p><p>You'll also find new Koopaling bosses scattered throughout some of the game's stages, and to help you take them on, Rosalina has become a playable character in the Switch 2 version of the game (and I'm sure it's no coincidence <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-first-trailer" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fdabb138-30ed-426d-ae89-f5cf557b56fc" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">she's appearing</a> in the upcoming <em>Super Mario Galaxy Movie </em>as well).</p><p>Other new features include the mouse-controlled Co-Star Luma and the new Assist Mode, which lessens some of <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em>'s challenge and makes your journey just a little less stressful.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to regular cards for adorable 'mons like Vanillite and Pumpkaboo, as well as new Trainer cards like the Retreat Cost-lowering Peculiar Plaza and the Energy-sapping Piers.</p><p>As for that new mechanic, Stadiums are "a new type of Trainer card that can turn the tide of battle", according to The Pokemon Company. The aforementioned Peculiar Plaza card is a Stadium addition, and it's "especially tricky to handle for players using Psychic-type Pokemon", apparently.</p><p><em>Fantastical Parade </em>is also packing a suite of new covers themed around expansion mascot Gardevoir. Those covers won't become available the moment the expansion drops, though; they'll be released starting from January 31st.</p><p>You can check out a trailer that shows off some of <em>Fantastical Parade</em>'s lovely new cards, as well as its overall art style and aesthetic direction, right here.</p>
