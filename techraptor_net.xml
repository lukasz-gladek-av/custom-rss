            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-hearts-missing-link-canceled<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has announced that "GPS based action RPG"&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link&nbsp;</em>has been canceled, although the long-absent&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts IV&nbsp;</em>remains in development, according to the studio.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/KHMLink_NA/status/1922540374167364055" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on X, Square Enix says that it "worked hard on developing and adjusting"&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link</em>, but that the studio would be unable to "offer a service that players would find satisfactory over a long period of time".</p>

<p>Square Enix closes by saying that "the&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts&nbsp;</em>series will continue", and that the development team is&nbsp;"hard at work on&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts IV</em>", imploring fans to "keep an eye out for further updates", although no timeframe for those updates is revealed.</p>

A number of closed beta tests were held in the period between then and now, but it seems that they didn't help Square Enix refine the game enough for release.</p>

<p>The game was to take place between the events of&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts Union&nbsp;</em><i>χ&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts Dark Road</em>, both smartphone spinoffs (although what constitutes a "spinoff" in the murky world of&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts&nbsp;</em>can be fluid at the best of times).</p>

<p>Gameplay-wise, it was to adapt the action-RPG gameplay for which&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts&nbsp;</em>has become known, with players battling Heartless and other enemies in and around the land of Scala ad Caelum. Disney characters like Aladdin,&nbsp;<em>Toy Story</em>'s Woody, and&nbsp;<em>Tangled</em>'s Rapunzel were set to appear.</p>




<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts IV</em>, very little has been revealed about the game since that debut trailer back in 2022. We know it'll once again star series protagonist Sora, and that it'll take place in the modern city of Quadratum, but other than that, it's shrouded in mystery.</p>

<p>Somewhat alarmingly, series creator Tetsuya Nomura has also declared that it's possible he <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tetsuya-nomura-kingdom-hearts-retirement" rel="nofollow">won't finish the series before he retires</a>, so if you were hoping for closure from&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts&nbsp;</em>(for some reason), you might be disappointed.</p>
