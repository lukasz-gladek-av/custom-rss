It's got 2,050 pieces and some fun details, like electrical energy between Pikachu and the Poke Ball, as well as a "25" on its base to signify the iconic mouse's Pokedex number.</p><figure role="group">

<p>The next major set incorporates Venusaur, Charizard, and Blastoise as part of a single group, and you can build them either to stand alone or to take their place on an "action base". Lego and The Pokemon Company say the base will have Easter eggs for you to discover as well.</p><figure role="group">

<p>Finally, the third set revolves around a 587-piece set of everyone's favorite...err...mammal Eevee, which boasts an "expressive face", as well as a "movable tail, head, and limbs". You can see the set here.</p><figure role="group">

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Icarus </em>creator Dean Hall has revealed that his game, which was released four years ago, received a huge sales boost from the recent Steam Winter Sale, and for that matter, so did its DLC.</p><p>Speaking on social media platform <a href="https://x.com/rocket2guns/status/2010559063088934997" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">X</a>, Hall revealed earlier today that <em>Icarus </em>clocked up just shy of a million base game sales during the Steam sale, and that RocketWerkz also managed to sell just under a quarter of a million "DLC units".</p><p>As a quick reminder, <em>Icarus </em>was on offer at a pretty hefty discount during the sale; while the game would usually set you back $35 (as, indeed, it would if you picked it up now), buying it during the Steam winter sale would have cost you just $3.50.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Icarus </em>racked up a pretty healthy sales total during the Steam winter sale.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There are several DLC packs available for <em>Icarus</em>, including three major expansions and a number of smaller additions to the game. Hall doesn't break down which of the packs were most popular during the sale, unfortunately.</p><p>Still, given the fact that <em>Icarus </em>is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/icarus-release-date-takes-flight-this-december" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f3f90dad-acfd-4ecf-81f3-78c72b65f1bb" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">entering its fifth year</a>, getting a million-sale boost, however deep the discount may be, is a pretty impressive feat. There's clearly still an appetite for Hall's particular brand of session-based survival.</p><p>If you're not familiar with <em>Icarus</em>, it's a survival game that shares some of its DNA with extraction shooters. You can either choose to take on timed missions to complete objectives under pressure or simply explore <em>Icarus</em>' hostile terraformed environment at your own pace.</p><p><em>Icarus</em>' popularity has almost certainly been aided by the pedigree of its creator; Dean Hall is also one of the people responsible for perennially popular zombie survival game <em>DayZ</em>, so his name lends gravitas and credence to this title as well.</p>
<p>Right now, <em>Icarus </em>is only available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1149460/ICARUS/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">PC via Steam</a>, but it's coming to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S sometime this year as well. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Just a week or so after setting a new record for concurrent users (CCU), Steam has now broken that record as well, passing a major CCU milestone in the process.</p><p>A quick look at the SteamDB <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/753/charts/#max" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">charts</a> for overall players shows that the platform hit an all-time high of 42,042,778 players yesterday, comfortably passing the 42-million-player barrier as well.</p><p>As a reminder, Steam last <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steam-concurrent-user-count-record-january-2026" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7be73f4e-884f-478a-a432-b10c198a1f4a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">broke its CCU record on January 5th</a>, when the platform registered a high of 41,816,052 players simultaneously online. It looks like the meteoric rise in popularity of Valve's platform is showing no signs of slowing down, despite Steam entering its 23rd year in 2026.</p><figure role="group">

<p>As noted by user <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/morwull.bsky.social/post/3mc5qaakaj22w" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Alejandro LL over on Bluesky</a>, the in-game player count peak record was also broken last week, with 13.4 million players enjoying games on Steam at the same time at one point. That's only a very, very slight increase over last week's figure, but it's still impressive.</p><p>By this metric, it's safe to say that Steam is very much the most popular PC gaming storefront, and players are buying games in their droves on Valve's platform as well.</p><p>Some of last year's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steam-best-of-2025" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="506dd7fd-a10c-4745-bcb4-ef7cfe0636c8" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">best-selling</a> and highest-grossing Steam games include perennial favorites like <em>GTA Online </em>and <em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em>, as well as much-vaunted single-player RPG <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em>, which achieved <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-3m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c5a6dab0-4602-48f3-8a89-7254df3e04d7" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">some pretty impressive sales numbers</a>.</p><p>However, Steam's best-seller list was also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/almost-20-of-top-new-sellers-on-steam-in-2025-used-generative-ai" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="16d0c419-db96-434f-99c7-9e50c881e987" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">rife with games that used generative AI</a>, an issue that continues to cause deep divisions; some <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hooded-horse-no-gen-ai-contracts" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4bf049e2-a4f8-41a0-b834-8030bfbcc977" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">slam AI</a> for its environmental impact and low-quality asset generation, while others consider it to be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-generative-ai-characters-pubg-inzoi" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5b68d64e-aec4-43ca-8198-297e274eb0d3" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">a boon during development</a>.</p><figure role="group">
