            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has reneged on one of its promises for last year's <em>Skate </em>reboot, namely that the game will feature "no map areas locked behind paywalls".</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/skate/news/dev-update-s3-skatepass-grom-and-the-future" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">news post</a> outlining what's coming to <em>Skate </em>in the future, EA says that the game's third season will introduce the new Isle of Grom map, which has been expanded and filled with new areas to explore.</p><p>Initially, only <em>Skate </em>Pass Premium holders will be able to explore the Isle of Grom, but after the first month, the map will be opened up to everyone for a "very special multi-week event". That event is limited, though; afterwards, you'll have to pay in one form or another to access the Isle of Grom.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Skate</em>'s new map is pretty much locked behind a paywall. Yuck.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>After the aforementioned "very special" event, you'll either need to hold the <em>Skate </em>Pass Premium or pay in-game Rip Chips to access the Isle of Grom, and the latter will only net you a 24-hour pass, so it's not permanent.</p><p>Technically speaking - and I mean real fine-print technical here - the new map isn't really locked behind a paywall per se, because you can theoretically access it without paying real money.</p><p>Still, though, I'd say this is a contravention of what EA <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/skate-4-now-titled-skate-will-be-free-to-play" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="966b1818-c2c5-4648-9899-942a622c5274" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">promised all the way back in 2022</a> in spirit, if not absolutely in letter. It's not a great look to need to argue the finer detail rather than the broader picture.</p><p>Perhaps more insultingly, in response to a player asking why EA stepped away from the no-maps-behind-paywalls promise, the company rather dismissively <a href="https://x.com/skate/status/2024539083259654345" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">says</a> that "plans have to change" sometimes, and that "that's part of the deal when you're building in public".</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Welp.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In fact, one X <a href="https://x.com/its6767/status/2024645684272480620" rel="nofollow">user</a> points out that just one week ago, <em>Skate</em>'s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260213192103/https://www.ea.com/games/skate/skate/faq" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">website FAQ</a> declared that "new areas of San Vansterdam (the game's world) will always be free and available to all players...if it's there, you can go there". Suffice it to say the FAQ <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/skate/faq" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">no longer</a> features that passage.</p><p>Of course, the obvious question to ask here is this: if EA can walk back this promise, what's to stop the company ditching the others in the above image too? How long before <em>Skate </em>features pay-to-win elements, paid loot boxes, or paid gameplay advantages?</p><p>For now, at the very least, if you want to access <em>Skate</em>'s Isle of Grom map beyond May, you're going to have to pay for it in some form. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Well, it's official: there's going to be a Pokemon Presents showcase next week, and it'll mark the series' 30th anniversary with new information about what's on the horizon for <em>Pokemon</em>.</p><p>Of course, a Pokemon Presents has taken place on February 27th <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-presents-february-2025-all-reveals-and-announcements" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5a01851b-ea44-4f17-a719-ac2be1497b34" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">every year</a> for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-a-announced" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4987919d-a3d8-416f-8dc9-216f8246a8cf" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">past few years</a>, so it probably shouldn't come as too much of a surprise that that's the date for this year's presentation as well.</p><p>The showcase will air at 6am Pacific (that's 9am Eastern and 2pm GMT), and it'll give us a look at "the latest news and updates from the world of <em>Pokemon</em>" before what The Pokemon Company describes as "a year's worth of <em>Pokemon </em>fun" begins.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Could the followup to <em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet </em>finally be on the horizon?</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We already know one thing that's going to be featured during the show, namely the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-firered-leafgreen-switch" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="057d121c-d519-4dfa-af54-03ce59fa9f52" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Switch release of <em>Pokemon FireRed and LeafGreen</em></a>, which was confirmed earlier today. The games will launch just after the showcase concludes.</p><p>What else we'll see during this Pokemon Presents is a mystery for now, although we can make some educated guesses; it's likely that mobile games <em>Pokemon Cafe ReMix </em>and <em>Pokemon Masters EX</em> will appear, as they usually do, and we'll probably hear from <em>Pokemon Unite </em>as well.</p><p>Outside of the realms of virtual certainty, I'd be very surprised indeed if this presentation doesn't contain at least a nod to the upcoming tenth <em>Pokemon </em>generation. Back in October, a massive <em>Pokemon </em>leak <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-leak-2025-gen-10-more" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c5a709d9-d361-46d9-823d-aa0957eba8ed" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">seemingly revealed details about gen ten</a>, so the clock's ticking on an official reveal.</p><p>We may also see more DLC announced for last year's <em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>. The game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-a-sales" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2d5d3818-49a2-4447-89bf-e19e298fa0df" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">sold very well indeed</a>, so a second DLC pack after <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension-dlc-release-date" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1a7fab66-8e9f-461b-8e80-b39e300cbd1a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">December's <em>Mega Dimension</em></a><em> </em>seems like a good idea.</p>
<p>Whatever gets announced, the next Pokemon Presents will be airing on February 27th at 6am PT/9am ET/2pm GMT. It'll be viewable on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@pokemon" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">YouTube</a> or <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/pokemon" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Twitch</a>.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has revealed that <em>NieR: Automata </em>has crossed another major sales milestone, and if a new teaser is to be believed, more <em>NieR </em>could finally be on the way.</p><p>Per <a href="https://x.com/NieRGame/status/2024800054004138394" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a message</a> on the official <em>NieR </em>X account, <em>NieR: Automata </em>has officially sold over 10 million copies. That figure counts across both digital and physical sales, naturally, and it also includes all platforms on which the game is currently available.</p><p>The new sales figure means that <em>NieR: Automata </em>has racked up another million sales for itself <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nier-automata-sales-9m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="144a48d3-7eae-44a0-bba4-85056ad4cc63" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">since December 2024</a>.

</figure>
<p>There's reason to hope that more <em>NieR </em>could be coming, too. At the conclusion of a new video celebrating the 10 million achievement, a message simply reads "<em>NieR: Automata </em>to be continued...".</p><p>It's worth noting that the rest of the video is entirely in Japanese, so it's possible that this is a mistranslation, or that the message simply points to more <em>NieR: Automata </em>media in future. Perhaps a current-gen port could even be on the cards.</p><p>Still, <em>NieR: Automata </em>remains the last new mainline release in the <em>NieR </em>series at time of writing, so I don't think it's unreasonable to hope that Square Enix could be gearing up to give Yoko Taro another chance to hold the reins this year.</p><p>You can watch the aforementioned video, which celebrates <em>NieR: Automata</em>'s achievements over the years, right here.</p>
<p>If you're unfamiliar with <em>NieR: Automata</em>, it's an action game that serves as a collaboration between iconoclastic designer Yoko Taro and action luminaries PlatinumGames.</p><p>The game revolves around 2B, an android who slowly begins to question her existence as a war with machines threatens to develop into something more complex than she initially believed.</p><p>You can check out <em>NieR: Automata </em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/524220/NieRAutomata/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/nier-automata/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 4</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/nierautomata-become-as-gods-edition/BPPZVT8BZ15N" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox One</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/NieR-Automata-The-End-of-YoRHa-Edition-2232461.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch</a>, and it's playable on current-gen systems through backwards compatibility as well.

That's not too shabby, and we can probably expect <em>Nioh 3 </em>to compete with its forebears on this front, at the very least.</p><figure role="group">

</figure>
<p>In general, it seems that <em>Nioh 3 </em>is part of an upward trend for Koei Tecmo when it comes to initial sales; back in 2024, the studio also revealed that its Bakumatsu-era RPG <em>Rise of the Ronin </em>had surpassed the first two <em>Nioh </em>games <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rise-of-ronin-sales-koei-tecmo-financials" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="67f991d6-0e1a-4301-9f20-4cef49c020a1" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">in terms of launch sales</a>.</p><p>If you're not familiar with <em>Nioh 3</em>, it is, believe it or not, the third game in the <em>Nioh </em>series, which blends <em>Souls</em>-esque combat and exploration with a focus on loot gathering and fast-paced combat.</p><p>In contrast to its predecessors, <em>Nioh 3 </em>allows you to travel between various eras in Japanese history, including the aforementioned Bakumatsu era, as well as the Edo, Sengoku, and Heian periods.</p><p>Much like in Team Ninja's other Soulslike RPG <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/wo-long-fallen-dynasty" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ded52dd9-4edb-4dd7-b4c6-09ff708bab63" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty</em></a>, you'll meet and interact with historical figures from throughout these periods, including the likes of Hattori Hanzo, Minamoto no Yoshitsune, and Himiko.</p>
<p>You can check out <em>Nioh 3 </em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3681010/Nioh_3/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/nioh-3/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a>. There's been no mention of ports to other systems yet, but given that <em>Nioh </em>has historically been exclusive to PlayStation (and PC), it's unlikely.
