            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With the release of Magic’s first ever space set in Edge of Eternities, another frontier was also crossed: that of the Standard rotation.</p>

<p>Standard is magic’s premiere tournament rotating format, and formerly its most played format. While the casual play of Commander has taken that crown, Standard is still played, especially online and it is the regional qualifier format come August. While the format was recently played at Pro Tour Final Fantasy, the decks from that event will need changing because of Wizards <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/banned-and-restricted-june-30-2025" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Banned and Restricted Announcement – June 30, 2025">banning 7 cards</a> after the event, and standard rotation happening with the release of&nbsp;<em>Edge of Eternities</em>.</p>

<h2>What is MTG Standard Rotation?</h2>

<p>When a format rotates, certain sets stop being legal for the format. Generally speaking, a number of sets rotate at once, in a predefined pattern. Previously, Standard had been on a 2 year cycle, meaning that it would rotate a year worth of sets at the start of the Magic year (traditionally September), leaving behind 3 or 4 sets along with the newly released set.</p>

<p>However, in 2023 Wizards of the Coast announced that Standard was moving to a <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/revitalizing-standard" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Revitalizing Standard">3 year rotation schedule</a>. Thus sets will be legal for at least 3 years (<em>Foundations </em>stays legal through at least 2029), before rotating. They further refined it in 2024 with the release of <em>Foundations</em>, <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/aligning-the-universes-making-all-our-sets-legal-in-all-our-formats" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Aligning the Universes: Making All Our Sets Legal in All Our Formats">announcing that following</a> the <em>Edge of Eternities </em>rotation, there will be no rotation until 2027 so that rotation is moved to happening at the start of the calendar year.</p>

<h2>What sets are rotating out of Standard with <em>Edge of Eternities</em>?</h2>

<p>The following sets will cease to be legal following the official release of <em>Edge of Eternities</em>:</p>

<h3>Dimir Midrange&nbsp;</h3>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dimir-midrange.jpg?itok=wTNsteat 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dimir-midrange.jpg?itok=eD5hXhb6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><a href="https://mtgdecks.net/Standard/dimir-midrange-decklist-by-forge-2568035" rel="nofollow">Dimir Midrange by _Forge_</a></figcaption></figure><p>One of the top-decks post-bannings, Dimir Midrange aims to set up small value creatures, often with evasion to hit your opponent and sneak in <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dsk/220/kaito-bane-of-nightmares" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Kaito, Bane of Nightmares ">Kaito, Bane of Nightmares </a>to help create overwhelming card advantage along with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dsk/51/enduring-curiosity" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Enduring Curiosity">Enduring Curiosity</a>, and then sit back and control the game as it pushes through.</p>

<p><strong>Losing From Rotation</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mom/58/faerie-mastermind" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Faerie Mastermind"><u>Faerie Mastermind</u></a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/faerie-mastermind.jpg?itok=d-kN45Qz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/faerie-mastermind.jpg?itok=x47sFBEt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Yuta Takahashi’s World Championship card had been a strong card in the deck as it helped provide an evasive threat that could be flashed in and was particularly good against cards like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dsk/136/fear-of-missing-out" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Fear of Missing Out">Fear of Missing Out</a> as it gained the deck free card advantage.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dmu/107/sheoldred-the-apocalypse" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Sheoldred, the Apocalypse"><u>Sheoldred, the Apocalypse</u></a></p>

<p>Some of the biggest and baddest black threats to walk the format are rotating out. While Sheoldred is no longer the monster it was early in its run in Standard, it would see play either main or board for these decks and was especially strong against Izzet Vivi Cauldron. This loss, and the next, also impact other black midrange decks like Demons.</p>

<p><u>Black Removal Spells </u>– <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dmu/89/cut-down" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Cut Down ">Cut Down</a> / <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/one/108/sheoldreds-edict" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Sheoldred’s Edict">Sheoldred’s Edict</a> / <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/bro/102/go-for-the-throat" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Go For The Throat">Go For The Throat</a> / <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mat/12/blot-out" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Blot Out">Blot Out</a> / <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/one/81/anoint-with-affliction" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Anoint with Affliction">Anoint with Affliction</a></p>

<p>The removal package Dimir Midrange decks were running is getting gutted with rotation. The biggest loss here is Cut Down for all the black decks, as this was the little 1 mana answer that could, answering a huge variety of threats up to about 3 mana at instant speed. It was particularly useful against Izzet Cauldron as it could kill all their threats.</p>

<p><strong>Replacements</strong></p>

<p><u>For Faerie Mastermind</u></p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/lci/63/malcolm-alluring-scoundrel" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Malcolm, Alluring Scoundrel">Malcolm, Alluring Scoundrel</a>: Perhaps the most straightforward switch is adding another 2 mana flier that provides some card quality advantage with its looting.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/lci/102/deep-cavern-bat" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Deep-Cavern Bat">Deep-Cavern Bat</a>: Some of the Dimir Midrange Decks had been cutting down on Bat counts, but the leaving of Faerie Mastermind seems like a good reason to up it again to keep having enough early evasive creatures.</p>

<p><u>For Sheoldred, the Apocalypse</u></p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/big/9/harvester-of-misery" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Harvester of Misery">Harvester of Misery</a>: One way the black decks may try to fill two holes with one card is Harvester of Misery, who is a sizable 5 drop, but also can be discarded earlier in the game for some cheap spot removal of -2/-2.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/97/elegy-acolyte" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Elegy Acolyte">Elegy Acolyte</a>: From <em>Edge of Eternities</em>, this acolyte is a 4/4 lifelink for 4 giving a passable body for this role, but importantly it can help you draw cards (also replacing <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/bro/95/gix-yawgmoth-praetor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Gix, Yawgmoth Praetor">Gix</a> for those lists that ran it), and make tokens if a non-land left the battlefield.</p>

<p><u>For Black&nbsp; Removal</u></p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/otj/106/shoot-the-sheriff" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Shoot the Sheriff">Shoot the Sheriff</a>: While there are some creatures that this will randomly miss, Shoot the Sheriff hits most of the important creatures in Standard and is importantly a 2 mana instant.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shoot-the-sheriff.jpg?itok=3JbFk0vY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shoot-the-sheriff.jpg?itok=QaudHBd6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/122/tragic-trajectory" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Tragic Trajectory">Tragic Trajectory</a>: A general step down from Cut Down, Tragic Trajectory is the closest to the 1 mana kill an early creature with some flexibility that there is. The fact that it’s only -2/-2 with potential for more as well as a sorcery may doom it, as missing 3 toughness misses key creatures like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dsk/136/fear-of-missing-out" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Fear of Missing Out">Fear of Missing Out</a>, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/248/vivi-ornitier" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Vivi Ornitier">Vivi</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mkm/92/long-goodbye" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Long Goodbye">Long Goodbye</a>: If Tragic Trajectory can’t fill the hole, it’s possible Long Goodbye may as it is able to take out some of the cheap creatures that cost 3 mana or less that Trajectory can’t. It is also an instant, and it might occasionally matter that it can avoid counters from Izzet decks.</p>

<h3>Izzet Vivi Cauldron</h3>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/izzet-cauldron.jpg?itok=IUpZN7ye 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/izzet-cauldron.jpg?itok=k4ymErN1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><a href="https://mtgdecks.net/Standard/s-izzet-cauldron-decklist-by-thenerdysteve-2564171" rel="nofollow">Izzet Cauldron by TheNerdySteve</a></figcaption></figure><p>The other seeming top tier deck with Dimir Midrange is centered around everyone’s favorite little wizard. This is an aggro-combo deck aiming to win either by beating you down quickly with giant creatures, or do combo works with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/woe/242/agathas-soul-cauldron" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Agatha’s Soul Cauldron">Agatha’s Soul Cauldron</a>.</p>

<p>Core to the deck are cards like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mkm/67/profts-eidetic-memory" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Proft’s Eidetic Memory">Proft’s Eidetic Memory</a>, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dft/138/marauding-mako" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Marauding Mako">Marauding Mako</a> that take advantage of all the draw and discarding in the deck, which the core of cards are aimed at producing to let the deck punch face. If that plan gets stalled or stymied, it merely relies on it’s combo plan it is setting up of getting <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/248/vivi-ornitier" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Vivi Ornitier ">Vivi Ornitier </a>on <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/woe/242/agathas-soul-cauldron" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Agatha's Soul Cauldron">Agatha’s Soul Cauldron</a> and then using its creatures pumped with counters to generate mana. From there, drawing cards is generally easy for more, and the deck finishes with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mom/171/voldaren-thrillseeker" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Voldaren Thrillseeker">Voldaran Thrillseeker</a> if huge creatures aren’t enough.</p>

<p><strong>Losing From Rotation</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mom/171/voldaren-thrillseeker" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Voldaren Thrillseeker">Voldaren Thrillseeker</a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/voldaren-thrillseeker.jpg?itok=IeeFQKWb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/voldaren-thrillseeker.jpg?itok=tydPVXaH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Having dodged the post-PT bans, Vivi Cauldron also dodges losing almost anything to rotation, although it does lose its combo finisher of choice. Thrillseeker was an easy way to launch the deck’s giant creatures at an opponent, and also served as an enabler by handing out counters.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Replacements</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dft/121/draconautics-engineer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Draconautics Engineer">Draconautics Engineer</a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/draconautics-engineer.jpg?itok=2Pkyzgwd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/draconautics-engineer.jpg?itok=wKPo2_UR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Draconautics Engineer is nowhere as good as Voldaran Thrillseeker for Vivi, as it lacks the direct clean finish punch that Thrillseeker gave, and the additional counter synergy it functioned with, but the Engineer’s pair of abilities will work with him under Agatha’s Cauldron to let team Vivi make a bunch of dragons and haste them. It seems unlikely though that it will get the same 3of spot that Voldaren had before.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/otj/50/geralf-the-fleshwright" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Geralf, the Fleshwright">Geralf, the Fleshwright</a></p>

<p>In part because the Vivi decks may choose to diversify their finisher options some, or seeking cards that can provide additional value. Geralf doesn’t work with the Cauldron himself, but instead the way the deck’s engine works with wanting tons of spells played on its key turn to make tons of tokens.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/woe/246/gingerbrute" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Gingerbrute">Gingerbrute</a></p>

<p>Our last option here is a little sneaky, but Gingerbrute’s use here would be that it could essentially grant unblockability to the creatures for 1 mana. This would serve as a way for them to get past things like token hordes from Mono White.</p>

<h3>White Based Control (Mono White, Azorious, Jeskai)</h3>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/azorius-control.jpg?itok=39fOn_XR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/azorius-control.jpg?itok=qS782JIb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><a href="https://mtgdecks.net/Standard/azorius-control-decklist-by-ryuji-haga-2565267" rel="nofollow">Azorius Control by Ryuji Haga</a></figcaption></figure><p>Control decks containing white come in a lot of variety in Standard now, from the <a href="https://mtgdecks.net/Standard/mono-white-tokens-decklist-by-al-azif-2565284" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Mono White Control">mono-white token control decks </a>making use of <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/blb/6/caretakers-talent" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Caretaker’s Talent">Caretaker’s Talent</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdm/11/elspeth-storm-slayer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Elspeth, Storm Slayer">Elspeth</a>, and a variety of similar token makers alongside removal, to decks that are based in blue and white (as pictured above), or going into <a href="https://mtgdecks.net/Standard/jeskai-control-decklist-by-mark-benedict-cabrera-2554462" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Jeskai Control">Jeskai</a> with white, blue, and red.</p>

<p>All of these are losing some of the same cards, with Mono White losing an additional card that might cause the deck to abandon its previous mono-white status. That may cause these decks to homogenize, especially as the metagame stabilizes, into just two decks.</p>

<p><strong>Losing From Rotation</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/bro/11/lay-down-arms" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Lay Down Arms"><u>Lay Down Arms</u></a><br>
A loss only for Mono White Token Control, Lay Down Arms was a major reason for the deck staying in mono-white as it gave it a 1 mana removal option. The ability to exile creatures based on your land count, and gain 3 life for it was a significant advantage in a format with a pair of notable decks that care about graveyards.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dmu/36/temporary-lockdown" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Temporary Lockdown"><u>Temporary Lockdown</u></a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/temporary-lockdown.jpg?itok=NSA9AhsT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/temporary-lockdown.jpg?itok=2iZ19SG2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>A loss also for the Orzhov/Esper Fairy Bounce decks, Temporary Lockdown has been a format staple. While not quite as prominent as it was a month ago when it was fighting <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdm/103/cori-steel-cutter" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Cori-Steel Cutter">Cori-Steel Cutter</a>, Temporary Lockdown is still seeing a lot of play in white decks that don’t make tokens and want to exert some control over the game. It is an early game stopper and its ability to remove anything that costs 2 or less was highly prized.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mom/40/sunfall" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Sunfall"><u>Sunfall</u></a></p>

<p>Previously the go-to top end mass wipe, Sunfall’s ability to exile creatures, and give a token back to the control player to hit back at the aggro player or block in the future. The key loss here is the exile portion for these decks.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Replacements</strong></p>

<p><u>For Lay Down Arms</u></p>

<p>There aren’t really any direct replacements for Lay Down Arms that would encourage the deck to stay mono-white. Instead you could see the deck merge some with Azorius or explore other options like black, but nothing matches the removal efficiency they got with Lay Down Arms.</p>

<p><u>For Temporary Lockdown</u></p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dsk/32/split-up" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Split Up">Split Up</a></p>

<p>Jeskai sometimes already prefers Split Up, but it seems like this may be the first replacement option for Temporary Lockdown. That said, Temporary Lockdown’s hitting of various permanent types would be missed by control decks.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/27/pinnacle-starcage" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pinnacle Starcage">Pinnacle Starcage</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another major replacement option would be Pinnacle Starcage, which functions very similarly. It does miss enchantments however, and artifacts are more vulnerable to destruction generally, especially with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fdn/188/abrade" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Abrade">Abrade</a> in the format.</p>

<p><u>For Sunfall</u></p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/7/beyond-the-quiet" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Beyond the Quiet">Beyond the Quiet</a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/beyond-the-quiet.jpg?itok=0ejmoWwW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/beyond-the-quiet.jpg?itok=AQZZvgdY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>If exiling is needed from a white sweeper, Beyond the Quiet is going to be the answer, as for 5 mana it exiles all creatures and spacecrafts, something else that no sweeper does at that cost.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fdn/140/day-of-judgment" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Day of Judgment">Day of Judgment</a></p>

<p>A mana cheaper, Day of Judgment though doesn’t exile creatures which is a significant difference. It also doesn’t give you a potentially large creature to rebound with, but it's a solid no questions asked board wipe.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/38/ultima" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Ultima">Ultima</a></p>

<p>Ultima is already seeing some play, and it provides a way to avoid death triggers by ending the turn right there. However it also fails to exile creatures, though it does wipe out artifacts as well - so you don't want to run it alongside Pinnacle Starcage.</p>

<h3>Red Based Aggro</h3>

First of all: Boros Convoke is dead, as convoke cards are gone. Second, Boros as a deck is still alive, as are Gruul, Lizards, and Mice as all various takes on getting small little red dudes down and backing them up with burn.</p>

<p>The biggest hits to red happened with the recent bannings, as losing <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdm/103/cori-steel-cutter" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Cori-Steel Cutter ">Cori-Steel Cutter </a>took red decks out of the top tier, especially when combined with the further bannings of <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/woe/142/monstrous-rage" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Monstrous Rage">Monstrous Rage</a> and its best 1 drop <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/blb/138/heartfire-hero" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Heartfire Hero">Heartfire Hero</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Losing From Rotation</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/Seed%20of%20Hope" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="https://scryfall.com/card/mom/204/seed-of-hope"><u>Seed of Hope</u></a></p>

<p>Run by Gruul Delirium, Seed of Hope is a card used to quickly get some cards in the graveyard to help trigger their synergies and essentially cycles. Gruul Delirium needs to find a way to quickly stock its graveyard too.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/bro/144/monastery-swiftspear" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Monastery Swiftspear"><u>Monastery Swiftspear</u></a></p>

It’s not irreplaceable, but the decks will need to adapt to losing this good creature.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/one/134/gleeful-demolition" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Gleeful Demolition"><u>Gleeful Demolition</u></a></p>

<p>For more go-wide options, especially the dying convoke decks, Gleeful Demolition was a go-to option as it could quickly make several tokens. Nothing matches Gleeful Demolition pure token ratio of 3 tokens for 1 mana, which was an explosive burst these decks relied on to power their aggressive push, and figuring out how to survive its loss is their biggest challenge.</p>

<p><strong>Replacements</strong></p>

<p><u>For Seed of Hope</u></p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dft/171/molt-tender" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Molt Tender">Molt Tender</a></p>

<p>Run already by Insidious Roots, Molt Tender lacks the explosive graveyard loading of Seed of Hope, but provides a 1 drop who can help load the graveyard.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/lci/178/cenote-scout" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Cenote Scout">Cenote Scout</a></p>

<p>Another 1 drop, Cenote Scout’s exploration can functionally mill at least one card sometimes, or help get through land draws.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/185/esper-origins-summon:-esper-maduin" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Esper Origins">Esper Origins</a></p>

<p>While it costs 2 mana, the fact that Esper Origins can get 3 cards in the graveyard, and helps smooth draws makes it in some ways a closer fit for Seed of Hope. There is also the upside that in a longer running game, Esper Origins can be flashbacked to provide a body, and eventually an overrun option.</p>

<p><u>For Monastery Swiftspear</u></p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dft/132/greasewrench-goblin" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Greasewrench Goblin">Greasewrench Goblin</a></p>

<p>While lacking haste, this goblin provides 2 power for 1 mana and the ability to recharge by dumping excess lands for new cards and grow him up to 3 power later in the game.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/139/kavaron-harrier" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Kavaron Harrier">Kavaron Harrier</a></p>

<p>From <em>Edge of Eternities</em>, if your deck cares about artifacts at all, this 2 powered 1 drop is another good fill in, and it provides a mana outlet with an additional attacker come the midgame and keeping it relevant.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fdn/91/kellan-planar-trailblazer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Kellan, Planar Trailblazer">Kellan, Planar Trailblazer</a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kellan-planar-trailblazer.jpg?itok=3kwun8JS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kellan-planar-trailblazer.jpg?itok=2M_kUCWt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Another 2 powered 1 drop, Kellan here is a mana sink in the style of Figure of Destiny, and can over time help gain card advantage and eventually be a 3 powered double striker.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fdn/632/stromkirk-noble" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Stromkirk Noble">Stormkirk Noble</a></p>

<p>Remembering him from my days playing vampires, this guy was reprinted in Foundations, and more creatures are humans than you might think. With a single hit or two, he gets quite powerful and could be an option depending on how the metagame shakes out.</p>

<p><u>For Gleeful Demolition</u></p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdm/186/frontline-rush" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Frontline Rush">Frontline Rush</a></p>

<p>While it’s twice as much mana, Frontline Rush only makes 2 tokens, but it also can double as a finisher spell. Some decks have already adopted it, but expect any decks wanting to lean on token strategies to pick it up more.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdm/122/stadium-headliner" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Stadium Headliner">Stadium Headliner</a></p>

<p>Nothing replaces the explosiveness or mana to token ratio of Gleeful Demolition, but Stadium Headliner provides a quick 1 drop who can make an additional token each turn it attacks, and essentially an extra <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mkm/8/case-of-the-gateway-express" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Case of the Gateway Express">Case of the Getaway Express</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Darrington Press has released new playtest material for <em>Daggerheart</em>. The latest batch of <em>Daggerheart</em> playtest material of material doesn't introduce a new ancestry or a new class, but a new transformation mechanic, allowing players to become monstrous vampires or werewolves at the table.</p>



<p>The new <em>Daggerheart</em> playtest material was added in an update to <a href="https://www.daggerheart.com/thevoid/" rel="nofollow">The Void</a>, Darrington Press' page for new playtest material. Similar to <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons'</em> <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/latest-dungeons-dragons-2024-unearthed-arcana-revisits-arcane-subclasses" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Unearthed Arcana</a>, the page provides players with an early look at experimental gameplay mechanics and ideas.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/daggerheart-playtest-material-transformation-image.jpg?itok=Bm16HyTY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/daggerheart-playtest-material-transformation-image.jpg?itok=22bfQkf2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Those players can then provide feedback to Darrington Press. Based on that feedback, the material may be adjusted and released in official supplements down the line.</p>

<p>As the name suggests, the new transformation represents changes to a player's character in <em>Daggerheart</em>. These changes can be done for narrative purposes by the GM or can be used as a character creation option. The playtest material contains rules and cards for six transformations: Vampire, Werewolf, Demigod, Ghost, Reanimated, and Shapeshifter.</p>

<p>How the transformation <em>Daggerheart</em> playtest material works in-game is that your character adds the corresponding transformation card to their loadout, ignoring their domain card limit. A character can only have one transformation total. That transformation card then provides an appropriate benefit and drawback.</p>

<p>The playtest material encourages gaming tables to figure out the origin of this transformation alongside the implications of the power going wrong. For example, vampire and werewolf transformations are staples of pop culture; get bitten and be forever changed. But while a werewolf player benefits from a Wolf Form, sacrificing Stress for a damage boost, they can potentially massacre their party with the Frenzy drawback.</p>

<p>The more eclectic forms do encourage some more creativity. Reanimated and Ghost do contain potential for dark fantasy and horror adventures, and the Demigod does invite some intriguing worldbuilding and roleplay potential if done well.</p>

<p>The new transformation Daggerheart playtest material, which includes rules and the transformation cards, are free to download.</p>
