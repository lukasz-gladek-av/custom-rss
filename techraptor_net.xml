            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/seafarer-the-ship-sim-astragon<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Construction Simulator&nbsp;</em>studio Astragon has announced&nbsp;<em>Seafarer: The Ship Sim</em>, and as the title suggests, it'll put you in command of your very own ship.</p>

<p>Built in Unreal Engine 5,&nbsp;<em>Seafarer&nbsp;</em>promises to do for maritime simulation what&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/get-to-work-in-construction-simulator-this-september" rel="nofollow"><em>Construction Simulator&nbsp;</em>did for, well, construction</a>. Astragon describes the game as a "fully interactive ship experience" with a variety of missions and two different game modes to enjoy.</p>

<p>In Story Mode, you'll take on "unique missions" and receive rewards from different factions. You might be transporting cargo one minute, then fighting fires on open waters the next. Astragon is even promising treasure retrieval missions, which...well, who hasn't dreamt of that at some point?</p>

<p>You won't just be piloting one type of ship, either. Astragon is promising a variety of different ships, "from small tugboats to gigantic freighters", so you'll be able to get a sense of what it's like to sail ships big and small.</p>

<p>The game will offer a variety of different tasks to complete, as well. You won't just be sailing your ship; you'll also have to operate machinery and even use water cannons to put out fires.</p>

<p>If you're expecting ship combat from&nbsp;<em>Seafarer: The Ship Sim</em>, though, you might want to look elsewhere. This is very much not a pirate sim, nor is it an arcade-style ship battler; it's an Astragon simulation through and through, by the looks of things.</p>




<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Seafarer: The Ship Sim&nbsp;</em>when it launches for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2582140/Seafarer_The_Ship_Sim/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a> and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/seafarer-the-ship-sim-bbbc39" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Epic Games Store</a> this summer. It'll set you back $24.99 and will be an Early Access release to begin with.</p>
