            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-darktide-nightmares-and-visions-update-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Fatshark has revealed the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Darktide&nbsp;</em>Nightmares and Visions update, a major patch for the game that will bring a new game activity, a rework for the Ogryn talent tree, and more later this month.</p>

<p>Set to release on March 25th across all platforms, Nightmares and Visions' first big addition to&nbsp;<em>Darktide&nbsp;</em>is the Mortis Trials activity, which is essentially a wave-based Horde-style mode in which you'll be able to build "new and exciting playstyles" each time you enter a trial.</p>

<p>Beating these trials will reward you with "secret information on some characters present on the Mourningstar", so it sounds rather like&nbsp;<em>Darktide&nbsp;</em>is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-marine-2-datavault-update" rel="nofollow">following in the footsteps of&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-marine-2-datavault-update" rel="nofollow">Space Marine 2</a>&nbsp;</em>by introducing extra lore as a reward for slaughtering the Imperium's enemies.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-darktide-nightmares-and-visions-update-ogryn.jpg?itok=7WLbriCS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-darktide-nightmares-and-visions-update-ogryn.jpg?itok=RI2cHE5q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Warhammer 40k: Darktide&nbsp;</em>is getting a new update later this month, and Ogryn players should be happy with what's coming.</figcaption></figure><p>You can also look forward to a rework for the Havoc game mode, with the endgame experience getting higher difficulty, a reassessed ranking system, and other miscellaneous improvements. Fatshark says it'll reveal more about the changes to Havoc soon.</p>

<p>If you're an Ogryn player, you'll also be pleased to know that the Ogryn talent tree is being reworked to give you "more build opportunities", and a few Ogryn weapons will also be tweaked to make the big guy feel a little better to play.</p>

<p>All in all, Fatshark says it has "37 pages of notes" relating to Nightmares and Visions. It's not clear whether the developer is referring to the patch notes with that number, but the update is set to be a big one, at any rate.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Darktide</em>, it's effectively Fatshark's grimdark&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k&nbsp;</em>answer to its horde-based FPS&nbsp;<em>Vermintide</em>.</p>

<p>The game, which sees you battling the minions of the Chaos God Nurgle as an Operative in the Hive City of Tertium, has been out for a couple of years now on PC and Xbox, but it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-darktide-ps5-release-december" rel="nofollow">secured itself a PS5 release</a> late last year as well.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Darktide&nbsp;</em>on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1361210/Warhammer_40000_Darktide/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/EP4122-PPSA21255_00-0888672453602469" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/warhammer-40000-darktide/9nt3wc6rkbvq" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. The Nightmares and Visions update lands on March 25th.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ballistic-moon-closed-report-until-dawn</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/until-dawn-remake-studio-ballistic-moon-reportedly-effectively-closed.1126836/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ballistic-moon-closed-report-until-dawn<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>remake developer Ballistic Moon has reportedly been "effectively closed", with only a handful of employees remaining at the studio.</p>

<p>According to a report by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/until-dawn-remake-developer-ballistic-moon-effectively-closed/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Insider Gaming</a>, which cites "multiple sources with knowledge of the situation", the remaining staff at Ballistic Moon were let go in December. Those layoffs followed staff reductions back in September, just before the&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>remake's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/until-dawn-remake-release-date" rel="nofollow">October release</a>.</p>

<p>Insider Gaming's sources say that around 40 staff were let go in September, and that about 20 more lost their jobs in December, with only the studio's founders and "possibly" a few more employees remaining at Ballistic Moon. No developers, marketing execs, or PR folks are still there, apparently.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/until-dawn-remake-ballistic-moon-closed-rumor-screens.jpg?itok=mrDN0JH6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/until-dawn-remake-ballistic-moon-closed-rumor-screens.jpg?itok=XG57tRiK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>remake Ballistic Moon has apparently effectively ceased to exist.</figcaption></figure><p>Ballistic Moon's gutting effectively means that the&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>remake has nobody working on patches or updates; a source told Insider Gaming that people were "sharing bugs" to make Ballistic Moon aware of them, but that "there is no one working on patch support".</p>

<p>Apparently, Ballistic Moon's owners attempted to keep the ball rolling with regards to further support for&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn</em>, but Sony wasn't interested. Sources also told Insider Gaming that Ballistic Moon's owners were looking for new publishers for other projects, but they weren't successful.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it probably isn't a surprise that Ballistic Moon is in its current position. Reportedly,&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/until-dawn-remake-ps5-player-count-concord" rel="nofollow">debuted to a lower PS5 player count</a> than the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds" rel="nofollow">doomed shooter&nbsp;<em>Concord</em></a>, and its Steam player count peak of <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2172010/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">just over 2,600 players</a> isn't particularly noteworthy either.</p>

<p>Given that Sony currently seems to be in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-studio-visual-arts-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">middle</a> of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-leadership-shakeup" rel="nofollow">rethink</a> when it comes to its gaming operations, studios like Ballistic Moon are unfortunately likely to be the first in the gaming giant's firing line.</p>




<p>Of course, with respect to Ballistic Moon, I'd question the necessity of remaking&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>in the first place. The original's not particularly old, and it seems to me that a remaster along the lines of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-esrb" rel="nofollow"><em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>'s</a> would have worked just as well.</p>

<p>In any case, if you do want to see the fruits of Ballistic Moon's labor, the&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>remake is available now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2172010/Until_Dawn/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/until-dawn/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, and you can read our Tyler's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/until-dawn-2024-review-new-faces-old-blood" rel="nofollow">review of the game here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/skullgirls-hidden-variable-autumn-games-legal-dispute<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Skullgirls&nbsp;</em>developer Hidden Variable has announced it will cease all work on the franchise owing to an ongoing legal dispute with publisher Autumn Games.</p>

<p>In a post on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hiddenvariable.com/post/3ljotvjtpnk2o" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a> (spotted by ResetEra user <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/hidden-variable-ceases-development-on-skullgirls-ip-payment-dispute-publisher-autumn-games-seemingly-owes-1-2-million-to-hidden-variable.1126731/#post-136658811" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">dgamemaster</a>), Hidden Variable says it is "no longer involved" in developing any&nbsp;<em>Skullgirls&nbsp;</em>game, including&nbsp;<em>Skullgirls 2nd Encore</em>,&nbsp;<em>Skullgirls Mobile</em>, and "other&nbsp;<em>Skullgirls&nbsp;</em>IP-related efforts".</p>

<p>The studio says it's in the middle of a dispute with Autumn Games which has been escalated to "litigation filed in the Los Angeles County Superior Court", and that it won't be providing further comment on the matter until said issue is resolved.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skullgirls-2nd-encore-hidden-variable.jpg?itok=ipJVsscE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skullgirls-2nd-encore-hidden-variable.jpg?itok=l5GLWkQ9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Skullgirls&nbsp;</em>studio Hidden Variable is embroiled in a legal dispute with publisher Autumn Games.</figcaption></figure><p>Although Hidden Variable says it won't be commenting on the matter, dgamemaster sought out the <a href="https://trellis.law/doc/240911937/complaint" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">legal document</a> filed by the studio, and it looks as though the dispute comes down to missed payments.</p>

<p>Specifically, Hidden Variable appears to be alleging that Autumn Games failed to pay it a number of times between November and now, with payments amounting to $1.23m due to Hidden Variable on Autumn Games' behalf.</p>

<p>The developer says Autumn's actions were intentional, and that the publisher was intending to find a new developer for the&nbsp;<em>Skullgirls&nbsp;</em>games after it "unsuccessfully sought to sell its business".&nbsp;Ouch.</p>

<p>According to dgamemaster's post, Autumn Games has said that it intends to continue updating&nbsp;<em>Skullgirls&nbsp;</em>despite the dispute, but it hasn't specified which of the games it will be updating, nor when new updates will be made available.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skullgirls-2nd-encore-hidden-variable-beowulf-painwheel.jpg?itok=r2hSSRn3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skullgirls-2nd-encore-hidden-variable-beowulf-painwheel.jpg?itok=XiFBQ8T7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It looks like&nbsp;<em>Skullgirls&nbsp;</em>might still get updates, although we don't know when.</figcaption></figure><p>This isn't the first time&nbsp;<em>Skullgirls&nbsp;</em>has run into a spot of bother. Back in 2020, Autumn Games <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/skullgirls-publisher-kicks-lab-zero-games-off-project" rel="nofollow">kicked original developer Lab Zero off the IP</a>&nbsp;following <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/More-Victimized-Employees-Leave-Lab-Zero-Mike-Z" rel="nofollow">allegations made against that studio's head Mike Zaimont</a>.</p>

<p>Following those allegations, Zaimont subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mike-z-lays-off-all-remaining-lab-zero-games-employees" rel="nofollow">laid off all remaining Lab Zero employees</a>, with former staff going on to create a new studio by the name of Future Club. That studio would then work on&nbsp;<em>Skullgirls&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/former-lab-zero-devs-partner-with-hidden-variable-for-skullgirls-content" rel="nofollow">DLC</a>, thus completing the cycle.</p>

<p>The future of the&nbsp;<em>Skullgirls&nbsp;</em>franchise is currently unclear, although it sounds like Autumn Games intends to continue working on at least one of the games in the series. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-rivals-update-brings-new-clone-rumble-mode-and-more.1126779/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-update-clone-rumble<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>NetEase has released a new&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>update, and it's bringing a chaotic new game mode along with it, as well as a new Galacta-themed event and plenty of balance changes.</p>

<p>The update was released earlier today, but two of its biggest additions won't be going live until tomorrow: the Galacta's Cosmic Adventure event and the Clone Rumble game mode.</p>

<p>First up, Clone Rumble is a new mode that allows you and your teammates all to play as the same hero. If you've ever wondered what six Mr. Fantastics or six Rocket Raccoons could accomplish in a <em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>match, this mode is for you.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-rivals-clone-rumble-update-punisher.jpg?itok=Ux31xIdJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-rivals-clone-rumble-update-punisher.jpg?itok=V38OQTBO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Marvel Rivals</em>' new Clone Rumble update looks set to cause chaos.</figcaption></figure><p>The mode will only be available across three distinct three-day time periods, though. You'll be able to check it out between tomorrow and March 10th, and it'll then be available again from March 14th-March 17th and March 21st-March 24th.</p>

<p>As well as Clone Rumble, you can also check out the new Galacta's Cosmic Adventure event, which launches tomorrow as well. Joining the event will net you an exclusive Black Widow outfit for free, and this event runs until April 11th, so the time period isn't as limited as Clone Rumble.</p>

<p>Of course, you can also expect plenty of optimizations and gameplay tweaks in this update. It's well worth checking out the full&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/20250304/41548_1215931.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">patch notes</a> for the Clone Rumble update so you can stay up-to-date on what's going on.</p>




<p>It's been a strange few months for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>. The game launched back in December and reached <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-10m" rel="nofollow">10 million registered players</a> within just 72 hours, going on to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-40m" rel="nofollow">break the 40 million barrier</a> by NetEase's last count.</p>

<p>However, that didn't stop the Chinese gaming giant from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-studio-shockingly-closed-by-netease-laying-off-everyone" rel="nofollow">unexpectedly closing down the Seattle studio</a> responsible for developing the game. I guess nobody is really safe from the recent wave of industry cuts and layoffs, unfortunately.</p>

<p><em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>is available to play right now for free on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2767030/Marvel_Rivals/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010451" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/marvel-rivals/9n8pmw7qmd3d" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>
