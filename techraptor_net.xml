            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-dating-sim-announced-again<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>developer Pocketpair has seemingly announced a dating sim spinoff by the name of&nbsp;<em>More than Just Pals</em>, but there's reason to believe it might not be a serious prospect.</p>

<p>The game was revealed via <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1906687045130653704" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on X earlier today, in which Pocketpair calls the game "a <i>Palworld&nbsp;</i>school romance VN (visual novel)" and invites players to wishlist it via its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3620480/Palworld_More_Than_Just_Pals/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">brand new Steam page</a>.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time&nbsp;<em>More than Just Pals&nbsp;</em>has appeared, though. The first announcement for the game came <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/april-fools-day-2024-gaming-roundup" rel="nofollow">on April Fools' Day last year</a>, at which point Pocketpair said it would launch on the same day the following year (i.e. tomorrow).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-dating-sim-lovander.jpg?itok=a_-BkLAL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-dating-sim-lovander.jpg?itok=pVaYh1Zt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I don't think I want to do that, Lovander.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, the fact that the game was already announced as part of Pocketpair's April Fools' japery last year doesn't necessarily mean it isn't real this time around, but I think it's fair to take the project with a very large pinch of salt, at any rate.</p>

<p>Then again, back then, I wrote that Pocketpair had willed the project into genuine existence by virtue of creating it as a joke, and that may well be what's happened. If it is, well, we might be beyond help this time around.</p>

<p>Assuming&nbsp;<em>Palworld: More than Just Pals&nbsp;</em>is real, you'll be attending the Palagos Private Academy, where you'll meet a number of romanceable Pals. You can "stay friends with the Pals, develop romantic relationships with them, or even dismember and eat them".</p>

<p>It rather looks like&nbsp;<em>More than Just Pals&nbsp;</em>is taking a more&nbsp;<em>Hatoful Boyfriend</em>-style approach to dating sims rather than the conventional path; this feels rather like a parody effort to me.</p>




<p>Pocketpair also says it's giving away a Lovander body pillow to celebrate the new announcement of&nbsp;<em>Palworld: More than Just Pals</em>. If you want to enter the competition (again, assuming it's real), <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1906688298925633793" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">you can do so on X</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Death Stranding Passes 20m Players Worldwide Ahead of Sequel Launch]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-20m-players</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/death-stranding-passes-20m-players-worldwide-ahead-of-sequel-launch.1149672/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-20m-players<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hideo Kojima has announced that his most recent game&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>has passed another big player milestone ahead of the release of the hotly-anticipated sequel later this year.</p>

<p>Speaking on social media platform <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:2jd64ychnmuu4x6eghptdvco/post/3llo4343bk222" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>, Kojima Productions revealed that&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>has passed 20 million players around the world, thanking "everyone who built bridges, paved roads, and delivered cargo" for the "incredible milestone".</p>

<p>It's worth noting that Kojima Productions is referring not just to sales of the game, but to the player count as a whole. That figure therefore likely includes players who have experienced the game on PlayStation Plus and Xbox Game Pass; it's currently available on the former on both PS4 and PS5.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/death-stranding-20m-players-box.jpg?itok=PtkmihIz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/death-stranding-20m-players-box.jpg?itok=zi3L6yvs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>has passed 20 million players worldwide.</figcaption></figure><p>The new player milestone for <i>Death Stranding&nbsp;</i>comes as Kojima and his studio prepare to release the game's sequel,&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">set for a June launch on PlayStation 5</a>.</p>

<p>It looks like the game will be exclusive to Sony's console for the foreseeable future, but given that Kojima <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-xbox-release-kojima-ip" rel="nofollow">now owns the IP rights</a> to&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding</em>, I really wouldn't be surprised to see the game get a multiplatform release at some point.</p>

<p>Of course, there's also the&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>movie, which will be a co-production between <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-movie-a24" rel="nofollow">Kojima's studio and movie house A24</a>, to look forward to. We still don't know who will be starring in that or when we can expect to see it, however.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding</em>, it's Hideo Kojima's first major project after <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/report-hideo-kojima-leaves-konami-forms-new-studio" rel="nofollow">leaving Konami back in 2015</a>. He's best known for the&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear&nbsp;</em>series, although he's also worked on other games like&nbsp;<em>Policenauts&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Zone of the Enders</em>.</p>




<p><em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>tells the post-apocalyptic story of Sam Porter Bridges, a courier who must deliver packages in a world devastated by a mysterious cataclysm. Of course, if you know Kojima's work, you'll know that's hardly doing the game justice.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1850570/DEATH_STRANDING_DIRECTORS_CUT/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/death-stranding/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/death-stranding-directors-cut/9nqgn8tgnt8p" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. The sequel, <i>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</i>, is <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">launching for PlayStation 5</a> on June 26th.</p>
