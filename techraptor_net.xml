One of those is a new Eberron 2025 supplement, bringing players back to one of the fantasy TTRPG's most beloved settings.</p>

<h2>The Eberron 2025 Supplement Announcement</h2>

<p>In a recent report by <a href="https://www.enworld.org/threads/d-d-adds-two-new-books-to-2025-slate-including-new-eberron-book.710194/#post-9568885" rel="nofollow">EN World</a>, the Eberron 2025 supplement has been added to Wizards of the Coast's upcoming slate of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> books coming this year.</p>

It was created by Keith Baker, James Wyatt, and Bill Slavicsek and debuted in 2004 for <em>D&amp;D 3.5 Edition</em>. It is a setting distinct from Dragonlance or The Forgotten Realms for its introduction of fantasy technology like trains, airships, automatons known as Warforged and iconic arcane tinkerers: Artificers.</p>

<p>The Eberron supplement, officially titled <em>Eberron: Forge of the Artificer</em>, will come to store fronts this August. The book will be a companion to the previously released book, <em>Eberron: Rising from the Last War</em>, and will contain new player options, bastion options tied to the Eberron setting, and new airship rules.</p>

<p>Among those new player options is the revised Artificer class. This aligns with Wizards of the Coast recently releasing <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dd-beyond-releases-dungeons-dragons-2024-artificer-unearthed-arcana" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Artificer playtest material</a> for <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024</em> after the class was conspicuously absent from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-player-handbook-review-mixed-messaging-around-strong" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">2024 Player Handbook</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, the Eberron 2025 will contain some changes to the setting's lore. Dragonmarked houses are no longer species-locked , players can join any house. In addition, dragonmarks will be made into more fully fleshed out Feats including pre-requisites Lastly, the Khoravar, originally treated as a form of half-elf, will now be treated as a separate player species.</p>

<p>The design team on this new supplement will include James Wyatt and Keith Baker will act as a consultant.</p>

<p>The announcement of the Eberron 2025 supplement is in keeping with Wizards of the Coast's latest wave of books for the latest iteration of their fantasy TTRPG. Their release slate also includes a <em>Forgotten Realms Player's Guide</em> containing 8 new subclasses and a <em>Forgotten Realms Adventurer's Guide</em> providing GMs with worldbuilding details on the land of Faerun.</p>
