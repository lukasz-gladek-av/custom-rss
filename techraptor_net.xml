            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ravensburger has new details on<em> Horrified: Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. This fifth entry in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/horrified-american-monsters-board-game-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Horrified</em></a> board game series will feature iconic monsters, character classes, and puzzle mechanics from the world's most popular fantasy TTRPG.</p>

<h2>The <em>Horrified: Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Preview</h2>

<p>&nbsp;As the name implies, <em>Horrified: Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> will take players on an adventure through the Forgotten Realms. On this journey, players will take on at least two of four monsters drawn from the fantasy TTRPG's fifty years of lore.</p>

The Mimic, the killer treasure chest that feeds on foolish or greedy treasure hunters. The (non-<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizkids-announces-official-dungeons-dragons-potato-head-beholder-miniature-coming-to" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Potato Head</a>) Beholder, the multi-eyed bringer of death and doom. The Displacer Beast, the ferocious feline with the power to cast illusions. Lastly, there is the Red Dragon, the most prideful and destructive of the chromatic dragons.</p>

<p>You can't just fight the monsters in <em>Horrified: Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. Each one has a puzzle that must be solved before you can test your mettle against them. For example, the Red Dragon's puzzle involves finding its prized Orb of Dragonkind and luring it to its hoard.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> influences don't stop at the monsters. Each player can choose to play as one of five heroes: the Wizard, Rogue, Fighter, Cleric, or Bard. Each hero has their own unique set of abilities that can aid the group in their journey. Those special abilities are determined by rolling the most iconic of TTRPG dice: the d20.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;“With the assets provided by Hasbro and Wizards of the Coast, we got to see and read through the expansiveness of the worldbuilding; in many ways, our biggest challenge was deciding what we wanted to show,” said Sam Dawson, Art Director at Ravensburger. “Then, of course, we had to decide how to interpret that for the board and fill in the seams where no definitive visual exists.&nbsp; I think the result will both feel like familiar territory to fans alongside some new interpretations of the Undermountain they know and love.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are interested in how <em>Horrified: Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> plays, there is an opportunity to see it in action. The game will be featured in the latest episode of Critical Role's "Everything is Content" show, which will debut on Twitch on June 24th at 10 PM ET.</p>

<p><em>Horrified: Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> will launch worldwide on August 1.</p>
