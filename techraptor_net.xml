            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-january-2025-circana-us-sales-data<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Circana has released its US gaming industry sales data for January 2025, and given that it's a month without many significant releases, the number one seller for the month probably won't surprise you.</p>

<p>As noted in a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lioxq6xkoc2w" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky thread</a> by Circana's Mat Piscatella,&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>is once again the month's biggest-selling game across all platforms. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/circana-us-sales-data-2024-top-selling-games" rel="nofollow">was also 2024's top-selling title</a>&nbsp;by Circana's reckoning.</p>

<p>In second place for the all-format chart is&nbsp;<em>Madden NFL 25</em>, which isn't surprising given the colossal commercial success of that franchise <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-sports-college-football-25-best-selling-sports-game" rel="nofollow">and&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football</em></a>, while&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth&nbsp;</em>is in third, bolstered by its January PC release. Perhaps now, it can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-16-rebirth-profits-square-enix" rel="nofollow">strive to meet Square Enix's expectations</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-january-2025-us-sales-data.jpg?itok=_9qjfds5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-january-2025-us-sales-data.jpg?itok=49ipegHv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</em>'s PC release helped it hit third place in Circana's January 2025 sales chart.</figcaption></figure><p>Rounding out the all-format top five are&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC 25</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-ea-sports-fc-25-underperformed" rel="nofollow">underperformed compared to EA's expectations</a>, and&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>, which probably <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/diablo-player-count-gta-5-sales" rel="nofollow">couldn't be said to have underperformed</a> by any expectations in the known universe.</p>

<p>When it comes to specific formats,&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>tops the PlayStation chart for January, while&nbsp;<em>Madden NFL 25&nbsp;</em>tops the Xbox chart. As always, the Switch is dancing to its own tune; Nintendo's chart is dominated by&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Country Returns</em>.</p>

<p>As for player engagement - that is, games on each platform ranked by monthly active users -&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>is top of the chart on PlayStation, while&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>tops Xbox's chart.&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-40m" rel="nofollow">recently hit 40 million players</a>, is number one on Steam.</p>

<p>Spending as a whole across the industry fell by 15% compared to the same period last year, although as Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lioxq42zqc2w" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">points out</a>, January 2025 consists of four weeks rather than last year's five-week tracking period.</p>

Xbox was second in dollar sales, while Switch came second in units.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Hades 2 Developer Says It Won't Recast Voice Actors or Use AI]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hades-2-supergiant-recast-statement</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hades-2-developer-says-it-wont-recast-voice-actors-or-use-ai.1115430/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hades-2-supergiant-recast-statement<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Hades 2&nbsp;</em>developer Supergiant Games has released a statement responding to a voice actor's recent suggestion that they may be recast owing to the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, voice actor Marin Miller, who voices characters like Athena in&nbsp;<em>Hades&nbsp;</em>and its sequel, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/marinmmiller.com/post/3likgdz5k722f" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">said via Bluesky</a> that followers "may hear me get recast in a particular game that is very popular" because "the employer refused to flip to an interim".</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/marinmmiller.com/post/3likglug3322f" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">followup post</a>, Miller made it very clear they were referring to Supergiant, stating that "it would be SUPER helpful if you wrote a GIANT email asking them to flip for their actors". By "flip", Miller presumably means they want Supergiant to put an interim agreement in place to allow them to continue working through the strike.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hades-2-supergiant-voice-actors-recast-statement-gameplay.jpg?itok=MpqsTd-o 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hades-2-supergiant-voice-actors-recast-statement-gameplay.jpg?itok=EK1NZ2eu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hades 2&nbsp;</em>voice actor Marin Miller suggested they may be recast during the SAG-AFTRA strike, but Supergiant denies it.</figcaption></figure><p>Responding - albeit indirectly - to Miller's post <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/supergiantgames.bsky.social/post/3lin7soibi22o" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on Bluesky</a>, Supergiant says it hasn't recast any of its&nbsp;<em>Hades 2&nbsp;</em>actors and that it doesn't intend to do so. The studio also says it "ha[s] respected and will continue to respect any actor needing to pause work" due to the strike.</p>

<p>Supergiant then says that none of its games have been subject to SAG-AFTRA contracts "for a variety of reasons", but that its own contracts "offer the strongest AI protections in the industry" and that its games are "intentionally made by human beings", pledging not to use generative AI in the creation of&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>.</p>

<p>So far, it doesn't look like Miller has responded to Supergiant on social media. It's possible we may hear from them in the coming days, or that Miller has decided to contact Supergiant directly to continue the dialog.</p>

<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Hades 2&nbsp;</em>itself, development on the game continues apace. Released in Early Access <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hades-2-release-date-early-access-now" rel="nofollow">in May last year</a>, the game sees Princess of the Underworld&nbsp;Melinoë battling the forces of Chronos, the Titan of Time.</p>




<p>Earlier this week, Supergiant released the Warsong Update for&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>, adding a number of new features to the game. You can check out the full patch notes for that update <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/503942841152569404" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>.</p>

<p><em>Hades 2&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145350/Hades_II/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>. You can check out our very own Tyler's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/hades-ii-preview-godlike-first-impression" rel="nofollow">preview of the game here</a> if you want to know how it stacks up compared to its predecessor.</p>
