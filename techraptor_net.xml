            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix is teasing some announcements for the <em>Dragon Quest </em>franchise this year as part of the celebrated JRPG series' 40th anniversary, and yes, it really has been that long since the first game was released.</p><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/DragonQuest/status/2006757310673395980" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">message on X</a> (which is admittedly rather brief), Square Enix notes <em>Dragon Quest</em>'s anniversary and promises "various announcements in celebration" of the occasion, although we don't get much more than that, unfortunately.</p><p>The publisher stops short of revealing when we can expect the first of these announcements, so unlike <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-30th-anniversary-website" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c0ca7ca1-f73b-49cf-aa12-186077080c21" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Atlus' recent <em>Persona </em>anniversary website</a>, there's no countdown or concrete date to look forward to, sadly.</p><figure role="group">

<p>Of course, the one question on your mind right now if you're a <em>Dragon Quest </em>fan is probably whether Square Enix is planning to reveal more information about the long-awaited next installment in the series, <em>Dragon Quest XII</em>.</p><p>The game was originally announced all the way back in 2021, at which point it had been four years since <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dragon-quest-xi-echoes-of-elusive-age" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c5650383-7871-4d7a-8a57-bdc9e6ca76fa" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">the previous mainline entry</a>. Since then, almost five more years have gone by, so <em>Dragon Quest </em>fans have been waiting a very long time indeed for news of the series' future.</p><p>Naturally, <em>Dragon Quest </em>hasn't been dormant in the intervening time. A plethora of spinoffs have been released, as well as a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-sales-2m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="479f5a9f-55ff-465f-b449-c352aa8c3839" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">number of remakes</a> of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake-switch-2-upgrade-path" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7d0dabe5-f32a-49c5-9804-b2d6bd5aac52" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">previous games in the series</a>. Another remake, <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em>, is scheduled to arrive next month.</p><p>If you're somehow not familiar with <em>Dragon Quest</em>, it's a series of rather cozy JRPGs that revolve around traditional turn-based gameplay, overworld exploration, and dungeon-delving. It's very much the comfort food of the JRPG world (and I say that as a compliment).</p>
<p>Despite that reputation, series producer Yuji Horii has <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2021/05/dragon-quest-xii-the-flames-of-fate-announced" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">promised</a> an overhaul for the twelfth installment, pledging to shake up <em>Dragon Quest</em>'s combat and introduce "dark, mature content" to the franchise. We'll have to wait and see if he and Square Enix make good on these promises.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>AdHoc Studio has announced that its workplace comedy adventure <em>Dispatch </em>has crossed another big sales milestone, and there are some more fun stats for you to chew on as well.</p><p>Sharing a "<em>Dispatch </em>Wrapped" video (which contains spoilers, so be careful!) to celebrate the New Year over <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/adhocstudio.com/post/3mbeqx7wik72v" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">on Bluesky</a>, AdHoc reveals that the game has reached three million sales, which means another million people have picked it up <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dispatch-sales-2m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="742f50e8-ee01-456d-9410-9ccc64ed7694" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">since late November</a>.</p><p>From the off, it was pretty clear that <em>Dispatch </em>would prove to be a big hit; the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dispatch-sales-1m-10-days" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fdb19357-4765-4684-bf2c-7f64112fcdbd" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">sold a million copies</a> in just ten days and was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/game-awards-2025-nominees" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a925a006-6874-4d20-831b-d86ee39af97a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">nominated</a> for the Best Debut Indie Game title at this year's Game Awards, although it lost to <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 </em>(which also scooped the Game of the Year prize).</p><figure role="group">

<p>In the video, AdHoc says that players have completed a total of 52.5 million shifts across their total play time, and that 727 million calls have been answered.</p><p>You can see other info showing things like <em>Dispatch</em>'s most popular romance choices, as well as what decisions players made at certain crux points, but I won't be sharing those here just in case you've scrolled this far without having played the game.</p><p>If you're not familiar with <em>Dispatch</em>, it's a workplace-themed superhero comedy adventure game (that's a whole lot of descriptors) <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-telltale-employees-go-on-to-form-adhoc-studio" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ebf6f25a-7f8d-4c5f-bcf6-4525c284b84e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">created by ex-Telltale staffers</a>, so you can probably guess roughly what to expect from that description.</p><p>The game is an episodic release that casts you as Robert Robertson III, also known as Mecha Man, a former superhero who must take a desk job following an incident that leaves him unable to don his costume.</p>
<p>If you want to get in on the hype, you can check out <em>Dispatch </em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2592160/Dispatch/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/dispatch/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a>, and the game is also coming to the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/Dispatch-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2991427.html" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Switch 2</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Dispatch-2991429.html" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Switch</a> later this month.
