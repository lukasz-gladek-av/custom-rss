            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The campaign for the newest edition of <em>Mutants &amp; Masterminds</em> has launched on Kickstarter. The new <em>Mutants &amp; Masterminds</em> Fourth Edition refreshes the iconic superhero TTRPG with streamlined rules, simplified character creation, and a new suite of superpowers.</p><p>According to its <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/greenroninpub/mutants-and-masterminds-4th-edition/description" rel="nofollow">campaign page</a>, <em>Mutants &amp; Masterminds</em> Fourth Edition will retain the bombastic superhero action and creative freedom of the superhero RPG, just with some quality-of-life improvements.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The game, which debuted in 2002, is built around an award-winning RPG system. Every action in the game is resolved by a single d20 roll. In addition, there are no character classes, but a point-buy system, allowing you to make just about any larger-than-life costumed hero you can imagine. From there, adventures can range between fighting aliens, thwarting would-be conquerors, or stopping rampaging monsters.</p><p><em>Mutants &amp; Masterminds</em> Fourth Edition will retain this system. A d20 roll still resolves everything.. Players will still make characters using a pool of Power Points, but the core rulebook will contain 15 hero archetypes (The Paragon, The Battlesuit, etc.) which serve as templates for new players.&nbsp;</p><p>The new core rulebook does add some new twists to this formula. It will include new rules for different heroic feats, advantages, and superpowers. The newest edition will also include Reactions to the game, introducing new tactical options in superhero brawls. Lastly, the book will feature artwork by comic artist Sean Izaakse.</p><p>For older fans, the digital stretch goals of <em>Mutants &amp; Masterminds</em> Fourth Edition contain some throwbacks. The goals include older prewritten Astonishing Adventures updated to the new system, such as A Cold Day in Midtown, Into The Idiot Box, and Rise of the Tyrant. There is also a gazetteer for Earth Prime, an introduction to the game's core setting written by the game's creator, Steve Kenson.&nbsp;</p><p>The different pledge tiers for <em>Mutants &amp; Masterminds</em> Fourth Edition are as follows:</p><ul><li data-list-item-id="ed18be609d6f65fc398410faecb4caae2"><em>Hero's Handbook PDF for $25:</em> A digital copy of the Hero's Handbook and any digital stretch goals</li><li data-list-item-id="e28ca8875493aa545649e0ba6c3524edf"><em>Hero's Handbook and GM's Kit for $40:</em> Digital copies of the Hero's Handbook, Game Master's Kit, and any digital stretch goals</li><li data-list-item-id="e7ef65ca7aa87e51a50d1489f292d0e2f"><em>Hero's Handbook Print and PDF for $50:</em> A physical hardcover and digital copy of the Hero's Handbook, and any digital stretch goals</li><li data-list-item-id="e340ff38a66bdd099536c9fedc9d5d5b2"><em>Hero's Handbook and GM's Kit Print and PDF for $80:</em> Physical and digital copies of the Hero's Handbook, Game Master's Kit, and any digital stretch goals</li><li data-list-item-id="ef3bb1299d4234d5ae891236646d07436"><em>Campaign Starter for $140:</em> Physical and digital copies of the Hero's Handbook, Game Master's Kit, a set of physical hero tokens, reaction tokens, and a condition deck.</li></ul><p>At the time of writing, the campaign for <em>Mutants &amp; Masterminds </em>Fourth Edition has raised $116,921, more than twice its initial funding goal of $50,000, and has unlocked all digital stretch goals.
