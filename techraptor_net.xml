            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/z-man-games-announces-arkham-horror-lovecraft-letter-eldritch-twist-on-classic<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Z-Man Games has announced <em>Arkham Horror: Lovecraft Letter</em>. The tabletop developer known for <em>Carcassonne</em> and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/pandemic-hot-zone-north-america-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Pandemic</em></a> series is putting an eldritch horror twist on one of their classic card games, <em>Love Letter</em>.</p>

<h2>The <em>Arkham Horror: Lovecraft Letter</em> Announcement</h2>

<p>According to its <a href="https://www.zmangames.com/game/arkham-horror-lovecraft-letter/" rel="nofollow">store page</a>, <em>Arkham Horror: Lovecraft Letter</em> is a chilling twist on the <em>Love Letter</em> card game. <em>Love Letter's</em> original creator, Seiji Kanai, was the lead designer on this eldritch horror-themed spin-off.</p>

Players will delve into the madness of the world of H.P. Lovecraft, face eldritch horrors, and uncover allies in a protracted game of wits. Can you hold on to your sanity and outsmart the things beyond mortal ken? Or will you succumb to the unyielding terror that comes from knowledge of what lies beyond?</p>

<p><em>Arkham Horror: Lovecraft Letter</em> isn't the first spin-off of <em>Love Letter</em>. The series has seen plenty of creative license. Spin-offs that include a Marvel superhero take, <em>Infinity Gauntlet</em>, a tie-in to the British period drama series <em>Bridgerton</em>, and a licensed Star Wars title, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/star-wars-jabbas-palace-card-game-brings-new-bargains" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Jabba's Palace</em></a>.</p>

<p>This is thanks to Love Letter's simple yet strategic card gameplay. The result is a game that is easy to learn but hard to master.</p>

Certain cards have a secondary effect, ones that may provide you an extra edge, but will cost you sanity. Do you push your luck or go mad?</p>

<p><em>Arkham Horror: Lovecraft Letter</em> is now available for pre-order at an MSRP of $14.99. The pre-order includes special Collector's Edition packaging for dedicated board game players and collectors alike. It contains the following:</p>

<ul><li>27 cards</li>
	<li>18 Double-Sided Tokens</li>
	<li>6 Reference Cards</li>
	<li>1 Rulebook</li>
	<li>1 Lovecraft-themed Velvet Bag</li>
</ul><p>The game is expected to ship March 28, 2025.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/strinova-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/multidimensional-free-to-play-shooter-strinova-gets-release-date.1036974/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/strinova-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher iDreamSky has announced the release date for free-to-play anime shooter&nbsp;<em>Strinova</em>, which was one of the most popular demos during the most recent Steam Next Fest event.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1282270/view/6492596291873275919" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post on Steam</a>,&nbsp;<em>Strinova&nbsp;</em>will launch on PC on November 21st, which means we're less than a week away from its release at time of writing. The release is set for 4pm Pacific, so depending on your time zone, you may have to wait until the following day to check it out.</p>

<p>More specifically,&nbsp;<em>Strinova&nbsp;</em>managed to secure the top spot on the Next Fest's Daily Active Demo Players board, as well as reaching the top three in the Trending Upcoming Games list. Suffice it to say people are excited for this one.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/strinova-release-date-combat.jpg?itok=ZRpp0jxu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/strinova-release-date-combat.jpg?itok=q5OGLwBK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you've ever wished&nbsp;<em>Paper Mario&nbsp;</em>was a third-person anime shooter,&nbsp;<em>Strinova&nbsp;</em>is for you.</figcaption></figure><p>It must be said that&nbsp;<em>Strinova&nbsp;</em>has some pretty unique mechanics going for it, if nothing else. Essentially, it's a blend of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/genshin-impact" rel="nofollow"><em>Genshin Impact</em></a>-style anime visuals, arena shooter combat, and a singular gimmick that might help it stand out from the crowd.</p>

<p>With the touch of a button, your&nbsp;<em>Strinova&nbsp;</em>character can switch from 3D to 2D, allowing them to squeeze through passages, swim through ceilings, and zip up walls. You can also glide while you're in 2D form.</p>

<p>The catch is that you won't be able to fire your weapon while you're 2D, so it's kind of like moving through ink in&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/splatoon-3" rel="nofollow"><em>Splatoon 3</em></a>; you'll need to switch back to 3D in order to fire at enemies, but obviously, that will also make you a bigger target.</p>




<p><em>Strinova&nbsp;</em>will be completely free to play, and it'll boast a variety of gameplay modes, including stalwarts like Team Deathmatch. More modes and features will be added over time, too.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen whether this one can stand out in the crowded marketplace of free-to-play multiplayer shooters, but if you'd like to find out,&nbsp;<em>Strinova&nbsp;</em>will launch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1282270/Strinova/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> on November 21st (or 22nd, depending on where you are in the world).</p>
