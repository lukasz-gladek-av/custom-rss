A single game takes about 30-45 minutes to complete. Players take turns drafting and placing tiles on a map. Each tile represents greenery, solar panels, turbines, rainwater collectors, cultural hubs, and more. Players must strategically place these tiles to boost energy production, biodiversity, and aesthetic appeal, to create a living rooftop ecosystem.</p>

<p>Each playthrough of the game introduces new challenges. It encourages both competitive and casual players to experiment with different strategies in each game. If you want to play out the fantasy of building a beautiful future, or just want to beat your friends in landscaping, this game provides.</p>

<p><em>Solar Gardens</em> was designed by Eric Slauson (<em>MonsDrawsity</em>, <em>Kaiju Haiku</em>) and Alex Cutler (<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/skate-summer-gets-padded-up-for-kickstarter" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Skate Summer</em></a>, <em>A Place for All My Books</em>) and illustrated by Daniel Clarke. Echoing its overt environmentalist themes, the game is produced with biodegradable, plastic-free materials and will use paper stickers to hold its contents together in transit.</p>
