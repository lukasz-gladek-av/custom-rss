            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/umamusume-pretty-derby-western-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Horse girl waifu game&nbsp;<em>Umamusume: Pretty Derby&nbsp;</em>(yes, you read that right) now has an official Western release date, and you can pre-register your interest in the game on PC and mobile devices right now.</p>

<p>As revealed by developer Cygames <a href="https://x.com/umamusume_eng/status/1916479480308420635" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">over on X</a>,&nbsp;<em>Umamusume: Pretty Derby</em>'s English version will be arriving on June 26th. Back in June last year, when the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/umamusume-pretty-derby-western-release" rel="nofollow">Western release was first announced</a>, it looked like the PC version wouldn't be joining the mobile versions, but PC has been officially confirmed for the West now too.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with the&nbsp;<em>Umamusume: Pretty Derby&nbsp;</em>franchise, it's worth explaining what's going on here, at least to the best of my (limited) ability.</p>

<p>Horse girls who distinguish themselves get to go to the Tracen Academy in Tokyo, where they'll learn not only to be racers once again, but also to be Japanese-style idols.</p>

<p>The horses in&nbsp;<em>Umamusume: Pretty Derby&nbsp;</em>are real-life animals, too; Japanese horses like T M Opera O, Rice Shower, and Mejiro McQueen make appearances in&nbsp;<em>Umamusume: Pretty Derby</em>, although naturally, even the stallions become pretty anime girls.</p>

<p>This game isn't the first&nbsp;<em>Umamusume&nbsp;</em>game to come West, either. Back in August last year, the party game <i>Umamusume: Pretty Derby - Party Dash&nbsp;</i><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/umamusume-pretty-derby-finally-coming-west-with-party-game-for-ps4-switch-pc" rel="nofollow">launched for PC, PS4, and Switch</a>, giving many their first taste of what can reasonably be described as an unusual franchise.</p>




<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Umamusume: Pretty Derby&nbsp;</em>itself, the game is a gacha sports sim in which you race the titular Umamusume against one another, training them and trading them as you see fit.</p>

<p><em>Umamusume: Pretty Derby&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3224770/Umamusume_Pretty_Derby/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cygames.umamusume" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Android</a>, and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/umamusume-pretty-derby/id6480433538" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">iOS</a> on June 26th. Pre-registration and wishlisting are both open for all platforms now.</p>
