A narrative-focused horror game, it combines board game mechanics with card-crafting gameplay. The story is woven through each part of the gameplay, and the dialogue segments really highlight the important aspects of the plot. A strong opening for Nullpointer Games,&nbsp;<em>The Horror at Highrook</em>&nbsp;offers a completely new gaming experience that will stay with you.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><em>The Horror at Highrook</em> Card-Based Gameplay</h2>

<p>You’re in control of four investigators as they explore Highrook, an abandoned estate on the coast. The noble Ackeron family has disappeared amid rumors of occult activity. Tasked with finding the missing residents, strange occurrences happen soon after their arrival.&nbsp;</p>

Drag actions to the corresponding room, then drag someone who’s skilled in that area to start working. Open packages in the Machine Room, create potions in the Laboratory, or cook meals in the Kitchen. Some actions keep your investigators alive and sane, while others turn up usable items and boosts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As you progress through the game, you'll be aided by Mr. Tubbs, the cat, and Stokes the Raven. Mr. Tubbs moves where he wills, but offers a boost for certain rooms. Interacting with him lowers Madness, just like petting a cat in real life can soothe a worried heart. Stokes, on the other hand, can be moved around the board, but only offers assistance in the Chapel and Courtyard. Using them wisely can really make a difference in your gameplay, especially when you've run out of Moonshine to keep your investigators sane.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>An Atmosphere of Intrigue in <em>The Horror at Highrook</em></h2>

<p>I really enjoyed the story of The Horror at Highrook. It’s easy to digest, yet pulls at the heartstrings. It’s presented through journal entries, notes you find in locked rooms, and dialogue moments between the characters.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-horror-at-highrook-key.jpg?itok=huY5wpuU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-horror-at-highrook-key.jpg?itok=wW65bg1J 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>You discover that the father and son are in this other realm, with other residents pulled into the madness as it spreads through the estate. By the middle of the game, I wanted to know what happened to this family, especially Simon. This is a world I became invested in. Each dialogue built a web of intrigue that lasted throughout the story.</p>

<p>The art and the music perfectly complement the narrative that’s established. Eerie music begins as the occult occurrences ramp up. Eldritch horrors with no faces and extra teeth appear at the end of rituals. I tensed up as soon as the music started, and those creatures will haunt my nightmares.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You work through eight chapters of eldritch narrative and card creation to reach the culmination of the title. Pausing to read everything during my first playthrough meant it took me nine hours to finish. My second playthrough, so I could see all the ending summaries (and hit 100%), only lasted four hours.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once fully complete, there’s no real incentive to play the title again. The ending summaries don’t change, and the steps to finish the side quests stay the same. The story is static. No matter how good the narrative is, there are so many ways you can play it.&nbsp;This is great for those with restricted time for gaming. A single weekend will give you the complete experience.&nbsp;</p>

It's stayed with me well past the last time I played, living rent-free in my head. There is much more about this world I'd like to learn about beyond what's presented. Nullpointer Games developed interesting game mechanics along with an invigorating world that can be the setting for future titles. I know I'd buy another game set around Highrook just to experience more of the world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While the length of the title can be seen as a negative, the only real issue I take with the game is the abundance of spelling and grammatical errors found throughout. This could be due to being a writer or a former English major in college. However, some of the mistakes can cause slight confusion when read. Aside from that, I encountered no bugs or glitches, my game never crashed, and the audio always played correctly.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><em>The Horror at Highrook</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Overall,&nbsp;<em>The Horror at Highrook</em>&nbsp;was an experience I really enjoyed. Figuring out how to craft the boost I needed or trying to complete side quests while the investigators went insane solidified the indie game as one of my favorites of the year. The lack of bugs paired with a well-written story that sticks with you and unique card mechanics makes it stand out among other horror games releasing. If you're interested in Eldritch horror stories,&nbsp;<em>The Horror at Highrook</em>&nbsp;is a game you need to check out.&nbsp;</p>
