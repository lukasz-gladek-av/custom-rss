            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has revealed the first post-launch GameCube game coming to the Switch 2 as part of the Nintendo Switch Online service, and it's none other than arcade sports classic&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Strikers</em>.</p>

<p>As revealed in a new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Strikers&nbsp;</em>will be joining <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-gamecube-switch-2-online" rel="nofollow">the console's GameCube lineup</a> on July 3rd, taking its place alongside games like&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;SoulCalibur II</i>.</p>

<p>Just like with other GameCube games, as well as titles available on systems like the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fire-emblem-the-sacred-stones-nintendo-switch-online" rel="nofollow">Game Boy Advance</a> and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/streets-of-rage-nintendo-switch-online" rel="nofollow">Sega Genesis</a>, you're going to need an Expansion Pack addon if you want to enjoy&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Strikers</em>.</p>

Playables include Mario himself, of course, as well as Donkey Kong, Waluigi, and more.</p>

<p>Originally released in 2005,&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Strikers&nbsp;</em>was developed by Next Level Games, who, at that point, were known only for 2003 sports title&nbsp;<em>NHL Hitz Pro</em>. The studio would go on to work alongside Nintendo on games like the Wii's&nbsp;<em>Punch-Out!!&nbsp;</em>remake, as well as the two&nbsp;<em>Luigi's Mansion&nbsp;</em>sequels.</p>

<p>Naturally,&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Strikers&nbsp;</em>puts a characteristically Nintendo spin on soccer; while the basic rules remain largely intact, you can use&nbsp;<em>Mario</em>-themed items to gain an advantage, and characters also have access to special attacks to turn the tide of play.</p>




<p><em>Super Mario Strikers&nbsp;</em>serves as the first in a series of three games; the first followup, 2007's&nbsp;<em>Mario Strikers Charged</em>, was released for the Wii, but it would take another fifteen years before&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/mario-strikers-battle-league" rel="nofollow">Mario Strikers: Battle League</a>&nbsp;</em>would appear on the Switch, once again developed by Next Level Games.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Strikers&nbsp;</em>as part of the Nintendo Switch Online GameCube lineup when it takes to the pitch on July 3rd. Again, though, you'll need a Switch Online Expansion Pack addon to enjoy it.</p>
