      <div><p>Capcom has announced a new sales milestone for flagship survival horror games&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil Village</em>, as well as new figures for several other games in the series.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/dev1_official/status/1915685807085805921" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Capcom reveals that&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em>has hit ten million sales, which means the game has managed to pick up another million sales for itself <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-9m" rel="nofollow">between January and now</a>.</p>

<p><em>Resident Evil Village</em>, meanwhile, has crossed the eleven million mark. It <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-village-sales-10-million" rel="nofollow">crossed the ten million line</a> in June last year, so it's taking a little longer to pass those milestones than&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4</em>, but that's still a pretty impressive performance nonetheless. Capcom also shared this cool artwork to commemorate the occasion.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/resident-evil-4-sales-10m-artwork.jpg?itok=gUj5eoPl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/resident-evil-4-sales-10m-artwork.jpg?itok=a3LFXN3V 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Two of Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>games have reached big new sales milestones.</figcaption></figure><p>In addition to these two figures, Capcom also announced new milestones for&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>3</em>, although it's harder to tell whether these are sales figures or player counts, given that both games are available via Xbox Game Pass right now.</p>

<p><em>Resident Evil 7&nbsp;</em>has also passed the 15 million mark according to Capcom, but again, since that game has historically been available as part of Game Pass or PlayStation Plus, it's hard to say whether the figure refers to sales or simply player count.</p>

<p>In any case, the figures show that Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>franchise is still going strong, so hopefully, it won't be too long until the next installment of the franchise is revealed.</p>

<p>Roughly five years passed between the release of&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 6&nbsp;</em>and the semi-reboot&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</em>, and a further four years went by until&nbsp;<em>Village&nbsp;</em>arrived, so by that logic, we should be getting fairly close to a&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 9&nbsp;</em>reveal, at the very least.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/resident-evil-4-sales-scarecrows-village.jpg?itok=nJJvdwfR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/resident-evil-4-sales-scarecrows-village.jpg?itok=RxuF1k5X 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Surely, the successor to&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil Village&nbsp;</em>is coming soon.</figcaption></figure><p>Until then, however, the various&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>games are available across pretty much all platforms, so you can pick your poison when it comes to survival horror.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/infinity-nikki-version-15-next-week<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Infold Games has revealed&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>Version 1.5, and if you've been waiting to experience the wonders of Miraland alongside a friend, then this is the update for you.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>Version 1.5 launches on April 29th, which is also when the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/infinity-nikki-steam-release-date" rel="nofollow">long-awaited Steam release</a> will happen. It's not clear whether the game will support crossplay between platforms, however.</p>

<p>Co-op supports two players, and you can "explore the entirety of Miraland, including the brand new Sea of Stars area" with a friend in tow. You can also teleport to your fellow Stylist, take photos, and "enjoy all-new interactions" as part of the co-op mode.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/infinity-nikki-version-1.5-co-op-characters.jpg?itok=cSr3pbrQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/infinity-nikki-version-1.5-co-op-characters.jpg?itok=s93mLdeC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>Version 1.5 brings a new co-op mode and more.</figcaption></figure><p>Since Version 1.5 is also known as "Bubble Season", the update is also introducing new bubble-themed co-op challenges to take on.</p>

<p>These will involve teaming up to "use bubble props that generate bubbles in different colors to reveal hidden paths", as well as "protecting a fragile bubble as it travels along a winding path" and working with your co-op partner to keep it safe.</p>

<p>You'll also find lots of new stuff on Serenity Island, which has transformed into "a fantastical playground brimming with floating bubbles and celebration". There, you can ride a Bubble Gondola, use a new outfit to "create soaring water columns for traversal", and more.</p>

<p>Of course, this being an&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>update, you can also look forward to new outfits, including two new five-star sets and five free outfits, one of which is "legendary fan-favorite" Sea of Stars. The new dyeing system will also let you change outfits' individual colors and create custom color schemes.</p>




<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>for free right now on <a href="https://infinitynikki.infoldgames.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices</a>. The game's 1.5 update, Bubble Season, arrives on April 29th, as does its Steam version.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/split-fiction-movie-gains-sydney-sweeney-deadpool-and-wolverine-writers.1173561/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-movie-sydney-sweeney<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>movie, for which several studios were apparently engaged in a bidding war last month, has gained a new star and two pretty big-name writers.</p>

<p>According to a new Variety <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/split-fiction-movie-sydney-sweeney-jon-m-chu-video-game-1236377192/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, the movie, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-movie-report" rel="nofollow">first mooted in March</a>, will star <em>Madame Web&nbsp;</em>and <em>Immaculate</em>'s Sydney Sweeney. Variety says which of the two leads Sweeney will be playing is "undecided", although it seems fairly obvious to me that Zoe is the right choice, given Sweeney's resemblance to the character.</p>

<p>Additionally, the movie's script is being written by&nbsp;<em>Deadpool and Wolverine&nbsp;</em>scribes Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, according to Variety. The duo's other credits include the likes of&nbsp;<em>Zombieland&nbsp;</em>and 2023's&nbsp;<em>Ghosted</em>&nbsp;(although let's hope they're using the former rather than the latter as inspiration).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/split-fiction-movie-sydney-sweeney-mio-zoe.jpg?itok=EwfuD6XL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/split-fiction-movie-sydney-sweeney-mio-zoe.jpg?itok=bmFIHzmc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>movie will star Sydney Sweeney, apparently.</figcaption></figure><p>Currently attached to direct the&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>movie is Jon M. Chu, whose name you might know from movies like&nbsp;<em>Step Up 2: The Streets</em>, Lin-Manuel Miranda's musical&nbsp;<em>In the Heights</em>, and last year's&nbsp;<em>Wicked</em>.</p>

<p>This is the second video game-based movie with which Sydney Sweeney has been associated this week. On Tuesday, it was reported that Sweeney is working alongside Michael Bay on a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/outrun-movie-report" rel="nofollow">movie adaptation of the Sega racing classic&nbsp;<em>OutRun</em></a>.</p>

<p>It's also one of several movies based on video games that are currently in the works, alongside the likes of Dread's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortuary-assistant-movie-announced" rel="nofollow"><em>The Mortuary Assistant</em></a>, Nintendo's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/live-action-zelda-movie-march-2027" rel="nofollow"><em>The Legend of Zelda&nbsp;</em>movie</a>, and a film <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-movie-is-coming-courtesy-of-hasbro-and-legendary-pictures" rel="nofollow">based on popular card game&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a>.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>, it's the latest game from&nbsp;<em>A Way Out&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two&nbsp;</em>developer Hazelight, headed up by Josef Fares. The game stars Mio and Zoe as two writers who must begrudgingly work together to battle a (very literal) corporate machine that plans to steal their ideas.</p>

<p><em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>is out now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2001120/Split_Fiction/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/split-fiction/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/games/store/split-fiction/9n1wxxd1rl8d" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.
