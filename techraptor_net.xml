Or how about that time Geralt got cut in half by a portal? It's no wonder he hates portals so much. Experience these wacky situations and more in <em>Reigns: The Witcher</em>.</p><p>This spin-off, featuring <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/reigns-review-addicted-to-death" rel="nofollow"><em>Reigns</em></a>' signature, Tinder-style swiping gameplay, is the next entry in the franchise featuring none other than Geralt of Rivia and a whole cast of familiar characters, monsters, and events. Deviate from your Witcher values and live a life of peace, or become a reviled slayer of man; the choice is all yours.</p><figure role="group">

<h2>Which Way, Witcher Man?</h2><p><em>Reigns: The Witcher</em> is all about telling the greatest, and often most outrageous, ballad possible. All of which is sung via our favorite bard, Dandelion, so you might expect a bit of embellishment when it comes to these tales. By swiping either left or right, you choose the path of your adventure while also trying to prolong death for as long as possible.</p><p>Like other games in the <em>Reigns</em> series, you're given a few values to monitor, and should those values reach a certain threshold, you're dead. Failure is inevitable and unavoidable, but it's what you make of the life you're given that matters, right?</p><p>As this is in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/witcher" rel="nofollow"><em>Witcher</em></a> universe, you're contending with several factions, of which you'll have to monitor several different values: Humans, non-humans, sorcerers, and Geralt's focus on hunting monsters.&nbsp;</p><figure role="group">

<p>How does this work in practice, then? Curry too much favor with humans, and the rogue non-human faction, the Scoia'tael, will riddle Geralt with arrows. Conversely, if you're too chummy with the Scoia'tael, the city guard will hang Geralt for treason.&nbsp;</p><p>The ideal scenario is to have all of your values are at an even balance, right in the middle; this is done by picking choices by either swiping left or right. It's this simplicity that makes <em>Reigns: The Witcher</em> so addicting, and it always had me going for "one more run" just to see what happens, since runs are quick.</p><figure role="group">

<h2>Getting Inspired</h2><p><em>The Witcher</em>, be it in the original novels, video games, or TV adaptation, has a fair few silly moments, but the mood still typically errs on the side of "dark and gritty." The world of <em>The Witcher</em> is unforgiving and cruel, and even when you have moments of levity with Geralt's quips to Dandelion or hijinks with Lambert and Eskel, nothing is quite like <em>Reigns: The Witcher</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>Signature to the <em>Reigns</em> series is a sillier tone, and that is definitely what we have here. The tone was something I was conflicted with in the first few hours, but I soon came to a realization: These stories are all told through Dandelion's POV. It stands to reason, then, that ballads meant to entertain -- as told by the de facto comic relief character of <em>The Witcher</em> -- would be downright silly</p><p>I find that to be super clever. Rather than going for a darker tone, <em>Reigns: The Witcher</em> doesn't hold back on the humor. Honestly, the writing brings a smile to my face. There are so many references to stories within the <em>Witcher</em> universe, but everything still feels fresh from this lighter perspective.&nbsp;</p><figure role="group">

<p>There are some seriously funny situations you can find yourself in here, most of which are told through various "Inspirations." Basically, you have three Inspirations per run, and these are the topics of your song, as well as your objectives. They can alter some characteristics of your run, too, like making sorcerers easier to please.</p><p>The Inspiration "Geralt the Equine" requires you to be kind to Roach, so you'll be given many prompts relating to Roach and treating him like the good boy that he is. By being nice to Roach a number of times (or whatever your objective is at the time), you complete that Inspiration and unlock more, which allows you to see more characters, fight new monsters, and reach new endings.</p><figure role="group">

<p>Completing an Inspiration is easier said than done, as you'll have to contend with those values I mentioned. By balancing values and intuiting whether you should swipe left or right, these Inspirations are essentially just elaborate "Choose Your Own Adventure" puzzles.</p><p>With 51 different Inspirations, <em>Reigns: The Witcher</em> is meatier than one would expect. Some of the playtime is padded by how obtuse some of these Inspirations are. Often, I'd feel like I had exhausted all my options across runs, picking different choices each time to see how the narrative would change, only to fail.&nbsp;</p><p>Such was the case with "Geralt the Shedder," which was a thorn in my side for most of my playtime. With this Inspiration, Geralt is tasked with releasing a curse-stricken snakewoman from her malady. Despite reading every option and picking every choice, the text just seemed a bit unclear on how to proceed.&nbsp;</p><figure role="group">

<h2>How Do You Like That Silver?</h2><p>At the end of the day, Geralt is a Witcher, and a Witcher must do what they always do: Slay monsters. While some runs might end with your "Witcher" value so low that Geralt retires, you'll <em>usually</em> have to fight a few beasts before your eventual demise.&nbsp;</p><p>If Geralt's "Witcher" value -- how dedicated he is to his job -- fills too high, he has to fight. Normally, exceeding a value would end in death, but Geralt can fight his way out of a situation. As such, there are dozens of monsters in <em>Reigns: The Witcher</em>, and ones fans will certainly recognize: Drowners, Leshen, trolls, and heck, even dopplers.</p><figure role="group">

<p>Combat doesn't deviate from the swiping gameplay <em>Reigns</em> is known for. It takes place on a grid, with Geralt on the bottom row moving from left to right. Swipe left or right to change direction, all the while tiles fall to the bottom row. The gist of it is, avoid enemy moves while trying to land on your own attacks.&nbsp;</p><p>The trick here is timing, and though it is simplistic in theory, it's honestly a bit difficult to get the hang of at first. Geralt's speed versus that of the falling tiles need to be taken into consideration. Sometimes, you'll have to weigh taking an attack from an enemy in order to land on your own attack to whittle away the monster's health.&nbsp;</p><figure role="group">

<p>Geralt can also use Witcher signs, which often spawn on the bottom row. These can rapidly change the pace of battle by slowing down enemy attacks, or even outright removing them from the board. The sign Quen, for instance, completely tanks an attack, while Igni hurts an enemy without needing to land on an attack tile.</p><p>Fighting monsters is a bit of a drag in the early stages of <em>Reigns: The Witcher. </em>As you achieve new victories in battle, your signs will upgrade, making battles easier. Some of the foes are just way too tough to fight near the start since their attack patterns can be nigh impossible to deal with without the help of signs.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Reigns: The Witcher</em> doesn't throw too many tough enemies until you've acquired more endings and Inspirations, but there are still some instances of RNG that will absolutely destroy you.&nbsp;</p><figure role="group">

<h2><em>Reigns: The Witcher </em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2><p>You're able to reminisce about all of these weird, whimsical stories on various occasions. Throughout the land, certain individuals might call on Dandelion to perform -- these are called Song Puzzles. With these puzzles, you're met with a short narrative that tasks you to choose the correct prompt, with those prompts being various Inspirations you've completed.&nbsp;</p><p>These puzzles add another layer to <em>Reigns: The Witcher'</em>s gameplay that helps it feel more than a random re-skin of the usual <em>Reigns</em> formula. Overall, I sense that the developers and writers have a reverence for the source material, and those who are fans of <em>The Witcher </em>will definitely come to appreciate the callbacks and interactions with familiar characters as we wait for <em>The Witcher 4</em> in the coming years.</p><hr><p><em><strong>Reigns: The Witcher </strong>was reviewed on PC with a copy provided by the publisher over the course of around 12 hours of gameplay. All screenshots were taken during the process of review.</em></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/reigns-witcher-review-ballad-by-dandelion]]></content:encoded>
