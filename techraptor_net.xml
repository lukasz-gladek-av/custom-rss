As you can imagine, it's full of the bones of grand beasts, as well as lots of moody underground scenery.</p><figure role="group">

<p>While exploring the Ossuary Depths, you'll come across some of <em>Deep Rock Galactic </em>Season 6's new enemies, the Ossirans, and they're not big fans of dwarves encroaching on their home, as you can probably guess.</p><p>New enemy types include the Scrab, which will fly at you in swarms, as well as the lurking Pit Jaw, which will leap up from the ground in order to snap unsuspecting dwarves up in its jaws.</p><p>You might well have to contend with these enemies when you're taking on the new Heavy Extraction mission type, which will see you and your squad locating Resinite Mass in order to flag it for extraction.</p><p>You can check out the new narrated trailer for <em>Deep Rock Galactic </em>Season 6, which shows off some of these new features (plus lots more), right here.</p>
<p><em>Deep Rock Galactic </em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/548430/Deep_Rock_Galactic/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/deep-rock-galactic/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/deep-rock-galactic/9nhfvwx1v7qj" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox</a> (although not the Switch or the Switch 2, sadly).
