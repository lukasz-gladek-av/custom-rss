            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you've been wondering what's happened to&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 2</em>, then wonder no more, because Konami has an update for you on how development is going.</p>

<p>As spotted by social media user <a href="https://x.com/Kuwabara357/status/1971126048017322123" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Outsider Snake</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-2-is-still-moving-forward-properly-konami-says/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">VGC</a>),&nbsp;<em>Master Collection&nbsp;</em>producer Noriaki Okamura provided more information about the second volume of the collection during this week's Konami Tokyo Game Show spot.</p>

<p>According to Okamura (via Outsider Snake's translation), development on the second volume is "moving forward properly", and the collection as a whole is "shaping up to be something enjoyable", but fans should "wait just a little longer" for more information about the project.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol.-2-snake-eater.jpg?itok=Jkvw5vd8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol.-2-snake-eater.jpg?itok=A7d8P9Lc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1&nbsp;</em>was released back in 2023, and a second volume is expected.</figcaption></figure><p>Okamura goes on to say that it's "hard to say" exactly how much longer we'll have to wait for more&nbsp;<em>Master Collection Vol. 2&nbsp;</em>news, but that Konami is still working on the compilation, which feels like good news in and of itself.</p>

<p>Of course, we still know very little about what&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 2&nbsp;</em>will feature. Presumably, since the last collection left off at&nbsp;<em>Snake Eater</em>, the new volume will offer a remastered version of&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots</em>, but beyond that, it's tough to say.</p>

<p>If I had to guess, I'd say <i>Vol. 2&nbsp;</i>will remaster&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid 4</em>,&nbsp;<em>Portable Ops</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Peace Walker</em>, and that bonus versions of&nbsp;PSP card battlers&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Ac!d&nbsp;</em>and its sequel will be offered as well, although that might just be wishful thinking on my part.</p>




<p>In any case, if you want to play more&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear</em>, you'll have to content yourself with the recently-released (and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-1m-sales" rel="nofollow">rather successful</a>)&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater&nbsp;</em>for now. Hopefully, we'll get more info about&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 2&nbsp;</em>sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>Back in 2021, Konami <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-1m-sales" rel="nofollow">pledged to revive</a>&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear&nbsp;</em>with new titles, as well as&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Castlevania</em>. Since then, we've seen the release of the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Snake Eater&nbsp;</em>remake, as well as&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-f-officially-revealed-konami" rel="nofollow"><em>Silent Hill f</em></a>, so perhaps&nbsp;<em>Castlevania&nbsp;</em>will get its turn in the sun next (although that would probably turn it to dust).</p>
