It will feature brighter box art alongside updated components and packaging. it isn't as elaborate as the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/catan-masterpiece-kickstarter-fully-funded-within-hour-promoting-bespoke-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Catan Masterpiece</a> Kickstarter, but it is a modest upgrade nonetheless.</p>

<p>These new components will be part of <em>Catan Sixth Edition's</em> more eco-friendly design. Box trays have been redesigned to be more environmentally conscious, and the box will contain fewer plastic pieces. The box also has expanded storage, allowing it to accommodate the 5-6 Player Extension Pack. This doesn't mean the base box can contain all expansions, but it is a start.</p>

<p>On that topic, <em>Catan Sixth Edition</em> will have several expansions. These include Seafarers, Cities &amp; Knights, and the aforementioned 5-6 Player Extension Pack.</p>

<p>Lastly, the game will feature more inclusive, user-friendly design elements. The game's artwork will portray more diverse character illustrations. The newly textured hex tiles and premium card trays will provide a more tactile play experience. Finally, the updated rulebook will contain streamlined rules alongside visual examples, helping more players understand the core experience.</p>

<p>“For CATAN’s 6th edition, we aimed to enhance the player experience while preserving the game’s core mechanics," said Benjamin Teuber, managing director and game designer at CATAN GmbH. "With updated packaging, refreshed artwork, and a streamlined rulebook, we’re honoring our father’s legacy while making the game more approachable for new and longtime players alike."</p>
