            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-x-shadow-generations-sales-million<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega has announced that&nbsp;<em>Sonic x Shadow Generations&nbsp;</em>sales have topped a big milestone on the very day of its launch.</p>

<p>According to a Sega press release (via <a href="https://www.sonicstadium.org/news/games/sonic-x-shadow-generations-sells-over-one-million-units-on-launch-day-r2660/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sonic Stadium</a>),&nbsp;<em>Sonic x Shadow Generations&nbsp;</em>has reached a million sales already, which is pretty impressive given the fact that the game was only released today.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that players who pre-ordered the Digital Deluxe Edition of the game were granted three-day early access, so technically,&nbsp;<em>Sonic x Shadow Generations&nbsp;</em>has been available for a few days, but it was released to the general public today.</p>

<p>Additionally, Sega says it's themed this fiscal year around Shadow, dubbing this initiative "Fearless: Year of Shadow". That makes sense, given that he'll be turning up as a pivotal character in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-sonic-hedgehog-3-movie-trailer-keanu-shadow">upcoming third&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>movie</a> later this year.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Sonic x Shadow Generations&nbsp;</em>is, it's the latest 3D platformer in the long-running and iconic&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog&nbsp;</em>series, and as you've probably guessed, it's themed around everyone's favorite edgy hedgehog Shadow.</p>

<p>The game consists of two parts: a full remaster of 2011's&nbsp;<em>Sonic Generations</em>, complete with "updated visuals and reworked cinematics", and a new game that sees Shadow speeding through some of the levels from games in which he's appeared.</p>




<p>Shadow's campaign is technically a standalone game, so you don't need to play&nbsp;<em>Sonic Generations&nbsp;</em>to enjoy it, but unfortunately, it's not possible to buy Shadow's campaign separately.</p>

<p><em>Sonic x Shadow Generations&nbsp;</em>is available now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2513280/SONIC_X_SHADOW_GENERATIONS/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/sonic-x-shadow-generations/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/sonic-x-shadow-generations/9MVLZDH2FH05" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/sonic-x-shadow-generations-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.
