            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The International Game Developers Association (IGDA) has issued a statement regarding recent adult game bans on platforms like Steam and Itch.io, calling for "greater transparency and fairness" in the matter.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://igda.org/news-archive/press-release-statement-on-game-delistings/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a> on its website, the IGDA says it's "alarmed" by the way in which "legal, consensual, and ethically-developed games, especially from LGBTQ+ and marginalized creators", have been delisted and deplatformed by storefronts like the aforementioned two in recent weeks.</p>

<p>The association says that while it does not wish to engage in "the defense of harmful material", it does want to advocate for "reform, developer voice, and platform accountability", calling for developers' works to be assessed "fairly, transparently, and contextually".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/igda-statement-adult-game-bans-steam.jpg?itok=4TKURuPY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/igda-statement-adult-game-bans-steam.jpg?itok=_5FVIrWG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The IGDA says platforms like Steam aren't assessing adult games fairly or contextually.</figcaption></figure><p>The IGDA laments the sudden ways in which platforms like Steam and Itch.io are delisting and banning adult-oriented content, bemoaning the "lack of transparency around enforcement criteria, sudden shifts in policy, and...absence of appeal pathways" open to developers.</p>

<p>As the IGDA points out, these issues can lead to developers losing income, not to mention damage to their reputation; after all, some might be less likely to buy a developer's next game if they learn the previous effort was banned due to content Steam or Itch.io deem objectionable.</p>

<p>Not only that, but these policies can have a "disproportionate impact on marginalized voices", as the IGDA says. Censorship the association describes as "overreaching" may have a greater impact on "queer, trans, femme-identifying, and POC developers".</p>

<p>So, what does the IGDA recommend? The association is calling for clearer guidelines on what content is prohibited, as well as "timely communication" if action is taken. That's in addition to greater appeal pathways for developers, "advisory panels", and regular transparency reports.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/itch.io-adult-content-bans-igda.jpg?itok=3geS6vM7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/itch.io-adult-content-bans-igda.jpg?itok=rYqnAEAx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Itch.io has also been enacting adult content delistings in recent days.</figcaption></figure><p>This all began a couple of weeks ago, when a report by the activist group <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/open-letter-to-payment-processors" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Collective Shout</a> alleged that platforms like Steam and Itch.io were hosting content that glorified sexual abuse and contravened the guidelines of payment processors like PayPal, Visa, and Mastercard.</p>

<p>Following that campaign's commencement, both Steam <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/itch-io-deindexes-adult-pages" rel="nofollow">and Itch.io</a>&nbsp;began deindexing and delisting adult games from their platforms, the rationale being that if payment processors objected, then they may withdraw their services, leaving customers unable to pay for games.</p>

<p>However, this scorched-earth approach has already begun to affect creators it arguably shouldn't even go near.&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>creator Cara Cadaver, for instance, recently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vile-exhumed-steam-removed-sexual-content" rel="nofollow">reported that her game had been banned from Steam</a>, despite the fact it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/vile-exhumed-review-dirty-computer" rel="nofollow">about as far from a glorification of sexual abuse or violence</a> as it's possible to get.</p>

<p>Let's hope the IGDA's statement stops this issue from getting too out of hand. It's all too easy to imagine a world where developers don't feel confident creating games with any adult themes in them at all for fear of upsetting nebulous organizations that have very little to do with the games they're causing to get banned.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sony Sues Tencent Over Horizon-esque Light of Motiram]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-tencent-light-of-motiram-lawsuit</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-sues-tencent-over-horizon-esque-light-of-motiram.1256004/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has filed a lawsuit against Chinese gaming giant Tencent over the latter's open-world survival game&nbsp;<em>Light of Motiram</em>, which Sony alleges is a "slavish clone" of its own&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>series of games.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/sony-sues-tencent-allegedly-ripping-off-horizon-video-games-2025-07-28/" rel="nofollow">Reuters</a>, the lawsuit was filed in California federal court and accuses Tencent of copyright and trademark infringement over&nbsp;<em>Light of Motiram</em>, which it says contains several elements from the&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>franchise.</p>

<p>According to Sony, it declined to work with Tencent on a&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>spinoff game last year, and the announcement for&nbsp;<em>Light of Motiram</em>, which looks suspiciously similar to&nbsp;<em>Horizon</em>, followed soon afterwards.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/light-of-motiram-sony-tencent-lawsuit.jpg?itok=ff21AEIv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/light-of-motiram-sony-tencent-lawsuit.jpg?itok=gEzoLXQY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Pop quiz: is this shot from&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Light of Motiram</em>? (It's the latter.)</figcaption></figure><p>As part of its lawsuit, Sony is asking for damages (although the amount is undisclosed), as well as an order to block Tencent from violating its IP rights, according to Reuters. Presumably, that means development on&nbsp;<em>Light of Motiram&nbsp;</em>would either immediately cease or swerve direction swiftly.</p>

<p>In case you need a reminder,&nbsp;<em>Light of Motiram&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/light-of-motiram-announced-tencent-horizon" rel="nofollow">announced back in November last year</a>. When I reported on its announcement, I said it had "strong 'we have&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>at home' energy", and I stand by that; the trailer is...well, brazen feels like too mild a word, honestly.</p>

<p>Let's just say that&nbsp;<em>Light of Motiram</em>'s aesthetics, robot wildlife, and tribal outfits are extremely strongly reminiscent of&nbsp;<em>Horizon</em>, so I can understand the grounds on which Sony is pursuing this lawsuit.</p>

<p>You can check out the original announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Light of Motiram&nbsp;</em>below if you want to remind yourself of what, exactly, it's being accused of stealing.</p>




<p>Tencent's proposed&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>collab isn't the only external partnership in the franchise that Sony has backed away from in recent months; back in January, it was reported that an unannounced&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>MMO, developed in conjunction with&nbsp;<em>Guild Wars&nbsp;</em>studio NCSoft, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/horizon-mmo-canceled-report" rel="nofollow">had been canceled</a>.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen whether this lawsuit will materially affect&nbsp;<em>Light of Motiram</em>'s development, but in the meantime, you can still <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3319630/LIGHT_OF_MOTIRAM/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wishlist Tencent's game on Steam</a> if you want.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atari-thunderful-majority-stake</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/atari-acquires-majority-stake-in-steamworld-studio-thunderful.1255986/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Atari has announced that it will acquire a majority stake in&nbsp;<em>SteamWorld&nbsp;</em>publisher Thunderful, and the latter has also revealed that its CEO will be stepping down as soon as a successor is found.</p>

<p>According to an Atari press release, the company will be acquiring 82% of Thunderful's shares, a move CEO Wade Rosen describes as "another important milestone in Atari's development" and a big part of the expansion of Atari's "publishing and development capabilities in the European region".</p>

<p>In a separate <a href="https://thunderfulgroup.com/news-room/press-releases/2025-07-29-thunderful-group-initiates-restructuring-and-provides-business-update" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a> of its own, Thunderful says that it will be undergoing a restructuring operation that will result in layoffs across the studio, with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-in-random-eternal-die-roguelike-announced" rel="nofollow">recent release&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-in-random-eternal-die-roguelike-announced" rel="nofollow">Lost in Random: The Eternal Die</a>&nbsp;</em>selling less than Thunderful had hoped in its second quarter of the year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lost-in-random-the-eternal-die-atari-thunderful.jpg?itok=eYaPsEa9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lost-in-random-the-eternal-die-atari-thunderful.jpg?itok=wD0LkoCp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Atari now owns a majority stake in Thunderful.</figcaption></figure><p>Despite the restructuring, Thunderful says its upcoming slate remains the same, although the studio says it has been "overly dependent on individual game releases" in recent years. It's not entirely clear how the studio intends to pivot away from that reliance, however.</p>

<p>One thing that will be changing as part of Thunderful's restructuring is its CEO. Per <a href="https://thunderfulgroup.com/news-room/press-releases/2025-07-29-martin-walfisz-to-leave-the-role-as-ceo-of-thunderful-group-ab" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">another press release</a>, current CEO Martin Walfisz will be departing the company, but he'll be remaining in his position "until a new CEO has assumed the role".</p>

<p>He will, however, not be remaining beyond December 31st this year at the latest, so we can assume that Thunderful will have found itself another CEO by then.</p>

<p>Atari's investment in Thunderful follows a challenging year and a half for the studio. In January last year, Thunderful <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/thunderful-layoffs-restructuring" rel="nofollow">laid off around 20% of its workforce</a>, and it followed that decision with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/thunderful-closes-studio-financials" rel="nofollow">closure of Stage Clear Studios last May</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/thunderful-layoffs-development" rel="nofollow">yet more staff cuts in November</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/last-kids-on-earth-atari-thunderful.jpg?itok=abtRRxyG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/last-kids-on-earth-atari-thunderful.jpg?itok=Kowq6S90 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Thunderful closed&nbsp;<em>Last Kids on Earth and the Staff of Doom&nbsp;</em>developer Stage Clear Studios last year.</figcaption></figure><p>Atari, meanwhile, has been on something of an acquisition spree in the last couple of years. In 2024, the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atari-intellivision-acquisition" rel="nofollow">acquired its erstwhile rival Intellivision</a>, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/surgeon-simulator-acquired-by-infogrames" rel="nofollow">the&nbsp;<em>Surgeon Simulator&nbsp;</em>IP</a> through its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atari-infogrames-publishing-revival" rel="nofollow">newly-revived Infogrames label</a>.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what its majority stake in Thunderful yields for the latter, but it's unlikely that the&nbsp;<em>SteamWorld&nbsp;</em>studio will continue without some major internal policy shake-ups. Stay tuned for more.</p>
