In our <em>The Gold River Project </em>preview, you'll get to see what it's like being stranded in the wilderness, where everything is not quite what it seems.</p><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/gold-river-project" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="0e367eee-ab76-47df-bc21-b90a2431ae67" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>The Gold River Project</em></a> has you taking on the role of a person going on a camping trip. Fairview Games Inc. promises a survival adventure coupled with a thrilling mystery. The hints of something interesting are there, and I was curious to see if <em>The Gold River Project</em> could deliver on its promises.</p><figure role="group">

<h2>Arriving in Gold River</h2><p>Your adventure begins in a camping office where you can view brochures and look at some nice decorations. You're promised that supplies will be made available at your campsite; upon arriving, however, you find that the campsite is destroyed and you have nothing to your name other than the clothes on your back.</p><p>By all accounts, absolutely everything has gone wrong. The pilot who dropped you off via seaplane left without checking if everything was okay. Your supplies are gone. There are no other people around other than yourself (and if you're playing multiplayer, your friends).</p><blockquote><p>The tutorial seems a little too bare bones for this game, and the situation only gets more disappointing from there.</p></blockquote><p>A short tutorial directs players to their intended campsite and gives serviceable guidance for basic crafting. Once you've looted the area, you can then go wherever you like. If you paid attention, you'll find a note directing you to a cabin at the end of a nearby trail. You're walked through setting up a basic camp, and that's it.</p><p>I'm all for minimalist tutorials, especially in a game like this; a big part of the fun of survival crafting games is figuring things out yourself. That said, the tutorial seems a little <em>too</em> bare bones for this game, and the situation only gets more disappointing from there.</p><figure role="group">

<h2>Crude Crafting and Survival</h2><p>Crafting in <em>The Gold River Project</em> uses a recipe unlock system; you need to research specific items to unlock crafting recipes using a "Learn" function in your inventory. This also destroys the item. In my first attempt, I couldn't find enough cloth to make a bed and had to restart.</p><p>I managed to find everything I needed on my second attempt and set up a small campsite at a nearby cabin. This cabin had a fishing rod and some animal bones inside. I destroyed one animal bone to learn how to make bone fishing hooks, and then I used the second animal bone to make them.</p><p>Much to my displeasure, I found that fishing did not work at all. Maybe I'm missing something, but the guaranteed spawn of these items and a nearby small dock implies that this would be a good place to fish. I spent a good 10 minutes on the shoreline with nothing to show for it.</p><p>Another issue I had was the inability to unlock a crafting bench. I still don't know what you have to research to unlock it, if the item even exists or functions correctly. This locked me out of many of the more interesting items for most of my short playthrough.</p><p>I had enough supplies where I felt comfortable exploring, but night was falling. I decided to go to sleep for the night and get moving in the morning, and this is where I encountered another problem: I couldn't figure out how to sleep to pass the night. I ended up waiting until the sun came up.</p><figure role="group">

<h2>Hints of a Mystery</h2><p>My first in-game day was rife with problems, but I didn't want to give up on <em>The Gold River Project</em> just yet. A map in the visitor's center at the start of the game showed what looked like a fairly large playable area, so I decided to do a bit of exploring.</p><p>There are quite a few cabins, larger buildings, and other points of interest dotting the landscape. Most of these locations have some kind of useful loot, such as food or healing items. I found many items (such as batteries and electronics) that appeared useful but didn't immediately appear to have a use; they couldn't be researched, either.</p><p>Along the way, I found a few bits of lore. A cassette tape here, a handwritten note there. For the most part, though, I found a largely empty world devoid of any kind of meaningful objective other than surviving to the next day.</p><blockquote><p>I would have loved to explore the mystery in Gold River, but the barebones (and barely functional) survival and crafting mechanics killed any desire I had to continue.</p></blockquote><p>I didn't see much in the way of wildlife, either. At one point, I came across two deer next to a building that had a crafting bench inside it. As this was the only time I saw any animals, I strongly suspect that the appearance of these deer was scripted or otherwise pre-placed.</p><p>There was one element that really piqued my curiosity. Some of the buildings have cameras and spotlights on top of them. If you travel far enough, you'll encounter a futuristic force field keeping you in the playable area.</p><p>There's clearly some kind of high-tech surveillance happening here, and whoever is manning these cameras is definitely watching you. I would have loved to explore the mystery in Gold River, but the barebones (and barely functional) survival and crafting mechanics killed any desire I had to continue.</p><figure role="group">

<h2><em>The Gold River Project</em> Preview | Final Thoughts</h2><p>From what I've seen, <em>The Gold River Project</em> is a little undercooked. I can forgive a lack of story and a weak tutorial in an Early Access game, but I can't overlook the poorly functioning survival mechanics and crafting system.</p><p>To the credit of Fairview Games Inc., it's quite upfront that it intends for this to be a genuine Early Access experience where it can collect feedback from players and build out the game from there. It's good that this developer is being up front about that.</p><p>If you're keen on providing genuine feedback to a game that is very much still under development, you might want to check out <em>The Gold River Project</em>. If you're looking for a new survival crafting game to play and enjoy right now, though, it's probably best to wait until <em>The Gold River Project's</em> many rough edges have been smoothed out.</p><hr><p>The Gold River Project <em>was previewed over approximately 6 hours of gameplay on PC via </em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1253220/The_Gold_River_Project/" rel="nofollow"><em>Steam</em></a><em> with a key provided by the publisher. All screenshots were taken during the preview process.</em></p></div><div><p><span><div>
