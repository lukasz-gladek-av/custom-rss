            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/baldurs-gate-3-vatican-city<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Given how popular&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>is, it's no stretch to imagine that the game has been played all around the world, but Larian has revealed that two people in a very unusual place indeed have enjoyed the game.</p>

<p>According to publishing director <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1855995474492207263" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Michael Douse on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, two copies of&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>have been sold in Vatican City, and one person there has it on their Steam wishlist as well.</p>

<p>Douse rather amusingly says he likes to imagine the wishlisting person is "the Pope waiting until he has a free minute", expressing a wish to "see their mod list" and suggesting said list is "absolutely gnarly". That seems like an understatement.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/baldurs-gate-3-vatican-city-karniss.jpg?itok=q9QxJQxL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/baldurs-gate-3-vatican-city-karniss.jpg?itok=TAhuSMY4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>has somehow sold two copies in the Vatican, of all places.</figcaption></figure><p>Technically speaking, the Vatican is a city-state in its own right, although it does qualify as the smallest state in the world. At <a href="https://www.vaticanstate.va/it/stato-governo/note-generali/popolazione.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">last count</a>, 764 people inhabited Vatican City, with 618 of those people being citizens.</p>

<p>It should go without saying that Vatican City is an intensely religious place, so it's quite amusing to imagine someone living in such a place playing&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>, a game that might have been considered heretical by the Catholic Church just a few decades ago.</p>

<p>Perhaps even more amusingly, <a href="https://x.com/samito/status/1856006701259816994" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">one person</a> in the replies to Douse's original post suggests that the two Vatican City sales of&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>were a "clerical error". Badum, and indeed, tish.</p>

<p>In any case, I hope the two Vatican City players of&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>are enjoying it, whoever they happen to be, and I hope whoever has it on their wishlist decides to take the plunge and buy it. You won't regret it!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fortnite OG Returns as a Permanent Game Mode Next Month]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-og-permanent-december<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic has announced that the popular&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>OG game mode is coming back, and this time, it won't be a temporary mode, so you'll be able to ask your friends "where we droppin?" whenever you like.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1856351379838701691" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Epic reveals that&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>OG will return on December 6th, and that it's "here to stay". You'll be able to "explore the OG map, collect OG loot, and relive OG seasons".</p>

<p>It sounds like the new, permanent version of&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>OG will function in a similar way to when this mode appeared as <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-og-drop-back-into-battle-royale-chapter-1?lang=en-US" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">part of the game's fourth season last year</a>, focusing on multiple seasons rather than a single point in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s history.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fortnite-og-permanent-shooting.jpg?itok=3TBk39WX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fortnite-og-permanent-shooting.jpg?itok=rM_jPV6K 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>OG is coming back, and this time, it's "here to stay".</figcaption></figure><p>We don't have much more info about the way&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>OG will work as a permanent game mode, but I expect it'll function similarly to experiences like&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Fortnite Festival</em>, i.e. as a menu option you can pick whenever you want to go back in time.</p>

<p>Epic had already announced that&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>OG <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-will-bring-back-og-in-2024-after-it-shattered-records-with-100-million-players" rel="nofollow">would return at some point</a> this year following the original OG run <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-achieves-biggest-day-ever-with-447-million-players-following-return-of" rel="nofollow">shattering player records in November 2023</a>. They had not, however, revealed that it would be a permanent mode rather than a limited-time seasonal affair.</p>

<p>In any case, if you and your friends want to relive the glory days of&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>(assuming you consider the original seasons to be those glory days, of course), then you now know when you'll be able to jump in and do just that.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fortnite-og-permanent-shotgun.jpg?itok=Dpf74Wxk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fortnite-og-permanent-shotgun.jpg?itok=0IKcvzxp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll soon be able to revisit&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s past whenever you want.</figcaption></figure><p>As a reminder, Epic recently consolidated all of its previously-disparate&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>battle passes, allowing you to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-battle-pass-xp-simplified" rel="nofollow">gain XP for any mode</a> when playing any other mode. That means if you're playing&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>OG, you're also amassing XP for the main battle royale mode,&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite</em>, and everything else.</p>

<p>OG&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>arrives on December 6th, presumably across all platforms on which the game is currently available. Stay tuned for more.</p>
