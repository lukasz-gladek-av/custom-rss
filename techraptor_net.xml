            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Voxel sandbox game&nbsp;<em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>has been given a January Early Access release date, just over a week after its original creators announced its revival.</p>

<p>Hypixel Studios confirmed the news earlier today via the official&nbsp;<em>Hytale&nbsp;</em><a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-early-access-january-13-2026" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, on which it was revealed that the game will be launching into Early Access on PC on January 13th. Pre-orders will begin on December 13th.</p>

<p>Despite that, Hypixel says you shouldn't pre-order the game "if you don't feel comfortable" doing so. The studio is clear on the fact that&nbsp;<em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>will very much be an Early Access release, which means it'll be "unfinished" and "buggy for a while". Caveat emptor, and all that.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hytale-early-access-release-date-bugs.jpg?itok=etey4Iqv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hytale-early-access-release-date-bugs.jpg?itok=LvScV7nC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll do more than your fair share of running away from bugs, as it were, in&nbsp;<em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>in January.</figcaption></figure><p>In the post, Hypixel reiterates what it said last week as part of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hytale-rescued-early-access-soon" rel="nofollow">its announcement</a> that&nbsp;<em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>had been revived, namely that the game will follow "the original vision from the 2018 trailer" and that the developer will be "returning to a four-year-old legacy build that had been abandoned".</p>

<p>As such, "some parts of the game will feel behind" when it launches in January, but despite that, Hypixel says "momentum is strong", so you can expect plenty of updates and communication from the developer throughout the Early Access period.</p>

<p>If you're the kind of person who wants to mod&nbsp;<em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>to make it your own, then you'll be pleased to know modding and creative tools will be available on day one of Early Access, even though they're "not where [Hypixel wants] them long term".</p>

<p>Hypixel closes by warning players that the Early Access build of&nbsp;<em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>will be "rough", but promises that "the path ahead matters more". It seems like it really is important to set your expectations accordingly here.</p>




<p><em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>began life as a custom&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>server before being spun off into its own entity in 2018, with&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Valorant</em>'s Riot Games <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/riot-games-hytale-acqusition-adds-blocky-adventure-to-roster" rel="nofollow">stepping in to purchase Hypixel</a> in 2020.</p>

<p>However, the partnership between Hypixel and Riot ended earlier this year when the latter <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hytale-canceled-dev-shuts-down" rel="nofollow">shut down the former</a> and seemingly canceled&nbsp;<em>Hytale</em>, although the game has since risen from the ashes under the stewardship of some of the original server's co-founders.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>when it launches on PC via Early Access on January 13th next year. Stay tuned for more.</p>
