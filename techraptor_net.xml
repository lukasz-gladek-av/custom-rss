<p>Over the course of the introductory trailer, we got to see not only a look at the world of <em>Pokemon Winds and Waves</em>, but also at some of the Pokemon that will appear in it, including Wailord, Tangela, and Sandygast, to name but a few.</p><p>We also got to see the new starter lineup, and Nintendo and Game Freak are sticking with the Fire-Grass-Water trio, as you'd probably expect.</p><p>On the Grass side, this gen's starter is monobrowed bird Browt. It's joined by the fiery Pomeranian Pombon and the giggling water gecko Gecqua. I'm placing bets right now on Pombon becoming bipedal when it evolves into its final form.</p><p>The trailer concludes with a dive underwater, where we see more Pokemon swimming freely around. It looks like you'll be able to dive and explore beneath the water's surface as part of the game.</p>
<p><em>Pokemon Winds and Waves </em>were revealed as part of the latest Pokemon Presents show, during which we also learned that <em>Pokemon XD: Gale of Darkness </em>is coming to Switch Online in March, and that <em>Pokemon Champions </em>will arrive on Switch in April.</p><p>Nintendo also showed off the Switch versions of <em>Pokemon FireRed and LeafGreen</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-firered-leafgreen-switch" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="057d121c-d519-4dfa-af54-03ce59fa9f52" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">which are out today</a>. <em>Pokemon Home </em>compatibility is coming to both games at some point in the future.</p><p><em>Pokemon Winds and Waves </em>arrive exclusively for Switch 2 in 2027. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
