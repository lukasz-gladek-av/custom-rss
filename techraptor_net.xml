            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Dragami Games and Nada Holdings have announced that they're working together on a new&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw&nbsp;</em>game, as well as an anime adaptation that will presumably focus on the events of the original game.</p>

<p>Following the announcement of the two companies' partnership <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-lollipop-chainsaw-projects-coming" rel="nofollow">last week</a>, a new <a href="https://nadaholdings.com/new-lollipop-chainsaw-ip-development-to-feature-brand-new-game-and-anime-adaptation/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the Nada Holdings website confirms that a brand new game is in development. The team includes "key staff members who were involved in the previous title", according to Nada.</p>

<p>Not only that, but the new&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw&nbsp;</em>game will be developed "with close attention to fan feedback", and Nada says it will be free of "excessive creative restrictions in the name of DEI". To that, I can only say "hmm".</p>

<p>As well as the new game, Dragami and Nada also confirmed that an anime adaptation of&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw&nbsp;</em>is in the works. The announcement doesn't contain any more details about that adaptation, though, so we don't know which studio is working on it or what the story will be.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw</em>, it's a hack-and-slash action game developed by Grasshopper Manufacture and originally released back in 2012. The game revolves around Juliet Starling, a cheerleader who must battle a horde of zombies alongside the disembodied head of her boyfriend Nick.</p>




<p><em>Lollipop Chainsaw&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-remaster-remake" rel="nofollow">remastered last year</a>&nbsp;and released for modern systems complete with upgraded visuals and performance. According to Nada and Dragami, the game has surpassed 1.5 million sales so far, which explains why they're eager to create a followup.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Itch.io Deindexes NSFW Pages Due to Payment Processor Pressure]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/itch-io-deindexes-adult-pages</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/itch-io-deindexes-nsfw-pages-due-to-payment-processor-pressure.1251954/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Itch.io has announced that it's deindexing all of its adult-oriented NSFW pages from search engines and browsing due to "scrutiny from [its] payment processors".</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://itch.io/updates/update-on-nsfw-content" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on the Itch.io website, Itch.io says it understands this is a "sudden and disruptive" action, and that creators weren't provided with advance notice beforehand, which it acknowledges is "not ideal".</p>

<p>However, the site says it recently came under "scrutiny" from its payment processor partners regarding "some content hosted on Itch.io", pointing specifically to a campaign started by Collective Shout earlier this month that drew payment processors' attention to a game by the name of&nbsp;<em>No Mercy</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/itch.io-deindexing-adult-content-main-page.jpg?itok=Xdbp_IWq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/itch.io-deindexing-adult-content-main-page.jpg?itok=2t9gwK3d 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Itch.io is deindexing all of its adult content pages due to controversy surrounding a game called&nbsp;<em>No Mercy</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Collective Shout released an <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/open-letter-to-payment-processors" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">open letter</a> to payment processors like PayPal, Mastercard, and Discover, outlining the (admittedly rather disturbing) ways in which&nbsp;<em>No Mercy "</em>fl[ies] in the face of efforts to address violence against women".</p>

<p>In the letter, the group says the fact that Itch.io and Steam hosted the game effectively means payment processors are "facilitating and profiting from rape, incest and child sexual abuse game sales", which led to Itch.io's decision to deindex adult pages.</p>

<p>Itch.io says it's in the process of "conducting a comprehensive audit of content" to ensure it meets payment processors' requirements, and that pages will stay deindexed while the review is conducted.</p>

<p>Once the review is complete, new compliance measures will be introduced, including a checkbox creators must tick in order to "confirm that their content is allowable under the policies of the respective payment processors linked to their account". Some pages may also be permanently removed.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steam-itch.io-deindexing-adult-content.jpg?itok=NmWsKJD0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steam-itch.io-deindexing-adult-content.jpg?itok=2iyArk7h 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Valve also recently took steps to address payment processors' concerns on Steam.</figcaption></figure><p>Itch.io isn't the only platform taking these steps, either. Last week, Valve <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valve-pulls-adult-only-games-from-steam-as-it-tightens-rules-to-appease-payment-partners" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">began the process</a> of pulling dozens of sexually explicit games from Steam, citing concerns from its payment processors regarding the nature of said games.</p>

<p>It's been a weird twelve months for Itch.io; back in December, the site was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/itchio-offline-funko-phishing-brandshield" rel="nofollow">taken offline for several hours</a> following a phishing claim from the toy brand Funko, which site founder Leaf Corcoran called "bogus" (the claim, not Funko itself). Funko and its partner BrandShield <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/funko-brandshield-itch-io-denial" rel="nofollow">denied causing the shutdown</a>.</p>

<p>It doesn't seem like this situation is going to be resolved quite as quickly as that one was, unfortunately. Stay tuned for more.</p>
