            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Riot Games has released a teaser for their upcoming <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/league-of-legends" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>League of Legends</em></a> card game. While the English-language release is just a few months away, the studio already has plans for the second set, <em>Riftbound Spiritforged</em>.</p>



<p>In an official press release from Riot Games, they provided a few crumbs of information on <em>Riftbound Spiritforged</em>. This will be the second set released after the <em>Riftbound Origins</em> set, which is scheduled for release in English in October.</p>

<blockquote>
<div><p>Once <em>Riftboundʼs</em> origin story is told, itʼs time to become Spritiforged. This dynamic second set&nbsp;<br>
introduces new champions to the game, like Ezreal, Fiora, Irelia, Lucian, and Rumble. Spiritforged&nbsp;<br>
features 200+ new cards, two new Champion Decks you can pick up and play right out of the box,&nbsp;<br>
and a whole lot more.&nbsp;</p><p>
&nbsp;
Riftbound: Spiritforged launches in December 2025 for China and February 2026 in English</p></div>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Riftbound</em> is Riot's attempt to bring the deep lore and iconic characters from <em>League of Legends</em> into the TCG space. The game aims to bring in both tabletop veterans and new players with a mix of accessible and deep gameplay. A gameplay mix that, according <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/riftbound-league-of-legends-tcg-mixes-fast-gameplay-consistent-resource-system" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">to our preview</a>, appears to be on the right track. The game will support 1v1, 2v2, and 4-player free-for-all formats.</p>

<p>The <em>Riftbound Spiritforged</em> teaser does demonstrate Riot's commitment to supporting their TCG game. It is a space that has been heavily dominated for decades by the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/pokemon-trading-card-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Pokemon TCG</em></a>. But more recent competition, <em>Disney Lorcana</em>, has shown a place can be made in that space with the right amount of appeal and gameplay polish.</p>

<p>The teaser does invite some questions. The set will feature two premade Champion Decks. Who will be featured in those decks? How will the game's champions be represented in this new TCG format? Only time will tell.</p>
