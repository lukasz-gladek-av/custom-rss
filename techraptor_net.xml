            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-early-access-server-issues-warning<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>developer Grinding Gear Games has warned that the game may run into server issues during its Early Access launch period owing to the sheer volume of players who've redeemed keys.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/pathofexile/status/1864880645228630299" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message on social media platform X</a>, Grinding Gear technical director Jonathan Rogers says that a million&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>Early Access keys have been redeemed, which counts both sales of the game and those who've received a free key for spending a certain amount on the original&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile</em>.</p>

<p>Rogers says that the sheer volume of redemptions means there are "probably going to be some queues" over the weekend, and that Grinding Gear "really didn't expect" a million players to log in at the same time.</p>

<p>Rogers goes on to say that he and Grinding Gear "quite frankly don't know what our backend services are going to be able to handle" with regards to player numbers, and that while everything's been scaled up as far as it will go, it's not clear what "limits" could be hit during the first weekend.</p>

<p>In conclusion, Rogers says that if&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>does hit server issues over the course of the launch weekend, then the dev team will work as hard as it can to solve those issues, so if you do hit queues, be patient; fixes will be on the way.</p>




<p><em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>is the sequel to&nbsp;<em>Diablo</em>-style action RPG&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile</em>. It packs in a brand new campaign, hundreds of new monsters, and plenty of loot to gather, plus new skills to discover and more.</p>
