            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/technology/features/samsung-is-releasing-3d-monitor-that-feels-like-beefed-up-nintendo-3ds-screen<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I remember as a kid, the Nintendo 3DS absolutely floored me. 3D effects could jump out of handheld screens? It was magical, but also something that I couldn't imagine scaling up well.</p>

<p>Then Samsung put forth its new gaming monitor lineup, featuring the Odyssey 3D. This glasses-free monitor presents similarly to the 3DS's top screen but in 4K at 165Hz.</p>

<p>Introduced last year at CES, this screen adds a sense of depth to your games and YouTube videos. It sounded a little gimmicky to me when I first heard about it, so I had to try it out for myself to see if it's worth the hype.</p>



<h2>The Samsung Odyssey 3D Monitor Breaks the Fourth Wall</h2>

<p>I visited Samsung's offices in Bellevue, WA to get some hands-on time with the Odyssey 3D (the G90XF model). Almost immediately, I was surprised by how good the 3D effect looked. It took a second to adjust to my eyes, but once it did, the sense of the depth made me feel like I could reach into the screen, almost like an aquarium or diorama.</p>

<p>With two stereoscopic cameras at the top of the bezel, the monitor tracks your eyes to optimally adjust the parallax effect. Every now and then, I'd look away, then look back, and within seconds the effect readjusted.</p>

<p>I panned my head in all directions around the monitor to test how adaptable the eye tracking was, and as long as I didn't move too fast and was within range, it would maintain the 3D effect.</p>

<p>There's a distinction between the two kinds of games that will work with this monitor though. Some games are co-developed with the Odyssey 3D in mind, like <em>The First Berserker: Khazan</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/samsung-odyssey-3d-khazan.jpg?itok=tiQlBehz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/samsung-odyssey-3d-khazan.jpg?itok=kfis3896 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's hard to capture with my phone's camera, but the 3D effects really pop out here, especially that giant flower in the foreground.</figcaption></figure><p>The 3D effects stood out to me here, with the snow effects especially looking—and feeling—like I'm looking into a snow globe (with lots blood and action). <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/lies-of-p-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Lies of P</em></a> is also slated to receive this co-developed treatment later this summer.</p>

<p>The other kinds of games are certified by Samsung to work with the 3D monitor, though the 3D effect isn't as built into the games. These titles include <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/dragon-ball-z-kakarot-review" rel="nofollow">Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/palworld-preview" rel="nofollow">Palworld</a></em>, and the <em>Grand Theft Auto Trilogy</em> remasters.</p>

<p>It's hard to describe, but the 3D effect didn't feel as pronounced in the other games I tried out compared to <em>Khazan</em>. It felt more like a filter applied after the fact, instead of something from the ground up. It was still pretty good though, and it made things pop more than it usually would in a more classic experience.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/samsung-odyssey-3d-goku.jpg?itok=XkGehlxz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/samsung-odyssey-3d-goku.jpg?itok=DsGK00-C 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Here, with the camera misaligned, it's easy to see "double" here instead of the 3D image that both of your eyes would see in person.</figcaption></figure><p>Within the first year, Samsung is aiming to have 50 3D compatible games on its list (in total of both types). I was hoping to see a strategy game like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/civilization-vii" rel="nofollow"><em>Civilization VII</em></a> on the demo station, since I was curious how that isometric perspective would feel in 3D. But maybe down the line, we'll see it come up.</p>

<p>In addition to gaming, the Odyssey 3D can transform normal videos into 3D using the power of AI. As long as the video doesn't have DRM (e.g. a Netflix stream) and is in full screen, the Realty Lab app can take care of the rest. It can even take stereoscopic videos on YouTube and layer them into one 3D image.</p>

<p>I'd personally want to do more testing with this 3D conversion technology, because for some videos, it worked nicely, like a 4K scene from <em>Spider-Man: Far From Home</em>. For other videos, like a stereoscopic POV rollercoaster, I could see double every now and then instead of a "3D" image.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/civilization-7-screenshot.jpg?itok=OZmZod07 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/civilization-7-screenshot.jpg?itok=fcDPEzNx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Could you imagine a game like this in 3D?</figcaption></figure><h2>The Power of 3D Gaming Is Heavy</h2>

<p>For all the games involved, what surprised me the most was the smoothness of the experience. There weren't any noticeable frame-rate dips, and the crisp 4K resolution made everything stand out in high detail. That was something I worried about, since the PC would have to run the game as is and also process the 3D aspect on top of that.</p>

<p>However, I'm also fully aware that the demo station I played on was likely decked out with high-end gear. For an optimal 3D experience at home, Samsung recommends an Intel i7 or AMD Ryzen 7 1700X or higher, with at least 32GB of DRR5 5600 RAM. For AI video conversion to 3D, you'll specifically need an RTX 3080 or better (sorry AMD fans).</p>

<p>For hardcore PC gamers, these specs might not be too far out of reach, but needless to say, 3D gaming isn't exactly for mass consumption. It's a luxury good for a luxury gamer, if the monitor's $1,999 price tag didn't give that away.</p>



<p>That's where I ultimately get hung up on the Odyssey 3D monitor. Was it a cool experience? Absolutely. Will every major AAA PC game come out with support for this one monitor? Only time will tell, but likely not. Even then, is it worth the high price of entry? That's something only you and your wallet can decide, but personally, I'm not sure it is.</p>

<p>When you look at what else you can buy for $2,000 in the PC gaming space—a new VR headset, a GPU upgrade, a nicer gaming chair—it's hard to justify a monitor that does a gimmick very well but only for a certain selection of games.</p>

<p>Even in the monitor market, some of the best competitors out there cost less than half of the Odyssey 3D and offer more arguably useful features, like higher refresh rates or OLED panels.</p>

<p>If the idea of 3D gaming appeals to you, I don't want to yuck your yum. The Odyssey 3D will answer your needs very well and then some. Just don't go bankrupt for it.</p>
