            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/drunkards-druggies-delinquents-pre-orders-now-open<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Pre-orders are now live for <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1183ce14-1675-44b1-af00-4d7855d7f06c" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/chris-prynoski-talks-drunkards-druggies-and-delinquents-how-420-joke-became" rel="nofollow"><em>Drunkards, Druggies, &amp; Delinquents</em></a>. This light RPG experience is the tabletop game debut for Titmouse, the animation studio behind many beloved mature animated shows spanning both character dramas and crass comedies.</p>



<p>In an official press release, Titmouse announced pre-orders went live for <em>Drunkards, Druggies, &amp; Delinquents</em> as part of the company celebrating their 25th anniversary. Copies of the game will begin shipping in late August ahead of a Fall 2025 retail release.</p>

The lead creators are company Founder Chris Prynoski and Chief Creative Officer Antonio Canobbio. The game is designed for 3-8 adult players and a single game can last roughly 1-3 hours.</p>

<p><em>Drunkards, Druggies, &amp; Delinquents</em> is a blend of a light TTRPG, fantasy quest, party game, and collaborative trainwreck. Players take on the roles of unpredictable anti-heroes taking on increasingly absurd quests, leading to wild improvisation and escalating hilarity. The character classes include the Beerbarian, Weed Wraith, the Whiskey Wizard, and the Druid of the Flower.</p>

<p>The focus of the game isn't on strategy or victory, but on improv. Yes, you can get equipment for your character, and you do roll dice to resolve challenges. The twist is that if your character gets hurt, you have to drink or partake in whatever substance you have on hand. If you want a cleaner experience, these explicit prompts can be swapped out for drinking soda or doing dares.</p>

<p>This explicit style of game is in keeping with Titmouse's body of work. They are an award-winning animation studio whose work includes Mike Judge's <em>Beavis &amp; Butthead</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/star-trek-lower-decks-buffer-time-card-game-about-doing-starfleet-menial-tasks" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Star Trek: Lower Decks</em></a>, Adult Swim's <em>The Venture Bros</em>, and Critical Role's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/legend-of-vox-machina-season-4-confirmed-by-critical-role-and-prime-video-ahead-of-s3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>The Legend of Vox Machina</em></a>.</p>
