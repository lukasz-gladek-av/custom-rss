            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Saber Interactive and publisher Focus Entertainment have revealed what you can expect from next week's&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>Anniversary Update, as well as what's coming as part of the game's second full year of content.</p>

<p>As revealed in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/500582260112622093" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post on Steam</a>,&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>'s Anniversary Update, otherwise known as Update 10.0, lands on September 4th (a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-september" rel="nofollow">very important date in the gaming calendar</a>). It brings with it a brand new PvE mission, a new Helbrute Onslaught PvP mode, three new weapons, and tons more.</p>

<p>It'll be the last-but-one update this year, with Patch 11 set to arrive sometime in the fourth quarter. It'll add another new PvE mission, as well as new mission pickups and new stratagems for you and your squad to consider.</p>

You'll also get the new Techmarine class, as well as its Omnissiah Axe weapon and an expansion for the Battle-Barge.</p>

<p>Lots more is coming to&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>throughout next year as well, including more missions, new enemies, and new PvP arenas, as well as a new Siege map in the second quarter of 2026. Don't say Focus and Saber don't spoil you!</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with <i>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</i>(or, to give it its full title,&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</em>), it's a sequel to the cult 2011 classic&nbsp;<em>Space Marine</em>. Like its predecessor,&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>is a third-person shooter, but it has more of a focus on live-service-style updates and content than the first game did.</p>

<p>The campaign picks up the story of Ultramarine Captain Demetrian Titus, who must battle through hordes of Tyranids in order to prove his loyalty to his chapter after the events of the first game.</p>




<p>A third&nbsp;<em>Space Marine&nbsp;</em>game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-space-marine-3-revealed" rel="nofollow">is officially in development</a> following the success of the second installment, and not only that, but the devs behind&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>are currently working on a game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-marine-2-devs-hasbro-tentpole-ip" rel="nofollow">based on a "tentpole" Hasbro IP</a>, although we don't know which one just yet.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>right now on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, and if you want to know what I thought of the game, you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review" rel="nofollow">read my review right here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco and FromSoftware have announced a new difficulty mode for&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, and this one aims to test the mettle of even the most hardened Nightfarer.</p>

<p>As revealed in <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-high-difficulty-expedition-mode-deep-of-night-has-appeared" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a news post</a> on the game's official website,&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>'s Deep of Night difficulty update will arrive on September 11th (that's two weeks from now at time of writing). It's a "high-difficulty challenge mode" designed for those who have seen everything&nbsp;<em>Nightreign </em>currently has to offer.</p>

<p>Naturally, in Deep of Night, you'll face stronger enemies than you normally would. Not only that, but you won't be able to choose which Nightlord you're facing, so you won't know which of&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>'s bosses you'll need to prepare for.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-deep-of-night-difficulty-castle.jpg?itok=KPefjiWm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-deep-of-night-difficulty-castle.jpg?itok=SCQaUUQW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>is getting a brand new difficulty mode in two weeks' time.</figcaption></figure><p>Terrain changes in your base&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>campaign (i.e. the appearance of certain extra land features) won't be reflected in Deep of Night, so you won't be able to use the mode to pursue some of your characters' objectives, it seems.</p>

<p>If you decide to play on the new difficulty setting, you'll be able to gain special Depths Relics exclusive to the mode, as well as weapons that come with "multiple additional, but also detrimental effects".</p>

<p>What's more, difficulty increases with each "descent"; FromSoftware and Bandai Namco say that wins and losses will affect your Deep of Night rating. Presumably, the more wins you accrue, the higher the difficulty will become.</p>

<p>The real endpoint for Deep of Night is depth level 3; after that, depths 4 and 5 offer "an endless battle for those seeking even greater thrills", so they're essentially true roguelike modes for those who like to test their resolve.</p>

The game sees players teaming up to beat bosses known as Nightlords by exploring a randomized map over the course of a three-day cycle.</p>

<p><em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>may be a hit, but&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>is no slouch in and of itself; according to Bandai Namco's latest numbers, the game has managed to accrue <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-nightreign-sales" rel="nofollow">over five million sales</a>.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2622380/ELDEN_RING_NIGHTREIGN/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/elden-ring-nightreign/9pj22qnvcz3g" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and the Deep of Night difficulty mode arrives on September 11th.
