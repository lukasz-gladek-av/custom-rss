Games Workshop announced an official Warhammer 40,000 Imperial Hymn in celebration of the holidays, allowing fans to praise the God Emperor of Man during the most wonderful time of the year.</p>

<h2>The Warhammer 40,000 Imperial Hymn Announcement</h2>

<p>In an official <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/s48clzhx/praise-the-emperor-with-the-first-ever-official-imperial-hymn/" rel="nofollow">Warhammer Community post</a>, Games Workshop revealed the <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> Imperial Hymn through a first-of-its-kind music video.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40000-imperial-hymn-sister-of-battle.jpg?itok=JDwL8wx_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40000-imperial-hymn-sister-of-battle.jpg?itok=IPUA3OH9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In the world of <em>Warhammer 40,000</em>, humanity has no time for cheer, hope, or goodwill towards men. This is due to the authoritarian nightmare regime that is the Imperium of Man, demanding absolute loyalty to the eradication its enemies. Heretics, xenos scum, and the forces of Chaos must be given no quarter.</p>

<p>So how else can you celebrate the holidays in the grim darkness of the far future but with a hymn singing the praises of the all-powerful God Emperor of Man?</p>

<p>Given the franchise's rising popularity thanks to the sales of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Space Marine 2</em></a> and its mainstream exposure through the anthology series <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/warhammer-40000-secret-level-trailer-brings-glory-to-imperium" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Secret Level</em></a>, it would makes sense that Games Workshop would go this extra mile.</p>

<p>In this regard, Games Workshop pulled out all the stops for the <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> Imperial Hymn music video. The video itself has the song being sung by the Sisters of Battle. The audio plays out among animated vignettes of them on bloody battlefields and kneeling in prayer in gothic cathedrals.</p>

The choral singers were hand selected and directed by George Elekov in Sofia, Bulgaria.</p>

<p>For diehard fans, the lyrics are of special note. The hymn isn't sung in English but in the fictional language of the Imperium: High Gothic. This blend of Latin and other languages hasn't been explicitly spoken or seen before in Warhammer 40,000 works. If you're a huge fan of this setting's impeccably vast lore, this is for you.</p>

<p>Lastly, if you are interested in the vignettes in this music video, a limited supply of art prints will be available for purchase in the New Year.</p>
