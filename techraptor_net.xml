            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/fablecraft-npc-homebrew-features-arrives-next-week<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Official <em>Fablecraft</em> NPC homebrew support is coming. The developers of the digital TTRPG, Riftweaver, announced they would be rolling out more custom features for Game Masters earlier this year, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/developers-of-digital-ttrpg-fablecraft-announce-homebrew-tools" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">starting with music</a>. Starting this week, making custom NPCs will be added to their tools.</p>

<h2>The <em>Fablecraft</em> NPC Homebrew announcement</h2>

<p>The first phase of the <em>Fablecraft</em> NPC homebrew update was announced via <a href="https://x.com/FablecraftGame/status/1869417434958205409" rel="nofollow">social media post</a> on X (formerly Twitter) through the official <em>Fablecraft</em> account. The post was a one minute, forty-seven second video showing the feature in action.</p>

As the name entails, it allows you to take a preexisting NPC statblock, replicate it, then add custom text and images.</p>

<p>The video demonstrates this by taking a Meadow Hound creature and making it appear as one of the developer's dogs, Skipper. Players can give the NPCs custom names, subtitles, background information, description, token size, whether they are friend or foe, and their preferred region.</p>

<p>Notably, the <em>Fablecraft</em> NPC homebrew feature allows you to import images into the game. The image in question is limited to 10 MB and a JPG or PNG at 1920x 1080 resolution is recommended. The image can be adjusted and cropped in-game once it is uploaded.</p>

<p>There is also a check box that must be hit stating the image adheres to <em>Fablecraft's</em> Terms of Service. Obviously this is in place to prevent bad actors from uploading offensive, inflammatory, or otherwise transgressive images into the game.</p>

<p>The feature is one more step towards <em>Fablecraft's</em> intended goal of making a digital RPG where players can enjoy the fantasy of a tabletop experience without in-depth knowledge of a certain RPG system. It's a fantasy so appealing the professional Game Master service <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/fablecraft-startplaying-partnership-announced-by-developers" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">StartPlaying</a> partnered with them.</p>
