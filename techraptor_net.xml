            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This past weekend at New York Comic Con saw the announcement of a <em>Delicious in Dungeon</em> board game localization. Yen Press has announced that the tabletop adaptation of Ryuko Kui's fantasy manga will be getting an official English-language release.</p>

<h2>The <em>Delicious in Dungeon</em> Board Game Localization Announcement</h2>

<p>At a panel at New York Comic Con, Yen Press announced it had secured the rights for an English-language version of the <em>Delicious in Dungeon</em> board game. This announcement came alongside the company's purchase of the licenses of several manga and graphic novels.</p>

The manga follows a group of adventurers as they delve deep into a dungeon on a mission to rescue a friend. This standard fantasy trope is elevated by the dungeon being a fully fleshed-out ecosystem, complete with individual monsters having unique anatomy. Which means, if you know what to do, the monsters can be turned into delicious meals.</p>

<p>The original Japanese release, according to a report by <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/delicious-in-dungeon-board-game/announced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Wargamer</a>, was published in 2022 and features original artwork by Kui. This is notable because it is two years before the debut of the&nbsp;<em>Delicious in Dungeon</em> anime, which catapulted the series into mainstream popularity. The game is a rough adaptation of Ginichiro Suzuki's 1998 board game, <em>Monster Maker</em>, with some dungeon crawl elements.</p>

While, according to an interview <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/comics/delicious-in-dungeon-manga-creator-known-for-immaculate-dandd-vibes-says-shes-actually-never-played-dandd-but-loves-rpgs-like-baldurs-gate-3/" rel="nofollow">by GamesRadar</a>, she hasn't played the most popular of fantasy TTRPGs, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>, Kui has put plenty of time into the officially licensed critical masterpiece, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/baldurs-gate-3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a>.</p>

<p>The English release of the <em>Delicious in Dungeon</em> board game will be available May 2026.</p>
