            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/epic-games-store-to-give-devs-100-revenue-for-first-1m-per-year-from-june.1179612/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-games-store-revenue-share-100<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic has announced changes to its Epic Games Store revenue share model, and the new terms, which will kick in next month, are pretty favorable for developers.</p>

<p>In a news <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/new-epic-games-store-webshops-and-revenue-share-update" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on its website, Epic says that from June, it will give developers 100% revenue for the first $1m they earn each year, and that's on a per-app basis as well. From then, the standard 88-12 revenue share (that's 12% to Epic) will kick in.</p>

<p>Epic says it thinks this revenue share will provide "an even better deal for developers", and given that player counts on the Store are <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-games-store-year-in-review-2024" rel="nofollow">continuing to rise</a>, this seems like a good time to introduce those terms.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/epic-games-store-revenue-share-fortnite.jpg?itok=F6ZNCoDr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/epic-games-store-revenue-share-fortnite.jpg?itok=D_FBL6fx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Epic wants to show people it's not just&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>on the Epic Games Store.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as introducing the new revenue share model, Epic has also announced Webshops, a new feature that enables developers to introduce their own out-of-app purchase systems "as a more cost-effective alternative to in-app purchases".</p>

<p>Epic is specifically referring to mobile ecosystems like Android and Apple's iOS, which the company says "charge exorbitant fees". Thanks to recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-apple-500-million-euro-fine" rel="nofollow">legal rulings</a> in Epic's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-google-victory-play-store" rel="nofollow">favor</a>, however, devs can now send players outside of those ecosystems to alternative webshops with different payment systems.</p>

<p>Additionally, if you spend any money in Epic's Webshops, you will "accrue 5% Epic Rewards" on all of your purchases. If there's something you've got your eye on and it's in an Epic Webshop, then it might be a good idea to opt for that instead of the alternatives.</p>

<p>Admittedly, the new revenue share model and the Webshop system will likely benefit developers and publishers more than players, but if more devs get better deals with Epic, then perhaps they'll have more cash left over to make more games, eh?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/wizkids-adult-adamantine-dragon-review-steel-yourself-for-this-challenge<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I don't think that I'm the only person to believe that you can never have enough dragon miniatures. While it's great to have some that reside in <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="72283661-e76b-4c88-a508-3288a167599c" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/wizkids-return-of-dragons-review" rel="nofollow">Dungeons</a>, it's also important to have some Dragons coming from <em>Planescape</em>. Ahead of it's release we got to look at Wizkids Adult Adamantine Dragon in both it's painted and unpainted variant.</p>

<p>The Adult Adamantine Dragon, featured on the cover of last March's Pathfinder: Monster Core book, is one of the primal and skymetal dragons. This is a lumbering dragon caught in mid flight (and mid chomp) as it's elevated from it's 75mm clear base.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizkids-adult-adamantine-dragon-dragon-and-box.jpg?itok=E8f4Kmwh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizkids-adult-adamantine-dragon-dragon-and-box.jpg?itok=RkJ0mPD7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Looking over this dragon it's fierce at every angle. From the front you can see it's focused eyes and large gaping maw, claws are forward ready to strike, and even the points of it's wings and tail look like they're ready to dig in and cause some damage.</p>

<p>These fearsome tactics are reflected in the creatures stat block as well. With melee options for it's jaws, claw, and tail the miniature wants to make sure you're away to watch out for it's apendages.</p>

<h2>Attacks Represented In Motion</h2>

<p>All of that is not even mentioning what you can't see from the monster including an Avalanche Breath that will have the creature belching a mass of boulders (maybe some nice rocks from outside will accompany this dragon nicely).</p>

<p>A lot of incredible detail has been done on the Adamantine effects of the dragon. No matter which part of it you're looking at it's very clear to see where the flesh and scales of the dragon make way for the tougher metals that protrude from it's body.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizkids-adult-adamantine-dragon-back-of-dragon.jpg?itok=kuLe4gKD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizkids-adult-adamantine-dragon-back-of-dragon.jpg?itok=qLSXsKrj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Some particularly fantastic points of detail are the armoring around the neck, allowing enough protection while also giving the dragon full movement, down the tail and to the tip almost looking like a mace in its own right, and the sprawl of patterning on Adamantine chunks on the wing make it look just as beautiful as it is powerful.</p>

<p>For the texture I've seen a lot of work that Wizkids has done where through slightly rough patterning is able to recreate a feel somewhat similar to leather, here the bulkiness of the chunks of armor do a fantastic job to show just how sturdy an opponent this is.</p>

<p>The patterning and look of this dragon also do a great job of prompting the DM for not only their positioning, but understanding the scale and where a dragon such as this could be laying in wait. While we know that the Adamantine Dragon is proficient at digging whose to say a party moving through a quarry of metals doesn't walk by a pile that is in fact the dragon itself.</p>

<h2>Unpainted And Primed To Fight</h2>

<p>Alongside the painted edition I also got to see how it looks unpainted. For someone ready to challenge themselves this would be an excellent dragon form to lend some color to. While it retains it's powerful and imposing form you'll get to put your painting skills to the test trying to fill it out.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizkids-adult-adamantine-dragon-unpainted.jpg?itok=7FjaMbEw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizkids-adult-adamantine-dragon-unpainted.jpg?itok=ZyuT9DFT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Quite interestingly, while I already loved the look of the Adamantine, skin, and color shift in the wings when you put the fully painted version next to the unpainted edition it shows you even more just how fantastic this dragon looks.</p>

<h2>Adult Adamantine Dragon Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>It's always a good day when you can approach your RPG table and drop a dragon down before them. The Adult Adamantine Dragon is great because it can fit with almost any mountainous terrain, or even deep in mines where rare minerals could be found.</p>

<p>Wizkids has created an impressive dragon here that shows off the power of it's form, while also so perfectly nailing the aesthetic of the skymetal that covers this dragon from head to spiny tail.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Grand Theft Auto VI Release Date and Delay Revealed]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-vi-release-date-delay</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/grand-theft-auto-vi-release-date-and-delay-revealed.1179549/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-vi-release-date-delay<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rockstar and Take-Two have announced the&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI&nbsp;</em>release date at long last, but if you were hoping for the game to be released this year, then you're going to be disappointed.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://x.com/RockstarGames/status/1918265468076605706" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X,&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI&nbsp;</em>will be launching on May 26th next year, which Rockstar acknowledges is "later than you expected". The studio gives a pretty standard reason for the game's delay; it needs time to "deliver at the level of quality" players expect, and it wants to "try and exceed your expectations".</p>

<p><em>Grand Theft Auto VI&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-released-early-following-leak-coming-in-2025" rel="nofollow">first unveiled in December 2023</a>, with the game's debut trailer achieving a staggering <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-achieved-crazy-90-million-views-in-24-hours" rel="nofollow">90 million views in just 24 hours</a>. At that point,&nbsp;<em>GTA VI&nbsp;</em>was slated for a fall 2025 release.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/grand-theft-auto-vi-release-date-masks.jpg?itok=SSe1GD3u 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/grand-theft-auto-vi-release-date-masks.jpg?itok=waBZng3p 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Grand Theft Auto VI&nbsp;</em>finally has a release date, but the game has also been delayed out of 2025.</figcaption></figure><p>Since then, Rockstar and Take-Two haven't released much information about&nbsp;<em>GTA VI&nbsp;</em>at all; the game still only has one trailer, and no gameplay footage has been released yet.</p>

<p>Despite that, as late as February this year, Take-Two head Strauss Zelnick was claiming that&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI&nbsp;</em>would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gta-6-still-on-track-for-fall" rel="nofollow">still be releasing in the fall</a>, despite the fact that rumors (which turned out to be correct) were swirling at the time pertaining to the game's delay.</p>

<p>Of course, although this probably isn't the news Take-Two was hoping to deliver, it'll come as a relief to many publishers, who can now presumably breathe sighs of relief and release their games towards the end of 2025 without fear.</p>




<p><em>Grand Theft Auto VI&nbsp;</em>will serve as the sixth numbered installment (although it's far from the sixth game overall) in the&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto&nbsp;</em>series.</p>

<p>We don't know much about the game at the moment; it'll be set in the fictional US state of Leonida, in which can be found the Miami-esque Vice City, and it'll feature the series' first major female protagonist. Other than that, it's all up for grabs.</p>

<p>Rockstar will release&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI&nbsp;</em>on May 26th, 2026 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. Stay tuned for more.</p>
