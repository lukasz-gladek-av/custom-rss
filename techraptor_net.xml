            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/fallout-rpg-starter-set-preview" rel="nofollow"><em>Fallout RPG</em></a> is getting a solo mode. Modiphius Entertainment has announced <em>Fallout RPG: Wasteland Wanderer</em>, a standalone book that lets you chart your own journey through the wasteland without a group or a gamemaster.</p><h2>The <em>Fallout RPG: Wasteland Wanderer</em> Announcement</h2><p>According to an official press release, <em>Fallout RPG: Wasteland Wanderer</em> brings the experience of Modiphius' 2d20 RPG system into solo play. The book's rules and mechanics will procedurally generate a story for the player. It will start with them stumbling out of a Vault-Tec Vault, followed by their immersion in the post-atomic wasteland of the United States.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The play experience is broken up into four stages: Travel, Encounter, Action, and Journaling. The player rolls d20s on random tables to generate where they go, what happens there, and what they do. If you own a copy of the Fallout RPG Core Rulebook, the rules, encounters, and monsters found there are compatible with this book.</p><p><em>Fallout RPG: Wasteland Wanderer</em> is a 256-page full-color, royal-sized hardcover book. That book contains the following:</p><ul><li data-list-item-id="e51f2a593f8f18e724e16bee83e6da4bb">Rules for creating an original Vault Dweller and an original Vault for them to occupy</li><li data-list-item-id="e2cc61890f5b01a545a049d2b2721991a">Charts for randomly generating a wasteland and recording your story as you travel</li><li data-list-item-id="e1951fb4d932b631dbd62cd1132c43b03">Learn about the <em>Fallout</em> setting and its various factions from coast to coast</li><li data-list-item-id="e5dc26fe40f8d91525852b999299c31ea">Several oracle tables to generate quests, scenarios, and obstacles, making each game unique</li></ul><p><em>Fallout RPG: Wasteland Wanderer</em> is the latest licensed TTRPG to release a solo mode. In addition, it is the second RPG in Modiphius' catalog to do so, alongside <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/star-trek-captains-log-solo-roleplaying-game-charts-new-course" rel="nofollow"><em>Star Trek Captain's Log</em></a>. From a certain perspective, it is entertaining that a solo mode has been added to an RPG based on a videogame series, known for being a single-player experience. Aside from <em>Fallout 76</em>, of course.</p><p>The book is available for pre-order now on Modiphius' webstore at an MSRP of $56.27. The book is expected to ship in April, 2026.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
