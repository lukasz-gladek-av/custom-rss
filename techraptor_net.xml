            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-sales-1m-48-hours<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA and Hazelight Studios' new co-op action-adventure platformer&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>has reached a major sales milestone, the two studios have announced, and it only took the game a measly two days to get there.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hazelightgames.bsky.social/post/3ljztto3sws2v" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Hazelight's Bluesky page,&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>managed to sell a million copies within its first 48 hours, which is a pretty impressive milestone. Hazelight says it's "beyond happy" with the result and that it "can't stop enjoying [fans'] amazing reactions".</p>

<p><em>Split Fiction</em>'s strong performance probably shouldn't come as a surprise given that it was EA's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-ea-second-most-played-game-steam" rel="nofollow">second most-played game of all time on Steam</a> just a day or so after its release, losing out only to battle royale shooter&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends&nbsp;</em>(and I can't exactly blame it on that score).</p>

That game would go on to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hazelight-josef-fares-new-ip-it-takes-two-sales" rel="nofollow">sell more than 20 million copies</a> at last count, so it's entirely possible that&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>will do even better for itself.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>, it's the latest game from&nbsp;<em>A Way Out&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two&nbsp;</em>developer Hazelight Studios.</p>

<p>Like the studio's previous games (with the exception of&nbsp;<em>Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons</em>),&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>can only be played as a co-op game; there's no single-player mode here, since the story and gameplay both revolve heavily around two individuals.</p>

<p>However, if you do happen to want to try out the game, the Friend's Pass <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-friends-pass-crossplay" rel="nofollow">means you can play it with anyone on any platform</a>, whether they own the game or not (as long as you do, of course).</p>
