            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/exoborne-playtest-february<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Sharkmob has announced an&nbsp;<em>Exoborne&nbsp;</em>playtest for February, so if you were looking for yet another extraction shooter to add to your list for some reason, then you're in luck.</p>

<p>The playtest will take place between February 12th and 17th, and unlike the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/second-monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta" rel="nofollow">upcoming&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>open beta</a> (and, indeed, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta" rel="nofollow">one prior to that</a>), you'll have to request access in order to be approved for the test.</p>

<p>Sharkmob doesn't specifically say which aspects of the game you'll be granted access to if you manage to get approved for the beta, so it sounds like you'll be able to test a slice of the game, which is exciting if you're an extraction shooter fan, I suppose.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/exoborne-playtest-february-storm.jpg?itok=OPeg2gwx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/exoborne-playtest-february-storm.jpg?itok=0wPd3OKI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>An&nbsp;<em>Exoborne&nbsp;</em>playtest is coming in February.</figcaption></figure><p>Playing the&nbsp;<em>Exoborne&nbsp;</em>playtest for 60 minutes will earn you two extra keys, allowing you to recruit a couple of friends and "complete your squad", as Sharkmob says.</p>

<p>As for what the game actually is, Sharkmob describes&nbsp;<em>Exoborne&nbsp;</em>as an "open-world tactical extraction shooter set in a world torn apart by extreme forces of nature". An apocalyptic cataclysm (is there any other kind?) has ravaged the world, making resources scarce and hostile humans numerous.</p>

<p>You'll be let loose in the "vast open land" of Colton County, and it'll be up to you to scavenge for loot, deal with warring factions and enemy players, and try to survive when nature's fury comes a-calling once more.</p>

<p>If you want to know what&nbsp;<em>Exoborne&nbsp;</em>looks like on a moment-to-moment level, you can check out the playtest announcement trailer right here.</p>




<p>Between this, shooters like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/escape-from-tarkov-patch-0-16-0-0" rel="nofollow">Escape from Tarkov</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gray-zone-warfare-tarkov-players" rel="nofollow"><em>Gray Zone Warfare</em></a>, and experiments in other genres like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dungeonborne-playtest-early-access" rel="nofollow">Dungeonborne</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wolcen-devs-project-pantheon-live-service" rel="nofollow"><em>Project Pantheon</em></a>, the extraction genre sure is gaining popularity.</p>

<p>Whether&nbsp;<em>Exoborne&nbsp;</em>can stand out in a landscape like that remains to be seen, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2705130/Exoborne/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wishlist it on Steam</a> if you want to find out. That's also where you can request access to February's playtest.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Marvelous has announced the release date for upcoming farming RPG adventure&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em>, which will allow you to explore a "Japanese-inspired" land filled with unique twists on classic&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory&nbsp;</em>gameplay.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma&nbsp;</em>will launch on PC and Nintendo Switch on May 30th. There's no word on whether it'll also be released for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">newly-announced Switch 2</a>, but since that console is backwards compatible, I suppose the answer is technically "yes".</p>

<p>As the name suggests,&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma&nbsp;</em>will take place in the land of Azuma, which are "a shadow of their prosperous past" following the events of a mysterious calamity known as the Celestial Collapse.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-release-date-farming.jpg?itok=BEGzDpb- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-release-date-farming.jpg?itok=bYhHC9rC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma&nbsp;</em>brings more cozy RPG farming goodness in May.</figcaption></figure><p>The gods of nature have abandoned the land, but one hero makes a pact with a dragon in order to use its power to save the world from its encroaching blight. That, in case you hadn't twigged, is you.</p>

<p>You'll be able to choose from one of two protagonists, whose destinies are "closely tied together", according to Marvelous.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Guardians of Azuma&nbsp;</em>will also offer "reimagined and expanded&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory&nbsp;</em>gameplay", meaning you'll be able not only to farm, but also to fight using new weapons like bows and talismans, as well as befriending local villagers and exploring the land of Azuma to your heart's content.</p>

<p>You can check out the latest trailer for&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em>, which shows the kind of direction the game is going in, right here.</p>




<p>You won't just be farming in&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em>, either; you'll be rebuilding entire villages, constructing and placing buildings as you see fit. It's a wonder you can find the time for romance in between being an adventurer and a city planner.</p>

<p><em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2864560/Rune_Factory_Guardians_of_Azuma/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and Nintendo Switch on May 30th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-fantasy-roleplay-starter-set-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warhammer-fantasy-roleplay-starter-set-review.1084095/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-fantasy-roleplay-starter-set-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>The fortress town of Ubersreik, the center of mercantile trade for Reikland and a standing monument to what can be achieved with the combined work of dwarves and humans, but a riot soon turns sour there, and a band of adventures find themselves quickly on both sides of the law.</em></p>

<p>We've been fans of Cubicle 7's <em>Warhammer</em> roleplaying games for a while, and you can read our preview of the full <em>Soulbound</em> rulebook <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-soulbound-preview" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and our review of the <em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplaying Game</em> core rulebook <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-fantasy-roleplay-4th-edition-review" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-fantasy-roleplay-starter-set-1.jpg?itok=8iJ-FJl0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-fantasy-roleplay-starter-set-1.jpg?itok=gbnjrgGP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay</em> Starter Set comes with a load of content for the GM to create adventures beyond the introductory adenture.</figcaption></figure><h2>High Fantasy This Is Not</h2>

<p>Before we get into <em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay</em>, it's worth noting the difference between <em>Age of Sigmar (AoS),</em>&nbsp;and <em>Warhammer</em> (now known as <em>Warhammer the Old World</em> in Games Workshop's latest tabletop iteration). The original <em>Warhammer</em> was Games Workshop's fantasy wargaming system. In 2015 (a decade this year and we're still having this conversation) Games Workshop had a narrative event called the End Times, which ended the Old World and started the new <em>Age of Sigmar</em> system, along with moving the narrative completely away and into a new fantasy setting (with many of the same elements, but also a lot of changes). Games Workshop has also since re-released (in January 2024) the <em>Warhammer Fantasy</em> game, which you can read our review of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-old-world-review-hit-refresh" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>I mention the above because Cubicle 7 publishes 2 <em>Warhammer</em> roleplaying systems. <em>Age of Sigmar Soubound</em>, for which we reviewed the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/age-of-sigmar-soulbound-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Soulbound Starter Set here</em></a>, is set in Games Workshop's premier fantasy setting, and&nbsp;<em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay (WFRP),</em> which we are reviewing in this article, is set in Games Workshop's original fantasy system. <em>WFRP</em> also persevered throughout the removal of <em>Warhammer Fantasy</em> from Games Workshop's wargaming range throughout the 2015-2024 gap.</p>

<p>We'll go into details of both settings in our coverage of the systems, but a quick summary is that <em>Warhammer Fantasy</em> is set in a more traditional fantasy setting, with the races of humans, elves, dwarves, orcs, and Skaven (ratmen) all battling over the map of the Old World, and&nbsp;<em>Age of Sigmar</em> sees the different races fighting across 8 different Mortal Realms, 8 unique planes of existence, connected through realm gates. A lot of the classic races are included, but they have a unique Games Workshop twist in <em>AoS</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-fantasy-roleplay-starter-set-2.jpg?itok=cZ2-Vr3C 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-fantasy-roleplay-starter-set-2.jpg?itok=9ZBh7fBV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The players get quick reference cards for the rules they need, along with maps of the city and area, and handouts while they go through the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay</em> Starter Set adventure.</figcaption></figure><h2>True Dwarven Craftsmanship</h2>

<p>Most roleplaying products start with a single book, either a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/arkham-horror-roleplaying-game-core-rulebook-review-this-is-halloween" rel="nofollow">Core Rulebook</a>, which contains everything players and Games Masters (GM) need to run the games,&nbsp;or a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-player-handbook-review-mixed-messaging-around-strong" rel="nofollow">Players Handbook</a>, which focuses on the core mechanics and player options, expanding into other books for the Games Master&nbsp;(which we see historically in <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em> by Wizards of the Coast). <i>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay&nbsp;</i>has a Core Rulebook available, but also to make it even easier, the <em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay</em> Starter Set has everything 6 players, plus a GM need to play their first few games in one easy package, with no printing or other products required.</p>

<p>The <em>WFRP</em> starter set box includes a whole raft of contents, including 6 pre-generated fold-out character sheets, handouts, rules references for the players, and 2 10-sided dice. The <em>WFRP</em> system uses a percentile system, for which players roll both dice, one for the tens and one for the units, to get a roll between 01 and 100.</p>

<p>For the GM, the <em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay</em> Starter Set begins with the Adventure Book, and the adventure Making the Rounds, which leads both the players and the GM through their first game. Making the Rounds can be spread across several gaming sessions if the GM wishes. Alongside the core story, the Adventure Book also includes 10 additional scenarios that can be used throughout the adventure, or as separate tie-in adventures later on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The GM will need to read through the entire Adventure Book, in order to understand the rules and the adventure's story to best guide the players through, but this is usually the case for Games Masters, who do all the preparation in advance of gaming sessions. The starter set adventure book guides you through the system, giving you tips on how to GM, and acts as a tutorial for the rules as the players progress.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-fantasy-roleplay-starter-set-3_0.jpg?itok=b3fEBocp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-fantasy-roleplay-starter-set-3_0.jpg?itok=1zfaMyKX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay</em> Starter Set comes with 6 pre-generated characters, and their fold-out sheets comes with a load of background detail to help players get into them.</figcaption></figure><h2>Less Heroic Fantasy, More Gutter Survival</h2>

<p>The first edition of <em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay</em> had players' initial characters at an extremely low level. They were capable humans, but not the heroic heroes that we find in A<em>ge of Sigmar. </em>In contrast, the 6 pre-generated characters in the <em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay</em> starter set feel more heroic than first edition WFRP characters did, but not as heroic as Soulbound characters (especially not the immortal Stormcast Eternal who are reforged and reborn when they die).</p>

<p>The starter set characters give a fantastic view of those available in WFRP, whilst still being accessible to those not familiar with the setting. There's a noble soldier, a dwarf slayer (think shirtless barbarian berzerker), a halfling thief, a scythe-wielding wizard, an elf merchant (an incredible addition as a less combat-focused character,&nbsp; but still an elf, so still capable), and the classic WFRP Witch Hunter.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-fantasy-roleplay-starter-set-4.jpg?itok=JAuv5voQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-fantasy-roleplay-starter-set-4.jpg?itok=XsI8NRl9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>WFRP</em> uses a percentile dice system, 2D10 to get a number between 1 and 100, and the <em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay</em> Starter Set comes with a custom set.</figcaption></figure><h2>What Are The Chances!</h2>

<p><em>WRFP</em> uses a percentile system, the same as the original <em>WFRP</em> system, which gives it a more classical feel that suits the setting. This system requires players to roll 2D10, to get a number between 1 and 100, needing to score under their skill to succeed. The GM can add or subtract to the character's skill, depending on how hard to test is. There's also the option to have a dramatic test, where the amount under the tens number demonstrates how successful the test is (a roll of 10 against a test of 70 would be 6 dramatic successes for example).</p>

<p>The Starter Set keeps the level of detail light and accessible, with wounds and critical wounds, but leaves out the full level of detail on&nbsp;injuries, disease, corruption, and psychology that the full rulebook has. This is probably a good choice for keeping the rules straightforward, the product is aimed at new roleplayers and GMs, but it does leave out one of <em>WFRP</em>'s most interesting elements in the realism that it has over more heroic systems.</p>

<p>That doesn't take away from how good the starter set is, as a product, the adventure, and how well it introduces players to the gloriously dark <em>Warhammer Fantasy</em> setting.</p>

<h2>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay Starter Set Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>The <em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay Starter Set </em>is a fantastic product. The components are thematic, immersive, and high-quality. The adventure it contains introduces players well to the setting and the system and can be expanded into several full sessions with the hooks in the adventure book, and the detail included in the Ubersreik Guide. Brand new GMs will have to do some work preparing for the adventure, but the adventure book does give you a lot of tips for running the game. But most importantly, everyone will have a blast playing through the adventure, which is full of character.</p>

<p>You can expect an update that's roughly on a similar scale to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-update-010e" rel="nofollow">December's Update 0.1.0e</a>; while there's no single massive feature that will completely overhaul&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2</em>'s gameplay, there are tons of smaller changes that should result in a smoother experience.</p>

<p>Four new endgame tower map areas have been introduced in the form of Alpine Ridge, Bluff, Mesa, and Sinking Spire, and the Lost Towers map has been revamped in order to make it a little more interesting to explore.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/path-of-exile-2-update-0.1.1-tower.jpg?itok=tnyqoAUN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/path-of-exile-2-update-0.1.1-tower.jpg?itok=EVJA7PK0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>Update 0.1.1 brings changes to the endgame, plus lots more.</figcaption></figure><p>The Arbiter of Ash boss fight has also been redesigned so that you'll have more attempts; rather than only getting to try this boss once, you can now tackle it up to six times, with higher difficulties lowering the number of respawns you get.</p>

<p>Other changes have also been made to this boss fight; the falling flame seed skill can't be interrupted anymore, and the boss is now invulnerable for a longer duration after emerging.</p>

<p>As you might expect, the new&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>update has an absolute ton of changes besides the ones I've listed here, so if you want to see the full changelog, you can check out the <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3695606" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">patch notes via the game's official forum</a>.</p>




<p><em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>is, believe it or not, the sequel to the original&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile</em>. Like its predecessor, the game is an action RPG, but unlike its predecessor, it's not free-to-play;&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>started out as a massive update for the original game before its devs realized it was big enough to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-will-be-standalone-game-closed-beta-date-gameplay-revealed" rel="nofollow">spin off into a separate title</a>.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2694490/Path_of_Exile_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/path-of-exile-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/path-of-exile-2-game-preview/9ND8N4RW5GHX" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and Update 0.1.1 lands tomorrow.
