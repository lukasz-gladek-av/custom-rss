            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-vegas-mod-fallout-nuevo-mexico-canceled<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The lead developer on ambitious-looking <i>Fallout: New Vegas&nbsp;</i>mod<i>&nbsp;</i><em>Fallout: Nuevo Mexico&nbsp;</em>has canceled the project in order to prioritize his "mental health" and to "face reality".</p>

<p>In a message shared on the mod's Discord server (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/fallout-nuevo-mexico-mod-cancelled-prioritize-mental-health/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">TheGamer</a>), developer Zapshock says that while&nbsp;<em>Nuevo Mexico&nbsp;</em>has been his "passion" and "obsession" for years, the project's workload and costs are "too great".</p>

<p>As such, continuing with&nbsp;<em>Nuevo Mexico</em>'s development "simply isn't sustainable for [Zapshock] and everyone involved, including voice actors", and so the decision was made to cancel the project. Zapshock says the decision was "painful", but "necessary".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fallout-nuevo-mexico-mod-canceled-guns.jpg?itok=1SqRHiLS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fallout-nuevo-mexico-mod-canceled-guns.jpg?itok=EcpTjdIf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The ambitious&nbsp;<em>New Vegas&nbsp;</em>mod&nbsp;<em>Fallout: Nuevo Mexico&nbsp;</em>has sadly been canceled.</figcaption></figure><p>Before its cancellation,&nbsp;<em>Nuevo Mexico&nbsp;</em>was set to be a mod roughly the size of one of the&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>series' DLC packs, and it would have taken you to the US state of New Mexico, as the name suggests.</p>

<p>The mod was to be set five years after the events of the original&nbsp;<em>Fallout</em>, putting it several decades before the events of&nbsp;<em>Fallout 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>New Vegas</em>, both of which take place as humanity is beginning to rebuild something resembling a coherent society.</p>

<p>Per a Game Rant <a href="https://gamerant.com/fallout-new-vegas-mods-good-nuevo-mexico-scripting/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">interview</a> from February last year, the modders were planning to include&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age</em>-style origins for characters in&nbsp;<em>Nuevo Mexico</em>, including one for a ghoul character, which would have fundamentally changed the mod's gameplay experience.</p>

<p>Honestly, it sounds to me like it's no wonder the mod was canceled; Zapshock and his team clearly had an insane level of ambition for&nbsp;<em>Nuevo Mexico</em>, and with just four people working on the project, they were bound to burn out sooner or later.</p>




<p><em>Nuevo Mexico&nbsp;</em>isn't the only&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>mod to have been canceled in recent months; back in October, the developers of&nbsp;<em>Fallout: Vault 13</em>, a mod that attempted to remake the entirety of the original&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>in the fourth game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-vault-13-mod-development-suspended" rel="nofollow">shut down their mod</a> due to "a combination of factors".</p>

<p>If you are looking for a DLC-sized&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>mod experience, however, all is not lost. There's still&nbsp;<em>Fallout: London</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-london-out-now" rel="nofollow">launched in July last year</a>&nbsp;and which had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-london-mod-million-downloads" rel="nofollow">attracted a million downloads</a> by October. It's a&nbsp;<em>Fallout 4&nbsp;</em>mod, though, so you'll need the base game to play.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/division-2-story-dlc-delayed-again</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-division-2-story-dlc-delayed-again-no-new-release-date-announced.1093788/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/division-2-story-dlc-delayed-again<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has delayed the upcoming&nbsp;<em>The Division 2&nbsp;</em>story DLC out of the game's sixth year, but it looks like the third season will remain on the cards for February.</p>

<p>In an X <a href="https://x.com/TheDivisionGame/status/1884255116636705006" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, Ubisoft says that it wants to "deliver the best possible experience" for&nbsp;<em>The Division 2</em>'s story DLC, and so it "will not ship during Year 6". That likely means it won't be released until at least summer this year, although it could be even longer.</p>

<p>The DLC was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/division-heartland-division-2-resurgence-news" rel="nofollow">announced back in 2023</a>&nbsp;and was initially intended to be part of the game's fifth year of content, adding new zones, main missions, and "a whole new endgame structure" towards the end of 2024.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-division-2-story-dlc-delayed-beyond-2025-map.jpg?itok=UDvPwOZ5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-division-2-story-dlc-delayed-beyond-2025-map.jpg?itok=TnDQ-HoP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Division 2</em>'s story DLC has been delayed again.</figcaption></figure><p>However, in December 2023, the game's story DLC <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/division-2-story-dlc-delayed-to-2025-as-ubisoft-launches-project-resolve-to-improve" rel="nofollow">was delayed</a>&nbsp;beyond 2024, making this the second time the DLC has been pushed back. Perhaps appropriately, that first delay was revealed alongside "Project Resolve", an initiative that aimed to improve&nbsp;<em>The Division 2&nbsp;</em>across the board.</p>

<p>Ubisoft hasn't revealed a new release date for&nbsp;<em>The Division 2</em>'s story DLC. Honestly, at this stage, I don't think I'd be surprised if the expansion was canned altogether, although perhaps the game still enjoys a sizable enough player base for these delays not to spell the end.</p>

<p>The pushback of this DLC comes after what has been a pretty horrendous year for Ubisoft. The studio has endured multiple <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-h1-2024-25-fiscal-results" rel="nofollow">high-profile failures</a>, including&nbsp;pirate game&nbsp;<em>Skull and Bones</em>, open-world adventure&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, and first-person shooter&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing" rel="nofollow"><em>XDefiant</em></a>.</p>

<p>Not only that, but Ubisoft has&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-february" rel="nofollow">delayed</a> its upcoming flagship RPG&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-march" rel="nofollow">twice</a>, faced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-strike-investor-letter" rel="nofollow">investor unrest</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-lawsuit-data-policy" rel="nofollow">legal action</a>, and closed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-layoffs-leamington-closure" rel="nofollow">three of its studios</a>, with several more undergoing downsizing.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ubisoft-star-wars-outlaws.jpg?itok=CanXzuiy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ubisoft-star-wars-outlaws.jpg?itok=xuTsrXLK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It hasn't exactly been a great year for Ubisoft.</figcaption></figure><p><em>The Division 2</em>'s story DLC&nbsp;may not exactly be the flagship release Ubisoft has been banking on to turn its fortunes around, but this delay won't exactly come as a balm to shareholders who are already concerned the company has no clue what it's doing.</p>

<p>At any rate, if you'd like to catch up on&nbsp;<em>The Division 2&nbsp;</em>before the DLC launches (a pursuit for which it seems you'll have plenty of time), you can grab it right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2221490/Tom_Clancys_The_Division_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/tom-clancys-the-division-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 4</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/tom-clancys-the-division-2/9nc944t50735" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox One</a>, as well as on current-gen consoles through backwards compatibility.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-johan-pilestedt-sabbatical<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Arrowhead Game Studios' chief creative officer Johan Pilestedt is to take an extended "sabbatical" from work, and when he returns, he'll be working on a new Arrowhead game.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1884015181895983223" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Pilestedt says that while fans have been enjoying&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>for almost a year, he's been "living it since early 2016", and if the first <i>Helldivers&nbsp;</i>is included, "since 2013".</p>

<p>He says that eleven years of working on the&nbsp;<em>Helldivers&nbsp;</em>games have caused him to neglect his family, his friends, his wife, and himself, and so he wants to take some time to "redeem what was lost from all of those that supported [him] for over a decade".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-johan-pilestedt-sabbatical-omens-of-tyranny.jpg?itok=d_Ad7Gc7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-johan-pilestedt-sabbatical-omens-of-tyranny.jpg?itok=IjcaBny3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Helldivers 2</em>'s creative lead Johan Pilestedt is taking some time out from work.</figcaption></figure><p>Expressing faith in his Arrowhead colleagues to continue doing "their utmost" to deliver "amazing stuff" for&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>while he's off, Pilestedt says that on his return, he will "start working on the next Arrowhead game".</p>

<p>Whether that means he won't be involved in&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>anymore going forward isn't clear, but at the very least, it seems his focus will be elsewhere for a while, so major showstopping creative updates for&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>may be few and far between in future.</p>

<p>Well-wishers flocked to X to express their hope that Pilestedt enjoyed his break, with the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shuhei-yoshida-leaving-playstation" rel="nofollow">recent PlayStation leaver</a> Shuhei Yoshida and Kinda Funny's Greg Miller sending their best wishes to Pilestedt.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with Pilestedt, he served as the CEO and chief creative officer of Arrowhead Game Studios between 2009 and last year before <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-arrowhead-new-ceo" rel="nofollow">stepping down and appointing a new CEO</a> in order to focus on his creative work.</p>

<p><em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/helldivers-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>.

What's more, developer Keen Games has revealed a tentative release window for the game's 1.0 release.</p>

<p>It's been a year since&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/enshrouded-early-access-release-date" rel="nofollow">released into Early Access</a>, and to celebrate, Keen Games has released the game's fifth major update, which has tons of improvements and updates to various game systems.</p>

<p>Among the highlights for the update are the introduction of text chat to make communication easier, as well as a new emote wheel for extra social animations, a new first-person building camera, and more than 70 "new or previously unavailable props" for base crafting.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/enshrouded-pact-of-the-flame-update-battle.jpg?itok=F1LuA4XR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/enshrouded-pact-of-the-flame-update-battle.jpg?itok=z0C9RNin 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Enshrouded</em>'s Pact of the Flame update is out now, and it's a big one.</figcaption></figure><p>You can also look forward to individually resettable skills in the skill tree, new visual parry indicators for certain enemies, and several settlements and points of interest being "reworked and expanded significantly".</p>

It's a pretty extensive list, so don't be afraid to skim it if you don't want a deep dive into everything that's changed.</p>

<p>As well as releasing the new patch, Keen Games has also revealed when we can expect&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded</em>'s full release: it'll happen sometime in 2026, bringing the game to consoles as well as launching it out of Early Access.</p>

<p>Also, as if all of this wasn't enough, the&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded&nbsp;</em>roadmap for 2025 has been revealed, and it includes tons of new features like new weather events, new customization options, and voice chat, plus more. You can see it here in all its glory.</p>
