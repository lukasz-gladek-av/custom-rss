            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/discussing-magic-gathering-x-final-fantasy-with-daniel-holt-game-design-lead-for<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The <em>Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy</em> set is now available in pre-release with the full release only days away. As someone hooked into both the <em>MTG</em> and <em>FF</em> spaces, it's been incredible seeing the reaction, on par with the release of a <em>Final Fantasy</em> game. At Summer Game Fest, I got to sit down with Daniel Holt, Senior Game Designer for <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> and the lead designer behind the pre-con Commander decks featuring Terra, Cloud, Tidus, and Y'shtola.</p>

<h2>But First, A Duel</h2>

<p>Prior to sitting down to discuss the collaboration, Holt and I engaged in a quick game of <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> using the Cloud and Sephiroth decks that come in the starter set. Cloud's deck features equipment cards lending to the JRPG root,s while Sephiroth's deck is built around tokens and powering up Sephiroth, Planet's Heir.</p>

<p>Being my first time really getting hands-on with these cards, I was continuously distracted while playing, spotting favorite characters, locations, and events from the history of <em>FF</em>. I couldn't help but comment in excitement seeing the Sunstones of the Giza Plains from <em>Final Fantasy XII</em> glowing on the Plains card.</p>

<h2>Picking And Choosing Moments</h2>

<p>Knowing how much history there was to <em>Final Fantasy</em>, I first wanted to understand how, even in a large set such as this, they were able to pick and choose the different characters and moments to highlight.</p>

<p>Holt told me that Gavin Berry, who led the main set, developed a tiered system. "Tier One was made up of the character and story moments that every character knows; Sephiroth and Cloud, etc. Tier Two is like, if you played the game, you'd probably know. Tier Three is those deeper facts, like this is probably your favorite game."</p>

<p>On the topic of favorite games, Holt revealed that his favorite numbered <em>Final Fantasy</em> title was <em>Final Fantasy X</em>, which is why he was even more excited that he got to create a Tidus and <em>Final Fantasy X</em> themed pre-con.</p>

<p>I quickly paused to ask him whether he pronounces it Tidus (Tee-dus) or Tidus (Tie-dus), and he very quickly and confidently said the correct answer, Tidus (Tee-dus).</p>

<p>At the interview space, Holt directed me to editions of each of the Commander Pre-Con decks, explaining that each of these Pre-Con decks doesn't just feature a hero, but is completely themed after the game that they're from.</p>

<p>"When you buy the <em>Final Fantasy X</em> deck, every card in here is <em>Final Fantasy X</em>, except the lands. So we had 63-ish cards to all be from <em>Final Fantasy X</em>. So we got to go in those deep moments."</p>

<p>"One of my favorites from this one is the reprint Endless Detour. We've got to show Riku where she's scared of lightning. She's with the whole party inside the hotel, and she doesn't want to go back out."</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-x-final-fantasy-lands.jpg?itok=KryxqtLN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-x-final-fantasy-lands.jpg?itok=Nar_65jr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Creating The Plan For A Pre-Con Commander Deck</h2>

<p>I asked if there were any moments that a fan of <em>FFX</em> like himself put his foot down to say they needed to be included, and Holt revealed a bit of the behind-the-scenes for Commander deck creation. "The way we approached all these decks is that I had an Excel sheet where I looked at the reprint I'm considering, and a possible story moment."</p>

<p>He talked about the discussion he had with Dylan Davini, the head of creative for the set, "I'll ping him and ask 'hey, can we do this?' and [Davini] will say 'yeah, that's fine' and for every card we have one sentence what it could be. I had this sheet already filled out for <em>Final Fantasy X</em> before coming to Davini. He looked at it and said 'This pretty much works' and we were already kind of done."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Every character is somebody's favorite Character"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While <em>Final Fantasy X</em> had a lot of easy moments to pull from the Commander deck, <em>Final Fantasy VI</em> was more difficult. "VI was the last of the pixel games, so some of our references weren't great for capturing the game. Some of the items in the game are just a sphere, it's not enough for a reference."</p>

<p>Holt talked about having to drop certain ideas when there just wasn't any possible option, and seek out a different reference for those cards.</p>

<p>Holt did speak very highly of the team at Square Enix that they worked with while putting this set together. He talked of the benefit of so many on the <em>MTG </em>team being fans of Square Enix and <em>Final Fantasy</em>, and likewise, a lot of those at Square Enix were fans of <em>MTG</em>.</p>

<p>If they reached out to Square Enix and there wasn't a great reference to be use,d the team would be very helpful and provide alternate references.</p>

On top of that, Sagas have been altered to provide a basis for Summons. Powerful while on the field, but only temporary.</p>

<h2>Turning Gameplay Mechanics Into Card Mechanics</h2>

<p>Explaining more about how they adapted game systems to <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Holt again referenced the <em>Final Fantasy X</em> deck. "Tidus has a Cheer ability and he moves counters around. Just like you are on the sphere grid."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"We've got some fan favorite moments like the Cloud in a dress scene, the train suplex, and the laughing scene from <em>Final Fantasy X</em>"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Knowing that there's so much excitement around the <em>Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy</em> Cards I wondered how he and the team were reacting to it.</p>

<p>"It's still amazing. Even now that it's out like, I hear somebody say Sephiroth over in the corner and I'm like 'do people know about Sephiroth already?' because we've been working on this for four to five years. [...] Everyone on the team understands these games, loves them so it was a true passion project."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/neverwinter-nights-2-enhanced-edition-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Aspyr has revealed&nbsp;<em>Neverwinter Nights 2: Enhanced Edition</em>, a remastered version of the 2006 CRPG classic that comes with all-new enhancements and improvements, as well as all of the game's expansions.</p>

<p>Revealed during yesterday's PC Gaming Show (along with the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paralives-december-early-access-release-date" rel="nofollow"><em>Paralives&nbsp;</em>release date</a> and more),&nbsp;<em>Neverwinter Nights 2: Enhanced Edition&nbsp;</em>promises to do for the nearly twenty-year-old RPG what the enhanced editions of&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate&nbsp;</em>and its sequel did for their respective originals.</p>

<p>According to the game's brand new Steam page, <i>Neverwinter Nights 2</i>'s new enhanced re-release will feature "smoother gameplay", as well as "refined camera controls, polished mechanics, enhanced textures, and full controller support", together with a brand new "controller-specific UI".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/neverwinter-nights-2-enhanced-edition-combat.jpg?itok=n4aHR9dl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/neverwinter-nights-2-enhanced-edition-combat.jpg?itok=1Q2nZbzZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Neverwinter Nights 2&nbsp;</em>is coming back, in enhanced form.</figcaption></figure><p>Despite the fact this is an enhanced re-release of a classic CRPG, usual suspect Beamdog is nowhere to be seen in the credits for the game. The studio was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/beamdog-acquired-by-porting-and-remake-specialists-aspyr" rel="nofollow">acquired by Aspyr back in 2022</a>, but it still remains a distinct entity and hasn't been renamed, so it looks like Aspyr is the one handling this remaster.</p>

<p>Other than the aforementioned improvements, it looks as though&nbsp;<em>Neverwinter Nights 2: Enhanced Edition&nbsp;</em>will largely be the same game you may or may not already be familiar with; there's no mention of restoring cut content.</p>

<p>What that means is the package will contain the base&nbsp;<em>Neverwinter Nights 2&nbsp;</em>game, plus its three major expansions:&nbsp;<em>Mask of the Betrayer</em>,&nbsp;<em>Storm of Zehir</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Mysteries of Westgate</em>.</p>




<p>It's all go in the world of&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;</em>video games right now. As well as this remaster, it was revealed last week that&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Jedi&nbsp;</em>director Stig Asmussen's new studio Giant Skull is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/giant-skull-wizards-of-the-coast-dungeons-and-dragons" rel="nofollow">working on a&nbsp;<em>D&amp;D&nbsp;</em>game</a> alongside Wizards of the Coast.</p>

<p>That's in addition to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-dnd-game-2026" rel="nofollow">live-service multiplayer title</a> currently in development at Starbreeze Studios, about which we admittedly know very little at present. Hopefully, Starbreeze's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-financials-2024-payday-3" rel="nofollow">current difficulties</a> don't impact the development of that project too much.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Neverwinter Nights 2: Enhanced Edition&nbsp;</em>launches across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2738630/Dungeons__Dragons_Neverwinter_Nights_2_Enhanced_Edition/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1032-PPSA20783_00-NWN2ENHANCED0000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/dungeons-dragons-neverwinter-nights-2-enhanced-edition/9NS7KLP387H6" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/dungeons-and-dragons-neverwinter-nights-2-enhanced-edition-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> (and not Switch 2, oddly enough) on July 15th.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/absolum-preview-very-promising-beat-em-up</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/absolum-preview-a-very-promising-beat-em-up.1213227/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/absolum-preview-very-promising-beat-em-up<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Some of my fondest gaming memories involve playing beat 'em ups with my brothers. <i>Castle Crashers&nbsp;</i>comes to mind, in particular, a game I could play over and over again.&nbsp;<em>Absolum&nbsp;</em>feels the same way; it's the type of game that encourages repeat playthroughs with your best buds.</p>

<p>Really,&nbsp;<em>Absolum&nbsp;</em>ticks all the right boxes for me. A compelling fantasy universe with fleshed out lore, weighty beat 'em up gameplay, and a killer soundtrack to boot. My time with&nbsp;<em>Absolum</em>&nbsp;at Summer Game Fest 2025 left me very eager to try more.</p>



<h2>Fantastic(al) Fights Await&nbsp;</h2>

<p>The art style for&nbsp;<em>Absolum</em>&nbsp;really draws you in. It's this comic book-like aesthetic in this whimsical, high fantasy universe. It's a world where mages are feared for their use of magic. Non-magic users are scared of them, and monsters want to kill the wizards too.</p>

<p>Most of the demo comprised gameplay rather than story, but I'm very interested in seeing the narrative unfold. It actually reminds me a bit of&nbsp;<em>Hades</em>, with crucial NPCs in your hub with their own stories and motivations.</p>

<p>But the&nbsp;<em>Hades</em>&nbsp;similarities don't end there. The roguelite elements seem to take inspiration from that title. Gameplay involves progressing to new areas, while collecting boons every few rooms or so.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These boons empower your wizard's attacks. These upgrades are usually elemental in nature, so your special attack might shoot tidal waves when you activate it.</p>

<p>You're able to choose from several characters in&nbsp;<em>Absolum;&nbsp;</em>for example, one is a dwarf, and another an elf, so on and so forth. They're all visually distinct from one another and have different styles of attacking.</p>



<h2>Fighting to the End</h2>

<p>The core of&nbsp;<em>Absolum</em>'s gameplay, outside of its roguelite mechanics, is the beat 'em up combat. These aren't your ordinary wizards. The dwarf mainly uses his magically powered fists. His punches are powerful, and each hit is accompanied by a satisfying sound.</p>

<p><em>Absolum</em>&nbsp;has branching paths for each run, so my partner and I took a northern route along the coast. We're met with dog-like creatures and hermit crabs that hide in their shells. We made short work of them, and went on our way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Eventually we reached a village under attack by goblins. Now, you'd think the villagers would accept our aid, but in fact, they started to attack us! Surrounded on both sides, we fought through goblin and human foes. Just another example of&nbsp;<em>Absolum</em>'s very intriguing narrative.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><i>Absolum&nbsp;</i>Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Eventually we reached a boss at the end of the demo. It's your typical tanky boss that takes a lot of hits, so my partner and I dodged and weaved around him. This boss had a giant shield, so we'd go on either side of him and harass the guy until he lowered his guard.</p>

<p><em>Absolum</em>&nbsp;is genuinely a lot of fun, and words don't do it justice. It oozes quality, from its art design and soundtrack, to its gameplay. The rougelite elements really make me want to try and try again even in the face of failure. Although there's no release date yet, I shall eagerly wait.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/relooted-is-unique-heist-game-for-2d-platforming-speedrun-fans<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's always fun to come across games that are truly unique, and I got to experience one of them at Summer Game Fest this week. <em>Relooted</em>, by Nyamakop, is a unique game where you play as Nomali, a woman dragged into working to reclaim <s>stolen</s> obtained artifacts from collectors or museums across the world.</p>

<p>The premise of the game is that due to the wording of a new law, any ancient artifacts that were on public display at museums would need to be returned to their country of origin. The loophole in this that these locations found though, was that if an item was only shown in private, then the artifacts no longer needed to be returned.</p>

<h2>Accessory To A Heist</h2>

<p>With knowledge of these artifacts, Nomali and her team, consisting of a group of people skilled in acrobatics and hacking, and more as the game progresses. With this team it is your goal to get into these locations, scope out the most ideal way to 'reloot' these items with intent to return them to their homes, and then get out as quickly as possible.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/relooted-on-the-ground.jpg?itok=eGARCR8V 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/relooted-on-the-ground.jpg?itok=50JNoa4w 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The gameplay loop is that you'll start your mission outside, scope out the locations of the different artifacts within the building, and then plan the heist to recover as many items as possible. The game takes place from a sidescrolling view, you'll run left to right through each location but you'll also need to find ways to climb up to higher levels or return to the ground floor to obtain all of your items.</p>

<p>In the first level that I got to play, a private collector had two primary artifacts to collect, and a further two (one of which I missed, hidden in a safe). Reviewing the world was like looking at an equation where you have all of the pieces and you needed to get as close to the final answer as possible in order to succeed.</p>

<p>You could pre-emptively place your hackers by door, move desks into security doorways to keep them open, and have your acrobat in strategic places to get you to upper floors with ease. Once everything is in place itâ€™s time to snag the first artifact, that kicks off the alarm, and starts the timer for you to get everything and get out.</p>

<p>From there the game is a mix of platforming and speedrunning and you maintain your line, pick up all of the artifacts and getting out. As you begin to get low on your escape timer a drone enemy will appear, with nothing to do to defend yourself youâ€™ll have to just keep heading towards the exit.</p>

<p>Speaking with Ben Myres, CEO at Nyamakop and Creative Director for <em>Relooted </em>he told me that the inspiration behind the game came from a trip that he took to London with his family. While he spent time meeting people in gamedev, his parents went to the British Museum. Once the family got back together he learned of how enraged his family had been about the entire front of a building that had been taken from somewhere in the world and placed in the museum.</p>

<p>From there it was suggested to make a game about returning these items that have been taken or â€˜lootedâ€™ and while you canâ€™t get away from a museum with a whole wall research was done into different artifacts that could be reclaimed.</p>

<p>Myres told me another story of the Ngadji Drum, important to the Pokomo people in Kenya. This sacred relic was thought to have been destroyed over 100 years ago turned up in the storage of the British Museum too.</p>

<p>Stepping away from the gam,e I was excited to have gotten my hands on such a unique game that consists of puzzle solving and speedrunning-like gameplay with such a unique story to tell.</p>

In our&nbsp;<em>Atomfall Wicked Isle</em>&nbsp;review, we'll break down what's good about this new story DLC â€” and what isn't.</p>

<p>Previously,&nbsp;<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e4b71db8-6fe2-4eba-a250-84f5aee68760" href="https://techraptor.net/games/atomfall" rel="nofollow"><em>Atomfall</em></a>&nbsp;confined you to a walled-off "Quarantine Zone" with four distinct regions and a bunker called "The Interchange" that allowed you to travel between them fairly easily. This DLC introduces Midsummer Isle, a small island that is packed with a lot of history, some new sights to see, and a few too many familiar enemies.</p>

<p>Players can make their way to Midsummer Isle by way of Bill Anderson, a boat captain hanging out on the docks of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="31cd99b9-3546-4649-9d23-bc8c26a689f1" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/atomfall-wyndham-village-map-and-locations" rel="nofollow">Wyndham Village</a>. Bill wants your help in retrieving something important, and it's later revealed to be a special kind of mead only made on the island. What starts out as the world's strangest beer run soon evolves into a compelling story.</p>

<p>Midsummer Isle is roughly the size of the other zones in&nbsp;<em>Atomfall</em>, and it's about as dense as you'd expect it to be. There are a few points of interest to see on <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="316a5a7c-d4dd-4be9-9961-4a2a7cd46e7c" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/atomfall-midsummer-isle-map-and-locations-guide" rel="nofollow">the map</a>, a couple of merchants, and an abandoned B.A.R.D. bunker for you to explore. There's even a new set of garden gnomes for you to smash for an achievement!</p>

<p>There are plenty of interesting overworld locations to visit and several indoor locations with a lot to explore, two of which â€” the Chemical Testing Bunker and the Abbey Crypt â€” have mildly interesting puzzles for you to work out.</p>

<p>While there is some novelty to be had in these new places, there's nothing particularly exciting about them. I kept waiting for the&nbsp;<em>Wicked Isle</em>&nbsp;DLC to surprise me with some new mechanic or an interesting story twist and it never quite delivered.</p>

<p>I was fortunate enough to be able to jump right into the&nbsp;<em>Atomfall Wicked Isle</em>&nbsp;DLC via one of my old saves, so I had the advantage of having a healthy supply of ammo and all of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="31c385f2-951f-4d8a-b398-b10ec49aaf22" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/atomfall-weapons-guide-how-to-upgrade-guns" rel="nofollow">the best guns</a> that could be found in the base game. Unfortunately, some of the same problems I dealt with in the main game continued to rear their ugly heads in this DLC.</p>

<p>The storage space in the Pneumatic Tube remains at a paltry 100 items which was a disappointment, to say the least â€” especially since the&nbsp;<em>Wicked Isle</em>&nbsp;DLC introduces a bunch of new items you might want to hold onto just in case. I would have liked to see at least a small expansion in storage capacity for the hoarder types like myself out there.</p>

<p>It's all too easy to burn through most of your bullets exploring one of the tougher locations on the map.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A relatively low amount of storage space is really a symptom of another problem: the merchants rarely carry enough of the items you might need. If you want to stock up on any one particular item, you'll have to spend an hour or more running around the various regions of the map, hoping against hope that you can find everything you need.</p>

<p>Sadly, the new merchants also fail to carry much in the way of ammunition. It's all too easy to burn through most of your bullets exploring one of the tougher locations on the map, like the Harvesting Caves or the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="695edafc-20b3-44a7-a100-e925fc5cda71" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/atomfall-chemical-testing-bunker-solution-open-vault" rel="nofollow">Chemical Testing Bunker</a>, and then you'll have to spend another hour running all over the map to buy more for your next serious fight.</p>

<p>Story DLCs will often introduce something new, and the&nbsp;<em>Wicked Isle</em>&nbsp;DLC delivers just that with a few new crafting items, a handful of new consumables, and half a dozen new weapons for you to get your hands on. Unfortunately, all of this new stuff boils down to being more of the same kind of content you'd experience in the main game.</p>

<p>Let's start with the enemies. There are three basic types of foes to fight: Abbey Druids, Lake Bandits, and Aquatic Ferals. These enemies are all essentially palette swaps of the standard enemy archetypes you'll encounter in the base game, sans the Protocol soldiers. There are no new mechanics or tactics used by the bad guys.</p>

<p>The fight against the Beekeeper miniboss was truly a new experience that required a different kind of strategy to win.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The new DLC weapons don't have anything particularly special about them, either. You can get three kinds of knives, a slightly better bow that is a true upgrade to the standard bow, a massive club with a poison effect, and a Blunderbuss, which can't be upgraded. All of these weapons (save for the Midsummer Bow) are sidegrades at best.</p>

<p>That's not to say it was all samey; the Beekeeper miniboss fight was truly a new experience that required a different kind of strategy to win. I also enjoyed learning about the island's monks through the visions brought on by drinking the Angel's Essence; it added to the feeling that you were tapping into the collective consciousness of the "Angel."</p>

<p>By and large, the&nbsp;<em>Atomfall Wicked Isle</em>&nbsp;DLC is more of the same. It doesn't introduce any new mechanics of any consequence, nor does it introduce any shocking story hooks. It is simply a new zone with some new characters and a lot of the same great&nbsp;<em>Atomfall</em>&nbsp;gameplay that you've experienced in the base game.</p>

<p>The worst part of this DLC, though, was the moments that felt like padding. One set of Leads requires you to run to the far edges of three of the mainland's regions to retrieve keys to open a door, and opening this door is required for both of the new endings introduced in the DLC. All of this running around felt a bit like padding.</p>

<p>Even the new endings weren't particularly innovative. Spoilers ahead â€” one ending is effectively a remix of the "steal a piece of the spooky alien meteorite and escape" ending, and the other new ending is a play on the "join the collective consciousness of the alien fungus" ending. This was a missed opportunity to try a new sort of end to the narrative.</p>

<p>All in all, the&nbsp;<em>Atomfall Wicked Isle</em>&nbsp;DLC was serviceable at best. It's worth it if you really loved running around the mid-20th century British countryside and you're anxious for more places to explore; otherwise, I'd recommend waiting to pick it up until you feel like giving the game a new playthrough sometime down the line.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paralives-december-early-access-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Indie&nbsp;<em>Sims</em>-like&nbsp;<em>Paralives&nbsp;</em>finally has an Early Access release date, and while it's a way away, at least you know when you'll get to check this one out.</p>

<p>As revealed during yesterday's PC Gaming Show,&nbsp;<em>Paralives&nbsp;</em>will launch into Early Access via Steam on December 8th. It's one of very few games around right now that are willing to challenge EA's&nbsp;<em>The Sims&nbsp;</em>for its life sim crown.</p>

<p><em>Paralives&nbsp;</em>has been in development for quite some time. The game was first announced in June 2019, and since then, we've gotten <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sims-competitor-paralives-shows-off-its-characters" rel="nofollow">multiple glimpses</a> of features like its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paralives-character-creator-shows-substantial-improvements" rel="nofollow">character creator</a> and simulation gameplay.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/paralives-early-access-release-date-bloom.jpg?itok=ryZW0E3L 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/paralives-early-access-release-date-bloom.jpg?itok=idQRVV2X 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Paralives&nbsp;</em>is finally on the verge of being released in Early Access.</figcaption></figure><p>Developer Alex MassÃ©'s game may sport a more stylized aesthetic, but make no mistake: it's out here gunning for&nbsp;<em>The Sims</em>' throne, and given the way the landscape of&nbsp;<em>Sims&nbsp;</em>competitors looks right now, I'd wager it stands a solid chance.</p>

<p>Of course, there's Krafton's&nbsp;<em>inZoi</em>, which was released back in March, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/inzoi-sales-1m" rel="nofollow">racking up a million sales</a> within its first week. Other than that, though, the field for&nbsp;<em>Sims</em>-esque games is looking pretty thin, especially since Paradox <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/life-by-you-paradoxs-sims-competitor-has-been-cancelled" rel="nofollow">canceled&nbsp;<em>Life by You&nbsp;</em>last year</a>.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Paralives&nbsp;</em>is, it's a life sim in which you can create characters (known as "Parafolk") and manage their lives as you see fit. You can build their homes, oversee how they interact with one another, and even control their relationships.</p>




<p><em>Paralives&nbsp;</em>also takes place in an open-world environment where you can see your Parafolk interacting with each other in locations outside of their homes. MassÃ© promises locations like parks, beaches, shops, and more for your Parafolk to frolic in.</p>

<p>If you're interested in checking out&nbsp;<em>Paralives</em>, you'll be able to do so when it launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1118520/Paralives/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on December 8th. There's no word of any console ports yet, unfortunately.</p>
