            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Laser fire blasts past your ship as an enemy fighter goes screaming off into the distance, disappearing with a small pock of red light as it explodes in the void of space. Hell of a way to go... but you've got no time to think about it as three nasty little snubfighters are hot on your tail.</p>

<p>Pull up, circle around, try to fire off your blasters in time to catch one of their wings... it's this kind of thrill that you'll get on the table faster than the speed of light when diving into&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ospreypublishing.com/us/voidfighter-9781472866448/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Voidfighter</em></a>, a brand new miniatures-agnostic sci-fi dogfighting skirmish wargame from designer Casey Garske (with illustrations by Dimitris Martinos).</p>

<p>Publisher <a href="https://www.ospreypublishing.com/us/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Osprey Games</a> sent us a review copy of <em>Voidfighter</em> to check out ahead of the games release - so follow along with us as we dive in!</p>

<h2>What Do I Need To Play&nbsp;<em>Voidfighter</em>?</h2>

<p>All you really need to play&nbsp;<em>Voidfighter</em>&nbsp;is the rulebook, three different sized measuring sticks, an assortment of classic RPG dice (two each of: d4s, d6s, d8s, d10s, d12s, and a d20), markers to track which units have activated, and any like-sized spaceship models you can muster. Much like another of my favorite Osprey Games releases,&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/frostgrave-fireheart-and-blood-legacy-preview-new-rules-for-frozen-north" rel="nofollow">Frostgrave</a>,&nbsp;</em><em>Voidfighter&nbsp;</em>is miniature agnostic. This means you can field old <i>X-Wing&nbsp;</i>miniatures, kit-bash something cool from parts you have lying around, or even use cardboard cutouts. All that's needed is a uniform size across you and your opponent's models.</p>

<h2>Playing The Game</h2>

<p><em>Voidfighter'</em>s rules are meant to get miniatures onto the tabletop as quickly as possible, while still giving the player just enough to crunch on to not make it feel shallow by any means. Each round of the game consists of five phases: the Command phase, the Initiative phase, the Movement phase, the Gunnery phase, and the Maintenance phase.</p>

<p>In the Command and Initiative phases, players gain command points (which can be spent on daring maneuvers and upgrades) and roll to determine who activates their models first. In&nbsp;<em>Voidfighter</em>, you definitely&nbsp;<em>don't</em>&nbsp;want to be activating first, as it gives your opponent more information.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/voidfighter-art-1.jpeg?itok=fMXsR_RM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/voidfighter-art-1.jpeg?itok=eDECkteU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In the Movement phase, players will take turns activating chunks of their units (you'll activate a quarter of your units at once), and it's here that you can roll to pull off tricky maneuvers like a Roll or an Immelmann (where you change the ship's facing 180-degrees without moving). To do these maneuvers, you're usually rolling piloting rolls to which each have their own downside should you fail the roll!</p>

<p>In the Gunnery phase, blasters are unleashed as guns send streaks of light through the cold dark of space! With opposed rolls (that's how the whole game plays out, you roll two dice, as does your opponent to contest you) and easy determining of who's in your line of sight and who's in range, this has to be one of the snappiest dogfighting games I've ever tried.</p>

<p>The book goes on to cover rules for terrain and scenario-based models like Asteroids and space creatures, helps you design your squadron and individual ships in The Shipyard, shows off ships for various factions within the game, offers up 12 different scenarios, and has rules for extended campaign play... and it all adds layers to the game without bogging it down.</p>

<p>And that's what I love about these rules, and what makes reading this rulebook so fun. Everything is meant to be easy and intuitive, without feeling too simplistic. You'll find yourself zooming around the board, trying to outflank your opponents as you fire off round after round of guns, torpedoes, and more. It's fast and let's you chuck plenty of dice.</p>

<p>Of all the elements of&nbsp;<em>Voidfighter</em>&nbsp;that most surprised me and kept me engaged throughout my read-through of the rules, the sense of humor and high-quality prose author Casey Garske most stood out. When cracking open a new rulebook for a sci-fi dogfighting skirmish game, I have to admit: I was expecting a pretty dry affair.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/voidfighter-art-2.jpg?itok=RDewXm6O 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/voidfighter-art-2.jpg?itok=9JpGsETK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>But Garske's writing - even when writing out the rules for movement - can't help but shine with its approachable, breezy tone. On top of that, he's created a world for this game that feels wonderfully fleshed out&nbsp;<em>without</em>&nbsp;bogging the reader down with heaps of lore. You get a few paragraphs about the universe at large, and then its off to the (space) races.</p>

<p>Another element that really serves the game is its treatment of reality, which it keeps at arm's length. There's a lot of gleeful hand-waving away of hard physics, which is a very good thing, as this wonderful little spark of a game would grind to a halt if it worried too much about things like g-force.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/voidfighter-photo-2.jpg?itok=pEd2Bppw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/voidfighter-photo-2.jpg?itok=-7N10pUP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2><em>Voidfighter&nbsp;</em>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>This is another grand-slam from publisher Osprey Games, and it shows just how wide open the field of miniature agnostic wargaming truly is. And in the practiced hands of a designer like Garske, there's truly no limit to the amount of creativity and ingenuity we can see from this type of wargame. Untethered by trying to sell their own lumbering miniature line,&nbsp;<em>Voidfighter&nbsp;</em>is allowed to feel nimble - like a snubfighter just dropping into orbit.</p>

<p>If you've got a stack of spaceship miniatures lying around and you're looking for something to do with them, or you want to get into the world of kit-bashing or 3D-printing, or the light and easy tone of this game sounds appealing to you - then I cannot recommend highly enough&nbsp;<em>Voidfighter</em>. Jump in, pilot!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Mega Victreebel Revealed for Pokemon Legends: Z-A]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mega-victreebel-revealed-pokemon-legends-za</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mega-victreebel-revealed-for-pokemon-legends-z-a.1276935/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has revealed a brand new Mega Evolution for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>in the form of Mega Victreebel, and if you've ever felt like&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>could stand a little more horror in its diet, then the new trailer is for you.</p>

<p>Two new videos have appeared on The Pokemon Company's official YouTube channel. The first is a fairly whimsical introduction to Mega Victreebel that shows off the 'mon's design in&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>, as well as some of its combat moves.</p>

<p>It's the second, however, that sparked my interest. "The Case of the Sweet Scent Incident" is an honest-to-god found-footage horror video in which Mega Victreebel plays a role, and I don't want to spoil it, but it's well worth a watch if you're into the creepier side of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mega-victreebel-pokemon-legends-z-a-the-case-of-the-sweet-scent-incident.jpg?itok=KI6-3B6N 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mega-victreebel-pokemon-legends-z-a-the-case-of-the-sweet-scent-incident.jpg?itok=saskKvDp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Yes, this still is from a&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>video.</figcaption></figure><p>In essence, the new video short from the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>folks marries the warring worlds of the creature-collecting franchise and&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 7</em>, as two urban explorers investigate a building that's been giving off a sweet scent at night.</p>

<p>The conceit of the video is that the footage was discovered "on a video sharing website", so the creators are really leaning into the&nbsp;<em>Blair Witch</em>-style trappings of the genre. It's well worth a watch; you can check it out right here.</p>




<p>This has all been set up ahead of the launch of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>, which is set for release on both Nintendo Switch 2 and the original Switch <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-release-date-pokemon-presents" rel="nofollow">in October</a>.</p>

<p>Being set in the Kalos region's Lumiose City, the game will heavily feature Mega Evolution as a mechanic, and it'll introduce new Mega Evolved forms of existing Pokemon like Dragonite and Victreebel, as well as existing Mega Evolutions originally introduced back in Gen 6.</p>

<p>You'll be able to pick up&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>on the Switch family of consoles on October 16th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Time Loop RPG Rue Valley Set for November Release Date]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rue-valley-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/time-loop-rpg-rue-valley-set-for-november-release-date.1276887/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Owlcat Games and developer Emotion Spark Studio have announced the release date for their time loop RPG&nbsp;<em>Rue Valley</em>, and it's hitting PC and consoles in just a couple of months.</p>

<p>As revealed in a new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Rue Valley&nbsp;</em>will be arriving on November 11th. It'll serve as the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/owlcat-publishing-rpgs" rel="nofollow">inaugural publishing project</a> for Owlcat; the studio is mainly known for developing CRPGs like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/pathfinder-wrath-of-righteous" rel="nofollow">Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader" rel="nofollow"><em>Warhammer 40k: Rogue Trader</em></a>.</p>

<p><em>Rue Valley&nbsp;</em>is one of two publishing projects currently in the works at Owlcat; the other,&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Road</em>, is a "turn-based RPG where feudal Japan meets magic and machine", although unfortunately, it doesn't have a release window yet.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rue-valley-release-date-corkboard.jpg?itok=AU3lrV79 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rue-valley-release-date-corkboard.jpg?itok=m1waU7zw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Time loop RPG&nbsp;<em>Rue Valley&nbsp;</em>arrives in November.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Rue Valley</em>, it's a time loop RPG heavily inspired by&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>(and it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/longdue-hopetown-kickstarter-disco-elysium" rel="nofollow">far</a> from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zaum-project-c4-disco-elysium" rel="nofollow">only game</a> for which that description feels <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-disco-elysium-devs-new-studios-spiritual-successors" rel="nofollow">appropriate</a>).</p>

<p>Since&nbsp;<em>Rue Valley&nbsp;</em>takes place during a time loop, you'll have the opportunity to shape the protagonist's personality as you see fit. You can, as Emotion Spark puts it, "be a cold-hearted loner who overthinks everything or a melodramatic loudmouth who always trusts their gut instinct".</p>

<p>As you play, you'll store your memories in a special graph, and you'll use those memories to inform your personality and skills. Just like&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>,&nbsp;<em>Rue Valley&nbsp;</em>de-emphasizes traditional combat in favor of a more psychological approach to the genre.</p>

<p>You can check out the release date trailer for&nbsp;<em>Rue Valley</em>, which gives you a sense of what you're in for if you decide to pick it up in November, right here.</p>




<p>While Owlcat may be moving into publishing with&nbsp;<em>Rue Valley&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Road</em>, that doesn't mean the studio is abandoning development; it's currently hard at work on <i>Warhammer 40k: Dark Heresy</i>, another turn-based RPG set in the grim darkness of the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k&nbsp;</em>universe.</p>

<p><em>Rue Valley&nbsp;</em>launches for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2126190/Rue_Valley/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/rue_valley" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a>, and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/rue-valley-48a101" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Epic Store</a>, as well as <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10014770/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-gb/games/store/rue-valley/9pjmhlrct0j2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and Nintendo Switch, on November 11th.</p>
