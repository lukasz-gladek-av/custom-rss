            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/robocraft-2-canceled-freejam-shuts-down<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Robocraft 2&nbsp;</em>developer Freejam has announced that ongoing development on the game is no longer sustainable, and that the studio itself will also be closing its doors and sunsetting its other titles.</p>

<p>In a message on&nbsp;<em>Robocraft</em>'s official Discord server, Freejam's Rawxas says that "the current market conditions and the server costs required" to keep&nbsp;<em>Robocraft 2&nbsp;</em>running mean that the studio is unable to launch the game's 1.0 version or continue development.</p>

<p>As such, Freejam says it'll spend "some time" sunsetting&nbsp;<em>Robocraft 2</em>, as well as <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/301520/Robocraft/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">its predecessor</a>, "over the coming weeks". The studio's cardboard survival game&nbsp;<em>CardLife&nbsp;</em>will also be sunsetted along with the two&nbsp;<em>Robocraft&nbsp;</em>games.</p>

<p>It may also not come as a surprise that&nbsp;<em>Robocraft 2&nbsp;</em>is being sunsetted if you've played the game; it's currently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1991140/Robocraft_2/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sitting at a Mostly Negative review rating</a> on Steam, with 1,760 players weighing in with their opinions.</p>

<p>Some negative reviews point to technical issues like an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199588571283/recommended/1991140/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">inability to log in</a> or difficulty getting the game to run <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199127398025/recommended/1991140/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on certain platforms</a>, but others offer more <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198135029860/recommended/1991140/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">in-depth critiques</a> of the game, suggesting it's failed to strike the same kind of chord that the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/301520/Robocraft/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">original&nbsp;<em>Robocraft&nbsp;</em>did</a>.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Robocraft 2&nbsp;</em>is (or was), it's an online-focused vehicular combat game in which you can create and deploy your own custom-created vehicles. Freejam says its game's "construction systems" allow players to create "a multitude of shapes at any scale".</p>

<p>Just this week,&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad&nbsp;</em>developer Rocksteady <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rocksteady-layoffs-end-of-2024" rel="nofollow">was reported to have laid off a number of its staff</a> at the end of last year, and other companies such as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/thunderful-layoffs-development" rel="nofollow">Thunderful</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-nod-employees-strike" rel="nofollow">Don't Nod</a>, and many others have also been hit by layoffs.</p>

<p>Bigger companies like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Sony</a> have been affected too, although that hasn't stopped the C-suites at these companies <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-ceo-payrise-layoffs" rel="nofollow">raking in</a> frankly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-ceo-25-million-income-layoffs" rel="nofollow">embarrassing amounts of money</a> while they hemorrhage staff.</p>
