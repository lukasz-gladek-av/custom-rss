            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-40k-death-guard-poxwrought-vector-review-so-sick<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nurgle, the chaos god of rot and decay (and, some would say, rebirth) is back in a big way with the release of a brand new box set of miniatures for the Death Guard Chaos Space Marines army! This week, overall, is a great week for Chaos (check out <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-40k-world-eaters-gorestorm-slaughterpack-review-gory-goodness" rel="nofollow">our review of the other new Chaos Battleforce, the Gorestorm Slaughterpack</a>), so follow along as we hold our noses and get into the funk with the Poxwrought Vector Battleforce box, up for preorder now!</p>

<h2>Poxwrought Vector Battleforce Contents:</h2>

<p>The Poxwrought Vector&nbsp;contains the following miniatures:</p>

<ul><li>1x Lord of Poxes</li>
	<li>1x&nbsp;Foetid Bloat-drone</li>
	<li>1x Myphitic Blight-hauler</li>
	<li>1x&nbsp;Plagueburst Crawler</li>
	<li>5x Blightlord Terminators</li>
	<li>7x&nbsp;Plague Marines</li>
</ul><h3>Reappearing Ability: Nurgle's Gift [Aura]</h3>

<p>Many of the units in this box come with the Nurgle's Gift [Aura] special ability, so I think it's worth explaining that here before we dive into individual unit profiles! With a contagion range emanating out from each unit unit (range grows in the first three rounds), and while an enemy unit is within that range, that unit is Afflicted with one of three abilities you choose at the Declare Battle Formations step:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Overall:&nbsp;</strong>Each enemy unit that is Afflicted has 1 toughness subtracted.</li>
	<li><b>Option 1 - Skullsquirm Blight:&nbsp;</b>Each time a model in this (afflicted) unit makes an attack, subtract 1 from the Hit roll.</li>
	<li><strong>Option 2 - Rattlejoint Ague:&nbsp;</strong>Worsen the Save characteristic of models in this unit by 1.</li>
	<li><strong>Option 3 - Scabrous Soulrot:&nbsp;</strong>Worsen the Move, Leadership, and Objective Control characteristics of models in this unit by 1 (this rule can only worsen a model's OC characteristic to a minimum of 1).</li>
</ul><p>Now that we understand how Nurgle's Gift works, let's dive into the individual units!</p>

<h2>Poxwrought Vector&nbsp;- NEW UNIT:&nbsp;<b>Lord of Poxes</b></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/death-guard-lord-of-poxes.jpg?itok=O3Fe8ZcB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/death-guard-lord-of-poxes.jpg?itok=ADujXL09 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This brand new unit emanates a cloud of spore-thick plague smog - sounds nasty, right? It is!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Lord of Poxes Stats: </b>Move: 5” / Toughness: 6 / Save: 3+ (4+ invuln.) / Wounds: 5 / Leadership: 6+ / OC: 1</p>

<p><b>Lord of Poxes Ranged Weapons:&nbsp;</b></p>

<ul><li><b>Plasma Pistol (standard):&nbsp;</b>Range: 12" / Attacks: 1 / BS: 2+ / Strength: 7 / AP: -2 / Damage: 1</li>
	<li><strong>Plasma Pistol (supercharged) (pistol/hazardous):&nbsp;</strong>Range: 12" / Attacks: 1 / BS: 2+ / Strength: 8 / AP: -3 / Damage: 2</li>
</ul><p><b>Lord of Poxes Melee Weapons:&nbsp;</b></p>

<ul><li><b>Great plague blade (devastating wounds, lethal hits): </b>Attacks: 6 / WS: 2+ / Strength: 8 / AP: -2 / Damage: 2</li>
</ul></blockquote>

<h3><b>Lord of Poxes Key Abilities At A Glance:</b></h3>

<ul><li><strong>Nurgle's Gift:&nbsp;</strong>(see above)</li>
	<li><strong>Gift of Poxes:&nbsp;</strong>Add 3" to the range of this model's Contagion Range.</li>
	<li><strong>Shroud of Disease:&nbsp;</strong>While this model is leading a unit, that unit cannot be targeted by ranged attacks unless the attacking model is within 18".</li>
</ul><h3>Play Tips For Running The Lord of Poxes:</h3>

<p>This unit can lead as an attachment to a unit of Plague Marines, and that's the best way to get him in there. Though not incredible on his own, by attaching him you're shielding your Marines from long-range weaponry with his Shroud of Disease ability. And extending out the Contagion Range turns an ordinary unit of Plague Marines into a walking, festering cloud of de-buffs.</p>

<h2>Poxwrought Vector Unit: Plague Marines</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/plague-marines.jpg?itok=OXHJgAtx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/plague-marines.jpg?itok=5SqVYrGj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Your (rotten) meat and (spoiled) potatoes unit of this army, the Plague Marines have so many weapon options available to them it doesn't make sense to cover them all here - so excuse the shorthand that breaks with our normal format below:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Plague Marines Stats:&nbsp;</strong>Move: 5” / Toughness: 6 / Save: 3+ / Wounds: 2 / Leadership: 6+ / OC: 2</p>

<p><strong>Plague Marines Ranged Weapon Options:</strong></p>

<ul><li><b>Bolt Gun (standard), Blight Launcher, Bolt Pistol, Meltagun, Plague Belcher, Plague Spewer, Plasma Gun, Plasma Pistol</b></li>
</ul><p><b>Plague Marines Melee Weapon Options:</b></p>

<ul><li><b>Plague Knives (standard), Bubotic Weapons, Heavy Plague Weapon, Power Fist</b></li>
</ul></blockquote>

<h3>Plague Marines Key Abilities At A Glance:</h3>

<ul><li><strong>Nurgle's Gift (Aura):</strong> See Above</li>
	<li><strong>Infused with the Blessings of Nurgle:</strong>&nbsp;In your Shooting phase, each time this unit is selected to shoot, after this unit has shot, select one enemy unit hit by one or more of those attacks. Until the start of your next turn, that enemy unit is Afflicted (<em>see Nurgle's Gift</em>&nbsp;<em>above for more info on Afflicted)</em></li>
	<li><strong>Icon of Despair (Aura):&nbsp;</strong>This Wargear Ability states that when an enemy unit is within 6" of the bearer, worsen the Leadership characteristic of models in that unit by 1.</li>
</ul><h3>Play Tips For Running Plague Marines:</h3>

<p>When paired with the Lord of Poxes, these Plague Marines should really be run as a tough, shoot-y unit that's out there sitting on an objective and spraying around the Afflicted condition on enemies that try to get close-in.</p>

<h2>Poxwrought Vector Unit: Blightlord Terminators</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/death-guard-blightlord-terminators.jpg?itok=9xp6y1Dt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/death-guard-blightlord-terminators.jpg?itok=2xACVgBh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The Blightlord Terminators are another unit that come packed with tons of different weapon options, and these hearty units are built Nurgle Tough.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Blightlord Terminators Stats:&nbsp;</strong>Move: 5” / Toughness: 7 / Save: 2+ / Invuln. Save: 4+ / Wounds: 3 / Leadership: 6+ / OC: 1</p>

<p><strong>Blightlord Terminators Ranged Weapon Options:</strong></p>

<ul><li><b>Combi-bolter (standard), Blight Launcher, Combi-weapon, Plague Spewer, Reaper Autocannon</b></li>
</ul><p><b>Plague Marines Melee Weapon Options:</b></p>

<ul><li><b>Bubotic Blade (standard), Close Combat Weapon, Flail of Corruption</b></li>
</ul></blockquote>

<h3>Blightlord Terminators Key Abilities At A Glance:</h3>

<ul><li><strong>Nurgle's Gift (Aura):</strong> See Above</li>
	<li><strong>Blistering Fusillade:</strong>&nbsp;If this unit has a Starting Strength of 5 or more, or if a Character is leading this unit, then each time a model in this unit makes a ranged attack that targets an Afflicted unit, improve the Strength and Armor Penetration characteristics of that attack by 1.</li>
</ul><h3>Play Tips For Running Blightlord Terminators:</h3>

<p>There's nothing quite like slowly stomping toward your opponents (or unloading from a transport vehicle!) with a unit of Terminators, hunkering down with your 2+ save, and blasting them to bits. Add in the benefit you get from targeting Afflicted units, and it's about to get stanky in here!</p>

<h2>Poxwrought Vector&nbsp;- Myphitic Blight-Hauler</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/death-guard-myphitic-blight-hauler.jpg?itok=359E0Oqf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/death-guard-myphitic-blight-hauler.jpg?itok=uATpNHms 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This Daemon Engine is a highly mobile spewer of toxic gasses, tracking down enemy tanks and scarfing up close units.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Myphitic Blight-Hauler Stats: </b>Move: 10” / Toughness: 9 / Save: 3+ (5+ invuln.) / Wounds: 10 / Leadership: 6+ / OC: 3</p>

<p><b>Myphitic Blight-Hauler Ranged Weapons:&nbsp;</b></p>

<ul><li><b>Bile Spurt (Lethal Hits):&nbsp;</b>Range: 12" / Attacks: 3 / BS: 3+ / Strength: 5 / AP: 0 / Damage: 1</li>
	<li><strong>Missile Launcher (Frag) (Blast):&nbsp;</strong>Range: 48" / Attacks: D6 / BS: 4+ / Strength: 4 / AP: 0 / Damage: 1</li>
	<li><strong>Missile Launcher (Krak):&nbsp;</strong>Range: 48" / Attacks: 1 / BS: 3+ / Strength: 9 / AP: -2 / Damage: D6</li>
	<li><strong>Multi-Melta (Melta 2, Lethal Hits):&nbsp;</strong>Range: 18" / Attacks: 2 / BS: 3+ / Strength: 9 / AP: -4 / Damage: D6</li>

<ul><li><b>Gnashing Maw (Lethal Hits): </b>Attacks: 4 / WS: 3+ / Strength: 6 / AP: -1 / Damage: 1</li>
</ul></blockquote>

<h3><b>Myphitic Blight-Hauler Key Abilities At A Glance:</b></h3>

<ul><li><strong>Nurgle's Gift:&nbsp;</strong>(see above)</li>
	<li><strong>Tank Hunters:&nbsp;</strong>In your Shooting phase, each time a model in this unit makes an attack that targets a Monster or Vehicle unit, add 1 to the Hit roll and 1 to the Wound roll.</li>
</ul><h3>Play Tips For Running Myphitic Blight-Hauler:</h3>

<p>There's a nice mobility here you don't find in on-foot units from this slow-as-sludge army, but unless you're expecting a lot of tanks in the meta you're up against, this might spend most of its time lobbing missiles and bile from a distance, hoping to score a few odd hits.</p>

<h2>Poxwrought Vector&nbsp;- Plagueburst Crawler</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/death-guard-plagueburst-crawler.jpg?itok=i-DHm7Qd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/death-guard-plagueburst-crawler.jpg?itok=p5ub1hfT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This heavily armored tank is here to rain down destruction in the form of a punishing volley of artillery, including the deadly Plagueburst mortar.</p>

<ul><li><b>Armoured Tracks: </b>Attacks: 3&nbsp;/ WS: 4+ / Strength: 6&nbsp;/ AP: 0 / Damage: 1</li>
</ul></blockquote>

<h3><b>Plagueburst Crawler Key Abilities At A Glance:</b></h3>

<ul><li><strong>Nurgle's Gift:&nbsp;</strong>(see above)</li>
	<li><strong>Spore-laced Shock Waves:&nbsp;</strong>In your shooting phase, each time you select a target for this model's Plagueburst mortar, roll one D6 for the target unit and every other enemy unit within 3" of the target unit, adding 1 to that roll if the unit being rolled for is Afflicted. On a 6+, the unit being rolled for is struck by spores; after resolving all of this model's attacks against the target unit, each unit struck by spores suffers D3 mortal wounds.</li>
</ul><h3>Play Tips For Running Plagueburst Crawler:</h3>

<p>This is one of those units where the flavor of the weaponry at hand really shines through&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;helps guide you toward a play style. You want to send out shock-waves of spores into the thick of battle, so position your Plagueburst Crawler in just the right spot, launch that 48" ranged Mortar at your enemies, and laugh in that hacking cough way you do as the spores rain down destruction.</p>

<h2>Poxwrought Vector&nbsp;- Foetid Bloat-Drone</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/death-guard-foetid-bloat-drone.jpg?itok=T9un4PKM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/death-guard-foetid-bloat-drone.jpg?itok=mDA06BbK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Floating above the fray, moseying over to enemy units to chop them up into bits, this unit is great and causing mass chaos on the battlefield. Though the standard build is with the powerful Fleshmower, you can replace that with two plaguespitters if you want a more ranged approach.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Foetid Bloat-Drone Stats: </b>Move: 10” / Toughness: 9 / Save: 3+ (5+ invuln.) / Wounds: 10 / Leadership: 6+ / OC: 3</p>

<p><b>Foetid Bloat-Drone Ranged Weapons:&nbsp;</b></p>

<ul><li><b>Plaguespitter (anti-infantry 2+, ignores cover, torrent):&nbsp;</b>Range: 12" / Attacks: D6&nbsp;/ BS: NA / Strength: 6&nbsp;/ AP: -1&nbsp;/ Damage: 1</li>
</ul><p><b>Foetid Bloat-Drone Melee Weapons:&nbsp;</b></p>

<ul><li><b>Fleshmower (lethal hits): </b>Attacks: 10&nbsp;/ WS: 3+ / Strength: 7&nbsp;/ AP: -1&nbsp;/ Damage: 2</li>
	<li><strong>Plague Probe (lethal hits):&nbsp;</strong>Attacks: 3 / WS: 3+ / Strength: 6 / AP: -1 / Damage: 1</li>
</ul></blockquote>

<h3><b>Foetid Bloat-Drone Key Abilities At A Glance:</b></h3>

<ul><li><strong>Nurgle's Gift:&nbsp;</strong>(see above)</li>
	<li><strong>Hovering Death:&nbsp;</strong>This unit is eligible to shoot and declare a charge in a turn in which it Fell Back.</li>
</ul><h3>Play Tips For Running The Foetid Bloat-Drone:</h3>

<p>How you want to build this unit is up to you, as I think there's an argument to be made either to have two auto-hitting plaguespitters equipped, or the 10 (!!) hits on the Fleshmower. Either way, this unit is meant to get into the action, belt out wounds, and next turn fall back thanks to its Hovering Death ability.</p>

<h2>Poxwrought Vector Battleforce - Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Now&nbsp;<em>this</em>&nbsp;is what a Battleforce should look like, in my opinion. With six different types of units included, this vehicle-heavy box set is a really fun way to get a new army onto the tabletop in a way that feels very different from other boxes. I think, generally speaking, the design of the Death Guard is some of the best in Warhammer 40K, and this box shows how that Nurgle rot manifests across so many different types of units.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ttrpg-books-might-be-exempt-from-us-trade-tariffs.1174269/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/ttrpg-books-might-be-exempt-from-us-trade-tariffs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There may be an exception for tabletop games being affected by the imposed US trade tariffs. These tariffs, which have already caused several board game companies to shutter, may not affect TTRPG books. However, there are some catches.</p>

<h2>TTRPG Books Potentially Exempt From Tariffs</h2>

<p>As mentioned before, the Trump administration's 145% trade tariffs on imported Chinese goods have severely impacted the entire tabletop game industry. The vast majority of board game production happens overseas in China then is imported back for delivery. But with import costs now more than double, companies like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/greater-than-games-shuts-down-in-response-to-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Greater Than Games</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cmon-reduces-staff-and-pauses-board-game-development-amid-us-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">CMON</a> have paused board game production completely.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sentinels-of-the-multiverse-comic-artwork.jpg?itok=7KNg8Im4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sentinels-of-the-multiverse-comic-artwork.jpg?itok=0m-k60lo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This has lead to a question in the tabletop community: do TTRPG books count? This is a curious question since books are usually exempt from import costs due in part to how they are manufactured and their classification as cultural objects or means of technical information. In fact, printed books are on a limited list of products exempt from President Trump's trade tariffs via the executive order <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Annex-II.pdf" rel="nofollow">Annex II</a>.</p>

<p>This seems straightforward. Printed books are exempt from tariffs. TTRPG books are printed books, therefore, they are exempt. According to US Customs however, it is more complicated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a ruling <a href="https://rulings.cbp.gov/ruling/085214" rel="nofollow">from 1989</a>, TTRPGs, referred to as "Fantasy Role Play Books" are not classified as printed books. The ruling states that the books are "designed to enhance fantasy game play, not for passive reading." This means the books are classified not as books but as "arcade, table, or parlor games... parts and accessories thereof," the same classification given to tabletop games.</p>

<p>This ruling is contradicted by more recent findings from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/563608/rpg-books-tariff-exclusions-shadowrun" rel="nofollow">Polygon's</a> own Nicole Carpenter. According to a 2024 Customs and Border Protection ruling, the <em>Shadowrun 6th Edition</em> Rulebook was classified as a printed hardbound book. This ruling applied, "only to the specific factual situation and merchandise description as identified in the ruling request."</p>

<p>Presuming this ruling isn't amended or overruled, that means TTRPG books may be exempt from the trade tariffs if they are imported and sold separately. No dice. No miniatures. No maps. No accessories included alongside the book.</p>

<p>What does this mean for the future of TTRPGs? Considering the ever-changing volatile landscape caused by the current administration, it is difficult to be certain. But, it may mean the cost of starter sets or TTRPG bundles may go up due to this quirk of US Customs.</p>
