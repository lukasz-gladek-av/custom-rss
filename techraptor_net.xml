            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-ea-second-most-played-game-steam<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA and Hazelight Studios' latest release&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>has already climbed its way through the publisher's Steam charts, and the co-op action-adventure game is now the second most-played EA game on the platform.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2001120/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>,&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>'s 24-hour Steam player peak sits at 197,434, which is pretty impressive; it's more than double what predecessor&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two&nbsp;</em>achieved, and that game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hazelight-josef-fares-new-ip-it-takes-two-sales" rel="nofollow">phenomenally successful in sales terms</a>.</p>

<p>The figure puts&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>in second place, and while that's certainly an achievement Hazelight and Josef Fares can celebrate, I don't think&nbsp;the game has a hope of beating the first-place record holder given that it's battle royale FPS&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/split-fiction-steam-count-platforming.jpg?itok=ihs7HF-e 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/split-fiction-steam-count-platforming.jpg?itok=g1XKWRE- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hazelight's&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>is doing pretty well at launch.</figcaption></figure><p>It is worth noting that since&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>'s Friend Pass allows players to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-friends-pass-crossplay" rel="nofollow">enjoy the game with a friend</a> even if they didn't buy it themselves, the Steam numbers don't necessarily translate into hard sales.</p>

<p>Still, the same is true of&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two</em>, so it's still a fair point of comparison in my books. It's fair to say that EA and Hazelight have a hit on their hands with&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>, and I wouldn't be surprised if the numbers climb even higher over the weekend.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>, it's the latest game from&nbsp;<em>A Way Out&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two&nbsp;</em>developer Hazelight Studios, headed up by industry iconoclast and noted Oscars hater Josef Fares.</p>

<p>The game sees you and a friend (it doesn't support single-player, much like the aforementioned games) playing as Mio and Zoe, two writers who find themselves sucked into the worlds they've created and looking for a way out.</p>




<p>Much like&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two</em>,&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>features a variety of co-op-focused activities, including platforming, combat, and various wacky setpieces. It's pretty much exactly what you'd expect from a Hazelight game, it seems to me.</p>

<p><em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>is available now for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.
