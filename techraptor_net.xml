            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shotgun-cop-man-my-friend-pedro-creator<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Devolver Digital (because of course) and developer DeadToast Entertainment have announced&nbsp;<em>Shotgun Cop Man</em>, the studio's next freewheeling shooter after its debut title&nbsp;<em>My Friend Pedro</em>.</p>

<p>Described by the two studios as a "devilishly fun ballistic platformer",&nbsp;<em>Shotgun Cop Man&nbsp;</em>sees the titular shotgun cop man descending into the depths of hell in order to arrest Satan. Yes, you read that right.</p>

<p>If you've played&nbsp;<em>My Friend Pedro</em>, then you can probably guess that this game likely won't be too heavy on the story. After all, in&nbsp;<em>Shotgun Cop Man</em>'s debut trailer, our hero yells at Satan to freeze, upon which he says "fuck you, Shotgun Cop Man" and flees. It's that sort of soiree.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shotgun-cop-man-gameplay.jpg?itok=xw9FIaSV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shotgun-cop-man-gameplay.jpg?itok=ga44pLn8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Shotgun Cop Man&nbsp;</em>eschews&nbsp;<em>My Friend Pedro</em>'s 2.5D look for a pure 2D aesthetic.</figcaption></figure><p>Gameplay-wise,&nbsp;<em>Shotgun Cop Man&nbsp;</em>promises to continue&nbsp;<em>My Friend Pedro</em>'s frenetic dual-wielding shooter gameplay, albeit with a much more pleasing to the eye (for me, at least) 2D visual style.</p>

<p>You'll go in armed with Shotgun Cop Man's signature boomstick and pistol, but you'll also be able to acquire other weapons on-site. You won't just be using the guns to shoot bad guys, either; you'll also be using them to traverse the world, propelling yourself through hell by the power of bullets.</p>

<p>Devolver and DeadToast are promising a "hand-crafted campaign" to enjoy, as well as extra No Damage and Speedrun modes if you really want to test your skills against the hordes of hell.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Shotgun Cop Man&nbsp;</em>right here.</p>




<p>As well as the aforementioned modes,&nbsp;<em>Shotgun Cop Man&nbsp;</em>will also let you create your own levels, and others can play them for "endless replayability". After all, Shotgun Cop Man is going to need a pretty convincing excuse to hang around hell after Satan has been arrested.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Shotgun Cop Man&nbsp;</em>on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2966850/Shotgun_Cop_Man/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and Switch when it launches later this year, and a PC demo is available to try out right now.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-blitz-crackdown</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-rivals-cracks-down-on-blitz-tool-but-promises-amnesty-for-users.1115559/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-blitz-crackdown<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>developer NetEase has announced a crackdown on popular third-party app Blitz, which players have been using to track damage statistics, ban certain heroes, and more.</p>

<p>In a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2767030/view/509572974349647985" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, NetEase says that Blitz "injects itself" into the game's process, allowing users to view "confidential information like damage and healing statistics". Not only that, but the tool also allows players to predict enemy ultimate cooldowns and "selectively ban heroes", which NetEase says "severely undermin[es]" fairness.</p>

<p>As such, NetEase says it's officially deemed Blitz to be "cheating software", and so using it in the game is no longer allowed. If you've got Blitz installed and you're using it for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>, it's probably best to uninstall it, and if you aren't using it yet, I wouldn't recommend starting.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-rivals-blitz-crackdown-magik-black-panther.jpg?itok=vFZbDV8M 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-rivals-blitz-crackdown-magik-black-panther.jpg?itok=sMYnfYxc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Using Blitz in&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>is now tantamount to cheating, NetEase says.</figcaption></figure><p>However, if you have used the tool in the past, NetEase says that you "will not face any penalties, as long as you refrain from using it in future games".</p>

<p>The developer closes by imploring players not to use any third-party plugins in order to "uphold justice in our gaming universe and protect the integrity of your account", so it sounds like you'll face a ban if you are caught using Blitz.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with Blitz, it's a tool that provides overlays for multiplayer games like <i>League of Legends</i>,&nbsp;<em>Valorant</em>, and indeed&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>&nbsp;until today.</p>

<p>Its use is tolerated by other game companies; in fact, according to Blitz itself, the tool is <a href="https://support.blitz.gg/hc/en-us/articles/4415398467737-Can-I-get-banned-for-using-Blitz" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">officially recognized by Riot</a>, so&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' stance is perhaps a little unusual among games for which players use the tool.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/league-of-legends-viktor-singed-blitz.jpg?itok=DqOueOYQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/league-of-legends-viktor-singed-blitz.jpg?itok=msI5W1sD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Blitz's use in&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>is all but endorsed by Riot.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>, it's a third-person hero shooter that's essentially&nbsp;<em>Overwatch&nbsp;</em>with Marvel characters. Heroes like Iron Man, Venom, and Storm do battle across a variety of maps, completing objectives like protecting certain areas or escorting moving objects to their destination.</p>

<p>The game recently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-40m" rel="nofollow">hit 40 million registered players</a>, according to developer NetEase, but that didn't stop the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-studio-shockingly-closed-by-netease-laying-off-everyone" rel="nofollow">closing down the Seattle studio</a> responsible for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em> and laying off all of its employees.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>right now for free on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2767030/Marvel_Rivals/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/marvel-rivals/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/marvel-rivals/9n8pmw7qmd3d" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. Just don't use Blitz while you're doing so, eh?</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-january-2025-circana-us-sales-data</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-is-january-2025s-top-selling-game-according-to-us-sales-data.1115469/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-january-2025-circana-us-sales-data<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Circana has released its US gaming industry sales data for January 2025, and given that it's a month without many significant releases, the number one seller for the month probably won't surprise you.</p>

<p>As noted in a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lioxq6xkoc2w" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky thread</a> by Circana's Mat Piscatella,&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>is once again the month's biggest-selling game across all platforms. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/circana-us-sales-data-2024-top-selling-games" rel="nofollow">was also 2024's top-selling title</a>&nbsp;by Circana's reckoning.</p>

<p>In second place for the all-format chart is&nbsp;<em>Madden NFL 25</em>, which isn't surprising given the colossal commercial success of that franchise <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-sports-college-football-25-best-selling-sports-game" rel="nofollow">and&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football</em></a>, while&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth&nbsp;</em>is in third, bolstered by its January PC release. Perhaps now, it can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-16-rebirth-profits-square-enix" rel="nofollow">strive to meet Square Enix's expectations</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-january-2025-us-sales-data.jpg?itok=_9qjfds5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-january-2025-us-sales-data.jpg?itok=49ipegHv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</em>'s PC release helped it hit third place in Circana's January 2025 sales chart.</figcaption></figure><p>Rounding out the all-format top five are&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC 25</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-ea-sports-fc-25-underperformed" rel="nofollow">underperformed compared to EA's expectations</a>, and&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>, which probably <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/diablo-player-count-gta-5-sales" rel="nofollow">couldn't be said to have underperformed</a> by any expectations in the known universe.</p>

<p>When it comes to specific formats,&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>tops the PlayStation chart for January, while&nbsp;<em>Madden NFL 25&nbsp;</em>tops the Xbox chart. As always, the Switch is dancing to its own tune; Nintendo's chart is dominated by&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Country Returns</em>.</p>

<p>As for player engagement - that is, games on each platform ranked by monthly active users -&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>is top of the chart on PlayStation, while&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>tops Xbox's chart.&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-40m" rel="nofollow">recently hit 40 million players</a>, is number one on Steam.</p>

<p>Spending as a whole across the industry fell by 15% compared to the same period last year, although as Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lioxq42zqc2w" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">points out</a>, January 2025 consists of four weeks rather than last year's five-week tracking period.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-rivals-circana-us-sales-data-january-2025.jpg?itok=jbbUZD91 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-rivals-circana-us-sales-data-january-2025.jpg?itok=AE6L4Gpo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>topped Circana's Steam player engagement chart for January.</figcaption></figure><p>Hardware-wise, the PS5 <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lioxqlznlf2w" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">emerged victorious</a> once again in January, beating out the Xbox and Switch in units and dollar sales. Xbox was second in dollar sales, while Switch came second in units.</p>

<p>As ever, Piscatella's full thread is well worth a look if you want to see some other stats. You can <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lioxq23ems2w" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">check the thread out here</a>.</p>
