            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Funcom and developer Astrolabe Interactive have announced the Bloom &amp; Blight update for cozy survival adventure&nbsp;<i>Aloft</i>, and it's set to bring big improvements to the game next month.</p>

<p>As revealed in a press release,&nbsp;<em>Aloft</em>'s Bloom &amp; Blight update will arrive on November 4th, and the two studios are talking a big game for the update; it's apparently set to improve "almost every facet" of the game.</p>

<p>According to Funcom and Astrolabe, Bloom &amp; Blight will "revamp and improve almost every aspect of [<em>Aloft</em>], including world generation, tech tree progression, exploration and travel, ecosystem restoration, and combat", so this is a pretty ambitious undertaking.</p>

<p>Progression will be overhauled to be less confusing and directionless, and ecosystem restoration will be redesigned so that it feels more "engaging" and less "likely simply ticking items off a checklist".</p>

<p>It's not just content within the game that will be getting changes, however;&nbsp;<em>Aloft</em>'s developers are also working on the technical side of things, with the save data system getting a complete overhaul to "achieve long-term stability".</p>

<p>Suffice it to say that if you haven't played&nbsp;<em>Aloft </em>since its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/aloft-early-access-release-date" rel="nofollow">January Early Access release</a>, or even if you're new to the game, you should hopefully find a significantly improved and expanded version of the survival adventure after Bloom &amp; Blight lands.</p>




<p>News of&nbsp;<em>Aloft</em>'s latest major update comes just a couple of days after publisher Funcom <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-funcom-layoffs" rel="nofollow">embarked on a spate of layoffs</a>, with&nbsp;<em>Metal: Hellsinger&nbsp;</em>developer The Outsiders <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-hellsinger-the-outsiders-shut-down-funcom" rel="nofollow">closing down</a> as a result of these staff cuts.</p>

<p>That's despite the fact that sci-fi survival sim<i>&nbsp;Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</i>proved to be the company's most successful release yet, racking up <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-sales-1m-infographic" rel="nofollow">a million sales within just two weeks of its launch</a> back in June this year.</p>

<p>In any case, you can check out&nbsp;<em>Aloft&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1660080/Aloft/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>, and you can remind yourself what our very own Isaac thought of the game by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/aloft-preview" rel="nofollow">reading his preview from January</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/vampire-survivors-update-1-14-brings-online-co-op-and-more-this-fall.1318555/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Vampire Survivors&nbsp;</em>developer and publisher Poncle has announced a brand new update for the arcade roguelike, and it'll finally bring the ability to play the game online alongside your friends.</p>

<p>As revealed in <a href="https://x.com/poncle_vampire/status/1975546530238013703" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on X,&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors&nbsp;</em>Update 1.14 is due to arrive sometime this fall, and it's bringing online co-op to the game on both PC and consoles, although it's not clear right now whether the game's multiplayer mode will feature crossplay.</p>

<p>Of course, Poncle revealed the news of&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em>' online co-op mode with a characteristically amusing trailer featuring a throwback Windows 95-style operating system, so if, like me, you're hopelessly nostalgic for the days of old-school PC gaming, this one'll appeal to you.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/poncle-vampire-survivors-online-co-op-update-windows-95.jpg?itok=VZADLhqn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/poncle-vampire-survivors-online-co-op-update-windows-95.jpg?itok=S10Mc8B4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Oh, Poncle, you rogue, you.</figcaption></figure><p>The trailer also shows a clip of four players enjoying&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors&nbsp;</em>together, and indeed, the game's online co-op mode will support up to four players, so grab three friends and get ready to fill the screen with an absolutely cosmic amount of projectiles.</p>

<p>As well as online co-op, there are four more major features to be revealed as part of&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors&nbsp;</em>Update 1.14, and Poncle is pledging to reveal new cards each week, so we'll learn more about what else is coming as part of this update in...well, in a week, as it happens.</p>

<p>News of&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em>' latest update comes just a couple of months after Poncle announced its second major <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-survivors-studio-poncle-publishing" rel="nofollow">foray into the publishing world</a> in the form of brick-breaking roguelike&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kill-the-brickman-poncle-out-now" rel="nofollow">Kill the Brickman</a>&nbsp;</em>(no, not that one).</p>




<p>As for the game that made Poncle's name, if you're somehow unfamiliar with it,&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors&nbsp;</em>is an action-heavy arcade roguelike in which you must survive hordes of enemies swarming you across a variety of different maps.</p>

<p>To that end, you'll gain access to projectile and melee weapons that fire themselves, so it's up to you to position yourself correctly and try to build the perfect combination of items in order to survive for as long as you possibly can.</p>
