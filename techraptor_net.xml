Publisher The Game Kitchen and tabletop developer Ludus Magnus Studio have announced a tabletop adaptation of the dark fantasy indie action game will be coming through a crowdfunding campaign on Gamefound.</p>



<p>According to the Gamefound <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/projects/lms/blasphemous-the-boardgame#/section/project-story" rel="nofollow">campaign page</a>, <em>Blasphemous: The Board Game</em> is a competitive tabletop experience based on the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/blasphemous-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Blasphemous</em></a> videogame.</p>

It is a dark, gothic world inhabited by highly religious followers of a devout order. An order that believes that all diseases, afflictions, and supernatural events are the cause of something called the Miracle and that acts of extreme penance, pain, and sacrifice can lead to salvation from its influence.</p>

<p>It is a setting highly influenced by The Game Kitchen's home region of Seville, themes of Catholic guilt, and the methods of torture inflicted by The Spanish Inquisition.</p>

<p>In <em>Blasphemous: The Board Game</em>, 1-4 players take on the role of zealous warriors known as Penitents. Players will explore the land of Cvstodia, fight enemies, and complete quests, all in preparation to face down deadly bosses.</p>

<p>While the game is competitive in nature, players will need to work together to take down these terrifying foes. Each boss has a unique victory condition, which can be achieved through different strategies, adding potential replay value to the game.</p>

Penitents of Abdon are straightforward bruisers, Penitents of Crimson Dusk are cunning and swift strikes. As you complete quests, you will gain custom dice, prayers, and beads that will improve your abilities.</p>

<p>Those quests are presented in narrative booklets. Each quest in the game contains up to four booklets: one general booklet and 3 specific ones.</p>

<p>Finally, <em>Blasphemous: The Board Game</em> will contain miniatures based on enemies from the videogames. The preview page confirms the Esquilon, Flagellant, Shieldmaiden, and Phalaris are in the game with more to be announced.</p>

<p>The Gamefound campaign for <em>Blasphemous: The Board Game</em> will go live in Q1 2025. If you follow the campaign beforehand, you will get an exclusive Penitent One miniature with your pledge at no additional cost.</p>
