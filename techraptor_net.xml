            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-network-test-stats<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has revealed some fun statistics for the recent&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>network test, in which those lucky enough to be invited got a glimpse of what can be expected from the game's final release later this year.</p>

<p>Over <a href="https://x.com/BandaiNamcoUS/status/1905622167158432218" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on X</a>, Bandai Namco shared what it called its "Numbers from the Night", and it turns out that across the network test as a whole, players slaughtered the Gladius, Beast of Night boss 58,615 times. That's a lot of dead Nightlords.</p>

<p>Spectral Hawks, the ghostly birds used to ferry players across&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>'s map, were summoned 427,533 times across the network test, while 23.6 million recovery attacks were used to help downed players get back on their feet.</p>

<p>Almost 150,000 Flying Dragons of the Hills were killed, and almost 100,000 Royal Knights met their ends at the hands of enterprising warriors. If you think you're going to struggle in&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, let these numbers give you some solace.</p>

<p>On the other hand, almost 38 billion (!) runes were lost by players cumulatively over the course of&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>'s network test. I like to imagine that 37 billion of those were just one very, very unlucky player.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, it's an upcoming action RPG spinoff of FromSoftware and Bandai Namco's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-25-million" rel="nofollow">hugely successful</a> open-world Soulslike&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>, and it represents the developer's first major spinoff for one of its properties.</p>




<p><em>Nightreign</em>'s core gameplay loop sees you and two other players (or just you, but not you and one other) descending onto a map in order to loot it, kill its bosses for XP, and grow strong enough to battle the Nightlord at the end of a three-day period.</p>

<p>The game will feature not only enemies from&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>, but also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-dark-souls-enemies-confirmed" rel="nofollow">foes featured in FromSoftware's&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls&nbsp;</em>series</a>, including the likes of the first game's Centipede Demon,&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls 2</em>'s The Duke's Dear Freja, and&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls 3</em>'s The Nameless King.</p>

<p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>launches <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nighreign-release-date" rel="nofollow">on May 30th</a> on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2622380/ELDEN_RING_NIGHTREIGN/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/elden-ring-nightreign/9PJ22QNVCZ3G" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>. I was lucky enough to get into the network test back in February, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/elden-ring-nightreign-preview-night-fever" rel="nofollow">you can read my impressions of it here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-32-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has announced the&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.2 release date, with the new update set to bring two new 5-star characters, a perilous new foe to take down, and more in April.</p>

<p>Following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-31-release-date" rel="nofollow">February's Version 3.1</a>,&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.2, also known as "Through the Petals in the Land of Repose", is set to launch across all platforms on April 9th. HoYoverse is promising "trials of survival and political intrigue" as part of the update's main story.</p>

<p>You'll be traveling to the "forgotten city-state of Styxia" in this update, and while you're there, you'll take on Pollux, a leviathan who slumbers in the River of Souls. Pollux has some pretty nasty HP manipulation attacks, so you'll have to be on your A-game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/honkai-star-rail-version-3.2-release-date-styxia.jpg?itok=_-i4deVf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/honkai-star-rail-version-3.2-release-date-styxia.jpg?itok=So3A03E3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.2 brings the fallen city-state of Styxia and more next month.</figcaption></figure><p>Two 5-star characters are coming your way in&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.2. The first, Castorice, is a Remembrance-path character who can sync up with her Netherwing dragon for big damage, although the dragon sacrifices its own HP to use its ultimate attack.</p>

<p>Your second 5-star character in Version 3.2 is Anaxa, an Erudition character who can apply Weaknesses to enemies and boost his damage using his Qualitative Disclosure ability.</p>

<p>The first half of Version 3.2 will also see the return of Fugue, Jiaoqiu, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-acheron-raiden-shogun" rel="nofollow">Acheron</a> as rerun banners, while the second half will give you another chance to obtain the wonderfully-named <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-dr-ratio-trailer" rel="nofollow">Dr. Ratio</a> for your team.</p>

<p><em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.2 isn't all about gloomy city-states and frantic combat, though; you can also kick back and enjoy the new Seal Slammers minigame, which allows you to compete against your allies "in chaotic seal-based collisions". Finally.</p>




<p><em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>is available to play for free right now on <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC, PS5, and mobile devices</a>. Version 3.2, also known as "Through the Petals in the Land of Repose", arrives on April 9th.</p>
