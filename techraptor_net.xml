            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/future-clair-obscur-expedition-33-updates-new-content<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sandfall Interactive, the studio behind the hugely successful turn-based RPG&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, has confirmed it's actively considering "new content" for future updates, as well as various other improvements.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/expedition33.bsky.social/post/3lrpzry3pnk2f" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Bluesky, Sandfall says it's "currently exploring a wide range of future improvements" for&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>updates, including "accessibility features", "new content", and "all sorts of bits and bobs".</p>

<p>One of the major improvements Sandfall says it's thinking about involves expanding localization options for the game, allowing folks to play it in more languages. However, the studio <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/expedition33.bsky.social/post/3lrpzry3ujs2f" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">cautions</a> that it doesn't have "specific timelines or confirmed languages" yet.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/clair-obscur-expedition-33-updates-new-content-lune.jpg?itok=8xZg97HD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/clair-obscur-expedition-33-updates-new-content-lune.jpg?itok=Zd-eqjMq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>could be getting new content in future updates.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, it's a turn-based RPG that serves as the debut title from French studio Sandfall Interactive (and once you've played the game, you'll understand why its developer needed to be French).</p>

<p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>takes place in a world ravaged by a monstrous figure known as the Paintress, who paints a new number each year. Everyone of that age dies at the conclusion of the year, so humanity sends out "expeditions" to try and defeat the Paintress before the next number is painted.</p>

<p>Gameplay-wise, the game appears to take several cues from classic turn-based RPGs in franchises like&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest</em>, although it has a much darker and more bleak tone than the latter.</p>

<p>It's also got a parry system, being a modern game, and so you'll have to factor in parrying or dodging enemies' attacks as well as strategizing during turn-based combat.</p>




<p>Since launch,&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>has proven immensely popular. It <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-500k" rel="nofollow">sold 500,000 copies</a> within just 24 hours, going on to reach <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">two million in under two weeks</a>. At last count, it had hit the satisfying total of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-3-3m-33-days" rel="nofollow">3.3 million sales in 33 days</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Donkey Kong Bananza Nintendo Direct Scheduled for This Week]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-direct-announced</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-direct-scheduled-for-this-week.1219368/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-direct-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced that it will be airing a&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>-themed Direct presentation later this week, so we'll finally get to learn more about the iconic ape's upcoming platformer.</p>

<p>As revealed on the Nintendo Today news app, the&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>Direct airs on June 18th (that's this Wednesday at time of writing). It'll last around 15 minutes and will (quite obviously) focus entirely on&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, so put your&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>hopes away.</p>

<p>Announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2" rel="nofollow">back in April</a> as part of the Nintendo Switch 2's big reveal,&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>will serve as DK's first 3D platformer in 26 years. Naturally, I'm not counting the newer&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Country&nbsp;</em>games; their models might be 3D, but they're 2D platformers at heart.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-announced-dk.jpg?itok=FoXmj90V 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-announced-dk.jpg?itok=Rpz_cQ8B 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Direct airs in two days, DK. I'd go find something else to do in the meantime.</figcaption></figure><p>The game will see you playing as the titular ape as he attempts to recover priceless golden banana-shaped jewels from the nefarious VoidCo, for if Donkey Kong is involved, then it must be the rescue of bananas that motivates him.</p>

<p><em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>will take the form of a 3D platformer with all the good stuff you've come to expect from the genre: collectibles, bad guys to fight, and, of course, plenty of chasms to jump across.</p>

<p>The game will also feature destructible environments, with initial trailers showing off the ability to smash up elements of the stage to get underground or to collect more stuff. That's the kind of thing the original Switch probably wouldn't have been able to handle.</p>

<p>You can remind yourself of how fun&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>looks (very, in case you need a refresher) by checking out the debut trailer from back in April below.</p>




<p>The&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>Direct presentation airs on June 18th at 9am Eastern (that's 6am Pacific). The game itself launches <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">exclusively for Nintendo Switch 2</a> on July 17th.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Stellar Blade PC Sales Apparently Topped a Million in Just Three Days]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-pc-sales-1m-three-days</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stellar-blade-pc-sales-apparently-topped-a-million-in-just-three-days.1219296/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-pc-sales-1m-three-days<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>PC sales of the hack-and-slash actioner&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>apparently reached a major milestone within just three days of the game's release, according to a new report.</p>

<p>Per Korean news platform <a href="https://bbs.ruliweb.com/news/read/211821" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Ruliweb</a>&nbsp;(via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-proves-theres-appetite-for-playstation-5-games-on-pc-as-it-blasts-past-one-million-sales-in-three-days" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>),&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade</em>'s PC version, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-pc-release-june-leak" rel="nofollow">released last week</a>, racked up a million sales for itself on PC alone within the first three days of its release on the platform.</p>

<p>According to Ruliweb, that brings the game's total sales up to over three million around the world. That's on both PlayStation 5 and PC, of course, and it also includes both digital and physical shipments. Still, that's not a bad figure at all, and it means&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>has picked up an extra two million sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-sales-one-million" rel="nofollow">since June last year</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stellar-blade-pc-sales-report-boss.jpg?itok=uA66X8Or 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stellar-blade-pc-sales-report-boss.jpg?itok=0eCGlPQk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Stellar Blade</em>'s PC port has done solid numbers, according to a new report.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade</em>, it's an action game developed by&nbsp;<em>Goddess of Victory: Nikke&nbsp;</em>studio Shift Up. Released last year, the game revolves around Eve, who must rid Earth of a hostile force known as the Naytiba.</p>

<p>Since launch,&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>has received a number of updates, including the addition of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-new-game-plus-mode" rel="nofollow">New Game Plus mode</a>, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-nier-automata-crossover" rel="nofollow">crossover with&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-nier-automata-crossover" rel="nofollow">Nier: Automata</a>&nbsp;</em>(one of the game's biggest inspirations), and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/festive-stellar-blade-update" rel="nofollow">lots of new outfits</a> for several of the game's characters as well.</p>

<p>Supposedly, the game did so well that Shift Up <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-shift-up-ps5-pro-bonus" rel="nofollow">gifted all of its employees PS5 Pro consoles</a> as a Christmas bonus last year, and since&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>boasts PS5 Pro improvements (along with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/full-ps5-pro-enhanced-list-launch" rel="nofollow">several other games</a>), I'm sure that came as a welcome surprise.</p>




<p>As for what's next for Shift Up, a <i>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</i>sequel has been confirmed to be in the works, although we don't know when it's due yet. Additionally, the studio is currently working on a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-developer-shift-up-new-action-rpg" rel="nofollow">new next-gen action-RPG</a>&nbsp;with an urban sci-fi theme.</p>
