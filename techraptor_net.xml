            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/notch-minecraft-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Markus "Notch" Persson, the original creator of&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>, says he's "basically announced&nbsp;<em>Minecraft 2</em>" after releasing a poll in which he asked his fans what type of game they'd like to see him work on next.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://x.com/notch/status/1874522284813107617" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">poll</a>, which was posted on social media platform X a few days ago, gave fans two options with regards to Notch's next project: "a traditional roguelike" in the vein of&nbsp;<em>ADOM&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Nethack</em>, or "a spiritual successor thing to&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>".</p>

<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the poll, which has attracted over 285,000 votes at time of writing, heavily skews towards "<em>Minecraft 2</em>", as he calls it, with 81.5% of votes weighing in for that project and just 18.5% of votes supporting the roguelike concept.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/minecraft-2-notch-announced.jpg?itok=MWQpjJ3h 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/minecraft-2-notch-announced.jpg?itok=aIleTtcQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Notch can't actually make&nbsp;<em>Minecraft 2</em>, since he no longer holds the rights to the franchise.</figcaption></figure><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/notch/status/1875230756437479658" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">followup message posted later on</a>, Notch then says he "basically announced&nbsp;<em>Minecraft 2</em>" in the poll. Despite feeling that "spiritual successors are usually kind of...tragic", he goes on to say "why not do the thing that people DO want and are willing to give me, somehow, even MORE cash for".</p>

<p>Of course, Notch doesn't actually own the rights to&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>anymore (which <a href="https://x.com/notch/status/1874532442637475973" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">he himself acknowledges</a>); since Mojang was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mojang-yes-were-being-bought-by-microsoft-notch-leaves" rel="nofollow">purchased by Microsoft in 2014</a>, at which point Notch also left the company, it's Microsoft that owns&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>, not Notch.</p>

<p>In his post, Notch says he intends to make the&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>spiritual successor without "sneakily infring[ing] on the incredible work the Mojang team is doing and that Microsoft is successfully doing the Microsoft shittification about". He doesn't elaborate on exactly what that means.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that Notch doesn't reveal any details whatsoever about this project, so it's likely that we're a long way away from seeing any actual gameplay or even learning any concrete information about it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/minecraft-2-notch-announced-portal.jpg?itok=BVZTQS7r 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/minecraft-2-notch-announced-portal.jpg?itok=x_BYQmIk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>could be getting a "spiritual successor" courtesy of Notch.</figcaption></figure><p>Notch also doesn't sound particularly enthusiastic about making&nbsp;<em>Minecraft 2</em>; he's open about knowing it'll make more money than his roguelike idea, but he <a href="https://x.com/notch/status/1874530816216482169" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">implored his supporters</a> to vote for his roguelike project, so that's likely where his heart is (or was).</p>

<p>While the concept of&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>'s original creator making a spiritual successor will be exciting to many, he's not a figure without his fair share of controversy.</p>

<p>He's been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/minecraft-ditches-references-to-notch" rel="nofollow">accused of homophobia, transphobia, misogyny, and other prejudices</a> due to his posts on social media, leading to Mojang <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/notch-excluded-from-minecraft-anniversary-for-comments-and-opinions" rel="nofollow">excluding him</a> from&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>'s tenth anniversary due to his "comments and opinions".</p>

<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>itself, it's going from strength to strength.</p>

<p>It's still the best-selling game of all time, having <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-67105983" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">hit 300 million sales</a> back in 2023, and a number of tie-in projects are in the works, including <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/minecraft-attractions-merlin-entertainments" rel="nofollow">real-life attractions</a>, an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/minecraft-animated-series-netflix" rel="nofollow">animated series</a> on Netflix, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-minecraft-movie-trailer" rel="nofollow">a live-action movie</a>. As far as we're aware, Mojang and Microsoft have no plans for a&nbsp;<em>Minecraft 2&nbsp;</em>of their own.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-cross-9m-capcom-announces.1074738/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-9m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has announced that its&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em>remake has topped another major sales milestone, so it looks like the game is selling solidly.</p>

<p>Back in October, Capcom revealed that&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em>had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-8m" rel="nofollow">broken the eight million sales barrier</a>, and now, according to <a href="https://x.com/dev1_official/status/1876175498398822673" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a new post</a> on social media platform X, the game has topped nine million sales.</p>

<p>That means that in the intervening months,&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em>notched up another million sales or so for itself. To celebrate this latest milestone, Capcom also posted a new piece of artwork that depicts many of&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4</em>'s characters enjoying a surprisingly civil meal together.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-9m-artwork.jpg?itok=NeovxWmN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-9m-artwork.jpg?itok=IwStviWP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Resident Evil 4</em>'s sales milestones are growing increasingly impressive.</figcaption></figure><p>Given that it took&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e240313.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">around six or seven months</a> to amass the million sales needed to take it from seven to eight million, this latest milestone is perhaps even more impressive than previous achievements, too.</p>

<p>The remake was originally released in March 2023, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-hit-3-million-in-just-2-days" rel="nofollow">racking up three million sales</a> in the two days following its launch and swiftly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-top-4-million-mercenaries-mode-now-available" rel="nofollow">reaching four million</a> within just a couple of weeks. The game had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-reach-5-million-capcom-announces" rel="nofollow">hit five million sales</a> by July that year.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with the&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em>remake, it's a reimagining of the influential 2005 action-horror classic, which sees Leon Kennedy descending into a European village in order to rescue Ashley Graham, the US president's daughter, from a sinister cult.</p>

<p>The remake introduces a number of changes and additional elements to the original, including new exploration areas, revamped gameplay that more closely resembles the&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>3&nbsp;</em>remakes, and more.</p>




<p>Our very own Sam gave&nbsp;the&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em>remake an impressive score of 9.5 in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/resident-evil-4-review" rel="nofollow">his review</a>, praising its "fantastic" gameplay improvements and "beautiful" visuals, among other things.</p>
