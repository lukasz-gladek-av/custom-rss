            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-the-veilguard-character-creator-free<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA and BioWare have announced how they're planning to celebrate&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>Day, and the celebrations include a free version of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>'s character creator, plus more.</p>

<p>Over on the official&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.ea.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/da-day-2024" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">blog</a>, EA and BioWare say they're commemorating&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>Day, which falls on December 4th each year, with "several activities", starting with a fourth patch for&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>.</p>

<p>We don't know what's in that patch yet; at time of writing, the <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/patch-4-release-notes" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">link in the blog to the patch notes</a> is dead. Still, hopefully, said patch notes will be updated later in the day, so you'll be able to see what's coming to&nbsp;<em>The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>then.</p>

That's right; starting today, you'll apparently be able to download and try out the full character creator before buying the game.</p>

<p>It's not available at time of writing, but like Patch 4, I'm expecting it'll be made available as the day goes on. You'll be able to try it out on all platforms on which&nbsp;<em>The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>is available.</p>

<p>EA and BioWare say there's no time limit on the Character Creator, either; you can try it out for as long as you like so that you can get the perfect Rook ahead of starting your adventure.</p>

<p>Lastly, BioWare is also gifting every <i>The Veilguard&nbsp;</i>owner with a special set of armor and cosmetics reminiscent of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age 2</em>'s protagonist Hawke. You'll need to download Patch 4 and complete "The Singing Blade" to grab your cosmetics.</p>




<p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>is the latest game in EA and BioWare's&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>series. It sees protagonist Rook attempting to stop two elven gods from conquering the world while also dealing with the machinations of elven trickster Solas.</p>

<p>The game represents <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-gameplay-trailer" rel="nofollow">something of a departure</a> from&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age</em>'s traditional RPG leanings; it's arguably more of an action-adventure game with RPG elements, so if you're a <em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>fan, bear that in mind before you pick it up.</p>
