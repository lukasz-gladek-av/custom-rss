            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/technology/reviews/dxracer-martian-series-review-premium-product-with-few-interesting-twists<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Racing chairs have become synonymous with gaming, with companies like DXRacer releasing a variety of models tailored for fans of these products. With the launch of their new high-end Martian series, we were able to get our hands on it, and we're not looking to go back.</p>

<h2>The Look and Style</h2>

<p>The Martian series is the new top-of-the-line model of DXRacer chair. This chair, sold in a black EPU Leatherette or Woven Fabric, is a more discreet racing chair. You won't find the flashy colors or branding to align with your favorite video game or energy drink of choice, but for a work-from-home lifestyle, I was extremely appreciative of its low-key design.</p>

<p>Unlike other racing chairs I've seen on the market the back of the Martian series has a far more open face, as a tall and large guy, this open face did a lot to combat the sometimes cramped feeling that other racing seat chairs may result in. It feels more like my back is being cupped, as opposed to compressed.</p>

<p>The key features of the DXRacer Martian Series is in the magnetic headrest that is able to be easily attached and detached while remaining in place and supporting your neck, and the various features of this powered chair.</p>

<p>The back piece is extremely firm, so if you enjoy a chair you can sink into, this definitely isn't going to be your first choice, but if you like feeling that firm support, then this will be more up your alley.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dxracer-backrest-airbag.jpg?itok=VQc4wxTC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dxracer-backrest-airbag.jpg?itok=zl0J9D-U 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Buttons on the side move your lumbar support into four different modes.</figcaption></figure><h2>Time to Plug In my Chair</h2>

<p>You heard me right, this chair has a built-in battery that powers the recline of the seat back, the airbag-like lumbar support, and the light up logo on the chair.</p>

<p>Much like you'd expect to have in a car, on the left side of the chair, where the seat meets the back, there is a toggle that you can tilt forward and back to control the rise and fall of the back. Unlike standard desk chairs where tilting up and down is done in increments, the Martian XL lets you smoothly raise and lower as you see fit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The level of precision is such a small thing, but it's extremely nice during the long hours of sitting at your desk when you want to be seated just right.</p>

<p>The other electronic feature of the Martian Series is an airbag lumbar support feature. Here, two thin airbags are situated in the lower-back area of the chair. Using four buttons on the right side of the chair, you can adjust whether the lumbar support is minimized, maximized, more pronounced at the top, or more pronounced at the bottom.</p>

<p>The large positive of this is that the lumbar support is built into the chair directly. It makes the experience feel more like you're just sitting in a chair, as opposed to having a chair and an addon. Unfortunately though, the lumbar support is far more situational. If one of those four presets aren't a good shape or height for you, then this feature will be good but not great.</p>

<p>While a chair with a headrest on elastic bands is going to be more frustrating for your head support, with so much movement, the adjustability of lumbar support on elastic bands gives more freedom of movement while being in a position that once you're settled, it will stay in place.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dxracer-martian-review-wheel-comparison.jpg?itok=vQ3p5uJB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dxracer-martian-review-wheel-comparison.jpg?itok=lhu7Na_E 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Left are the wheels that the DXRacer came with. Luckily, I could swap my rollerblade wheels to my new chair with ease</figcaption></figure><p>The most unfortunate aspect of the DXRacer Martian is the wheels. The wheels that the Martian comes with are unfortunately very basic desk-chair wheels. If you have a plastic mat or a carpet, it will be OK, but if you have wood floors, then you should replace these as soon as you can.</p>

<h2>Assembly Is Simple</h2>

<p>The DXRacer came in a huge box, one I was prepared to spend a lot of time digging through and putting together, but the chair was surprisingly easy to assemble. The large box was a side effect of just how large the seat and back of the chair was.</p>

<p>Opening up the box, you'll receive MASSIVE instructions on how to put it together that are extremely simple to follow. Each screw was pre-screwed into their destination, a very nice touch that allows the user to unscrew and then immediately re-screw the chair into place.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dxracer-martian-review-instructions.jpg?itok=dlxxFdNE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dxracer-martian-review-instructions.jpg?itok=bot3EEVZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Large and simple to understand.</figcaption></figure><p>Even hooking up the battery was an easy process with cables labeled clearly; A to A, B to B, etc. Once the battery and cables were slotted into place, you can cover it all up with fabric that snaps together under the chair.</p>

<p>As for battery life, I've got the chair's charger still sitting on my desk, but at over a month of use, I have yet to need to plug it in. The use of the battery is quite minimal, between the raising and lowering of the chair and altering the lumbar support, but even then I've been impressed.</p>

<h2>DXRacer Martian Series Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>DXRacer really has made a top-of-the-line chair with the Martian. The frame is firm but comfortable, not crushing you in but letting you comfortably sit. The headrest is extremely versatile to cradle your neck no matter where you're sitting, and the powered back lets you perfectly adjust for how you want to sit.</p>

<p>The lumbar support is nice, but isn't as exact in its positioning as the back or headrest, and unfortunately, the wheels are scraping the bottom of the barrel.</p>

<p>If you're going to be spending a long time at your desk and are OK picking up a set of rollerblade wheels to fit into this chair, this is going to be a fantastic and unassuming chair that you'll want to keep for years on end.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/backbone-pro-announcement</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/backbone-announces-backbone-pro-controller-for-any-screen.1181937/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/backbone-pro-announcement<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mobile controller company Backbone has announced the Backbone Pro, a new controller whose stated aim is to let you play on "any screen with a single device".</p>

<p>The controller, which is out now via Backbone's website, is designed for a world in which "more people are playing across platforms than ever before", the company says. It's got two principal modes: Handheld and Wireless.</p>

<p>In Handheld mode, you'll connect the controller to a mobile device via USB-C for "zero latency and no need to charge", while in Wireless mode, the Backbone Pro will connect via Bluetooth. It'll work with devices like phones, tablets, laptops and PCs (with Bluetooth functionality), and VR headsets, as well as smart TVs.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/backbone-pro-controller-fortnite.jpg?itok=0brwFsvY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/backbone-pro-controller-fortnite.jpg?itok=8xRVsaiM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Backbone Pro wants to let you game anywhere with just one controller.</figcaption></figure><p>Not only that, but the controller will come complete with an app that lets you change remembered devices with a single tap, allowing you to switch seamlessly between gaming platforms.</p>

<p>Backbone says it had to "rethink everything" to make the Pro work, "from industrial design to firmware". The company goes on to say that the controller constitutes "one of the most comfortable handheld gaming products ever built".</p>

<p>According to Backbone, the Pro will feature full-size console-style joysticks, and you can remap every single button on the controller, including its back paddles. You can also create specific game profiles and switch between them within the Backbone app.</p>

<p>Rather uniquely, the Backbone Pro also comes with its own "built-in emulator" that will feature a "rotating library of free games" if you sign up to the Backbone Plus subscription service. Backbone doesn't reveal what those games are, though.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/backbone-pro-controller-emulator.jpg?itok=-t-Vh122 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/backbone-pro-controller-emulator.jpg?itok=4uCMBzl0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A retro emulator is included with the Backbone Pro, although we don't know what games will come with it yet.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, since there's a USB-C port on the Backbone Pro, you can also hook it up to your PC for some good old-fashioned wired gaming. Naturally, though, the controller won't work as an Xbox or PlayStation peripheral, nor can you hook it up to your Switch or Switch 2.</p>

<p>The Backbone Pro is available right now via Backbone's website.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ecco the Dolphin Remasters and Brand New Game On the Way]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ecco-dolphin-remasters-new-game</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ecco-the-dolphin-remasters-and-brand-new-game-on-the-way.1181898/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ecco-dolphin-remasters-new-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Ecco the Dolphin&nbsp;</em>creator Ed Annunziata has revealed that remasters of the first two games in the series are on the way, and that a brand new entry in the franchise is also in the works.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/05/xbox-asian-pacific-islander-heritage-month-2025/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">interview</a> as part of Xbox's Asian and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, Annunziata says that remasters of&nbsp;<em>Ecco the Dolphin&nbsp;</em>and its 1994 followup&nbsp;<em>Ecco the Dolphin: The Tides of Time&nbsp;</em>are on the cards, although it's not clear whether work on said remasters has begun yet.</p>

<p>He then says a "new, third game" that features "contemporary play and GPU sensibilities" will be made, although it's not clear whether he means a third modern project or a third&nbsp;<em>Ecco&nbsp;</em>game overall.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ecco-the-dolphin-remasters-new-game-website-countdown.jpg?itok=mKGlFMeC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ecco-the-dolphin-remasters-new-game-website-countdown.jpg?itok=P3-AdhKD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>At time of writing, this is what you see if you visit the&nbsp;<em>Ecco the Dolphin&nbsp;</em>website.</figcaption></figure><p>If it's the latter, then Annunziata is perhaps unfairly skipping over 1995's&nbsp;<em>Ecco Jr.</em>, its rather odd Sega Pico-only sequel, and 2000's Dreamcast game&nbsp;<em>Ecco the Dolphin: Defender of the Future</em>, which was due to get its own sequel before the Dreamcast's demise.</p>

<p>Either way, Annunziata says interested fans should keep an eye on the official&nbsp;<em>Ecco the Dolphin&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.eccothedolphin.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>. At time of writing, said website shows only a counter that seems to promise some kind of announcement or reveal at the end of April next year, counting down around 8,500 hours to do so.</p>

<p>In the interview, Annunziata says he believes that "gamers possess a higher than average IQ" when compared to "the average human". This he puts down to gamers' "socially connected" nature, as well as the fact (as he says) that they're "frequently fully engaged and challenged mentally with real-time systems and information technology".</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Ecco the Dolphin&nbsp;</em>revival will surely bring at least a modicum of joy to those who were hoping that&nbsp;<em>Dolphin Quest</em>, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/intellivision-amico-reveals-new-game-from-ecco-dolphin-team" rel="nofollow">spiritual successor</a> originally touted for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/leaked-intellivision-amico-documents-paint-grim-picture" rel="nofollow">ill-fated</a> Intellivision Amico, would come to fruition. There's a much better chance of&nbsp;<em>Ecco&nbsp;</em>happening than&nbsp;<em>Dolphin Quest</em>, that's for sure.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dolphin-quest-ecco-the-dolphin-team.jpg?itok=W_vhp-6T 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dolphin-quest-ecco-the-dolphin-team.jpg?itok=L9yoNdqR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dolphin Quest&nbsp;</em>probably isn't happening, is it?</figcaption></figure><p><em>Ecco the Dolphin&nbsp;</em>is just one of the many classic IPs Sega is currently in the process of reviving. Others include the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sega-new-virtua-fighter-game" rel="nofollow"><em>Virtua Fighter</em></a>, ninja platformer series&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shinobi-movie-announced" rel="nofollow"><em>Shinobi</em></a>, and wacky arcade racer&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crazy-taxi-reboot-open-world-mmo" rel="nofollow"><em>Crazy Taxi</em></a>.</p>

<p>It's likely we'll get to hear more about the&nbsp;<em>Ecco the Dolphin&nbsp;</em>revival in the coming months, although it's not clear whether the above timer is counting down to a release or just a reveal. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-2m</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-top-2m-in-less-than-two-weeks.1181856/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-2m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Sandfall Interactive and publisher Kepler Interactive have announced that JRPG-inspired adventure&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>has hit another big sales milestone less than two weeks after its initial release.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/expedition33/status/1919701863491838316" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, the two studios reveal that&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>has reached two million sales since its launch in late April. The figure means the game has picked up another million and a half sales since <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-500k" rel="nofollow">very quickly hitting 500,000</a>&nbsp;on launch day.</p>

<p>Sandfall says it's "watched in awe" as players flocked to&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, "feeling every step, every emotion, every revelation" alongside those playing through the&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy</em>-style RPG.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-2m-boss.jpg?itok=USkaGTri 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-2m-boss.jpg?itok=83SgQxfC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Turn-based RPG&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>is selling pretty well.</figcaption></figure><p>As before, the two million figure is particularly impressive when considering that&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>is also available on Game Pass (as part of the PC and Ultimate tiers, at least), so two million people have bought it rather than opting to play it via the subscription service.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, it's a turn-based RPG inspired by the&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>series, and it's also a pretty strong argument against&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>producer Naoki Yoshida's <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/final-fantasy-16-ditched-turn-based-combat-to-appeal-to-younger-generations-producer-says/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">assertions</a> that gamers don't want turn-based games anymore.</p>

<p>The game follows the titular Expedition 33 as it sets out to put an end to the Paintress, a solemn and terrifying figure who paints increasingly low numbers each year, with everyone of the equivalent age perishing as she paints.</p>

<p>It features staples of the JRPG genre like an overworld map with plenty of optional locations to explore, party members that can be swapped out on the fly, and turn-based battles (albeit with real-time elements and a parry system).</p>




<p>If you want to see what all the fuss is about, you can pick up&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1903340/Clair_Obscur_Expedition_33/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/clair-obscur--expedition-33/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/clair-obscur-expedition-33/9ppt8k6gqhrz" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.
