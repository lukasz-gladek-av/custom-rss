            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> gave a first look at a number of additional cards coming to their <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> expansion. Coming hot off the heels of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d136e86e-6c14-4268-bc58-bad86cb9452c" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/discussing-magic-gathering-x-final-fantasy-with-daniel-holt-game-design-lead-for" rel="nofollow"><em>Final Fantasy</em></a>, Avatar: The Last Airbender is another fan favorite IP to get the <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> treatment, most excitedly, this first look also explained how the different types of bending work as game mechanics.</p>

<h2><em>MTG Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> Set Details</h2>

<p><em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> is coming to <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> on November 21st, 2025. It will contain cards that reference events throughout the original Avatar series following Aang, the last airbender on his journey to develop his powers to live up to the name of Avatar and stop the Fire Nation's assault against the world.</p>

<p>There are cards here for the casual fans, all the way down to those who will get a chuckle out of that one guy who got so excited to see the Avatar he began to foam at the mouthâ€¦</p>

</ul><h2><em>MTG Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> Legal</h2>

<p>It was outlined that all of the cards that have the <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> set code of TLA will be legal in all formats, and those with TLE will be commander, legacy, and vintage legal. In addition, any individual TLE cards are legal where already available in other formats.</p>

<h2>Bending Mechanics | <em>MTG x ATLA</em></h2>

<p>A unique aspect of the story of <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> is in the bending mechanics, where characters can be born with the ability to manipulate Water, Earth, Air, and Fire. These mechanics are coming to <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> with card abilities that invoke bending those elements.</p>

<h3><em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Waterbending</h3>

<p>Waterbending allows you to set a base power and toughness across your field. In <em>Katara, Water Tribe's Hope,</em> we see that by using Waterbending Katara can "allow for creatures you control to have a base power and toughness X/X until end of turn."</p>

<p>With a strong amount of mana on your bench this could allow you to take normally weak creatures and buff them to deal big damage all at once. The ability also mentions "you can tap your artifacts and creatures to help. Each one pays for 1 mana."</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mtg-avatar-preview-waterbending-and-earthbending.jpg?itok=yIzo9-X1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mtg-avatar-preview-waterbending-and-earthbending.jpg?itok=PQU0AWP6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h3><em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Earthbending</h3>

<p>Earthbending lets you turn your lands into land creatures for as long as they survive. Much like an Earthbender, like <em>Toph, the First Metalbender</em> was able to hurl rocks you can activate Earthbending to turn your land into a 0/0 creature and add two +1/+1 tokens to it.</p>

<p>Thematically, this makes sense, and there couldn't have been any other way to adapt this ability to the mechanics of <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>. Additionally, if that land dies or is exiled it just goes back to being a land.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Airbending</h3>

<p>Airbending is interesting in that it pays very close attention to the pacifist nature of the Airbenders in that it "helps you control the board without getting violent."</p>

<p>Our example of Airbending is <em>Appa, Steadfast Guardian</em>. On entry you can airbend any of your non-land permanents by exiling them. To bring them back you pay 2 mana and when you cast a spell in this way Appa, Steadfast Guardian allows you to create a 1/1 white Ally creature token.</p>

<p>Definitely a more complex mechanic, forcing you to take things off the board and bring them back to bolster up your defences.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mtg-avatar-preview-airbending-and-firebending.jpg?itok=3BhoKTC2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mtg-avatar-preview-airbending-and-firebending.jpg?itok=eWcyAna4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h3><em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Firebending</h3>

<p>Firebending is all about aggression and giving yourself a number of additional fire mana for use in Combat. <em>Fire Lord Zuko</em> lets him create X fire mana representative of his current power, while <em>Fire Lord Sozen</em> creates a standard 3.</p>

<p>This red mana is only around for as long as combat, but with Enchantment's like <em>Fated Firepower,</em> you can immediately capitalize on it.</p>

<h2>Special Card Treatments</h2>

<p>It wouldn't be a new Magic The Gathering set without some unique art treatments. Some specific artwork that was called out includes the Borderless Raised Foil <em>Avatar Aang</em> with art by series creator, Bryan Konietzko. There will also be Borderless Double-Faced Sagas like <em>The Rise of Sozen</em>, Borderless Field Notes like <em>Momo, Friendly Flyer</em>, Elemental Frame Cards like <em>Redirect Lightning </em>and <em>Katara, Water Tribe's Hope</em>.</p>

These will depict "various moments during Aang's journey."</p>
