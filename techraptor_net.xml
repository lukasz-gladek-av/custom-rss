            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo's acting a bit sus, because this new announcement came out of nowhere. A social deduction game, set within the&nbsp;<em>Fire Emblem&nbsp;</em>universe? It's called&nbsp;<em>Fire Emblem Shadows</em>, and it's out literally now.</p>

<p>A press release from Nintendo Japan announces&nbsp;<em>Fire Emblem Shadows,</em>&nbsp;a brand new mobile-exclusive title with role-playing elements, as well as social deduction -- common games in such a genre include&nbsp;<em>Werewolf, Mafia</em>, or much more recently,&nbsp;<em>Among Us.&nbsp;</em>It's out today, but as of writing not yet available to download on iOS.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2025/250925.html" rel="nofollow">The press release</a> goes into little detail on gameplay other than that gameplay revolves around three players. Two players take the role as a "disciple of light" while another works against them as the "disciple of shadow." The ultimate goal is to traverse a labyrinth or uncover the imposter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The press release continues to be vague on the details, but it mentions an "initial battle" that, after completing, players will vote for the supposed disciple of shadow. Depending on if your guess is right seems to have an outcome on the following battle. Again, there isn't much information battles beyond that.</p>

<p>From a story and lore perspective, it will be interesting to see if&nbsp;<em>Fire Emblem Shadows</em>&nbsp;is set in the universe of an existing game such as<em>&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/fire-emblem-three-houses" rel="nofollow">Three Houses</a></em>, or if it's standalone and wholly original. The fact that there's an "imposter" reminds me of&nbsp;<em>Fire Emblem: Three Houses' </em>own elusive group of imposters, Those Who Slither in the Dark.</p>

<p>It stands to reason it may be a part of the&nbsp;<em>Fire Emblem: Three Houses</em>&nbsp;universe given that the recently announced&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-september-2025-recap" rel="nofollow"><em>Fire Emblem: Fortune's Weave</em></a>&nbsp;is set in the same universe, but we'll definitely find out more when it's available on&nbsp;</p>

<p>The press release says it is free to play, but there are in-game purchases, so cosmetics seem likely.&nbsp;The good news is, the release for&nbsp;<em>Fire Emblem Shadows</em>&nbsp;is September 25, 2025 on iOS and Android, so by the time you're reading this, it's probably already be out. I have word it's on Android already, so soon we'll all be diving into the abyss.</p>
