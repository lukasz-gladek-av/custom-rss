            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Shiro Games has released a brand new&nbsp;<em>Wartales&nbsp;</em>roadmap covering the rest of 2025, and there's plenty on the way this year, including DLC that will let you build and manage your very own fiefdom.</p>

<p>Back in February, Shiro revealed its roadmap for&nbsp;<em>Wartales&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wartales-roadmap-2025" rel="nofollow">for the first half of the year</a>, and now, it's time to discover what lies in wait throughout the remainder of 2025, starting with a major community update this very month.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1527950/view/537733876590575648" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on Steam, the update, which is set to arrive at the end of July, will bring new Tier 5 armor and weaponry, as well as a new notification log, 20 new traits, and 40 new confessions, some of which are "unique confessions" that have been "written specifically for unique characters you may recruit".</p>

You'll be able to build and expand said fief, rule over your subjects, and construct districts, all while tending to the needs of your population.</p>

<p>Doing so will involve not only making decisions about the lives of your subjects, but also producing and procuring resources for the healthy maintenance of your lands, all of which will shape the "identity of your fief", as Shiro puts it.</p>

<p>In future, two different kinds of DLC will be produced by Shiro, namely Expansions and Contracts. The former are large-scale additions that bring new regions, storylines, or factions to the game, while the latter are slightly smaller addons with new systems or "modular content that enhances replayability".</p>

<p>To that end, at some point in the fourth quarter of the year, a new&nbsp;<em>Wartales&nbsp;</em>DLC pack will arrive that adds a new region and a new storyline, so under the new system, that'll be an Expansion rather than a Contract.</p>




<p>You can grab&nbsp;<em>Wartales&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1527950/Wartales/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/wartales/9nwq686jb33g" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/wartales-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Oblivion Remastered Studio Virtuos Reportedly Laying Off Hundreds of Employees]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Virtuos, the studio behind this year's&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remaster and the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater&nbsp;</em>remake, is reportedly about to lay off hundreds of its employees.</p>

<p>According to a report by journalist <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gautoz.cool/post/3lu3ntewdrk2t" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gauthier Andres</a>, around 300 employees' jobs are at risk at Virtuos, constituting around 7% of the studio's overall workforce. These layoffs will mostly be concentrated in the Chinese branch of Virtuos, but employees in "many other areas" are at risk too, Andres says.</p>

<p>Supposedly, these employees are being laid off in the name of "competitiveness", or so Andres says a memo sent to employees a few weeks ago reads. These layoffs reportedly follow payrise freezes and bonus reductions at Virtuos in February.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/oblivion-remaster-virtuos-layoffs-archer.jpg?itok=oDsJPF8q 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/oblivion-remaster-virtuos-layoffs-archer.jpg?itok=CC7XYAmD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Despite its success,&nbsp;<em>Oblivion Remastered&nbsp;</em>developer Virtuos has apparently been hit by layoffs.</figcaption></figure><p>Andres also says that Virtuos employees have told him the company is ramping up its interest in generative AI; employees have reportedly received "basic but mandatory training" on AI in the last year.</p>

<p>According to Andres, Virtuos is "losing the trust" of many of its staff members, and while he doesn't directly tie that loss of morale to the threat of AI, it's hard not to draw a link between the two, especially when that's reportedly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/king-ai-replacement-morale-layoffs" rel="nofollow">exactly what's happening at other studios</a>.</p>

<p>Virtuos' layoffs come as part of a wider industry layoff wave that has been going on for the past few years, with tens of thousands of industry employees losing their jobs, as well as major studios being closed down and huge projects being canceled.</p>

<p>This month alone, Microsoft <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" rel="nofollow">reportedly laid off around 9,000 of its employees</a>, and Xbox canceled projects in development at its subsidiary studios; both <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">Rare's&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">Everwild</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">The Initiative's&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">Perfect Dark</a>&nbsp;</em>were shut down, and the latter studio closed its doors as well.</p>

Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Subnautica 2 Lawsuit Revealed as Krafton Reportedly Extends Bonus Period]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/subnautica-2-lawsuit-krafton-bonus</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/subnautica-2-lawsuit-revealed-as-krafton-reportedly-extends-bonus-period.1245990/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Charlie Cleveland and his fellow Unknown Worlds co-founders have released the public text of their&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>lawsuit, and it comes just as publisher Krafton reportedly extends its employee bonus period to cover 2026.</p>

<p>As a quick reminder, Krafton, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pubg-owner-krafton-buys-subnautica-dev-unknown-worlds" rel="nofollow">the parent company</a> of&nbsp;<em>Subnautica </em>studio Unknown Worlds,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/subnautica-2-delayed-2026" rel="nofollow">recently delayed</a>&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2</em>'s Early Access release&nbsp;into 2026. The announcement of the game's delay was made shortly after original Unknown Worlds founders Cleveland, Max McGuire, and Ted Gill were ousted from the company.</p>

<p>In response to their ousting and&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2</em>'s delay, Cleveland and his fellow co-founders <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/subnautica-charlie-cleveland-lawsuit" rel="nofollow">pledged to sue Krafton</a>, claiming not only that the game was ready for Early Access but also that Krafton delayed it in order to avoid paying out a potentially large bonus to employees if a 2025 revenue target was met.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/subnautica-2-lawsuit-krafton-fish.jpg?itok=CP0P78d8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/subnautica-2-lawsuit-krafton-fish.jpg?itok=kN4gRjKy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Charlie Cleveland and company's&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>lawsuit (or, at least, the public version of it) has been released to the public.</figcaption></figure><p>Now, Cleveland has once again taken to social media in order to release a <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/889109175/Fortis-Advisors-v-Krafton-via-Aftermath" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">redacted public version</a> of the lawsuit against Krafton. It's a lengthy legal document, but in essence, Cleveland, Gill, and McGuire are suing Krafton for breach of contract with specific reference to the payout.</p>

<p>The three are alleging that Krafton deliberately delayed&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>in order to avoid paying $25 million of a $250 million bonus to Unknown Worlds employees, and that this is also why the three were dismissed from their positions at Unknown Worlds.</p>

<p>In a move that might muddy the waters somewhat, however, Krafton is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-15/krafton-extends-subnautica-2-bonus-period-is-sued-by-founders" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reportedly</a> extending the bonus payout window to cover 2026, and it's also apparently planning to advance part of the 2026 bonus pool to employees by the end of 2025.</p>

<p>If this move goes ahead, it sounds to me like it might invalidate a large part of Cleveland's claim, although I'm not a legal expert. We'll just have to wait and see what happens next, but as many lawsuits do, this process may well drag on for a while yet.</p>




<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>itself, it's currently due for launch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1962700/Subnautica_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/subnautica-2/9PJPCB188SVG" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> sometime next year. Of course, there's every chance it could be delayed until 2027, in which case the aforementioned bonus extension would cease to matter, but that's too far in the future for us to meaningfully speculate on.</p>
