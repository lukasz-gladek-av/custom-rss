<p>Twisted Pixel and Sanzaru's shutdown are likely part of plans Meta apparently has to cut roughly 10% of the employees in its Reality Labs business, which works primarily on VR and AR content, as reported by the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/12/technology/meta-layoffs-reality-labs.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">New York Times</a>.</p><p>That would include both studios; Twisted Pixel's last game was <em>Marvel's Deadpool VR</em>, released last year, while Sanzaru's most recent titles are both in the <em>Asgard's Wrath </em>series, which was created for VR headsets.</p><p>According to the New York Times' report, these cuts are part of a general shift in terms of Meta's direction, with the company now planning to focus more of its resources into the development of AI systems.</p><p>Generative AI has proven to be a controversial subject in the gaming industry, with some major companies <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-hopes-to-use-generative-ai-to-drive-more-monetization-and-make-development-30-more" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="746600ea-ef36-4d95-b141-ab37281d9e3e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">embracing the technology</a> while others <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hooded-horse-no-gen-ai-contracts" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4bf049e2-a4f8-41a0-b834-8030bfbcc977" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">excoriate it</a> for its environmental impact and the (perceived) poor quality of the assets it generates.</p><figure role="group">

<p>The bonus path in question is called Frostfire, and it's launching a week later than the extension update on January 27th. It'll include extra rewards for both the free and paid paths of the Battle Pass.</p><p>You can complete this path alongside the main Season 1 route as well, so you don't need to worry about whether you're accruing XP for one or the other; they'll both progress beside one another.</p><p>Additionally, there won't be any Bonus Challenges for the Frostfire path; unlike previous bonus paths, everything you need to unlock things from Frostfire will be earnable through weekly challenges.</p><p>If you're unfamiliar, <em>Battlefield 6 </em>is the latest entry in the <em>Battlefield </em>series of first-person shooters. It reintroduces a single-player campaign alongside the game's signature <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/battlefield-6-multiplayer-preview-all-out-warfare-in-mirak-valley-and-operation" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="8fe7fb4f-a8e0-4370-b310-d3c060efd9ab" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">multiplayer gameplay</a>, which features a number of tweaks and changes compared to <em>Battlefield 2042</em>.</p>
