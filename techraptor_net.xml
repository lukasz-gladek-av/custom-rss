This week,&nbsp;<em>World of Warcraft Classic&nbsp;</em>players got a chance to experience that very same plague anew.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/1hkxzs5/looks_like_we_are_going_back_to_2005_someone_in/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Redditor Lightstruckx</a> (via <a href="https://massivelyop.com/2024/12/26/wow-classic-players-manage-to-recreate-the-infamous-corrupted-blood-event/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Massively Overpowered</a>), players on&nbsp;<em>Classic</em>'s Season of Discovery server managed to recreate Corrupted Blood a few days ago, carrying the eponymous debuff into the Alliance capital of Stormwind City, where it proceeded to decimate the population just like the first time.</p>

<p>Lightstruckx's accompanying video shows exactly the kind of carnage you'd expect from Corrupted Blood; players are taking periodic damage ticks from the debuff and dropping like flies as healers fail to outpace the relentless disease.</p>

<p>Of course, I hope this doesn't happen for the sake of everyone who's managed to build up a treasure trove of loot and gear in hardcore mode, but on the other hand, I can't deny it'd be fun to watch.</p>

<p>In case you aren't familiar, the Corrupted Blood incident happened back in 2005. Hakkar the Soulflayer, a boss in the Zul'Gurub raid, inflicted a debuff on players called Corrupted Blood, which caused their health to tick down periodically.</p>

<p>While players themselves couldn't carry the debuff out of Zul'Gurub, their pets could, and adventurers quickly found that resummoning their deactivated pets outside of the raid would cause Corrupted Blood to be applied in areas it should never have appeared in.</p>

<p>Sadly, the scope and breadth of the original Corrupted Blood incident isn't likely to be repeated today; Blizzard is far more vigilant about such things than it once was. Still, it's almost nostalgic to see this disease murdering player after player yet again, so many years later.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-forest-steam-player-count-record</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-forest-hits-new-steam-player-record-ten-years-after-early-access-release.1069425/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-forest-steam-player-count-record<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Open-world survival-crafter&nbsp;<em>The Forest&nbsp;</em>has hit a new concurrent Steam player count record a full ten years after the game's original release in Early Access, and it's all thanks to the ongoing Steam Winter Sale.</p>

<p>A quick look at&nbsp;<em>The Forest</em>'s <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/242760/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB page</a>&nbsp;shows that the game is currently sitting at a rather impressive 91,370 players on Steam, and that its 24-hour peak player count is 98,323, which also happens to be its all-time peak.</p>

<p>Interest in the game has been steadily climbing since the Steam Winter Sale started last week, and it's not hard to see why; you can currently grab&nbsp;<em>The Forest&nbsp;</em>at a whopping 90% off. That's right: the game will set you back only $2 at time of writing.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-forest-steam-player-count-record-sale.jpg?itok=RM-nzIqS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-forest-steam-player-count-record-sale.jpg?itok=Rox0qTUp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Forest&nbsp;</em>is currently on sale at a deep, deep discount.</figcaption></figure><p>Not only has&nbsp;<em>The Forest</em>'s player count skyrocketed, but the game has also attracted almost <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/242760/The_Forest/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">13,000 recent reviews</a> at time of writing, and they are, of course, overwhelmingly positive.</p>

<p>Admittedly, many of the reviews are essentially one-liners or memes rather than genuine assessments of the game, but still, it's clear that&nbsp;<em>The Forest&nbsp;</em>has the kind of staying power many indie games can only dream of.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Sony doesn't make its PS4 player metrics public, so we don't know how many people are enjoying the game on console right now. Still,&nbsp;<em>The Forest&nbsp;</em>isn't on sale on Sony's machine, so if you want to enjoy it for an absolute pittance, you're best off on PC.</p>




<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>The Forest&nbsp;</em>is, it's a horror-themed open-world survival-crafter that sees you "in a mysterious forest battling to stay alive against a society of cannibalistic mutants".</p>

<p>The game can be enjoyed either solo or in multiplayer co-op, and if you're of a squeamish persuasion, you might want to recruit a friend to survive with, because&nbsp;<em>The Forest&nbsp;</em>can get pretty scary.</p>

<p><em>The Forest&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/242760/The_Forest/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP0238-CUSA12398_00-THEFOREST0000000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS4</a> (and PS5 via backwards compatibility). Sequel&nbsp;<em>Sons of the Forest</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sons-of-forest-10-patch-notes" rel="nofollow">hit its 1.0 release</a> in February, is also available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1326470/Sons_Of_The_Forest/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, and it's currently up for grabs at 50% off as well.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metaphor-refantazio-director-says-no-plans-for-series-sort-of.1069416/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metaphor-refantazio-director-no-plans-series<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio&nbsp;</em>director and Studio Zero head Katsura Hashino has revealed some rather disappointing news regarding the potential future of what we might have called the&nbsp;<em>Metaphor&nbsp;</em>series.</p>

<p>In a new interview with Famitsu (via <a href="https://personacentral.com/metaphor-refantazio-director-future-development/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Persona Central</a> and Japanese gaming news leaker <a href="http://ryokutya2089.com/archives/82367" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ryokutya2089</a>), Hashino says that there are no "concrete plans" to make&nbsp;<em>Metaphor&nbsp;</em>into a series, although he hopes that this will happen someday.</p>

<p>Rather confusingly, however, Hashino also says that development on&nbsp;<em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>&nbsp;began with a view to making "a third JRPG series alongside&nbsp;<em>Shin Megami Tensei&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Persona</em>", so presumably, either the scope of the project changed or Atlus decided against this direction.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metaphor-refantazio-sequel-director-comments-strohl.jpg?itok=g5jPjzmH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metaphor-refantazio-sequel-director-comments-strohl.jpg?itok=bKD8J9eH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Quite right, Strohl.</figcaption></figure><p>We can assume that if there are no plans to make&nbsp;<em>Metaphor&nbsp;</em>into a series, that also means there isn't currently a&nbsp;<em>Metaphor: ReFantazio 2&nbsp;</em>in the works, although that doesn't mean Studio Zero isn't working on something entirely different, of course.</p>

<p>Hoshino says that if a sequel were to be made, he might "decide that the best setting for a future [<em>Metaphor</em>] title is the Sengoku period", which, he says jokingly, would create "a JRPG with a world like the&nbsp;<em>Basara&nbsp;</em>series".</p>

<p>He's almost certainly referring here to Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Sengoku Basara&nbsp;</em>games, hack-and-slash action titles which have a rather spotty history of Western localization. One can only imagine that this might mean a Sengoku-set&nbsp;<em>Metaphor&nbsp;</em>game could struggle to get the localization nod as well.</p>

<p>If a&nbsp;<em>Metaphor: ReFantazio&nbsp;</em>sequel is, indeed, not currently in the works, that would come as a surprise from a business perspective at the very least; after all, the JRPG <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metaphor-refantazio-sales-1m-already" rel="nofollow">managed to rack up a million sales in just a few hours</a>, so a sequel seems like a no-brainer for Sega and Atlus.</p>




<p>Of course, if a sequel is in the works, it wouldn't be the first time a major Japanese developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-2-not-happening-fromsoftware" rel="nofollow">apparently openly lied</a> about <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-2025" rel="nofollow">not creating more games</a> in a series anytime soon. We can only hope.</p>

<p><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2679460/Metaphor_ReFantazio/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/metaphor-refantazio/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/metaphor-refantazio" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/11-bit-studios-ceo-teases-two-new-projects-explains-project-8-shutdown.1069401/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/11-bit-studios-project-8-shutdown-new-projects<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>11 bit studios CEO&nbsp;Przemysław Marszał has provided some more context regarding the studio's recent cancellation of its story-based, console-focused game&nbsp;<em>Project 8</em>, and he's also teased two new projects in the works at the studio.</p>

<p>In an interview with Polish publication <a href="https://biznes.pap.pl/wiadomosci/firmy/11-bit-studios-rozpoczelo-prace-nad-dwiema-grami-nie-planuje-emisji-akcji-wywiad" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PAP Biznes</a> (via <a href="https://gameworldobserver.com/2024/12/25/games-industry-severe-crisis-11-bit-studios-ceo" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Game World Observer</a>),&nbsp;Marszał says that the gaming industry is "going through a severe crisis" at the moment, and that 2024 was a tough year for 11 bit "in some areas".</p>

<p>As a reminder, 11 bit revealed the cancellation of&nbsp;<em>Project 8&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/11-bit-studios-layoffs-project-8" rel="nofollow">last week</a>, along with a reduction in staff that would see several of the project's developers laid off. Others, however, would apparently be reallocated to other 11 bit projects.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/11-bit-studios-project-8-cancellation-ceo-comments.jpg?itok=0fcecYBN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/11-bit-studios-project-8-cancellation-ceo-comments.jpg?itok=1rQfOnOh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>11 bit studios recently canceled&nbsp;<em>Project 8</em>, calling the project too risky to continue with.</figcaption></figure><p>In the PAP Biznes interview,&nbsp;Marszał says that&nbsp;<em>Project 8</em>'s reference points would have included the likes of Ninja Theory's&nbsp;<em>Senua&nbsp;</em>games, as well as the&nbsp;<em>Plague Tale&nbsp;</em>series; specifically, the gameplay would have been more similar to the latter than the former.</p>

<p>However,&nbsp;Marszał reiterates that he believes the market has changed since&nbsp;<em>Project 8&nbsp;</em>began development, and that games like the aforementioned titles aren't doing particularly well in the current climate.</p>

<p>He says that&nbsp;<em>Project 8&nbsp;</em>was suffering from a number of issues both big and small, and that correcting them would have required more development time than management was comfortable with, so the game was shelved.</p>

<p>Marszał also reveals two new 11 bit studios projects, although he doesn't go into detail about either of them. The first is a 25-developer project with a smaller budget that's targeting a 2027 release, while the second will be "bigger" and take around "four years" for production.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/11-bit-studios-the-alters_0.jpg?itok=Uw2q529R 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/11-bit-studios-the-alters_0.jpg?itok=AIZMvMLX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>One of 11 bit studios' next projects will reportedly be on a similar level to the upcoming&nbsp;<em>The Alters</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>According to&nbsp;Marszał, 11 bit is also about to announce a change in its publishing strategy, which the CEO says is a "direct consequence" of its experience in this area so far.</p>

<p>To remind you, the studio doesn't just publish its own games; it's also a third-party publisher, with games like surreal adventure&nbsp;<em>Indika</em>, sci-fi head-scratcher&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/invincible" rel="nofollow"><em>The Invincible</em></a>, and CRPG&nbsp;<em>The Thaumaturge&nbsp;</em>being some of the games on its publishing slate.</p>

<p>In any case, it sounds like both of the newly-revealed 11 bit projects are still a little ways away from being ready, so it might be a while before we hear what they are. Stay tuned for more.</p>
