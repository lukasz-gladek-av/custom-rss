            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/beyond-two-souls-tv-series<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A&nbsp;<em>Beyond: Two Souls&nbsp;</em>TV series is in production, with star Elliot Page's production company Pageboy Productions set to develop the adaptation, although it's unclear whether Page himself will star or not.</p>

<p>Per a Deadline <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/01/beyond-two-souls-video-game-television-series-elliot-page-pageboy-1236267129/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, the adaptation is currently in early development, and it's expected to follow the same storyline as the game, which tracks Page's Jodie as she comes to terms with the supernatural powers that allow her to see and communicate with a mysterious entity known as Aiden.</p>

<p>Page says that&nbsp;<em>Beyond: Two Souls&nbsp;</em>represented "one of the most challenging and fulfilling acting experiences of [his] career", and that the goal is to "create a unique vision of the characters" in what he describes as a story with "rich narrative and emotional depth".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/beyond-two-souls-jodie-nathan.jpg?itok=bsgGXn04 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/beyond-two-souls-jodie-nathan.jpg?itok=Zf7AinW2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Beyond: Two Souls&nbsp;</em>is set for a TV adaptation.</figcaption></figure><p>Alongside Page as Jodie, the game also starred Willem Dafoe as paranormal scientist Nathan Dawkins, a researcher working to understand the nature of Jodie's powers.</p>

<p>Deadline's report doesn't state whether Page or Dafoe will be returning to star; the production is still fairly early on in development, so it's possible that actors haven't been cast yet.</p>

<p>Quantic Dream's David Cage says he's "absolutely thrilled" to be working with Page on the&nbsp;<em>Beyond: Two Souls&nbsp;</em>TV show, and that Page "has all the talent and instinct to make it something really unique on TV".</p>

<p>Whether Page himself is as thrilled to be working with Cage is less clear. Back in 2015, it was <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ellen-page-explored-legal-action-154256357.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reported</a>&nbsp;(note: this article is several years old and uses Page's deadname) that he explored legal action following his discovery that Quantic Dream had made a fully rendered nude model of his in-game character without his permission.</p>




<p>As for what's next for Quantic Dream, the studio, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/quantic-dream-acquired-by-netease" rel="nofollow">acquired by Chinese gaming giant NetEase</a> in 2022, is currently developing adventure game&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Eclipse</em>.</p>

<p>Announced during the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-announcement-from-game-awards-2021" rel="nofollow">2021 Game Awards</a>, the studio has been relatively silent about the game since; it still has no release date or even vague release window, so it's likely to be some time before we hear from it again.</p>

<p>That's also true about the&nbsp;<em>Beyond: Two Souls&nbsp;</em>TV show, given how early in production it apparently is. Stay tuned for more on that, and in the meantime, you can check the game out right now on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/beyond-two-souls/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS4</a> (and PS5 via backwards compatibility) and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/960990/Beyond_Two_Souls/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/japanese-nintendo-switch-eshop-payment-crackdown<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced that starting later this year, you'll no longer be able to use overseas-issued payment cards or PayPal accounts in order to pay for content from the Japanese Switch eShop.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://support.nintendo.com/jp/information/2025/0130.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">notice</a> on the Japanese Nintendo website (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/switchs-japan-eshop-will-no-longer-accept-foreign-cards-or-paypal-to-prevent-fraudulent-use/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">VGC</a>), the gaming giant says that in order to "prevent fraudulent use" (we're using machine translation for the post, which is originally in Japanese", overseas-issued cards and PayPal accounts will be banned.</p>

<p>It looks as though PayPal accounts opened in Japan, as well as Japan-issued credit cards, will still be valid. Unfortunately, though, if you've been using the Japanese eShop from outside Japan, it looks like you might have to find a new payment method.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-eshop-japanese-payment-crackdown.jpg?itok=RWrI0Juv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-eshop-japanese-payment-crackdown.jpg?itok=uUO1bQMx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll have to pick a different payment method for the Japanese eShop in future.</figcaption></figure><p>It's common for Switch players to buy their games from the Japanese eShop, either to circumvent what they see as poor exchange rates or to get games that they can't get in their native countries.</p>

<p>Nintendo's reference to "fraudulent" behavior might be a veiled nod to this practice; it might seem relatively harmless to me, but Nintendo is well-known for what could charitably called <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-lawsuit-patents-demands-nintendo" rel="nofollow">"fiercely protecting its products"</a>, so I wouldn't be surprised if that was the reasoning.</p>

<p>So, what does this mean for you if you're a frequent user of the Japanese eShop? Well, it means you'll need to find some way of using a Japan-issued payment method if you want to continue, unfortunately.</p>

<p>This decision shouldn't affect your country's native eShop, and it also likely won't change anything if you're already using a Japanese payment method to access the eShop.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-handheld-mode.jpg?itok=Oa1ZSUGg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-handheld-mode.jpg?itok=numsHrxt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nintendo is currently gearing up for the release of the Switch 2.</figcaption></figure><p>Earlier this month, Nintendo <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">officially announced the Switch's successor</a>, putting an end to months of speculation and leaks regarding the device's appearance.</p>

<p>We still don't know what kind of specs the machine will have, though; we'll have to wait until April's forthcoming Nintendo Direct in order to learn that.</p>

<p>Still, with a new device coming, perhaps it's no wonder Nintendo is tightening its rules a little. Stay tuned for more. In the meantime, the Japanese eShop payment crackdown takes effect on March 25th.</p>
