            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-rumble-global-release-delayed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega has announced that upcoming free-to-play battle royale-style party game&nbsp;<em>Sonic Rumble&nbsp;</em>has been delayed, and the studio hasn't announced a new release date for the game either.</p>

<p>The game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-rumble-release-date" rel="nofollow">originally due to launch</a> on May 8th, but in <a href="https://x.com/Sonic_Rumble/status/1917453885326688412" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post on X</a>, Sega says it's made the "difficult decision" to delay the game's release indefinitely. The studio says it wants to "build the kind of high-quality, long-lasting&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>game" its players deserve.</p>

<p>Sega says it knows the news of <i>Sonic Rumble</i>'s delay will be "disappointing" to fans, but that it thinks taking the extra time to work on the game is the "right choice for the future of&nbsp;<em>Sonic Rumble</em>".</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Sonic Rumble</em>, it's a&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys</em>-esque free-to-play battle royale party game coming to PC and mobile...well, at some point in the near future, apparently.</p>

<p>The game comes with a range of modes, including a classic-style Run mode, which sees players racing against one another, as well as Ring Battle and more.</p>

<p>Sega says the game has been designed with shorter games in mind, ensuring that anyone can pick up and play&nbsp;<em>Sonic Rumble&nbsp;</em>"in their spare time".</p>




<p>As you'd probably expect, a range of&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>characters will be available for you to play as, including Sonic himself (naturally), as well as Shadow, Tails, Amy, and many more.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Sonic Rumble&nbsp;</em>when it launches at some point in the future on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2951690/Sonic_Rumble/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sega.sonicrumble&amp;hl=en_GB" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Android</a>, and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ph/app/sonic-rumble/id6511215584" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">iOS</a>. Hopefully, Sega will announce a new&nbsp;<em>Sonic Rumble&nbsp;</em>release date sometime soon, so stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sea-of-stars-throes-of-watchmaker-dlc-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Sabotage Studio has announced the release date for the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Sea of Stars&nbsp;</em>DLC&nbsp;<em>Throes of the Watchmaker</em>, which, as a reminder, is completely free for everyone who plays the game.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://x.com/seaofstarsgame/status/1917581893056303123" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, the DLC, which was revealed in January this year, will be launching across all platforms on May 20th, bringing with it around eight hours of new stuff to enjoy after the ending of&nbsp;<em>Sea of Stars</em>' main storyline.</p>

<p>Sabotage says&nbsp;<em>Throes of the Watchmaker&nbsp;</em>will be based around "a self-contained progression loop" that will offer new classes, skills, and combos for both Zale and Valere to use.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sea-of-stars-throes-of-the-watchmaker-dlc-release-date-characters.jpg?itok=2Y-75KpT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sea-of-stars-throes-of-the-watchmaker-dlc-release-date-characters.jpg?itok=gA1c1FQo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Sea of Stars</em>'&nbsp;<em>Throes of the Watchmaker&nbsp;</em>DLC will be coming in May.</figcaption></figure><p>You'll also discover "never-before-seen areas, puzzles and enemies" across a "compelling storyline wholly unique from <em>Sea of Stars</em>’ core adventure", so you won't need to remember how the ending of the original game went.</p>

<p><em>Throes of the Watchmaker&nbsp;</em>will boast a new soundtrack composed by&nbsp;<em>Sea of Stars</em>' Eric W. Brown, and it'll also see&nbsp;<em>Chrono Trigger&nbsp;</em>composer Yasunori Mitsuda return "as a guest composer".</p>

<p>In story terms, you'll be exploring the clockwork world of Horloge, a land created by the titular Watchmaker (who's also the originator of the in-game Wheels minigame in&nbsp;<em>Sea of Stars</em>' lore). Zael and Valere must adapt to Horloge's unusual rules if they're to put a stop to the "cursed carnival" that is terrorizing the land.</p>

<p>In keeping with the carnival theme, Zael and Valere will also be ditching their signature weapons; Zael will put down his sword and take up juggling, while Valere will drop her staff for a new acrobatic combat style.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Sea of Stars</em>, it's a turn-based RPG inspired by JRPG classics like&nbsp;<em>Chrono Trigger</em>. Released in 2023, the game sees Eclipse magicians Zael and Valere setting out on an epic journey to stop an evil figure known as the Fleshmancer.</p>
