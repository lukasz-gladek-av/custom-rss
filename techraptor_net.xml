            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/orcs-must-die-deathtrap-roadmap<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Robot Entertainment has revealed the post-launch&nbsp;<em>Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap&nbsp;</em>roadmap, and it includes a new War Mage, a new enemy type, and much more.</p>

<p>The game, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/orcs-must-die-deathtrap-announcement" rel="nofollow">announced last year</a>, launched for PC and Xbox Series X|S today, but Robot Entertainment isn't resting on its laurels. The developer took to Steam earlier today to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2273980/view/533214336538116486" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">share its vision</a> for where&nbsp;<em>Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap&nbsp;</em>will go in the future.</p>

<p>In the post, Robot Entertainment organizes forthcoming updates into two categories: In the Works and Coming "Soon", and "The Road Ahead". It's probably not too difficult to guess what each category represents.</p>

Deathtrap&nbsp;</em>has barely been out a few hours, but its developer has already shared the game's post-launch plans.</figcaption></figure><p>In the former category, Robot Entertainment promises a new War Mage in the form of Master Gabriella, who's appeared in previous&nbsp;<em>Orcs Must Die!&nbsp;</em>games as well. She'll have "an exciting kit of tricks" and will reintroduce Arcane magic into the game.</p>

<p>Next up, the Resort Canal map will ask you to defend two rifts simultaneously, and it'll take place in the game's Coastal biome. You can also look forward to a new Unstable Orc enemy, which takes a great deal of punishment before it dies to compensate for its slow movement.</p>

<p>Rounding out the Coming Soon category are an Alchemy lab, which will offer you buffs for each run, and a new Gnome Balloonist Sentinel, which will "add more ceiling space for traps".</p>

<p>As for the road ahead, Robot Entertainment says it plans to support&nbsp;<em>Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap&nbsp;</em>"for as long as possible", and that the studio has "ideas for a wide variety of content and features".</p>




<p><em>Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap&nbsp;</em>is the latest game in the&nbsp;<em>Orcs Must Die!&nbsp;</em>series, combining the franchise's traditional action-tower defense hybrid gameplay with a new roguelite-inspired approach and "deeper progression systems".</p>

<p>You can grab the game right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2273980/Orcs_Must_Die_Deathtrap/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/orcs-must-die-deathtrap/9p0302f6v9vt" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>
