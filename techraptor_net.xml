            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pathfinder-kingmaker-sales-2m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Knights Peak and developer Owlcat Games have announced that their CRPG&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder: Kingmaker&nbsp;</em>has hit a brand new sales milestone over six years after its initial launch.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder: Kingmaker&nbsp;</em>sales have now hit the two million mark. It seems the milestone may have been reached a little too late for the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pathfinder-kingmaker-delays-its-rule-until-september-25th" rel="nofollow">sixth anniversary</a>, which fell in September last year, but it's still an achievement for Owlcat and Knights Peak to be proud of.</p>

<p>At last count, Owlcat's followup&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous&nbsp;</em>had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pathfinder-wrath-of-righteous-sales-reach-1-million" rel="nofollow">reached a million sales</a>, and earlier this week, the studio revealed that its grimdark futuristic CRPG&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Rogue Trader&nbsp;</em>had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-rogue-trader-1m-sales" rel="nofollow">hit the same number</a>. That puts&nbsp;<em>Kingmaker&nbsp;</em>out in front as the studio's best-selling game to date.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder: Kingmaker</em>, it's a CRPG that serves as both Owlcat Games' first title and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-crpg-pathfinder-kingmaker-announced-chris-avellone-to-contribute" rel="nofollow">first video game</a> to be set in the&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder&nbsp;</em>world. The game sees you building and managing your very own kingdom, navigating courtly intrigue and seeing off threats to your rule as you do so.</p>

<p>As you'd probably expect from a modern CRPG, the game lets you create your own hero and meet a range of diverse companions, as well as iconic figures from the&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder&nbsp;</em>mythology. It also allows you to choose between real-time and turn-based combat depending on your personal preference, which is always nice.</p>




<p><em>Pathfinder: Kingmaker&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/640820/Pathfinder_Kingmaker__Enhanced_Plus_Edition/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP2047-CUSA14853_00-KINGMAKER00000US" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 4</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/pathfinder-kingmaker-definitive-edition/BPHQQN22GB7L" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox One</a>, and you can also play it on current-gen consoles thanks to the magic of backwards compatibility. Stay tuned for more on all other things Owlcat.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[It Looks Like Major Dragon Age: The Veilguard Updates Are Ending With Patch 5]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-the-veilguard-updates-ending-patch-5</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/it-looks-like-major-dragon-age-the-veilguard-updates-are-ending-with-patch-5.1091145/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-the-veilguard-updates-ending-patch-5<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has released a new patch for&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, and judging by the wording in the official patch notes, this looks to be the game's final major update.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/patch-5-release-notes" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the official <i>Veilguard&nbsp;</i>website, EA says it was "so happy with the game's stability at launch" and that the game is now "in a stable place". As such, the development team is now "moving to monitor for any game-breaking bugs", which rather sounds like there won't be any more significant content updates.</p>

<p>This patch isn't exactly massive, either; it doesn't add any new quests or content, but brings more quality-of-life changes, like recommended levels being added for lower-level quests and a number of bug fixes as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-updates-ending-patch-5-emmrich.jpg?itok=oKL7F_el 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-updates-ending-patch-5-emmrich.jpg?itok=x98jW0H- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>doesn't look to be getting any more big updates after its latest patch.</figcaption></figure><p>I'm speculating a little here, but it also sounds a bit like&nbsp;<em>Veilguard&nbsp;</em>won't be getting any major expansions like previous&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>games did, so if you're expecting&nbsp;this game's version of <i>Awakening&nbsp;</i>or even DLC packs like&nbsp;<em>Trespasser</em>, you might want to save your disappointment now.</p>

<p>While the wording of the post seems to suggest EA and BioWare want to put a positive spin on ending updates for&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, the fact remains that the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-ea-sports-fc-25-underperformed" rel="nofollow">sold disappointingly</a> for the company, coming in at around half of EA's expectations for the quarter in which it released.</p>

<p>Along with&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC 25</em>,&nbsp;<em>Veilguard</em>'s underperformance caused EA to adjust its financial expectations for the 2024-25 fiscal year, which in turn led to a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/23/ea-shares-plunge-19percent-on-track-for-worst-day-since-dot-com-bubble.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">drop</a> in the company's stock value of almost 20%. Yeowch.</p>




<p>It's also worth noting that&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>director Corinne Busche <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/veilguard-director-corinne-busche-leaving-bioware" rel="nofollow">departed BioWare recently</a>, and while her departure isn't necessarily related to the game's underperformance, the timing of the two announcements seems a touch too coincidental for them not to be connected.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1845910/Dragon_Age_The_Veilguard/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/dragon-age-the-veilguard/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/dragon-age-the-veilguard/bsdx4fnnc0dk" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and Patch 5 is out now.
