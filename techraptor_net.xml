            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has announced a new update for&nbsp;<em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</em>, and the studio has promised to add two of the features most requested by the game's community.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://x.com/AvatarFrontiers/status/1947325865982914631" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">social media post</a>, the update, which is due to arrive on December 5th, will add a New Game Plus mode to the first-person shooter, so you'll be able to tackle its story again with all of your equipment and skills intact.</p>

<p>New Game Plus will, however, also bring tougher enemies and a higher level of overall challenge, so you'll need to take advantage of the stronger gear and new skill tree offered by the mode in order to prevail.</p>

Honestly, I'm surprised there was no third-person view mode to start with, but better late than never, I guess.</p>

<p>According to Massive Entertainment, various gameplay systems in <i>Frontiers of Pandora&nbsp;</i>have been <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-update-brings-third-person-and-new-game-plus-modes" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reworked</a> in order to ensure a "seamless and intuitive" experience while playing in third-person, so it shouldn't just feel like a tacked-on extra.</p>

<p>If you're wondering why it's going to take so long for the update to arrive, it's probably because Ubisoft wants to time the release as close to the launch of the upcoming third&nbsp;<em>Avatar&nbsp;</em>movie as possible.</p>

<p>Additionally,&nbsp;<em>Frontiers of Pandora&nbsp;</em>was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-gets-gameplay-debut-and-december-7-release-date" rel="nofollow">released on December 7th back in 2023</a>, so while this update won't land exactly on the game's second anniversary, it'll be close enough to be considered a celebration anyway.</p>




<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2840770/Avatar_Frontiers_of_Pandora/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora/9N9QJG4S82B5" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and its New Game Plus update arrives on December 5th.

            <title><![CDATA[Surprise! Descenders Next Is Out Now]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/descenders-next-shadowdrop</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/surprise-descenders-next-is-out-now.1248852/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher No More Robots and developer RageSquid have revealed the release date for upcoming extreme sports game&nbsp;<em>Descenders Next</em>, and, well, it turns out the game isn't so "upcoming" anymore.</p>

<p>As revealed in a press release,&nbsp;<em>Descenders Next&nbsp;</em>is out now for PC and Xbox, and it's also on Game Pass. That's right; the game has been shadowdropped, and you can check it out right now at no extra cost if you're a Game Pass subscriber.</p>

<p>If you're not, the game will set you back $24.99 or your regional equivalent. It's in Early Access right now, which means you're getting just two sports: snowboarding and mountainboarding. Additional sports will, however, be added over time;&nbsp;<em>Descenders Next</em>'s goal is to become "the only extreme sports game you'll ever need".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/descenders-next-shadowdrop-grind.jpg?itok=oKMPjHIo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/descenders-next-shadowdrop-grind.jpg?itok=5q36EfUT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Descenders Next&nbsp;</em>is out now. Surprise!</figcaption></figure><p>As revealed back when the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/descenders-next-2025-pc" rel="nofollow">was announced last year</a>,&nbsp;<em>Descenders Next</em>'s first two sports will handle differently from one another as well, so you won't just be getting carbon copies of the same activity at launch (i.e. now).</p>

<p>No More Robots and RageSquid say the goal with&nbsp;<em>Descenders Next&nbsp;</em>was to "deliver the same feel, the same sense of speed [as the original <em>Descenders</em>], but expand beyond mountain biking". As such, the studios emphasized a philosophy of "perfecting the fluidity of numerous sports" for&nbsp;<em>Descenders Next</em>.</p>

<p>According to the two studios,&nbsp;<em>Descenders Next&nbsp;</em>already has the same amount of content that <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/descenders" rel="nofollow">the original</a>&nbsp;<em>Descenders&nbsp;</em>does, and it'll offer a "more natural experience" than the original game's mixture of procedurally-generated stages and hand-crafted levels thanks to its "procedural off-piste mountains that chain together into tight, winding parks and vistas".</p>




<p><em>Descenders Next&nbsp;</em>is out right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2375530/Descenders_Next/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/descenders-next-game-preview/9N66JJQFX3RX" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a> (including Xbox One), and if you're a Game Pass member, you can play it right now at no additional cost as well, although you will need to be on the Ultimate or PC tiers to check it out.</p>
