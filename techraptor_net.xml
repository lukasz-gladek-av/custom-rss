            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lies-of-p-dlc-q1-2025-new-ip<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Lies of P&nbsp;</em>developer Neowiz has revealed that the game's long-awaited DLC expansion will be arriving sometime during the first quarter of next year, and there's more exciting news for Neowiz fans as well.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.ebn.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=1644423" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">statement</a> issued by the studio (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/lies-of-p-dlc-is-coming-in-the-first-quarter-of-2025-as-developer-confirms-next-its-game/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">VGC</a>), Neowiz confirms the release window for the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Lies of P&nbsp;</em>DLC, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lies-of-p-dlc-sequel" rel="nofollow">teased last November</a> following the game's release in September 2023. We still don't know what the DLC will be about or exactly when we can expect it, however.</p>

<p>When the DLC was first teased, Neowiz showed a couple of pieces of concept art related to the expansion, including what appeared to be protagonist P exploring a shipwreck, as well as an industrial facility with a giant pillar at its center.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lies-of-p-dlc-q1-2025-fight.jpg?itok=qvKqI82K 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lies-of-p-dlc-q1-2025-fight.jpg?itok=1tTr3Wc1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Lies of P</em>'s DLC is coming in the first quarter of next year.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as confirming the release window for the&nbsp;<em>Lies of P&nbsp;</em>DLC, Neowiz also reveals what it's working on next in the statement, although again, further details are rather scarce.</p>

<p>Per VGC's translation, the studio is working on an entirely new IP that will take the form of a sci-fi survival horror game. The statement specifically namechecks the likes of 2023's <i>Dead Space&nbsp;</i>remake and Striking Distance's&nbsp;<em>The Callisto Protocol</em>, although let's hope Neowiz emulates the former rather than the latter <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/callisto-protocol-crunch-is-problem-with-100-hour-work-weeks" rel="nofollow">in terms of development process</a>.</p>

<p>We'll likely have to wait a while for more info on the new survival horror IP being worked on by Neowiz; it's likely the studio will be focusing on the&nbsp;<em>Lies of P&nbsp;</em>DLC for the immediate future. Still, a reveal at next year's Summer Game Fest might not be too much to hope for.</p>




<p>In case you haven't come across&nbsp;<em>Lies of P&nbsp;</em>before, it's a Soulslike that serves as a loose adaptation of the classic children's novel&nbsp;<em>The Adventures of Pinocchio&nbsp;</em>(although the emphasis is very much on "loose" here).</p>

<p>You play as P, a puppet created by Geppetto who, unlike other puppets, has the ability to lie. You must explore the fictional city of Krat in order to discover what happened to it, why its puppets have gone insane, and what, if anything, you can do to make things right.</p>

<p><em>Lies of P&nbsp;</em>proved very popular indeed, selling <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lies-of-p-sales" rel="nofollow">a million copies</a> within its first month on release despite being a day one Game Pass title.</p>

<p>It's still available there and on <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/lies-of-p" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox consoles</a> generally, as well as on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1627720/Lies_of_P/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/lies-of-p/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[Dave the Diver Sales Top 5m]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dave-diver-sales-5m</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dave-the-diver-sales-top-5m.1048035/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dave-diver-sales-5m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Mintrocket has announced that&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver&nbsp;</em>sales have crossed another big milestone, further cementing the diving adventure's popularity.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/DaveDiverGame/status/1862090754769998006" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post on social media platform X</a>, Mintrocket confirms that&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver&nbsp;</em>has sold five million copies, thanking players for all of their "love and support". The studio also posts a lyric that appears to be a reference to&nbsp;Bruno Mars and Rosé's song "Apt", namely "sleep tomorrow but tonight go diving".</p>

<p>In January this year, Mintrocket revealed that&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver&nbsp;</em>sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dave-diver-sales-3-million" rel="nofollow">had hit three million</a>, so that means that in the intervening months (since not even a year has passed since that announcement), the game has gone on to sell another two million copies.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dave-the-diver-sales-5m-diving.jpg?itok=N0Rs-DBQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dave-the-diver-sales-5m-diving.jpg?itok=aQFuvLbS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's been a strong year for&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver&nbsp;</em>in sales terms, it seems.</figcaption></figure><p>That number is especially impressive if we consider two things. First,&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver&nbsp;</em>isn't available on Xbox, so all of these sales have come from PC, Switch, and PlayStation.</p>

<p>Secondly, when&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dave-diver-ps5-release-date-ps-plus" rel="nofollow">launched on PS5 back in April</a>, it also hit PlayStation Plus on day one, so subscribers have the chance to play the game at no extra cost. Even still, many have clearly bought the game rather than taking to Sony's subscription service to check it out.</p>

<p>Of course, Mintrocket doesn't provide an exact breakdown of where the sales have come from in its post, so we don't know what proportion of those sales are PlayStation and how many are PC players.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver</em>, it's an adventure game-come-management sim in which you play as the titular Dave. You must dive into the ocean to gather ingredients and explore the world by day, then manage your sushi restaurant by night.</p>

<p>The game, which was developed by Nexon division Mintrocket, sparked some debate when it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/game-awards-2023-nominees-announced-baldurs-gate-3-alan-wake-2-are-most-nominated" rel="nofollow">nominated for Best Indie Game</a> at the 2023 Game Awards, although it eventually lost to Sabotage's JRPG homage&nbsp;<em>Sea of Stars</em>.</p>

<p>Still, since Nexon <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/nexon-spins-off-dave-the-diver-dev-mintrocket-into-a-full-corporation" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">spun Mintrocket off into its own entity</a> in September (albeit one that's still a subsidiary), perhaps that indie label is slightly more warranted now. I'd argue not, but there we are.</p>

<p><em>Dave the Diver&nbsp;</em>is available to check out now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1868140/DAVE_THE_DIVER/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/dave-the-diver/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/dave-the-diver-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>
