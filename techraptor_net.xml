            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Darrington Press has released new playtest material for its fantasy TTRPG, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/daggerheart-review-narrative-forward-yes-and-ttrpg-that-is-force-to-be-reckoned" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Daggerheart</em></a>. This new batch sees the debut of the <em>Daggerheart</em> Blood Hunter, an adaptation of the class created by Matt Mercer for the actual play series, Critical Role.</p>



<p>Like all <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-daggerheart-playtest-material-messes-with-monstrous-transformation" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">prior playtest material</a>, the <em>Daggerheart</em> Blood Hunter playtest is available on Darrington's <a href="https://www.daggerheart.com/thevoid/" rel="nofollow">The Void</a> hub. The playtest includes the Blood Hunter character sheet, a handful of printable class cards, and rules for three of its subclasses: Order of the Mutant, Ghost Slayer, and Lycan respectively.</p>

The class was created by Matt Mercer and is heavily inspired by The Witcher series. The unique hook of the class is invoking blood magic, which grants the character enhanced abilities and devastating attacks. All at the cost of their own health.</p>

<p>Since its AP debut, the Blood Hunter class has been available through D&amp;D Beyond as Critical Role fan content. Aside from a redesign in 2020, the class hasn't received much official support, partially due to its nebulous status as official content for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>.</p>

<p>The central gimmick of trading health for power is still present in the <em>Daggerheart</em> Blood Hunter playtest. Several key features from the D&amp;D version make the jump to <em>Daggerheart</em>. Crimson Rite lets you mark a hit point and gain bonus damage. Blood Maledict costs you 3 Hope but grants advantage on action rolls against a single target. And you can still track a target with Brand of Castigation.</p>

<p>The playtest does introduce some new wrinkles such as unique spells. Blood Puppet lets you control someone, living or dead, through their blood. Lifeblood Talisman lets you create a special trinket that reduces damage taken by its wearer. There is even some support with Weave The Flesh, which lets you mark a hit point or stress to let your allies heal.</p>
