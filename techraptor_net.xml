            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/raf-grassetti-naughty-dog<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>God of War Ragnarok&nbsp;</em>art director Raf Grassetti has joined up with&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Uncharted&nbsp;</em>developer Naughty Dog.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/rafagrassetti/status/1866135153497768034" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post on social media platform X</a>&nbsp;earlier today, Grassetti shared a picture of the Naughty Dog logo, together with the simple caption "new chapter" to announce that he'd signed up with the studio.</p>

<p>It's likely that Grassetti will be working on Naughty Dog's next project, which is almost certainly the same game Neil Druckmann <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1gr42v6/neil_druckmann_says_his_current_project_has_been/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">said has been in development since 2020</a> last month, although we don't know any more about the game than that yet, unfortunately.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/raf-grassetti-naughty-dog-sculpture.jpg?itok=zu-Y20et 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/raf-grassetti-naughty-dog-sculpture.jpg?itok=g657UAyy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Raf Grassetti is perhaps best known for his work on the two most recent&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>games.</figcaption></figure><p>As for Grassetti, he's probably best known as the art director on 2022's&nbsp;<em>God of War Ragnarok</em>, having served as an artist on the 2018 predecessor as well. If you loved the art direction of Kratos' latest adventure, you've got Grassetti to thank, at least in part.</p>

<p>Of course, that's not all the work Grassetti has done in the gaming industry. After <a href="https://x.com/rafagrassetti/status/1659618787036110848" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">leaving Sony in May 2023</a>, Grassetti joined up with Netflix to create "a brand-new studio and AAA multiplatform game", although it seems like he may have been one of the casualties when Netflix <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-team-blue-shut-down-report" rel="nofollow">shut down "Team Blue" in October</a>.</p>

<p>Prior to his time with Sony, Grassetti worked as a character artist on projects like BioWare's&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect 3</em>, Ubisoft's&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Origins</em>, and CD Projekt Red's&nbsp;<em>The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings</em>, among many others. Suffice it to say he's an old industry hand.</p>

<p>As for Naughty Dog itself, it's currently working on at least one as-yet unannounced project.</p>

<p>Given that the studio moved towards <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/last-of-us-online-canceled-as-naughty-dog-works-on-more-than-one-ambitious-single" rel="nofollow">focusing exclusively on single-player games</a> back in December last year, it's likely the new game won't be a multiplayer live-service affair, which, given one of Sony's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-shuts-down-two-studios-including-concord-creator" rel="nofollow">more recent high-profile failures</a>, is probably for the best.</p>
