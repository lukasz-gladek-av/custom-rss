            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Eremite Games and publisher Hooded Horse have announced the release date for city builder&nbsp;<em>Against the Storm</em>'s upcoming&nbsp;<em>Nightwatchers&nbsp;</em>DLC, and it's arriving pretty soon.</p>

<p>Per a Steam news post,&nbsp;<em>Nightwatchers&nbsp;</em>launches across all platforms on July 31st. It'll bring a brand new species, two new biomes, and plenty of other features if you decide to pick it up, although it is paid DLC rather than a free update.</p>

<p>The Bats are "a stern and fiercely devoted species with unmatched resilience and exceptional metallurgical skills", according to the two studios, so make sure you're leveraging their unique skills if you decide to play as them.</p>

The Ravine's landscape, in particular, is described as "unforgiving", but you can take advantage of the new Black Market feature to keep your settlement afloat even in this harsh landscape.</p>

<p>In the Bamboo Flats, meanwhile, you'll find a new creature by the name of the Fluffbeak, and you can keep an eye out for its "hunger, thirst, and warmth" to effectively care for it and receive fertilizer to help your soil along in return.</p>

<p>Other new features coming as part of the&nbsp;<em>Nightwatchers&nbsp;</em>DLC include new World Events, which will grant powerful new rewards in turn, as well as new Modifiers, new Legendary Cornerstones, and a ton of other good stuff that should make your&nbsp;<em>Against the Storm&nbsp;</em>experience all the more satisfying.</p>

<p>You can check out the&nbsp;<em>Against the Storm&nbsp;</em><em>Nightwatchers&nbsp;</em>DLC release date trailer, which gives you a sense of what will be in store for you if you decide to grab the expansion, right here.</p>
