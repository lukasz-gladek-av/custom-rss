            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-tokyo-ghoul-crossover<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Behaviour Interactive has announced&nbsp;a&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight Tokyo Ghoul&nbsp;</em>crossover, bringing the main character of the iconic anime and manga into the world of the asymmetrical horror game.</p>

<p>The crossover arrives on April 2nd and will bring protagonist Ken Kaneki into&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>, although unlike the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-castlevania-crossover-release-date" rel="nofollow">main characters</a> from other <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-tomb-raider-crossover" rel="nofollow">beloved IPs</a>, Kaneki won't be joining as a survivor but as a killer.</p>

<p>Technically speaking, Kaneki is&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>'s first anime crossover in terms of playable characters, although Behaviour did team up with acclaimed horror writer Junji Ito for a cosmetic collection <a href="https://deadbydaylight.com/news/junji-ito-collection-brings-his-chilling-creations/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">back in January</a>.</p>

<p>With each successful attack, Kaneki will enter Enraged Mode, which will amplify his "strength, brutality, and movements", according to Behaviour Interactive. It sounds like you'll need to stay on the offensive if you're playing as Kaneki.</p>

<p>The developer is also promising a set of perks "designed to apply pressure", as well as "gloriously graphic" effects when survivors succumb to Kaneki's Mori.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to a set of "iconic looks and characters" from&nbsp;<em>Tokyo Ghoul&nbsp;</em>as part of&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>'s accompanying DLC collection, with various characters and outfits from&nbsp;<em>Tokyo Ghoul&nbsp;</em>making an appearance.</p>

<p>Additionally, more crossovers are planned for the future, with a&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-five-nights-at-freddys-crossover" rel="nofollow"><em>Five Nights at Freddy's&nbsp;</em>collaboration</a> due for sometime this summer. It's worth noting, too, that crossovers are <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-hellraiser-chapter-leaving" rel="nofollow">sometimes removed</a> from&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>'s roster, so if there's one you've got your eye on, make sure to snap it up quickly.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight Tokyo Ghoul&nbsp;</em>crossover arrives on April 2nd, but you can check it out right now if you play on&nbsp;the game's public test server.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zaum-project-c4-disco-elysium</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/disco-elysium-studio-za-um-reveals-genre-defining-rpg-project-c4.1131114/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zaum-project-c4-disco-elysium<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>ZA/UM, the studio responsible for 2019's cult classic RPG&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>(although it's fair to say there's a little more to it than that), has revealed its new game&nbsp;<em>Project C4</em>.</p>

<p>The studio describes the game as "a mind-warping story of espionage and team-building" which takes place in an "original yet achingly familiar setting", which might suggest the setting will bear some similarities to&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>'s Revachol.</p>

<p><em>Project C4</em>'s debut trailer is characteristically vague and oblique, with a voiceover intoning vague lines like "my mind is eating itself" and "obliteration wears a rented suit" with a withering English twang. In fairness, this is a teaser trailer (and one made by ZA/UM, no less), so we probably shouldn't expect straightforward.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zaum-project-c4-conspiracies.jpg?itok=fFORnnmQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zaum-project-c4-conspiracies.jpg?itok=rjaik5SH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Project C4&nbsp;</em>looks like a characteristically weird RPG from ZA/UM.</figcaption></figure><p>The opening words of the trailer confidently read "WE ARE ZA/UM" and "WE BROUGHT YOU&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>", but that's arguably only true up to a certain point.</p>

<p>Back in 2022,&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>lead designer Robert Kurvitz, along with art director Aleksander Rostov and writer Helen Hindpere, <a href="https://x.com/artofrostov/status/1576539500012240897" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">confirmed</a> that they were no longer a part of ZA/UM after it was <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/report-i-disco-elysium-i-co-founders-ousted-from-developer-za-um" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reported</a> that the three had been quietly removed from the studio.</p>

<p>What followed is a lengthy, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-wild-story-behind-disco-elysiums-spiritual-successors-allegations-legal-threats-and-a-usb-stick" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">winding story</a> of legal disputes and bitter recriminations, so ZA/UM saying that it's the studio responsible for&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>feels just a little bit audacious given that many of that game's key creative personnel are no longer there.</p>

<p>Additionally, in early 2024, ZA/UM was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/disco-elysium-developer-zaum-confirms-game-cancellation-and-layoffs" rel="nofollow">hit by layoffs</a>, with the studio also canceling one of its in-development game projects (which was reportedly a standalone&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>expansion).</p>




<p>Since then, a number of ex-<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>developers have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-disco-elysium-devs-new-studios-spiritual-successors" rel="nofollow">founded their own studios</a> and announced their own games, many of which bear at least superficial similarities to the&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>formula.</p>

<p>Of course, it remains to be seen whether&nbsp;<em>Project C4&nbsp;</em>will itself be similar to&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>, but since ZA/UM reminds us of that game's existence in the first few seconds of the trailer (and describes&nbsp;<em>C4&nbsp;</em>as "the next genre-defining RPG" from the studio), it's a safe bet it will.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what's in store for us when it comes to <i>Project C4</i>. Stay tuned for more.</p>
