            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Krafton and developer ARC Team have announced the Early Access release date for their free-to-play top-down tactical shooter <em>PUBG: Blindspot</em>, and it's heading to PC via Steam next month.</p><p>As revealed in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3143710/view/535497844504658077" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">a post</a> on Steam, <em>PUBG: Blindspot </em>will be available to play in its Early Access form starting from February 5th. Again, the game will be free at the point of entry, so it won't cost you anything other than time to try it out.</p><p>Krafton says that <em>PUBG: Blindspot</em>'s Early Access version "may include limited content", but that the project will "evolve through ongoing balance updates, improvements, and live development", which is pretty much the dictionary definition of an Early Access game, I think.</p><figure role="group">

<p>More details about <em>PUBG: Blindspot</em>'s Early Access release, as well as a "full FAQ", will be made available via the game's official Discord server at some point in the near future, so look out for that if you want to know more.</p><p>If you're wondering exactly what <em>PUBG: Blindspot </em>is, Krafton describes the game as "a 5v5 top-down tactical shooter built on clever positioning, tight teamwork, and shared vision".</p><p>Each game will see one team trying to gain entry to a building in order to access its Crypt, while the other team tries to defend the building from the first team's incursion. Krafton and ARC Team are promising unique classes, as well as iconic weapons from <em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em> for you to try out.</p><p>&nbsp;You can check out a trailer for <em>PUBG: Blindspot</em>, which should give you a sense of what kind of gameplay you can expect from the project, right here.</p>
<p><em>Blindspot </em>isn't the only <em>PUBG </em>spinoff on the cards for Krafton; the company is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pubg-black-budget-announcement" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="465e73f0-d22e-41e4-96c2-51eda877aecb" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">also currently working on <em>PUBG: Black Budget</em></a>, an extraction shooter in the <em>Escape from Tarkov </em>mold, although that one doesn't have a release window yet.</p><p><em>PUBG: Blindspot </em>enters Early Access on February 5th <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3143710/PUBG_BLINDSPOT/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">on PC</a>.
