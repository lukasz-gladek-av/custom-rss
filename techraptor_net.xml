            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/dosa-divas-preview-cooking-up-storm<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Welcome to our establishment. On today's menu, our special is <em>Dosa Divas</em>, an upcoming title from developer Outerloop Games and publisher Outersloth. It mixes elements from popular JRPGs into one delicious meal. Here's our thoughts from the time we had with it at Summer Game Fest 2025.</p>

<p>Let me preface by saying&nbsp;<em>Dosa Divas</em>&nbsp;seems to focus heavily on narrative, but due to the nature of the demo, I wasn't able to get a real feel for it. With a timer giving me just 30 minutes, I wanted to consume as much gameplay as I could.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Taking Inspiration From the Greats</h2>

<p>From what I could gather, though, the story involves two sisters and an "ancient spirit-mech," which you can also control as a party member (it is pretty freakin' cool). An evil fast food empire is the main enemy faction we'll contend with throughout the duration of&nbsp;<em>Dosa Divas</em>&nbsp;playtime.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I went into&nbsp;<em>Dosa Divas</em>&nbsp;fairly blind; I saw something that looking cool, so I decided I wanted to play it. Because of this, I was quite surprised to find how much&nbsp;<em>Dosa Divas</em>&nbsp;plays like some of my favorite JRPGs.</p>

<p>You have an overworld -- it's kind of this 3D, side-scrolling like area a la&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/series/paper-mario" rel="nofollow">Paper Mario</a> --&nbsp;</em>and combat is also inspired by the same game's timing mechanics. More recently, we can look at games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-french-revolution" rel="nofollow"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a>&nbsp;using this more interactive, turn-based JRPG combat style.</p>



<h2>Food Fighting in&nbsp;<em>Dosa Divas</em></h2>

<p>So when you engage in combat, you can pick your standard attacks, special attacks, and the like. There's a little visual indicator to showing players can press a button again, during combat animation, to get an extra attack. Timing seems pretty generous for this.</p>

<p>The timing for attacks will depend; for an example, attack has a boomerang effect that, if you keep timing it correctly, can bounce for quite a long time. Nothing I'm saying here is extraordinarily different from other JRPGs that have similar mechanics, but&nbsp;<em>Dosa Divas</em>&nbsp;has a few tricks up its sleeve.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There's a culinary theme throughout the entire game. Attacks are based on cooking utensils for the most part, so you have your spatulas, pot lids, punches from a spirit-mech... okay, maybe the last one isn't a cooking utensil, but man, I can't get over how cool this mech is!</p>

<p>As I went around defeating enemies in the overworld, I helped liberate a village from the fast-food empire, the reputation with the settlement would increase. This actually gave me skills for my characters, so it seems like character progression is tied to these villages to some large degree.</p>



<h2><em>Dosa Divas</em> Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Besides that, though, I love the way&nbsp;<em>Dosa Divas</em>&nbsp;handles items. You're not buying your standard health potion like a normal JRPG; instead, you cook it up yourself. There's a cooking aspect involved, and depending on what ingredients you use, you get a different result.</p>

<p>So while you might be able to buy certain ingredients, it seems like you'll have to make your own utility items. There are little mini-games that make this aspect more interactive, so cooking can be a grand 'ol time.</p>

<p>If anything,&nbsp;<em>Dosa Divas</em>&nbsp;seems like a neat little JRPG-inspired game. It doesn't necessarily do anything super new or wild, but it doesn't need to. It's an honest take on the genre that is legitimately fun, so I'm excited to see how this one pans out when it launches next year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atelier-resleriana-red-alchemist-white-guardian-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Koei Tecmo has announced the release date for upcoming RPG&nbsp;<em>Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian</em>.</p>

<p>The game, which was first announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atelier-resleriana-red-alchemist-and-white-guardian" rel="nofollow">all the way back in September last year</a>, will be launching across PS5, Switch, and PC on September 26th. It doesn't appear that a native Switch 2 port will be available at launch, at the very least.</p>

<p><em>The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian&nbsp;</em>will serve as a followup to&nbsp;the original&nbsp;<em>Atelier Resleriana</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atelier-resleriana-global-release-date" rel="nofollow">released last year as a free-to-play RPG</a>. Unlike its predecessor, however, this new game won't be an online-based gacha RPG, but instead a fully-fledged&nbsp;<em>Atelier&nbsp;</em>game.</p>

It'll stand in contrast to&nbsp;<em>Atelier Yumia</em>, which, as Koei Tecmo says, "aimed to create the next generation of&nbsp;<em>Atelier&nbsp;</em>games" (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atelier-yumia-sales-300k-fastest-selling" rel="nofollow">rather successfully, it should be noted</a>).</p>

<p>The new game takes place in the fallen town of Hallfein, which has been devastated by a "mysterious disaster" that "caused most of its residents to disappear". After some time, however, two former residents of Hallfein, Rias and Slade, return to the town to discover the truth of what really happened.</p>

<p>Much like&nbsp;<em>Atelier Resleriana</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian&nbsp;</em>will also feature characters from previous&nbsp;<em>Atelier&nbsp;</em>games. Sophie, Wilbell, Totori, and Raze will all be making an appearance as playable characters "in segments of the game".</p>

<p>Koei Tecmo says&nbsp;<em>Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian&nbsp;</em>will revolve around "the core&nbsp;<em>Atelier&nbsp;</em>series gameplay cycle of exploration, synthesis, and battles", but that you'll also be able to develop the town of Hallfein, operating your own shop and selling what you make.</p>




<p><em>Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3259600/Atelier_Resleriana_The_Red_Alchemist__the_White_Guardian/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, PlayStation 5, and Nintendo Switch on September 26th.</p>
