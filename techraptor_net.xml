            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The first episode of Critical Role Campaign 4 is now available, and with it the first episode helmed by Brennan Lee Mulligan, played in by Matthew Mercer and his fellow twelve players, and our introduction to the world of Araman and its people.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Critical Role: Campaign 4 doesn't start with a bang. With a fiery explosion or a world on the brink, but with a quiet moment. A moment between brothers, one whose neck is about to have a noose tied around it, and the other who is trying to do what they can to save him.&nbsp;</p>

For a table that shifts between a dozen characters I was a bit worried going into the season about how disorienting getting introduced to so many characters would be. Getting to meet just one, join them in their hope for a way to save their brother, and then watch it all be for nought what a perfect introduction.&nbsp;</p>

<p>From here we move through an afternoon of mourning at the Fang home as Azure, Luis, brings the body to the wake. Aabria and Alex arrive to confirm Hal and pay respects, and a variety of other colorful (black is a color too) characters that had ties to Thiazi.</p>

<p>I would have never expected for a funeral to be the perfect place to introduce these characters but as ever character filed in we were able to perfectly get an introduction to them from who they are in the context of the city, who they are in relation to Thiazi and each other, what part they had to play in trying to rescue him, and how they're feeling that the plan was not successful…</p>

<p>There was some unavoidable word vomit of noble houses, places within the city and across the land of Araman, and factions but it never felt like knowing or focusing on that was important as you were drawn into such a relatable feeling of loss.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/critical-role-c4e1-aabria-and-ashley_0.jpg?itok=6sGwgysk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/critical-role-c4e1-aabria-and-ashley_0.jpg?itok=wGNkzUKd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Among the characters introduced, while all were fascinating to watch, Aabria Iengar and Ashley Johnson gave elevated performances.</p>

<p>From the moment Aabria arrived she brought with her the energy of a mother, a friend and partner, and a mentor. Once again playing the ex of another party member this time the relationship isn't a strained one, but one of two people on different paths.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This energy continued to evolve as she had a speedy "enemies to best friends" moment with Tyranny, had nothing but love for Arinessa, and an intense hatred for Sir Julien Davison. I particularly loved the way that Aabria used her druid abilities, creating vines and a beast spirit to continue conferring funeral rights, that she was able to project her characters internal emotions for all to see while not having to resort to soliloquy.</p>

<p>Immediately, I recognized what Sam Riegel spoke to me about last week, that in this larger group it became all the more important for characters to take what time they have and shine bright. Subtlety famously isn't great in actual plays so it's important the audience understands characters relationships and intentions, especially when meeting so many over the house of four hours.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Johnson's character, an immortal drow still engaged by the loss of their God, was stoic and cold from start to finish. From the moment she approached the table she dominated the scene while remaining cool and collected.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While it was incredible to see Johnson so deep in her role it was just as wonderful to see Brennan ask her to roll a side and her immediately panic and she attempted to wake her tablet and remember what her Insight bonus is.&nbsp;</p>

A tiefling rebelling against polite society whose present situation, and notable anecdote include getting drunk and throwing up did feel shallow compared to the other performances. Her and Riegel did have a fun double act between the performative holy man and the devil trying to act better.</p>

<p>Each other character seems established in their roles and who they are, and it's in this way that Tyranny has a serious narrative advantage. Currently she's a blank slate, a character with so much room to grow and hundreds of game hours to develop. Episode 1 might not be my favorite, but I can't wait to see Tyranny in 10, 30, 100 episodes time.</p>

<p>Outside of character introductions, a mystery was being set up, and a macguffin has gone missing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following who I assume will be the more soldiery characters of Teor, Azure, Thimble, Kattigan, (and maybe Occtis?) we are presented with a number of unanswered questions: How was Thimble found and attacked? Who got away with the Stone of Nightsone? Is there a traitor in their midsts? If the sigil was still with Thimble, then what was it that Hal detected on Thiazi?</p>

<p>These kinds of questions getting mentioned, but never dwelled on was a perfect way to sew the seeds of intrigue.</p>

<p>We're one episode in, statistically less than 1% of the way into the campaign, but so far it's very promising. In just a single episode I feel that the plot has done an excellent job introducing us to characters and beginning to intrigue the players and viewers as to where this story might be heading next.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As we continue through the overture, and players play musical chairs diving in and out of scenes I feel that everything is going to continue to be a bit confusing and fast paced.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I think the true strength of the campaign will be seen once smaller groups are made, goals are known, and we're able to really get into the meat of the campaign.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher vedinad has announced that their 3D&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em>-esque roguelite game&nbsp;<em>Megabonk</em>&nbsp;has managed to hit a major sales milestone within its first two weeks on sale.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://x.com/MegabonkGame/status/1973773917040111965" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">revealed</a> on social media,&nbsp;<em>Megabonk&nbsp;</em>has crossed a million sales since it was released on September 18th. Humorously, vedinad says they'll be "eating spaghetti with EXTRA sauce tonight" as a result of the sales milestone.</p>

<p>The developer also says they "really appreciate" the feedback fans have provided for&nbsp;<em>Megabonk&nbsp;</em>since its launch, and that there are "definitely a lot of things [they] wanna fix and change". A roadmap could be on the way, but vedinad says they're taking a few days off due to being "a bit overwhelmed and tired", so don't expect it imminently.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/megabonk-sales-1m-running.jpg?itok=CqtAF_0H 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/megabonk-sales-1m-running.jpg?itok=QJ9wTizz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Megabonk&nbsp;</em>has racked up a million sales since being released around two weeks ago.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Megabonk</em>'s million-sale milestone puts it in the same league as games like Konami's&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-f-sales-1m" rel="nofollow">Silent Hill f</a>&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-1m-sales" rel="nofollow">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a></i>, both of which had hit a million sales at last count, although they got there a little quicker (as you'd expect from established franchises).</p>

<p>In indie terms,&nbsp;<em>Megabonk</em>&nbsp;is now on the same page as hits like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sultans-game-sales-1m" rel="nofollow">card-based RPG&nbsp;<em>Sultan's Game</em></a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pacific-drive-sales-1m" rel="nofollow">driving roguelite&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive</em></a>, so however you slice it, vedinad's game is in some pretty good company.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Megabonk</em>, it's an action roguelite that combines the wave-based combat of games like&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors&nbsp;</em>with full 3D movement and traversal, adding another layer to the formula's strategy element.</p>

<p>Just like in&nbsp;<em>Survivors</em>-esque games, you'll have to survive against infinite waves of enemies in procedurally-generated maps, but you'll now have to worry about things like verticality and positioning yourself in a 3D space.</p>




<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Megabonk&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3405340/Megabonk/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, where it'll set you back $10 or your regional equivalent. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>
