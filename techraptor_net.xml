            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Peter Molyneux's studio 22cans has revealed the release date for upcoming god game <em>Masters of Albion</em>, which Molyneux describes as "the culmination of [his] life's work", and it's coming in spring.</p><p>As revealed by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/masters-of-albion-is-the-culmination-of-my-lifes-work-peter-molyneuxs-final-god-game-has-a-release-date-and-a-new-trailer" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">IGN</a>, <em>Masters of Albion </em>will be landing exclusively on PC on April 22nd. Molyneux has <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sim/emperor-of-overpromising-peter-molyneux-says-hes-done-with-games-after-masters-of-albion-which-is-also-his-redemption-title/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">previously described</a> the sim as his "last game", so it's also the controversial industry icon's swansong (assuming this really is his last hurrah, of course).</p><p>Molyneux and 22cans are promising that <em>Masters of Albion </em>will offer a blend of "cozy creativity" during the game's days and "brutal survival" when night falls, which sounds like a pretty typically ambitious combination of genres for <em>Fable </em>and <em>Populous</em>' designer.</p><figure role="group">

<p>According to 22cans and Molyneux, <em>Masters of Albion </em>is a "bold reimagining" of the god game genre, which Molyneux himself helped to pioneer through efforts like the aforementioned <em>Populous</em>, as well as games like <em>Black &amp; White</em> and <em>Dungeon Keeper</em>.</p><p>It's angling to be a city-builder with a strong narrative element; not only will you be building and developing the town of Oakridge, but you'll also be able to zoom in and see what you've built through the eyes of the people who live there.</p><p>Of course, Molyneux also has a history of overpromising and (some might say) underdelivering; although the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/fable-3-10th-anniversary" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="106de72f-8712-45e2-984c-a0d2b75cd71e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Fable </em>series is well-loved</a>, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/why-peter-molyneuxs-godus-is-such-a-disaster-1685539932" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">lessons of <em>Godus</em></a><em> </em>should teach us to approach any of Molyneux's future projects with trepidation.</p><p>That, however, is a reputation Molyneux himself is aware of. He's called <em>Masters of Albion </em>an attempt at "redemption" for him, and that this represents all of his "chips" being put on the table.</p><figure role="group">
