            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hasbro shared its latest earnings report recently. Among the financial information, the report illustrated new moves by the company's CEO, Chris Cocks, in terms of management and company policy. This includes more AI and pushing a digital-first approach to <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>.</p><h2>The Hasbro Earnings Report, Chris Cocks, AI, and Digital <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></h2><p>According to the official <a href="https://investor.hasbro.com/static-files/8cd9c02e-388e-4d85-8c35-e9d21dbe21bb" rel="nofollow">earnings report</a>, Hasbro has been doing really well. The report cites the sales of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> have been their strongest ever, up 59% vs. PY. The report cites the success of various Secret Lairs and the Q4 release of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/exciting-commanders-from-avatar-last-airbender-to-build-around" rel="nofollow"><em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em></a> Universes beyond set. This standout performance lead to revenue growing by 45%.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The report also confirmed a change in work environment by CEO Chris Cocks regarding AI integration. Cocks has been <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hasbro-ceo-chris-cocks-expresses-support-of-ai-in-dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow">very vocal </a>about the use of AI in various Hasbro products. While he doesn't explicitly name any specific company or brand, he does confirm integrating AI at Hasbro has been a "clear success."</p><p>The report explains the current application of this highly controversial and ethically fraught technology has been in non-creative contexts. AI tools are being used in areas like finances, supply chains, and in general productivity. Cocks also specifies the choice lies with specific teams whether or not to use these tools, emphasizing, "people make the decisions and people own the creative outcomes."</p><p>This appears to be in line with Wizards of the Coast's stance against the use of generative AI in Dungeons &amp; Dragons' products. Ever since the discovery of Gen AI artwork in the <em>Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants</em> supplement, they have explicitly <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-clarifies-stance-on-ai-artwork-in-their-books" rel="nofollow">banned Gen AI</a> use in all their books. Although, reports on AI's use of productivity enhancement is being <a href="https://hbr.org/2026/02/ai-doesnt-reduce-work-it-intensifies-it" rel="nofollow">seriously contested</a>.</p><p>A second area of note in the Hasbro earnings report is a shift from <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> to a digital-first brand. The report states that 60% of D&amp;D revenue has been from digital sales, bolstered by the ongoing use of the digital platform, <em>D&amp;D Beyond.</em> This aligns with recent decisions regarding digital exclusive content for the game.</p><p>Recently, D&amp;D Beyond has hosted more partnered content, official support for third-party books. These include <em>Crooked Moon</em> and <em>Dungeons of Drakkenheim</em> as well as more bespoke supplements for various settings like Critical Role's Exandria and <a href="https://marketplace.dndbeyond.com/category/DB8XTUXUM?pid=DB8XTUXUM" rel="nofollow">Keith Baker's Eberron</a>. There has also been a push of digital exclusive content like <em>Astarion's Book of Hungers</em> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dd-beyond-digital-supplement-lorwyn-first-light-brings-fey-mischief" rel="nofollow"><em>Lorwyn: First Light</em></a>.</p><p>While the Hasbro earnings report doesn't say anything about phasing out physical book releases, it is clear the company's focus will remain on these digital offerings going forward.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
