            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fanatical-movember-charity-bundle<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Fanatical has a new charity bundle up for grabs, and for just $12 (or more if you choose), you'll get a ton of pretty big games and support the Movember charity initiative into the bargain.</p>

<p>The Movember Game 'Stache Charity Bundle is, per Fanatical, "the first bundle to join the Movember mustache movement", and it's got a whopping 15 games to offer, including Owlcat's well-received CRPG&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader"><em>Warhammer 40k: Rogue Trader</em></a>.</p>

<p>Other games you'll get as part of this bundle include truckin' sim&nbsp;<em>American Truck Simulator</em>, city-builder&nbsp;<em>SteamWorld Build</em>, and goopy action-adventure game&nbsp;<em>The Gunk</em>, among several others.</p>

<p>Additionally, 100% of the proceeds go to the Movember charity initiative, so you don't need to choose how much you want to go to Fanatical itself; you're supporting Movember all the way if you pick this one up.</p>

<p>Here's a full list of the games available as part of the Fanatical Movember Game 'Stache Charity Bundle. All of these games activate via Steam, and many of them are either Playable or Verified on Steam Deck as well.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/remedys-revenue-is-up-as-alan-wake-2-inches-towards-profitability.1025346/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-q3-financials-alan-wake-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em>developer Remedy has announced its financial results for the third quarter of its fiscal year, and things are looking a little rosier for the Finnish studio.</p>

<p>In Remedy's <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/inderes-widgets-prod-assets/remedy/attachments/1ef581e9-5f40-4a92-ab0f-0d15844717cd/remedy-q3-2024-business-review.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">financial report</a>, the studio says its revenue has jumped 128.6% over the same period from the previous year. Between July and September this year, Remedy raked in&nbsp;€17.9 million in revenue, and its operating profit was&nbsp;€2.4 million, up from a&nbsp;€5.5 million loss in Q3 2023.</p>

<p>The studio also says that while&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alan-wake-2-budget-remedy-financials">still isn't profitable</a>, the game had recouped "most of its development and marketing expenses" by the end of the quarter, which means that it may well be profitable within the next couple of quarters.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/alan-wake-2-remedy-financials-lake-house.jpg?itok=VdDMC3Qy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/alan-wake-2-remedy-financials-lake-house.jpg?itok=VJ0dMg8C 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</em>isn't profitable yet, but it seems to be getting there.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Remedy, full production on&nbsp;<em>Control 2&nbsp;</em>is scheduled to start in 2025, with the sequel currently progressing "well in the production readiness stage". Many of the game's "critical features" have been implemented, Remedy says, and it's currently testing "workflows and pipelines" for full production.</p>

<p>Similarly, the&nbsp;upcoming&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/max-payne-remakes-control-spinoff-remedy"><em>Max Payne&nbsp;</em>remakes</a> are "making steady progress", and Remedy says it's "gradually reaching important milestones" in development on the projects.</p>

<p>For the rest of 2024, Remedy expects its revenue to "increase from the previous year", and it also expects its "operating profit to improve", so it looks like Remedy will likely have a better time in 2024 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-financials-2023">than in 2023</a>.</p>

<p>The report also looks ahead to Remedy's upcoming projects, including the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Control 2&nbsp;</em>and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fbc-firebreak-control-spinoff-announced">recently-revealed&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em></a>, a multiplayer&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em>spinoff set to launch sometime next year.</p>




<p>While Remedy is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-annapurna-control-2-tv-movies">teaming up with Annapurna</a> (even amidst that company's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/annapurna-interactive-staff-resign-after-company-spin-off-talks-fail">recent turmoil</a>) for&nbsp;<em>Control 2</em>, the Finnish developer will be self-publishing the game, as it will with&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>.</p>

<p>Here's hoping Remedy's fortunes continue to improve in the coming months. Stay tuned for more on all things Remedy-related.</p>
