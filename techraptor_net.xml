This more experimental spin-off of a Secret Lair, which quietly launched <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-announces-their-first-chaos-vault-drop-for-magic-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">back in December</a>, is continuing its eclectic streak with some new psychedelic land cards.</p>

<h2>The Secret Lair Chaos Vault 2025 Drop</h2>

<p>IN an official blog post, Wizards of the Coast briefly restates the intention of the Secret Lair Chaos Vault drops. They are designed to be unexpected. Sales launching at unexpected times to selling unexpected items. The post also confirms an email list for updates on future Chaos Vault drops.</p>

Starting "sometime next week" the next drop will feature new basic land cards. These land cards showcase a vibrant art style with abstract, rainbow-like colors by artist Scott Balmer. They look more like background vignettes to a prog-rock album than a fantasy landscape.</p>

<p>If you are worried about cost, this latest Chaos Vault drop will try something different. Buying this Chaos Vault drop will get you ten copies of each basic land card by popular demand. That is fifty cards in total as part of this drop. In keeping with the chaotic nature of these drops, there is no current listed price.</p>

It features several pieces of artwork by Rhonda Libbey, Heikala, Ashley Mackenzie, and kelogsloops. The artwork moves back and forth between watercolor vignettes, cozy anime imagery, and impressionistic koi ponds.</p>

<p>This promise of experimentality is in keeping with the first Secret Lair Chaos Vault drop. That drop, titled the Fairest Drop of All, had several cards in the style of art deco title plates. One card was illustrated in full profile. If this is maintained, Chaos Vault could serve as an outlet for alternative artists and to entice players with more eclectic taste.</p>
