            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-swearing-darth-vader-ai-fixed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>An exploit that caused&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s new Darth Vader AI to swear at players has already been fixed, so if you were hoping to hear some fruity language from everyone's favorite Sith Lord, you might be disappointed.</p>

<p>Earlier today, a clip showing Australian streamer Loserfruit prompting the game's new AI-powered Darth Vader to swear at her (as preserved <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1923397890241593822" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here by user Cordial</a>) went viral. In the clip, the Vader AI can be heard clearly dropping an F-bomb. He might be evil, but that's probably not what Epic intended.</p>

<p>Following the clip's proliferation, Epic <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1923397890241593822" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">responded</a> to Cordial in order to confirm that the issue "shouldn't happen again", since a hotfix has been pushed. If you ask me, it would have been infinitely funnier if they'd kept the swearing in the game, but I guess we can't have nice things anymore.</p>

<p>Vader only understands English (and not Galactic Basic, weirdly enough), and if you're a minor, you'll need your parent or guardian to approve voice or written communication with Vader via the parental controls section of the game.</p>

<p>The character can be spoken to by the first team to recruit Vader in either the standard Battle Royale mode or its Zero Build alternative, and he's also available in the Ranked play mode, so even if you're trying to sweat up a storm, you can still take some time to chat with Ani (spoiler alert).</p>




<p>The Darth Vader AI is part of&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-star-wars-crossover-2025" rel="nofollow">latest&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>collaboration</a>, which also brings the likes of Emperor Palpatine, Poe Dameron, and, er, Darth Jar Jar as skins for players to terrify their foes with.</p>

<p>Of course, if you're playing&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>on iOS, then all of this is moot, at least for now; earlier today, Epic announced that Apple has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-offline-worldwide-ios-apple-block" rel="nofollow">blocked the release of the game</a> on iOS in the US and Europe, which means it's currently offline on the platform "worldwide".</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bungie-acknowledges-stolen-marathon-art-promises-thorough-review.1191372/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-marathon-art-stolen<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>developer Bungie has acknowledged that some of the art featured in the game was stolen from an artist who didn't work on the game, promising a "thorough review" of&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>'s "in-game assets" as a result.</p>

<p>For context, artist Antireal <a href="https://x.com/4nt1r34l/status/1923067988871147605" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">alleged</a> yesterday that&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>'s environments are "covered with assets lifted from poster designs [she] made in 2017", posting a number of examples of areas in which&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>'s art was lifted from her own&nbsp;as proof.</p>

<p>In response to Antireal's allegations, Bungie, <a href="https://x.com/MarathonDevTeam/status/1923217324384903262" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">posting</a> on the&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>development team's account, confirmed that "a former Bungie artist included [Antireal's designs] in a texture sheet that was ultimately used in-game".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bungie-marathon-artwork-stolen-antireal.jpg?itok=tf1fookp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bungie-marathon-artwork-stolen-antireal.jpg?itok=OY9DC327 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>has a pretty distinctive art style, but not all of that style is Bungie's, it seems.</figcaption></figure><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/MarathonDevTeam/status/1923217325722874199" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">thread</a>, Bungie says its current art team didn't know about the artwork's theft, and that the studio is "still reviewing how this oversight occurred".</p>

<p>As a result of the stolen artwork's discovery, Bungie says it will now conduct a "thorough review" of&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>'s asset pool, specifically assets created or contributed by the former artist in question (who isn't named, for obvious reasons).</p>

<p>Additionally, Bungie says it will be "implementing stricter checks to document all artist contributions", although I'm honestly pretty shocked those checks weren't in place to begin with and that something so egregious could get through unnoticed.</p>

<p>The studio says it's "reached out" to Antireal to talk about the issue and is "committed to do right by the artist", as well as by "all artists who contribute" to Bungie's games.</p>




<p>Bungie's lax security when it comes to spotting stolen artwork is even more upsetting given that this isn't the studio's first time being accused of stealing from fans. In 2021, Bungie <a href="https://x.com/Cozmo23/status/1442534201165635587" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">used a fan depiction</a> of one of its characters in promo material, subsequently apologizing and crediting the correct artist.</p>

<p>After that incident, in 2023, a&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2&nbsp;</em>fan claimed Bungie had stolen their art for an in-game cutscene, an allegation that Bungie itself subsequently <a href="https://x.com/Destiny2Team/status/1671927000498597888" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">confirmed was true</a>. Then, in 2024, artist Tofu <a href="https://x.com/Tofu_Rabbit/status/1833851336607101076" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">accused</a> Bungie of stealing a weapon design they had made in 2015, and again, Bungie copped to doing so.</p>

<p>I don't want to cast aspersions, but I also don't know how many times something has to happen before it can be considered a pattern. Let's just say I wouldn't be surprised if Bungie was caught out for stealing fan artwork again before&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>is released.</p>

<p>If this whole thing hasn't left a bad taste in your mouth and you still want to check out&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>, you can do so when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3065800/Marathon/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/marathon/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/marathon/9pb32dkqkzdq" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on September 23rd.</p>
