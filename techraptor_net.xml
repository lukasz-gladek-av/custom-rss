            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/syberia-remastered-announced-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microids has announced&nbsp;<em>Syberia Remastered</em>, a modernized remaster-slash-remake of the original point-and-click classic with revamped gameplay and improved visuals.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Syberia/status/1924150647177306347" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on social media platform X, Microids promises that the remaster will feature a "stunning visual overhaul", as well as "redesigned gameplay". It will, however, tell the "same unforgettable story" as the original, so don't worry; the plot details haven't been changed.</p>

<p>The remaster will see protagonist Kate Walker and her automaton companion Oscar exploring "carefully rebuilt" environments which use an art style that "stays true" to original creator Benoît Sokal's vision while also utilizing "beautifully enhanced 3D", according to Microids.</p>

<p>In keeping with modern design trends,&nbsp;<em>Syberia Remastered&nbsp;</em>will offer "a fresh take" on the original's puzzles, which have been "redesigned to provide a smoother and more intuitive experience".</p>

<p>Additionally, the remaster will feature a reworked UI, as well as "improved 3D navigation", so it should be a little easier to move Kate around her environment now; the slightly clunky movement of the original sounds as though it's been addressed, which is nice.</p>

<p>Otherwise, it's still the same tale of Kate's "legal assignment" that transforms into "a profound journey of self-discovery". If you love the original&nbsp;<em>Syberia</em>, it sounds very much like this is the remaster you've been waiting for.</p>

<p>A sequel followed in 2004, followed by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/syberia-3-gets-release-date-and-revealing-trailer" rel="nofollow">another thirteen years later</a>. The latest game in the series,&nbsp;<em>Syberia: The World Before</em>, was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/syberia-world-before-release-date-set-for-march-2022" rel="nofollow">released in 2022</a>, and is the first to launch following Sokal's death in 2021 from a long-term illness.</p>

<p>With regards to the future of the series, it's not just&nbsp;<em>Syberia Remastered&nbsp;</em>you've got to look forward to; an animated series based on the franchise <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/syberia-animated-series-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">is also in development</a>, although we don't know when it's arriving yet.</p>

<p><em>Syberia Remastered&nbsp;</em>launches sometime later this year for PC. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3660220/Syberia__Remastered/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wishlist it right now via Steam</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/doom-dark-ages-chelsea-flower-show<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>and the Chelsea Flower Show might not be the most obvious crossover you can think of, but thanks to Xbox, Bethesda, and "leading bespoke firepit designers" The Firepit Company, it's becoming a reality tomorrow.</p>

<p>Per a press release, the medieval FPS will be getting a firepit display at the Chelsea Flower Show from May 20th to May 24th, thus "seamlessly blending the game's take on medieval stylings with cutting-edge craftsmanship".</p>

<p>The display will see several elaborately-designed firepit globes set among lush greenery, with the central firepit being built around the Doom Slayer himself and a number of other globes featuring designs of "intricate demons and elaborate adversaries" from&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/doom-the-dark-ages-chelsea-flower-show-display.jpg?itok=ud_h9JOL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/doom-the-dark-ages-chelsea-flower-show-display.jpg?itok=J-kYh9RF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>is getting, of all things, a Chelsea Flower Show display.</figcaption></figure><p>The centerpiece features not only the Doom Slayer, but also a number of "dark flowers", including dark variants of the likes of Zantedeschia, petunia, and Centaurea cyanus. You'll also find a pedestal with the Slayer's symbol carved into it.</p>

<p>Bethesda communications director Steve Merrett says it's "amazing" to see how&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>has been "adapted into a centerpiece worthy of any outdoor area", while The Firepit Company's Jason Andre describes the display as "iconic" and a "pleasure" to work on.</p>

<p>If you want to see the displays, you'll be able to do so in London <a href="https://www.rhs.org.uk/shows-events/rhs-chelsea-flower-show" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">between May 20th and 24th</a>, although tickets <a href="https://www.rhs.org.uk/shows-events/rhs-chelsea-flower-show/ticket-options" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">aren't cheap</a>&nbsp;and are limited in availability at time of writing.</p>




<p><em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>is the latest game in the&nbsp;<em>Doom&nbsp;</em>franchise, and the third game in the reboot series, which began with 2016's straightforwardly-titled&nbsp;<em>Doom</em>.</p>

<p>A prequel to that game,&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>sees the Doom Slayer battling back the forces of Hell in order to save humanity. It introduces a number of new weapons and combat mechanics to the series, including parrying, a throwable shield that can also be used to block projectiles, and more.</p>
