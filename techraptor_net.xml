            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-game-boy-may-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has added four more retro Game Boy classics to the Nintendo Switch Online library, so if you like your cult classics, then you're in for a treat.</p>

<p>Game Boy games, along with games from other systems, are <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-picross-donkey-kong" rel="nofollow">sporadically added</a> to the subscription service's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-game-boy-launch" rel="nofollow">library</a>, and unlike Nintendo 64 games (or the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-gamecube-switch-2-online" rel="nofollow">upcoming GameCube library</a> for Switch 2), you won't need an Expansion Pack for these titles.</p>

<p>First to be added in today's haul is the 1999 Konami game&nbsp;<em>Survival Kids</em>, which features some pretty innovative open-world survival gameplay for its time. It's a forefather of the DS'&nbsp;<em>Lost in Blue&nbsp;</em>series, and a new&nbsp;<em>Survival Kids&nbsp;</em>game is also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-launch-lineup" rel="nofollow">heading to the Switch 2</a>.</p>

If you're a fan of previous (or subsequent)&nbsp;<em>Gradius&nbsp;</em>titles, you'll probably love this one too.</p>

<p>Your third new Game Boy game in today's haul is&nbsp;<em>Kirby's Star Stacker</em>, a&nbsp;<em>Puzzle League</em>-style descending block puzzler that takes&nbsp;<em>Kirby&nbsp;</em>aesthetics and transposes them into a&nbsp;<em>Dr. Mario</em>-style gameplay system.</p>

<p>Finally, today's Nintendo Switch Online Game Boy lineup brings&nbsp;<em>The Sword of Hope&nbsp;</em>to Nintendo Switch Online. It's an RPG developed by&nbsp;<em>Kid Klown&nbsp;</em>studio Kemco, and while it's a little basic by today's standards, it's still got a rough charm to it.</p>

<p>All four of these games were previously available in the West, so none of them are <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-starfy-gba" rel="nofollow">getting a release outside Japan</a> for the first time, but some of them are likely not to have graced your Game Boy shelf in the past given their rarity.</p>




<p>You can play all four of these Game Boy games right now on Nintendo Switch Online if you've got an active subscription, and if you haven't, then you can sign up for one via your console's eShop.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-version-20-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has revealed the release date for&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 2.0, which the developer says will mark the "grand beginning" of the gacha action RPG's second season.</p>

<p>Following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-version-17-release-date" rel="nofollow">April's Version 1.7</a>, Version 2.0 will arrive on June 6th across all platforms on which&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>is available. It'll bring a new area to explore, new characters to add to your lineup, and more, just as you'd expect from a HoYoverse update.</p>

<p>First up, you'll be embarking on "an exhilarating new journey" that will take you to the Waifei Peninsula, a "remote yet vibrant district of New Eridu". There, you'll discover new exploration gameplay mechanics, "further uncover the hidden secrets of Phaethon", and more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zenless-zone-zero-version-2.0-ju-fufu.jpg?itok=LkhdIlPG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zenless-zone-zero-version-2.0-ju-fufu.jpg?itok=lZik-r6k 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 2.0 has three new fighters for you to add to your team.</figcaption></figure><p>The first of&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 2.0's three new characters is Grandmaster Yixuan, an S-rank agent who can ignore defense to deal huge damage, which can also scale with her attack power and max HP.</p>

<p>She's joined by fellow S-rank Agent Ju Fufu, a Yunkui Summit disciple who deals Physical and Fire damage and boosts her squad's critical damage with her Tiger's Roar buff.</p>

<p>Finally, rounding out the playable character roster for Version 2.0 is the A-rank Physical Defense Agent Pan Yinhu, a "kitchen-savvy panda" who brings some serious attitude to your team. S-rank Bangboo Belion will also be added to the game in this update.</p>

<p>They'll join Astra Yao and Caesar, two S-rank Agents who are getting reruns as part of&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero</em>'s Version 2.0 banners. Not only that, but since this update marks the game's first anniversary, you'll be able to "choose one S-rank Agent and one S-rank W-Engine from the Stable Channel for free".</p>




<p>Of course, this update also introduces plenty of quality-of-life improvements like a new 3D map for navigation, new beacons that allow you to revive characters and restore HP, and other optimizations.</p>

<p><em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 2.0 launches across <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices</a> on June 6th.</p>
