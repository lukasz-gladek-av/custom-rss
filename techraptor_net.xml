            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gothic-1-remake-2025-release-window<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Alkimia Interactive has revealed a new&nbsp;<em>Gothic 1 Remake&nbsp;</em>release window, although it's perhaps not quite as specific as you might like if you've been waiting for the game since its announcement.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1297900/announcements/detail/519700531080333166" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post on Steam</a>, Alkimia wishes the game's fans and followers a happy new year, promising that 2025 will be "a truly key year" for&nbsp;<em>Gothic 1 Remake&nbsp;</em>and that it is "working tirelessly" to release the game.</p>

<p>A user named Mr Patrick <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1297900/eventcomments/600766396226347151?snr=1_5_9_#c600766396226353492" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">commented on that post</a>,&nbsp;saying that Alkimia "won't even inform [us] about [the] release date" after telling players they would "get the game in 2024". Alkimia refutes this claim in <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1297900/eventcomments/600766396226347151?snr=1_5_9_#c600766396226353606" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a reply</a>, then says that&nbsp;<em>Gothic 1 Remake&nbsp;</em>"will be released in 2025".</p>

<p>Indeed, a collector's edition for the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gothic-1-remake-collectors-edition" rel="nofollow">was revealed in April</a>, allowing players to spend huge amounts of money on a game that still didn't have a release date or window nailed down.</p>

<p>It's nice to know that the two studios haven't given up on&nbsp;<em>Gothic 1 Remake</em>. Presumably, we'll be getting a more concrete release date sometime in the next few months, but we'll have to wait and see on that front.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Gothic 1 Remake</em>, it is, as you may have guessed, a remake of the first&nbsp;<em>Gothic</em>, although "reimagining" might be a little closer to the truth.</p>

<p>The original&nbsp;<em>Gothic</em>'s setting and basic plot setup remain intact, but the remake will add a number of more modern quality-of-life features, as well as a visual overhaul and other changes. Alkimia describes the project as "faithful".</p>

<p>We still don't know when&nbsp;<em>Gothic 1 Remake&nbsp;</em>will launch, but when it does, it'll arrive on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1297900/Gothic_1_Remake/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10005976" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/gothic-1-remake/9nbrlcpw4zgv" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.&nbsp;</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-xbox-port-series-s</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-myth-wukong-xbox-port-delayed-due-to-series-s-memory-limitations-producer-says.1072623/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-xbox-port-series-s<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>producer Feng Ji has stated that the reason the game's Xbox port has been such a long time coming has to do with the Xbox Series S' memory limitations.</p>

<p>In a post on <a href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5118097780121223" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Chinese social media platform Weibo</a> (for which we're using machine translation), Feng Ji says that the Series S' 10GB of shared memory would make a&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>port impossible without "several years of optimization experience".</p>

<p>That's despite Microsoft itself <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-xbox-delay-not-due-to-platform-limitations-microsoft-reiterates" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">stating back in September</a> that "platform limitations" were not the reason behind the game's Xbox delay, sparking rumors that the game was subject to an undisclosed exclusivity deal between Sony and developer GameScience.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/black-myth-wukong-xbox-port-series-s-boss.jpg?itok=Ofw61xPl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/black-myth-wukong-xbox-port-series-s-boss.jpg?itok=ZHI6vf-1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>'s Xbox port has apparently been delayed for so long due to the Series S' memory limitations.</figcaption></figure><p>It's perhaps not a surprise that Feng Ji has come forward to say this. The producer and GameScience CEO is garnering something of a reputation for controversial statements.</p>

<p>Around the time of the Game Awards, Feng Ji <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/black-myth-wukong-game-science-ceo-the-game-awards-criticized-game-of-the-year-loss/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">criticized the ceremony</a> for not awarding&nbsp;<em>Wukong&nbsp;</em>the prestigious Game of the Year prize, which instead went to PlayStation platformer&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em>. He said he'd prepared his acceptance speech two years prior and seemingly wrote that he "came here for nothing".</p>

<p>This time around, Feng Ji could either be calling out the Series S for its memory limitations or describing his own team's lack of optimization experience, both of which seem to be contributing to the&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>Xbox port being so long in the making.</p>

<p>Either way, it looks like we're not going to be seeing&nbsp;<em>Wukong&nbsp;</em>gracing the Xbox anytime soon, unfortunately. Better make do with the PC or PS5 versions for now.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>, it's an action-adventure game with Soulslike elements developed by Chinese studio GameScience.</p>

<p>The game is heavily inspired by the classical Chinese novel&nbsp;<em>Journey to the West</em>, although it's not a direct retelling of that story. Instead, it tells the tale of the Destined One, a simian warrior who must ascend to claim the monkey king Wukong's mantle.</p>

<p><em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>proved massively popular on release, topping the Steam charts <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-24-hour-player-count" rel="nofollow">within a handful of hours</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-expansion-sales-18m" rel="nofollow">passing the 18 million sales milestone</a> just a few weeks after its initial release.</p>

<p>You can check the game out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2358720/Black_Myth_Wukong/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/black-myth-wukong/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>. Whether or not it eventually does land on Xbox seems to be a matter for debate at the moment, so while you wait, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/black-myth-wukong-review-serious-monkey-business" rel="nofollow">check out my review</a> to see what I thought of&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>.</p>
