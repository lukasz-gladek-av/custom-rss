            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Betrayal at House on the Hill</em> is one of my go-to games for replayability. With so many haunts, variability in gameplay, and even the way that a house develops differently sitting down you've always got to be prepared for something new. With the <em>Betrayal At The Niebolt House: The Evil of Pennywise</em> expansion, players get to take on the roles of a group returning after 27 years of torment to put a stop to Pennywise.</p>

<p>Included in the box you'll find a "Come Home To Evil" Scenario Card, ten Pennywise Encounter cards, four tokens, a Henry Bowers character overlay, and three IT-themed miniatures for Henry Bowers, Pennywise the Clown, and Pennywise the Spider. The expansion also includes four new rooms, a thematic story preamble for the Derry setting, and five new haunts inspired by <em>IT Chapter II.</em></p>

<p>Come Home To Evil<br>
You are a group of friends who survived It's last feeding frenzy in the town of Derry when you were kids. Now, It has stirred again after 27 years, and you've been drawn back to the Neibolt House to confront the savage shapeshifter. As you explore the house and experience nightmarish events, will you turn on your friends? Or will you band together to defeat It once and for all?</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>What is <em>Betrayal</em>?</h2>

<p>If you're new to <em>Betrayal</em>, the basic premise of it is that you and your group of explorers begin in the entrance hall of a mysterious mansion. As you take turns, you'll enter rooms and flip over tiles from a large stack of rooms, building the house as you play the game.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/betrayal_-the-evil-of-pennywise-mansion-building.jpg?itok=1snp6sUF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/betrayal_-the-evil-of-pennywise-mansion-building.jpg?itok=_Le6PjM6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Exploring the house, you'll have a chance to earn items, experience strange and supernatural events, and discover ominous Omens. Once enough Omens have been gathered, a Haunt kicks off.</p>

<p>Once the Haunt kicks off, you're no longer playing a collaborative game of haunted house exploration, but instead, one (or maybe more) of the players will turn to the side of evil. They may have been killed, with the player now controlling monsters in the house, have become evil themselves, or some mix of the two.</p>

<p>Each team of players now has its own unique goals to win the game as new mechanics come into play.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/betrayal_-the-evil-of-pennywise-separated-house.jpg?itok=t5Y-qPok 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/betrayal_-the-evil-of-pennywise-separated-house.jpg?itok=0aHkYeCG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>With <em>The Evil of Pennywise</em>, there are a number of changes made to the base game so that no matter what, you always feel like you're part of the universe of IT.</p>

<p>The largest critique of <em>Betrayal: The Evil of Pennywise</em>&nbsp;is also one that it shares with the base game, as you move into the Haunt and there's a chance for players to die if things go awry and if you die quickly, then you're fully out of the game. When these haunts can take 30+ minutes, that's time that you're just not getting to engage in any aspect of the game.</p>

<h2>Setting Up Betrayal At The Neibolt House</h2>

<p>In order to adapt your game to fit the theme of the expansion, you'll get to add your four new tiles to the game board. From there, you'll start your game as normal with the expansion-specific scenario card.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/betrayal_-the-evil-of-pennywise-pennywise-encounters.jpg?itok=tR291cYU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/betrayal_-the-evil-of-pennywise-pennywise-encounters.jpg?itok=UVru6pKT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The largest change is that instead of pulling Omen cards when you see an Omen symbol on a revealed room, you'll instead pull a Pennywise Encounter card. These cards pull inspiration from the source material, where you'll see a red balloon pop and potentially take damage, or overcoming floating lights is able to help you gain sanity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The four new room tiles are unique to the expansion, but that doesn't mean that they can't be staples of your standard Betrayal experience</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Knowing that a few new tiles are in the deck, and you're pulling Pennywise Encounters instead of Omens, is really all you need to change going into <em>The Evil of Pennywise,</em> making setup an incredibly fast process and for it to be familiar for all returning players.</p>

<h2>Experiencing The Haunts</h2>

<p>Discussing the haunts can be a bit difficult without spoiling too much, so I'll keep it generic here for a bit. There are five themed Haunts in <em>The Evil of Pennywise</em>, each focusing on a key plotpoint from IT Chapter II, whether it be facing Henry Bowers, or facing off against Pennywise The Clown itself.</p>

<p>The game has done a fantastic job of adapting these scenes to best fit the gameplay of <em>Betrayal</em>, with Haunt number 2 in this book probably becoming my favorite Betrayal experience with a great mix of unique gameplay, interesting problems to solve, and a very visible threat continuing to grow until it becomes too much for any player to handle.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/betrayal_-the-evil-of-pennywise-henry-bowers.jpg?itok=t_Lg9Jpl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/betrayal_-the-evil-of-pennywise-henry-bowers.jpg?itok=YTlEemWv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>To get deeper into the spoilers, each of the different haunts progresses you further through the narrative of the source material. Starting by having to fight Henry Bowers, then getting trapped in a disconnected house, having to find your artifacts, and then performing the ritual and taking on Pennywise.</p>

<p>It almost feels like there should be a recommended goal to build the house, but make alterations so you can do each of the haunts in order to create a legacy game feel as you and your friends make it through the events of <em>IT Chapter 2</em>.</p>

<p>To cap off the experience, I'm a big fan of the final two haunts of the game having no traitor, but Pennywise be an mechanic-driven antagonist. It stays true to the source material while also creating a very unifying experience for the players.</p>

<p>If there was ever a board game to use the IP of <em>IT</em> and Pennywise, <em>Betrayal </em>is the perfect choice. This expansion is incredibly fast to setup, enhances the base game, and allows for you and your friends to experience a variety of mechanically unique haunts.</p>

<p>While only adding five new haunts, this won't take long to get through; each of the haunts is very unique and memorable to the source material.</p>

<p>If you're a fan of <em>Betrayal</em>, there's really no way that more haunts are ever going to be a bad thing, this should be a must buy.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Supermassive Games, the studio responsible for the likes of Bandai Namco's upcoming&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares III&nbsp;</em>and the&nbsp;<em>Dark Pictures&nbsp;</em>anthology series, has announced another round of layoffs.</p>

<p>Last year, the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/supermassive-games-layoffs" rel="nofollow">laid off a number of employees</a> as part of a "reorganization" effort; the number wasn't revealed, but Bloomberg's Jason Schreier reported that around 90 Supermassive staffers were affected.</p>

<p>Now, in a <a href="https://x.com/SuperMGames/status/1947650822768132211" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Supermassive says it's laying off "up to 36" employees as part of a new "redundancy consultation process". The studio cites the "challenging and ever-evolving environment" of the gaming industry as the reason for these newest cuts.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/supermassive-games-layoffs-2025-man-of-medan.jpg?itok=V1-arE7l 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/supermassive-games-layoffs-2025-man-of-medan.jpg?itok=fhZFXXN_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Dark Pictures&nbsp;</em>developer Supermassive Games is going through another round of layoffs.</figcaption></figure><p>As part of this layoff wave, Supermassive also says that its upcoming "cinematic sci-fi horror adventure"&nbsp;<em>Directive 8020&nbsp;</em>will be delayed until the first half of 2026. You can read our very own Andrew's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/directive-8020-enhances-gameplay-putting-stealth-and-scares-in-players-hands" rel="nofollow">preview of that game here</a> to find out what he thought of it.</p>

<p>If you're worried about&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares III</em>, you needn't be; Supermassive says that these layoffs will have "no impact on the development" of the upcoming horror puzzle-platformer, and the October 10th release date, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/little-nightmares-iii-release-date" rel="nofollow">announced last month</a>, will go ahead as planned.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Supermassive isn't even the only studio to lay off staff in the last week or so; it joins&nbsp;<em>GreedFall II&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Steelrising&nbsp;</em>developer Spiders, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/spiders-layoffs" rel="nofollow">hit by layoffs across its animation and rig team</a> this week.</p>

<p>These layoffs are also part of a broader pattern that has seen thousands of industry employees losing their jobs over the last couple of years, as well as project cancellations and studio closures galore.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see how else Supermassive Games' latest layoffs affect the studio's operations. Stay tuned for more.</p>
