            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has revealed that making more studio acquisitions will form a key part of its business strategy in future, so it looks like we can expect to see more Nintendo subsidiaries popping up before too long.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105e.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">supplementary document</a> accompanying the Japanese gaming giant's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-dk-bananza-switch-2-sales" rel="nofollow">latest financial results</a>, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa sets out how he intends to strengthen Nintendo's "business foundation".</p>

<p>Part of those efforts, Furukawa says, will be "acquiring development companies to make them subsidiaries", as well as "augmenting [Nintendo's] development facilities", all of which is intended to help "strengthen the internal game development organization" within Nintendo.</p>

<p>Some of Nintendo's existing subsidiaries include the likes of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/luigis-mansion-3" rel="nofollow">Luigi's Mansion 3</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/mario-strikers-battle-league" rel="nofollow">Mario Strikers: Battle League</a>&nbsp;</em>developer Next Level Games, as well as Monolith Soft, the studio responsible for the&nbsp;<em>Xenoblade&nbsp;</em>series of RPGs.</p>

<p>The Japanese gaming giant also owns Retro Studios, the developer to whom work on&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime 4&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-reboots-metroid-prime-4-hands-development-to-retro-studios" rel="nofollow">handed back in 2019</a>. The <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metroid-prime-4-beyond-2025" rel="nofollow">hotly-anticipated first-person shooter</a> is set to finally launch next month.</p>

<p>Some studios that technically aren't Nintendo subsidiaries, despite frequently working with the publisher, include&nbsp;<em>Kirby</em>'s HAL Laboratory,&nbsp;<em>Mario Tennis&nbsp;</em>developer Camelot Software Planning, and Masahiro Sakurai's Sora Limited, all of which could be potential contenders for Nintendo's next acquisition.</p>

Reportedly, Nintendo has asked its manufacturing partners to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-25m-production-report" rel="nofollow">produce 25 million units of the console by March</a>.</p>

<p>The news also comes after Doug Bowser, who was appointed as president of the company's American division in 2019, will <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-of-america-doug-bowser-retiring" rel="nofollow">step down at the end of the year</a>. His role will be taken by Devon Pritchard, who's currently serving as NOA's revenue and marketing executive VP.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has released a new update for its PlayStation Portal device that allows you to stream PS5 games without needing your main console handy, but you'll have to be a PlayStation Plus Premium member to use it.</p>

<p>As outlined in a new PlayStation Blog <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/05/cloud-streaming-officially-arrives-on-playstation-portal-today-with-new-support-for-digital-ps5-games-in-your-library/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, the update, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-portal-cloud-streaming-update" rel="nofollow">entered beta last year</a>, is being released today at 6pm Pacific (so you'll need to wait until 2am tomorrow morning if you're in the UK like me).</p>

<p>If you're a PS Plus Premium member, you can now stream PS5 games from your own library; not every game is supported, but Sony says the feature is available for "thousands of PS5 games", including the likes of&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em>,&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>, and the recently-released&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yotei</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/playstation-portal-cloud-streaming-menu.jpg?itok=2hG2ghhE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/playstation-portal-cloud-streaming-menu.jpg?itok=s3AKgPDY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Many games can now be streamed directly to your PlayStation Portal.</figcaption></figure><p>Prior to the update, you could only stream games to your PlayStation Portal if you were near your corresponding PS5, but you can now do so anywhere with a high-speed internet connection.</p>

<p>You'll also find a brand new home screen for the Portal as part of this update, with a brand new dedicated Cloud Streaming menu that shows which games can be streamed to your device without needing to connect to a PS5.</p>

<p>As well as the new Cloud Streaming stuff, the latest update also brings new features for both Remote Play and Cloud Streaming, including 3D audio support, a new passcode lock system to protect your Portal, and a network status screen that displays connection quality.</p>

<p>Cloud streaming additions include support for in-game purchases, new accessibility options, and the chance to receive game invitations from friends who are playing the same game as you. What a time to be alive, eh?</p>




<p>This latest PlayStation Portal update will be released today at 6pm Pacific/9pm Eastern, and it arguably brings the device one step closer to that dedicated Sony handheld <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonys-playstation-portal-gets-release-date-while-fans-keep-asking-for-real-portable" rel="nofollow">some fans have been clamoring for</a>. Stay tuned for more.</p>
