            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dungeons-dragons-dark-alliance-delisted-february<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Wizards of the Coast and developer Tuque Games have announced that fantasy action-RPG&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance&nbsp;</em>is being delisted at the end of February.</p>

<p>Rather curiously, the official announcement of said delisting comes as part of an update to the game's Steam page rather than a post on social media or a blog, as is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/littlebigplanet-3-plus-dlc-delisted-halloween" rel="nofollow">often the case</a> when games are <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/forza-horizon-4-delisting-player-surge" rel="nofollow">delisted or shut down</a>.</p>

<p>A new paragraph under&nbsp;<em>Dark Alliance</em>'s "About This Game" section on Steam states that the game will be shut down on February 24th, and that it will no longer be available for purchase starting from that date. Presumably, this applies to the DLC as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dungeons-dragons-dark-alliance-shutting-down-arrow.jpg?itok=t9f3CKSd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dungeons-dragons-dark-alliance-shutting-down-arrow.jpg?itok=TYklfScE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance&nbsp;</em>is going offline in February.</figcaption></figure><p>If you happen to already own&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance&nbsp;</em>and you still want to play it (for some reason) after February 24th, you'll be able to do so, as the offline single-player mode will remain available. That goes for DLC as well.</p>

<p>It's a bit of a mystery that Wizards of the Coast and Tuque Games have decided to completely remove&nbsp;<em>Dark Alliance&nbsp;</em>from sale rather than allowing players to purchase an offline version of the game.</p>

<p>However, given the game's <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/11567/dungeons-dragons-dark-alliance" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">weak critical reception</a>, that mystery might not be so puzzling after all. Our own Tyler was scarcely more positive than many others in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/dungeons-and-dragons-dark-alliance-review" rel="nofollow">his review</a>, citing awkward controls and poor AI as reasons for awarding his 6.5 score.</p>




<p>If you're wondering what&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance&nbsp;</em>is (or was, I suppose), it's a co-op hack-and-slash action-RPG in which you and your friends play as one of four iconic&nbsp;<em>D&amp;D&nbsp;</em>heroes: Drizzt Do'Urden, Catti-brie, Wulfgar, and Bruenor Battlehammer.</p>

<p>Playing as one of these heroes (or all of them if you have a full party), you'll take on iconic&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;</em>monsters, explore the legendary land of Icewind Dale, and earn rewards from defeating tough bosses, allowing you to take on ever more challenging quests.</p>

<p>The game is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/623280/Dungeons__Dragons_Dark_Alliance/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP2037-PPSA02680_00-7187320704565923" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/dark-alliance/9MZ55WCBW7TK" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, so if you want to keep playing it after February, I'd recommend picking it up now if you haven't already.</p>
