            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-adel-upgraded-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has released a new&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>update, and it's got the first of the promised upgraded Nightlord bosses for you to take on.</p>

<p>These bosses were first teased as part of a preview of what's next for the multiplayer-focused spinoff <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-confirmed-sales" rel="nofollow">earlier this month</a>, along with duos, which aren't being included as part of this update, unfortunately. They're due to land later this year.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://www.bandainamcoent.com/news/elden-ring-nightreign-the-everdark-sovereigns-have-emerged" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the official Bandai Namco website, the first upgraded boss you'll be facing is Adel, Baron of the Night, otherwise known as Gaping Jaw on the game's menu screen. The publisher is promising "new moves and increased power", constituting "an even greater threat" to you and your squad.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-upgraded-nightlords-adel.jpg?itok=tlwKx71f 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-upgraded-nightlords-adel.jpg?itok=OV-XRv95 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>'s first upgraded boss is waiting for you.</figcaption></figure><p>Bandai Namco and FromSoftware haven't revealed exactly how Adel will be upgraded for your battle against him, so you'll have to head in and take him on if you want to see exactly how he's going to wreck your squad anew.</p>

<p>Beating the new version of Adel - and, indeed, any other upgraded Nightlords - will net you a new resource named Sovereign Sigils, which you can exchange for unique Relics and other rewards. The first time you beat an upgraded Nightlord will net you extra Sigils as well.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with <i>Elden Ring Nightreign</i>, it's a multiplayer-focused spinoff of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-30m" rel="nofollow">massively successful</a> open-world action RPG&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>, and it also serves as the first ever spinoff of a game in the&nbsp;<em>Souls&nbsp;</em>series or its ancillaries.</p>

<p>The game sees players descending on a randomly-generated map to scavenge for resources and defeat minibosses, level up, and prepare for battle against a Nightlord, a unique boss with new attack patterns and weaknesses, at the end of a three-day period.</p>




<p><em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>has proven hugely successful, but&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>is no slouch in the sales department either; it managed to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">top two million sales on its first day</a>, and it had reached 3.5 million at last count.</p>
