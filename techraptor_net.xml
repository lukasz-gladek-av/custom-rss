            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Riot Games hosted their Riftbound PAX Unplugged panel this past weekend. Taking full advantage of the venue of one of the largest tabletop conventions in the business, the studio laid out a roadmap for their bestselling <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/league-of-legends" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>League of Legends</em></a> card game.</p>

<h2>The <em>Riftbound</em> PAX Unplugged Panel Announcements</h2>

<p>In a <a href="https://riftbound.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/announcements/recap-of-our-pax-unplugged-panel/" rel="nofollow">recap post</a> on Riot Games' website, the studio recounts everything announced at the Riftbound PAX Unplugged panel.&nbsp; The post opens by reiterating new Champions and mechanics coming in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/riot-games-releases-riftbound-spiritforged-preview-confirming-new-mechanics-for" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Riftbound: Spiritforged</em></a> set. This includes familiar faces like Draven, Rumble, and Fiora and new mechanics like Gold and Repeat.</p>

This includes new mechanics like Quick-Draw, which lets you play equipment as a reaction and attach it to a unit you control, and Weaponmaster, which lets you equip iconic characters with their signature weapons at a discount.</p>

<p>For collectors out there, the <em>Riftbound</em> PAX Unplugged panel confirms the Spiritforged set will include 30 Overnumbered cards with 12 signature variants. In addition, local game store events will include special Nexus Night promo cards. This was in response to the game's initial release running out of Nexus Night cards too quickly. Hopefully, it doesn't happen again for this new set.</p>

<p>The panel briefly switched to discussing the competitive scene of <em>Riftbound</em>. It did confirm the first Regional Qualifiers will be taking place in 2025 in Houston, and in 2026 in Bologna Italy and Las Vegas, USA, respectively. The panel's roadmap also confirms Qualifier events will also be happening in Europe, Australia, and PAX East.</p>

No other information was provided, except for some promotional artwork. <em>Unleashed</em> does put the steampunk boxer, and Arcane star, Vi, center stage. As for what surprises are contained within the set, that remains to be seen.</p>
