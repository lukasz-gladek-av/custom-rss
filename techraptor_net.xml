            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>developer Ironwood Studios and publisher Kepler Interactive have announced&nbsp;<em>Whispers in the Woods</em>, a brand new DLC expansion that will introduce new story elements, new anomalies, and much more.</p>

<p><em>Whispers in the Woods</em>, which is due out sometime this year, is distinct from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pacific-drive-endless-expeditions-update" rel="nofollow">previous</a> free <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pacific-drive-update-customization" rel="nofollow">updates</a> for the driving roguelike; it looks like it'll be a fully paid expansion that will bring a significant amount of new content to the game.</p>

<p>Per its Steam page,&nbsp;<em>Whispers in the Woods</em>&nbsp;will bring a new "8-12-hour story" to&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive</em>, and it'll be fully voiced as well, with new characters to get to know. Not only that, but you can jump into the expansion from either a new or an existing save, so even if you have a save file that's close to the game's conclusion, you can still play.</p>

<p>Naturally, there will also be new cosmetic elements for you to add to your car, so if you didn't feel like your janky 70s wagon was already kitted out enough, then this DLC has you covered.</p>

<p><em>Whispers in the Woods&nbsp;</em>is also introducing a new system to&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>in the form of Artifacts, which Ironwood and Kepler say will "create mysterious changes and effects to you and the world around you".</p>

<p>You'll need to carry Artifacts in order to survive the expansion's new areas and dangers, but doing so also "increases the challenge you and your car will face", so you'll need to weigh up how much risk you want to take.</p>




<p>We don't have a release date for&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Whispers in the Woods&nbsp;</em>expansion yet, but it'll presumably be available across all platforms on which the game can be found when it does arrive. In the meantime, you can remind yourself of what our very own Will thought of the base game by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/pacific-drive" rel="nofollow">checking out their review here</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Mega Malamar Revealed for Pokemon Legends: Z-A]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mega-malamar-pokemon-legends-z-a</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mega-malamar-revealed-for-pokemon-legends-z-a.1293675/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has announced another Mega Evolution form for the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>, and this time, it's the turn of topsy-turvy squid Malamar.</p>

<p>Over the last few weeks, the publisher, along with developer Game Freak, has been drip-feeding new Mega Evolution announcements, including a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mega-victreebel-revealed-pokemon-legends-za" rel="nofollow">surprisingly effective horror reveal</a> for Mega Victreebel and a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mega-hawlucha-pokemon-legends-z-a" rel="nofollow">rather touching wrestling match</a> between Mega Hawlucha and Machamp.</p>

<p>Today's reveal shows off the Mega Evolved form of the Dark/Psychic-type Malamar, which is itself the evolved form of the rather adorable Inkay. As you'd probably imagine for a 'mon that looked rather sinister in its original incarnation, Mega Malamar has a sleek, dark appearance that's just a touch unsettling as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-malamar-close-up.jpg?itok=UBAXi1x0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-malamar-close-up.jpg?itok=YzlEldPd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>'s latest Mega Evolution is the positively weird-looking Mega Malamar.</figcaption></figure><p>Mega Malamar's debut trailer is perhaps a little less strange or extravagant than its predecessors, although a preceding video did show people professing their love for the Pokemon after presumably being hypnotized by its powers.</p>

<p>In today's trailer, we get to see Mega Malamar face off against both Charizard and Dragonite, and it makes short work of them thanks to its aforementioned hypnotic abilities. The trailer concludes with Malamar seemingly hypnotizing its trainer as well, leading to them waking up on a bench surrounded by Malamars.</p>

<p>Naturally, Mega Malamar will be appearing in the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>, which will be the second game in what can now be considered the overarching&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends&nbsp;</em>sub-series.</p>

<p>The game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-release-date-pokemon-presents" rel="nofollow">due to launch on October 16th</a>, will take place entirely in the city of Lumiose in the Kalos region, and it'll see players helping to oversee an urban redevelopment plan while also taking part in a city-wide battle tournament.</p>




<p>You'll be able to play&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>when it launches on October 16th for both Switch 2 and Switch, and if you want to know how the game's shaping up, you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/pokemon-legends-z-preview-another-reason-to-get-switch-2" rel="nofollow">check out our preview here</a>.</p>
