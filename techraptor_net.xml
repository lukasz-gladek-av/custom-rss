            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher THQ Nordic and developer Three Fields Entertainment have announced the release date for vehicular destruction sandbox&nbsp;<em>Wreckreation</em>, and it's causing some serious car-nage next month.</p>

<p>As revealed in a new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Wreckreation&nbsp;</em>will land on PC and current-gen consoles (but no Nintendo Switch 2, unfortunately) on October 28th. It'll let you - and, optionally, your friends - loose in MixWorld, a "400 square kilometer racing realm that is yours to create, shape - and wreck".</p>

<p>As the title suggests,&nbsp;<em>Wreckreation&nbsp;</em>is built mainly around its core arcade racing loop, which combines high-speed racing and driving with&nbsp;<em>Burnout</em>-style crashes and stunts. If you're still waiting for&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wreckfest-2-early-access-release-date" rel="nofollow"><em>Wreckfest 2&nbsp;</em>to come out of Early Access</a>, this one should do more than just tide you over.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wreckreation-release-date-loops.jpg?itok=izuzCDGo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wreckreation-release-date-loops.jpg?itok=1HDUGAN1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Wreckreation&nbsp;</em>brings vehicular chaos in October.</figcaption></figure><p>The game's main attraction, however, is the aforementioned MixWorld, where you can place whatever crazy loops, ramps, and pipes your brain can conjure, before tasking your friends to take on your impossible gauntlet.</p>

<p>As THQ Nordic and Three Fields say,&nbsp;<em>Wreckreation</em>'s MixWorld will offer you the chance to "build roads on and off-road", as well as "out to sea or up in the sky", so if you love to spend hours with&nbsp;<em>GTA Online</em>&nbsp;players' racing creations,&nbsp;<em>Wreckreation&nbsp;</em>is for you.</p>

<p>You can also customize your vehicle, as well as the gameplay challenges you're asking players to complete. Even time of day, weather conditions, and whether there's any traffic on the road can be customized and controlled.</p>

<p>If you want to get a sense for what&nbsp;<em>Wreckreation&nbsp;</em>will play like (as well as seeing some pretty gnarly crashes), then you can check out the game's release date announcement trailer right here.</p>




<p><em>Wreckreation&nbsp;</em>is scheduled to launch for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1594040/Wreckreation/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10005975/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/wreckreation/9n0llb6pg0r4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on October 28th. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things THQ Nordic-related.</p>
