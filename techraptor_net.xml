The box will contain five booster packs, an Elsa-themed storage box, three punch-out dividers, and a glimmer foil promo card of <em>Elsa - The Fifth Spirit</em>. This Elsa Gift Box will be available this October at an MSRP of $29.99.</p>

<p>Lastly, the <em>Disney Lorcana Fabled</em> preview has confirmed the launch of two new formats. The first, Super Sealed, is a variation on a sealed draft. You get four boosters from each of the most recent sets. From there, you must make a three-ink color deck of 50 cards in under 60 minutes.</p>

<p>You are allowed to change cards between matches, but must revert back to the initial deck after each round and before the start of a new match.</p>

<p>The second format is called Triple Deck Constructed Format (Single Elimination). As the name implies, players create three decks, each covering all six ink colors. Players then play best-of-three against one another. You can even use an ink token to "bench" one of your opponents decks. The Grand Finals are determined in a best-of-five.</p>

<p><em>Disney Lorcana Fabled</em> will have a pre-release on August 29. The set's full release will be September 5.</p>
