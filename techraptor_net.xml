            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, a brand new game in the&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong&nbsp;</em>series and the beloved ape's first 3D platformer since 1999's&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong 64</em>.</p>

<p>As revealed during today's Switch 2 Direct show,&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>will launch exclusively for the Nintendo Switch 2 on July 17th, so it'll just miss the console's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">launch date of June 5th</a>&nbsp;and won't be included as part of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-launch-lineup" rel="nofollow">Switch 2 launch lineup</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, since this is a&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong&nbsp;</em>game, the story of&nbsp;<em>Bananza&nbsp;</em>revolves around DK uncovering a treasure trove of golden bananas, only for them to be stolen away by the nefarious VoidCo, causing him to set out on a quest to retrieve his hoard.</p>

He's got a rather expressive face that lends itself well to the world in which he finds himself for this adventure.</p>

<p>The trailer shows DK platforming his way around a few open-looking environments, as well as burrowing down into the ground to explore the level below the surface.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It isn't clear to what extent you'll be able to seamlessly transition between above-ground levels and underground stages, but I'd expect that given the Switch 2's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-specs-revealed" rel="nofollow">still-relatively-modest tech specs</a>, that's not going to be the case.</p>

<p>In any case, you can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, which shows off a fair bit of gameplay and DK's endearing redesign, right here.</p>




<p><em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>is just one of a number of games coming to the Switch 2. Others include&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a>, which is coming at launch alongside new versions of&nbsp;<em>Breath of the Wild&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, as well as games like EA's hugely successful&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>when it <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/featured-games/donkey-kong-bananza/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">launches for Switch 2</a> on July 17th.</p>
