            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-profits-plummet-switch-150m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has released its financial statement for the nine-month period between April and December 2024, and although the Switch has hit a new sales milestone, profits and sales are down overall.</p>

<p>In its financial <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250204_3e.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">presentation</a>, Nintendo acknowledges that sales are down by 31.4% and net profit has fallen by 41.9% when compared to the same nine-month period last year, with sales of both hardware and software plummeting.</p>

<p>Despite this, the company also reveals that the Switch has reached 150 million lifetime sales, putting it within throwing distance of the Nintendo DS family (around 154 million) and perhaps even the all-time title holder, Sony's PS2 (160 million).</p>

<p>Newcomer&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>sold almost 4 million copies, while&nbsp;<em>Nintendo Switch Sports&nbsp;</em>picked up another 2.63 million sales for itself. Incredibly,&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&nbsp;</em>sold 5.38 million units during this time period. Could there still be Switch owners out there who don't own this game?</p>

<p>Of course, there's one big, massive exclamation point hanging over these figures, and that's the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">recent announcement</a> of the Nintendo Switch 2, which will be unveiled in full during a Nintendo Direct showcase in April.</p>

<p>While the console itself wasn't revealed until January, Nintendo did reveal in May that a Switch 2 announcement <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation" rel="nofollow">would come before April 2025</a>, suggesting that many consumers may have been holding off on buying a Switch in order to wait for the new machine to appear.</p>




<p>&nbsp;With regards to its future, Nintendo points to a number of games it's releasing in the coming months, including the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-announced" rel="nofollow">remastered version of&nbsp;<em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em></a>, which is due to land in March.</p>

<p>The publisher also recommits to 2025 releases for&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-a-announced" rel="nofollow">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metroid-prime-4-beyond-2025" rel="nofollow"><em>Metroid Prime 4</em></a>, both of which are apparently still slated to come to the original Switch (although I wouldn't be surprised to see Switch 2 ports for both).</p>

<p>You can check out Nintendo's full <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250204e.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">financial results document right here</a> if you want to get super-nerdy with stats and figures.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/relic-knights-is-getting-relaunch-courtesy-of-ignition-core-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Relic Knights</em> is coming back under new management. The license for the anime-inspired miniatures skirmish game series, which went dormant after a controversial crowdfunding campaign, has been picked up by Ignition Core Games. Better still, it will be on sale at this year's Adepticon.</p>



<p>According to a press release, Ignition Core Games, Relic Knights will relaunch on the 27th of March at Adepticon at the Ignition Core Games/ Scale 75 USA booth.&nbsp; They will offer a 2-Player Starter Set and three additional miniatures to expand the units in the starter set. Those miniatures are Combat Armor Cordelia, Alabaster Automata, and Infiltrator Candy.</p>

If you want to know how it plays before you buy, you'll have plenty of opportunities.</p>

<p>The releases will not end there. Throughout 2025, Relic Knights will have faction releases for Shattered Sword, Black Diamond, and Cerci Speed Circuit.&nbsp; Everything offered will be available via direct sale, at conventions, or on Ignition Core Games' website from a stock of on-hand inventory.</p>

<p>A discount is possible if you were a backer of the <em>Relic Knights Second Edition</em> Kickstarter campaign. If you directly email Ignition Core Games, you can get a "steep discount" on anything in the product line you pledged for during the campaign.</p>

<p>To quote the press release directly, "It's not a perfect solution but we will provide you with your pledged items at the lowest prices possible."</p>

<p>This is important since the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sodapopminiatures/relic-knights-2nd-edition/description" rel="nofollow"><em>Relic Knights Second Edition</em> Kickstarter</a> campaign ended in disaster. It was originally developed by Soda Pop Miniatures and published by Ninja Division, the same studio behind <em>Super Dungeon Explore</em>.</p>

<p>Despite the campaign raising an impressive $386,826, production was stalled and stopped for several years. Ultimately, all Kickstarter Backers were left with nothing as <a href="https://boardgamewire.com/index.php/2024/03/11/thousands-of-kickstarter-backers-left-out-of-pocket-as-super-dungeon-explore-publisher-ninja-division-files-for-bankruptcy/" rel="nofollow">Ninja Division filed for bankruptcy</a>.</p>

<p>For those still interested in enjoying the anime-inspired action of <em>Relic Knights,</em> Adepticon is a few months away.</p>
