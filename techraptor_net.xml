            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft and developer Massive Entertainment have announced&nbsp;<em>From the Ashes</em>, a brand new story expansion for&nbsp;<em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora&nbsp;</em>that's set to launch alongside the third movie this December.</p>

<p>As revealed <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-from-the-ashes-dlc-announced-release-timed-with-fire-and-ash-movie" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">by IGN</a>, the new DLC will arrive on December 19th, which is the same day on which James Cameron's&nbsp;<em>Avatar: Fire and Ash&nbsp;</em>arrives in cinemas. Presumably, it will once again sell absolutely shedloads of tickets, although I cannot for the life of me fathom why.</p>

<p><em>From the Ashes&nbsp;</em>will, according to creative director Omar Bouali, take place "a few weeks" after the events of&nbsp;<em>Fire and Ash</em>, and around six months after the events of&nbsp;<em>Frontiers of Pandora&nbsp;</em>and its existing story packs.</p>

<p>Watching&nbsp;<em>Fire and Ash&nbsp;</em>may well give you a better experience in&nbsp;<em>From the Ashes</em>, too; while Bouali says the two "are set in different reigons of Pandora", there's still some "shared DNA" between the two, with Ubisoft working alongside Cameron's Lightstorm Entertainment to make both stories "complimentary".</p>

<p>It's likely that we'll learn more about&nbsp;<em>Fire and Ash&nbsp;</em>over the next few months, but you can at least expect to encounter the Ash Clan that partially lend their name to the DLC, as well as "one very special creature", about which Ubisoft is remaining tight-lipped for now.</p>

<p><em>From the Ashes&nbsp;</em>will arrive in the same month as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-update-new-game-plus" rel="nofollow">a major update</a> for&nbsp;<em>Frontiers of Pandora</em>, which is scheduled to add a New Game Plus mode to the&nbsp;<em>Far Cry</em>-esque FPS, as well as a third-person view mode and more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Department of Homeland Security Posts Bizarre Pokemon-Themed ICE Raid Video]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/department-of-homeland-security-pokemon-video-post</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The US Department of Homeland Security has posted a bizarre and, frankly, rather tasteless video that splices footage of ICE immigrant raids with clips from the iconic intro to the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>anime.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://kotaku.com/department-homeland-security-ice-pokemon-song-video-2000627900" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Kotaku</a>, the video was uploaded to the official DHS X account yesterday. It shows various enforcement officers, including ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement), police officers, and the military breaking into properties and arresting people.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it also shows clips from the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>anime, as well as using the anime's theme song to soundtrack the upsetting montage. What's more, the words "Department of Homeland Security" appear at the beginning of the video, rendered in the very recognizable&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>font.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/us-department-of-homeland-security-pokemon-video-card.jpg?itok=z-WB1I4s 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/us-department-of-homeland-security-pokemon-video-card.jpg?itok=rPssa17V 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The DHS' new video also features various "criminal aliens" rendered in&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>card format.</figcaption></figure><p>As if all of that wasn't enough, the video also shows various "criminal aliens" arrested by ICE, but rendered in a sort of parody&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>card format. Their weakness is even listed as the Ice type, which feels particularly tasteless.</p>

<p>I've got to wonder exactly whose idea this was and why they thought it was okay, but of course, it's possible that this video did indeed travel its way up the chain and met with approval at every turn, which is perhaps even more demoralizing than this being one person's maverick whim.</p>

<p>One body whose approval this video almost certainly did not obtain is, of course, Nintendo, the company that holds the IP rights to&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>. If you're familiar with Nintendo, you'll also know that the Japanese gaming giant is, to put it mildly, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-palworld-pocketpair-lawsuit" rel="nofollow">fond</a> of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-garrys-mod-takedowns" rel="nofollow">litigation</a> in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-genki-switch-2-lawsuit" rel="nofollow">certain circumstances</a>.</p>

<p>I'm no legal expert, but I suspect that if Nintendo wanted to, it could probably challenge DHS over its (presumably) unlicensed use of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>&nbsp;assets in this video. I don't imagine the parody defense would get the department too far in that instance, but again, not an expert.</p>

Let's hope sanity and wisdom prevail and the video is taken down, and whoever's responsible for it has a long, hard think about what they've done.</p>
