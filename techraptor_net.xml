            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Chucklefish and Robotality have announced that magical life sim&nbsp;<em>Witchbrook&nbsp;</em>won't be coming out in 2025 as originally planned.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1846700/view/501712599669276725" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on Steam, the two studios say that while they had originally planned to release the game in winter, you won't be able to play&nbsp;<em>Witchbrook&nbsp;</em>until 2026. This, they say, will give them the "time needed to ensure the world feels rich, immersive, and alive".</p>

<p>Despite this setback, Chucklefish and Robotality say that&nbsp;<em>Witchbrook&nbsp;</em>is "taking shape exactly as [they] hoped", and that the game will be "full of charm, depth, and detail" when you do finally get to check it out next year.</p>

You can check that map (which is interactive!) out <a href="https://www.witchbrook.com/map-of-mossport/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>.</p>

<p>Incidentally, this isn't the magical life sim that was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-indie-delays" rel="nofollow">delayed as a result of&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>'s release</a>; that was&nbsp;<em>Little Witch in the Woods</em>, which went on to release on September 15th. I guess this is kind of like indie game convergent evolution.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Witchbrook&nbsp;</em>is, it's a life sim in which you'll play "the newest resident witch in the bustling seaside city of Mossport". There, you'll find new people to befriend, spells to cast, and recipes to craft, as well as plenty of customization options for both you and your abode.</p>

<p>Naturally, you'll have plenty to do outside of the titular college as well. You'll be able to explore Mossport during your off-hours, playing games at the arcade or simply taking artful snapshots of the city with your camera.</p>




<p><em>Witchbrook&nbsp;</em>launches sometime in 2026 for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1846700/Witchbrook/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/witchbrook/9P54Q8W3TF4W" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and both Nintendo Switch consoles. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Paradox and developer The Chinese Room have announced the PC specs you're going to need if you want to run&nbsp;<em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>when it launches next week.</p>

<p>As you can probably imagine, running the game at Ultra settings in 4K is going to take a pretty beefy rig, but if you're happy to make a few compromises, then a less powerful machine will probably do the trick.</p>

<p>Handily, the two studios provide seven different presets depending on what kind of level you want to run the game at, so you should be able to find something that works for you.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-pc-specs-combat.jpg?itok=v27gKSSS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-pc-specs-combat.jpg?itok=yVO5R_qK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</em>'s PC specs are finally here.</figcaption></figure><p>Here's all the PC spec info you're going to need if you want to run&nbsp;<em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</em>. Bear in mind that all of these presets require 30GB of free storage, and you'll also need Windows 11 for all but the lowest preset, as well as 16GB RAM (8GB will suffice for Minimum).</p>

<h3>Minimum - 1080p at 30fps, Low preset</h3>

<ul><li>GPU: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 6GB,&nbsp;AMD Radeon RX 480 8GB, or Intel Arc A580 8GB</li>
	<li>CPU: Intel Core i3-8350K or AMD Ryzen 3 3300X</li>
</ul><h3>Recommended - 1080p at 60fps, High preset</h3>

<ul><li>GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti 8GB or AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT 12GB</li>
	<li>CPU: Intel Core i5-12600K or AMD Ryzen 5 5600X</li>
</ul><h3>2K - 1440p at 60fps, High preset</h3>

<ul><li>GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 8GB or AMD Radeon RX 7700 XT 12GB</li>
	<li>CPU: Intel Core i5-12600K or AMD Ryzen 5 5600X</li>
</ul><h3>4K - 2160p at 60fps, High preset</h3>

<ul><li>GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 16GB or AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX 24GB</li>
	<li>CPU: Intel Core i7-13700K or AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D</li>
</ul><h3>Ultra 2K DLSS - 1440p at 60fps, Ultra preset, DLSS enabled</h3>

<ul><li>GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti 8GB or RTX 5060 8GB</li>
	<li>CPU: Intel Core i5-12600K or AMD Ryzen 5 5600X</li>
</ul><h3>Ultra 4K DLSS + FG 2X - 2160p at 60fps, Ultra preset, DLSS (Quality) and Frame Gen enabled</h3>

<ul><li>GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 12GB or RTX 5060 Ti 16GB</li>
	<li>CPU: Intel Core i7-13700K or AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D</li>
</ul><h3>Ultra 4K + DLSS + MFG 4X - 2160p at 240fps, DLSS (Performance) and Multi Frame Gen (4x) enabled</h3>

<ul><li>GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 16GB</li>
	<li>CPU: Intel Core i7-13700K or AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D</li>
</ul><p>Whew! That's a lot of presets. As you can see, later presets only list DLSS, which is why you won't see AMD cards as part of those listings; it hasn't yet been confirmed whether the game will support AMD's FSR technology or not.</p>




<p><em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>launches <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-october-2025" rel="nofollow">on October 21st</a> for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/532790/Vampire_The_Masquerade__Bloodlines_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10007767/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/9pf9rkwb9b50" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> (and it's been a very long road indeed to get here).
