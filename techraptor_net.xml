            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dead Space&nbsp;</em>creator Glen Schofield has revealed that he pitched a new game in the series to EA "recently", and that while the studio rejected his pitch, he's optimistic that the series may have a future.</p>

<p>That's according to an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-can-save-you-30-40-million-on-the-idea-i-have-dead-space-creator-glen-schofield-already-making-calls-about-dead-space-4-now-ea-has-new-owners" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">IGN</a>, in which Schofield says he "went to [EA] recently" and that they told him they were "not interested anymore" when it came to&nbsp;<em>Dead Space</em>, despite his assertions that he could "save [the company] $30 to $40 million on the idea that [he has]".</p>

<p>Schofield then says that he's got "quite a few ideas", presumably for several different games, but that "one of them is&nbsp;<em>Dead Space 4</em>". He points to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-could-go-private-powered-by-saudi-and-private-equity-money" rel="nofollow">EA's recent purchase by a consortium of investors</a> as an "opportunity" and says he's "already making calls".</p>

<p>He also says he wants the franchise to branch out into "different mediums", suggesting that movies or a TV series based on&nbsp;<em>Dead Space&nbsp;</em>could be "great".</p>

<p>Still, Schofield says he doesn't think EA made a profit from the 2023&nbsp;<em>Dead Space&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dead-space" rel="nofollow">remake</a>, which is presumably why the company is so reticent to do anything new with the IP. Here's hoping it finds its way into the hands of someone who wants to use it for good.</p>

<p>The aforementioned remake is the last major project to be released in the&nbsp;<em>Dead Space&nbsp;</em>series. It's a ground-up rework of the 2008 original, adding new story scenes and gameplay mechanics to the first game's tale of spindly Necromorphs and sinister Markers.</p>




<p>Schofield himself wasn't involved in that remake, though; while it was in development, he was working on&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/callisto-protocol" rel="nofollow">The Callisto Protocol</a>&nbsp;</em>alongside Striking Distance Studios, although he <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-space-co-creator-pursuing-new-opportunities-less-than-year-after-callisto" rel="nofollow">departed the developer</a> less than a year after that game's release.</p>

<p>Subsequently, back in February, it was revealed that Striking Distance had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/striking-distance-layoffs-callisto-protocol" rel="nofollow">laid off "most" of its employees</a>, so it sounds as though Schofield may have been right to make his exit when he did.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see whether Glen Schofield's&nbsp;<em>Dead Space&nbsp;</em>pitch manages to get anywhere in the future, but for now, you can (and should) grab the&nbsp;<em>Dead Space&nbsp;</em>remake on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1693980/Dead_Space/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/dead-space/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/dead-space/9nlb6v0gnc9p" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>
