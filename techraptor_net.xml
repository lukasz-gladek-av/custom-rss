            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The latest <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> ban list update is here. Wizards of the Coast's latest change to their widely popular card game includes an "early rotation" for the popular Standard format, banning seven cards from competitive play.</p>



<p>In an official blog post, several members of Magic's design team, Carmen Klomparens, Jadine Klomparens, Arya Karamchandani, Garvin Varhey, and Dave Finseth, broke down the Magic: The Gathering ban list update and explained their process.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-ban-list-update-cori-steel-cutter-card-artwork.jpg?itok=VbhosPdS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-ban-list-update-cori-steel-cutter-card-artwork.jpg?itok=KOIt6fZM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As mentioned before, the format changing the most from this ban list is Standard format. Officially, seven cards are now banned from Standard, which is a lot according to Jadinee Klomparens. Those seven cards are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><em>Cori-Steel Cutter</em></li>
	<li><em>Abuelo's Awakening</em></li>
	<li><em>Monstrous Rage</em></li>
	<li><em>Heartfire Hero</em></li>
	<li><em>Up the Beanstalk</em></li>
	<li><em>Hopeless Nightmare</em></li>
	<li><em>This Town Ain't Big Enough</em></li>
</ul><p>There is a lot to unpack. The biggest offender on this list is Cori-Steel Cutter. It is a key card in the Izzet Prowess deck, represented in 40% of the Standard format meta at the recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-final-fantasy-spotlight-event-is-coming-to-japan" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy</em> Pro Tour</a>.</p>

<p>According to the post, Izzet Prowess is having an overall negative effect on the meta. This is why <em>Cori-Steel Cutter</em> is getting banned, it is too strong compared to everything else. Low cost, big impact, still affects the battlefield even if it's destroyed quickly. For the long-term health of the game, it is a sensible ban.</p>

<p>As for the other bans in the <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> ban list update, they are mostly for similar reasons. <em>Monstrous Rage</em> is too strong in mono-red decks so it's out. Same thing with <em>Heartfire Hero</em>. <em>Abuelo's Awakening</em> has synergized too well with <em>Omniscience</em>, so it's on the list. <em>Up The Beanstalk</em> has been on ban lists before in Modern format, and it is now banned in Standard for similar reasons.</p>

<p><em>Hopeless Nightmare</em> has proven to be too potent in self-bounce decks, making it a disruptive, aggressive deck. Finally, <em>This Town Ain't Big Enoug</em>h, when parred with <em>Stormchaser's Talent</em>, leads to a lot of momentum-killing endgame lock-outs. So to keep things fun, it is now banned.</p>

<p>Overall, this updated ban list is a measured change for the game. As for how this will change the competitive meta, that is something only time can tell.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/space-marine-2-will-get-a-second-year-of-free-and-paid-updates-and-dlc.1231947/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Saber Interactive and publisher Focus Entertainment have announced that&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>will get a second year of free updates and paid DLC.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/229-june-community-update" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">community update</a>, the studios say that a second yearly season pass is in the works, made possible by the "unwavering support" of the&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>community. The new pass will offer "new PvE missions, enemies, weapons, and...more", according to Focus, but it's too early for the studio to pin down exactly what's coming.</p>

<p>As well as that second year of content,&nbsp;a major&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>update is coming in September. Update 10.0 will include a brand new PvP mode, with the intervening Update 9.0 bringing "only balancing changes".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/space-marine-2-second-year-updates-dlc-shooting.jpg?itok=ajGZlZZF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/space-marine-2-second-year-updates-dlc-shooting.jpg?itok=s4V_i5o3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>is getting itself a second year of content.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Focus and Saber, the new PvP mode will take place on a brand new map, and it'll pit two warring Chaos factions against one another. You will also be able to pilot a Helbrute, which pretty much justifies the new mode in and of itself.</p>

<p>As part of this new mode, you can also expect new Chaos-themed armor sets to be added to&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>, and a new melee weapon will also be added in the form of the Power Axe, so you'll have another way to cleave heretics in twain (or followers of the False Emperor, whatever your poison may be).</p>

<p>Update 10.0 will additionally bring a new class in the form of the Techmarine, which Focus and Saber say they'll reveal more about in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>The latest community update also contains lots of information about how Saber and Focus learned from the new Siege Mode's public test period, so if you had strong opinions about that mode, you might want to check out their thoughts on that.</p>




<p>Elsewhere in&nbsp;<em>Space Marine&nbsp;</em>news, it was revealed recently that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-space-marine-3-revealed" rel="nofollow">a third&nbsp;<em>Space Marine&nbsp;</em>game</a> is in development, and while not much has been revealed about it yet, we do know that it will likely see protagonist Captain Titus returning from the previous two installments.</p>

<p>Not only that, but the devs behind&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>are currently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-marine-2-devs-hasbro-tentpole-ip" rel="nofollow">working on a brand new AAA-level game</a> using a "tentpole" Hasbro IP. If it doesn't turn out to be a&nbsp;<em>Monopoly&nbsp;</em>Soulslike, I'll be very sad indeed.</p>
