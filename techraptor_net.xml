            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elder-scrolls-vi-auction-could-let-you-create-an-in-game-npc-for-charity.1112145/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elder-scrolls-vi-auction-charity-npc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bethesda is holding a charity auction that could allow you to create your very own character to appear in&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls VI</em>, with all proceeds from the auction going to the Make-a-Wish Foundation.</p>

<p>In an announcement <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/2KceBLysMenA9JY9LsnSL3/bid-on-a-chance-to-create-a-character-for-the-elder-scrolls-vi" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on its website, Bethesda says the winner of the auction will get "the opportunity to work with Bethesda Game Studios to create a character to appear as an NPC in&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls VI</em>".</p>

<p>All money made from the auction will go directly to Make-a-Wish, and the auction is open to anyone in the United States, although you'll probably want to have a fair bit of cash handy if you're planning to bid.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-elder-scrolls-vi-make-a-wish-foundation-skyrim.jpg?itok=tEaLNbns 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-elder-scrolls-vi-make-a-wish-foundation-skyrim.jpg?itok=P1vxVeO9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>See that NPC in front of the Dragonborn? That could be your NPC, only in&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls VI&nbsp;</em>instead of&nbsp;<em>Skyrim</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>At time of writing, current bidding stands at a whopping $11,650, so you're going to have to bid over that if you want to create your own&nbsp;<em>Elder Scrolls VI&nbsp;</em>character. Still, at least everything is going to charity!</p>

<p>Of course, it is worth noting that&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls VI&nbsp;</em>currently doesn't have a release window; in fact, we know very little about the game, beyond the fact that it's presumably still in development and that it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elder-scrolls-vi-after-2026-no-ps5" rel="nofollow">probably won't release until next year or later</a>.</p>

<p>It's also worth noting that Bethesda doesn't provide any kind of time frame in its post, so it could be a while before you're invited to collaborate with the studio to make your own&nbsp;<em>Elder Scrolls VI&nbsp;</em>character.</p>

<p>Again, though, all of the proceeds for the bid are going to charity, so if you've got a lot of money knocking around and you're looking to spend it on a good cause, you could do a heck of a lot worse than this.</p>




<p><em>The Elder Scrolls VI&nbsp;</em>was first announced all the way back in 2018, and since then, Bethesda has been relatively radio-silent regarding the game.</p>

<p>We still don't know where it will be set or what the story will be, nor do we know what to expect with regards to gameplay (although we can guess it'll be a first-person RPG along the lines of its predecessors).</p>

<p>If you'd like to bid on the character creation auction, you can do so by heading over to the Make-a-Wish Foundation's <a href="https://my.onecause.com/event/organizations/sf-0018000000bK8c8AAC/events/vevt:fd137384-5aab-481b-bcc9-95db4365f38b/auctions/silent-auction" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Silent Auction page</a> and searching for "Bethesda", where you'll find an opportunity to contribute. Alternatively, you can <a href="https://secure2.wish.org/site/SPageServer?pagename=dfr_landing" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">make a flat, non-Bethesda-related donation here</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/relic-reveals-b-movie-inspired-turn-based-strategy-game-earth-vs-mars.1112142/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/relic-earth-vs-mars-turn-based-strategy<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Company of Heroes&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Dawn of War&nbsp;</em>developer Relic has revealed&nbsp;<em>Earth vs Mars</em>, a turn-based strategy game that looks like it's taking equal inspiration from&nbsp;<em>Advance Wars&nbsp;</em>and classic 50s sci-fi B-movies.</p>

<p>The studio <a href="https://x.com/relicgames/status/1891851631622328551" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">describes</a> the game as a "Relic Labs-style" project, which probably means it's one of the first efforts we're seeing that's part of Relic's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/relic-entertainment-future-plans" rel="nofollow">intention to branch out and create smaller games</a> alongside its flagship real-time strategy titles.</p>

<p>As you'd probably expect from a game inspired by classic sci-fi,&nbsp;<em>Earth vs Mars&nbsp;</em>takes place during a Martian invasion, which sees Martians "abducting animals and humans and harvesting their atomic essence to create bizarre Martian-creature hybrids". Yikes.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/earth-vs-mars-relic-map.jpg?itok=knPx8MKf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/earth-vs-mars-relic-map.jpg?itok=dDSHUgn- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Earth vs Mars&nbsp;</em>is set during a Martian invasion, but it's a colorful romp inspired by&nbsp;<em>Advance Wars</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Rather than taking the relatively serious&nbsp;<em>XCOM: Enemy Unknown&nbsp;</em>direction, Relic has chosen a more colorful&nbsp;<em>Advance Wars</em>-style aesthetic for&nbsp;<em>Earth vs Mars.</em></p>

<p>In a slightly terrifying twist, you'll be able to create human-creature hybrids of your own to take on the Martians. Specifically, you'll be splicing animals from Earth together, as well as with humans, to "create powerful hybrid supersoldiers" to fight alongside the military. Space Marines look positively cute in comparison.</p>

<p>Relic gives examplkes like "the fast-moving cheetah-fly", "devastating human-rhino hybrids", and "deadly squirrel-cow infantry". It's a good thing this game has a cartoony art style, because this all sounds like it has the potential to be genuinely haunting.</p>

<p>As you progress through&nbsp;<em>Earth vs Mars</em>' 30-plus-mission campaign, you'll gain access to new creatures and encounter new Martian enemies as well, including a "sentient organic weapon" known as the Creep, as well as "the Martians' own mutant creations".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/earth-vs-mars-relic-combat.jpg?itok=JLNqI1Ke 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/earth-vs-mars-relic-combat.jpg?itok=IVS2OfI9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Advance Wars&nbsp;</em>influence is really shining through here.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as the aforementioned campaign,&nbsp;<em>Earth vs Mars&nbsp;</em>will also include an online multiplayer mode where you can face off against other players, plus a versus mode in which you can battle the AI and a fully-fledged map editor.</p>

<p><em>Earth vs Mars&nbsp;</em>is available to wishlist right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3269230/Earth_vs_Mars/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>. It doesn't have a release date yet, so stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-financials-2024-payday-3<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Payday 3&nbsp;</em>developer Starbreeze Studios has released its yearly financial report for 2024, and things are looking pretty grim for a studio that was already arguably on the ropes at the end of the previous year.</p>

<p>In its latest <a href="https://corporate.starbreeze.com/en/press/press-releases/starbreeze-ab-publ-full-year-2024/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, Starbreeze says its net sales for 2024 fell by about 70% when compared to the previous year; it raked in just 185.9 million Swedish kronor this year compared to 633.5 million last year, with both&nbsp;<em>Payday&nbsp;</em>games dropping well into the double digits (having achieved triple-digit sales last year).</p>

<p>Pretty much all of Starbreeze's numbers are down when compared to 2023, but it looks like the Swedish developer is trying to keep a brave face, with acting CEO Mats Juhl describing the year as "intense but in many ways also successful".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/payday-3-starbreeze-financials-2025.jpg?itok=8EyxTLt9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/payday-3-starbreeze-financials-2025.jpg?itok=sw762rxy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Payday 3&nbsp;</em>hasn't exactly been a big earner for Starbreeze this year.</figcaption></figure><p>Juhl says the year has seen Starbreeze "strengthen[ing] the&nbsp;<em>Payday&nbsp;</em>brand through <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/payday-pubg-crossover-starbreeze-krafton" rel="nofollow">collaborations</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/payday-3-roadmap" rel="nofollow">enhancements</a>" while also "making great progress" with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-dnd-game-2026" rel="nofollow">upcoming&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;</em>multiplayer game Project Baxter</a>.</p>

<p>The acting CEO, who's currently in the position following the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-studios-ceo-steps-down" rel="nofollow">departure of former CEO Tobias Sjögren&nbsp;in March last year</a>, also says Starbreeze has been focusing on "establishing a strong foundation for [its] third-party publishing" this year.</p>

<p>As a reminder, the studio published "Lovecraftian Stone Age" base-builder&nbsp;<em>The Tribe Must Survive&nbsp;</em>this year, as well as the FPS roguelite&nbsp;<em>Roboquest&nbsp;</em>towards the tail end of 2023. We don't currently know what else is on Starbreeze's publishing slate for the future.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-gold-point-scheme-ending-march</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-gold-points-reward-scheme-to-end-in-march.1112067/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-gold-point-scheme-ending-march<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced that its Gold Points reward scheme will be coming to an end in March, but you'll still be able to spend the points you've accrued after the closing date.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://my.nintendo.com/news/7db7f9327a48ec83" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official announcement</a> on its website, the Japanese gaming giant says you'll no longer earn Gold Points for Switch purchases after March 25th. However, since Gold Points expire twelve months after purchase, any you have left over will still be valid until a year after you acquired them.</p>

<p>Naturally, this means that not only will you not be able to earn Gold Points through buying games on Switch, but you also won't get them through Nintendo's website or through redeemed download codes anymore.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-gold-points-ending-cycle.jpg?itok=sj9DujkX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-gold-points-ending-cycle.jpg?itok=rKUvpCaw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nintendo's Gold Point scheme is coming to an end soon.</figcaption></figure><p>If you pre-order anything via the Nintendo eShop prior to March 24th, you'll still earn the Gold Points for that pre-order, even if the payment is processed after March 25th.</p>

<p>However, if you cancel that pre-order, then you won't get Gold Points anymore, even if you re-up your pre-order at some point later down the line. Bear that in mind if you're umming and ahhing about one of your pre-orders right now.</p>

<p>Nintendo confirms later in the announcement post that you'll still be able to spend your Gold Points for up to a year after you get them, even if you're spending them after the cutoff date. You just won't earn any more from that point onwards.</p>

<p>No reason is given in the post for Nintendo's decision to end the Gold Point scheme, but I'm assuming that it has something to do with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">impending arrival of the Switch 2</a>, which may bring a scheme that replaces Gold Points with it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-gold-points.jpg?itok=1ivxFvzf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-gold-points.jpg?itok=_xII6sKn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Nintendo Switch 2's arrival is imminent, which could have something to do with the discontinuation of Gold Points.</figcaption></figure><p>In case you're not aware of Gold Points, they're a reward scheme by which you earn points for certain Switch games or other software you buy. You can then use those points to get discounts on future store purchases.</p>

<p>If you're thinking of buying anything on Switch, it's probably best to do it before March 25th so you can get your hands on those sweet, sweet Gold Points. Stay tuned for more.</p>
