            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Cyanide and publisher Nacon have announced the release date for goblin sneak-'em-up&nbsp;<em>Styx: Blades of Greed</em>, and although the game has technically been delayed, it won't be too much longer before you get to play it.</p>

<p>As announced in a new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Styx: Blades of Greed&nbsp;</em>will be launching across PC and consoles on February 19th. The game was originally set for a 2025 release, a fact that the new release date trailer acknowledges rather neatly.</p>

<p>When it does arrive,&nbsp;<em>Styx: Blades of Greed&nbsp;</em>will be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/styx-sequel-shards-darkness-announced" rel="nofollow">the third game</a> in the&nbsp;<em>Styx</em>&nbsp;series; although the franchise began as a spinoff of 2012 RPG&nbsp;<em>Of Orcs and Men</em>, it's probably fair to say that <i>Styx&nbsp;</i>has overtaken its parent in terms of popularity by now.</p>

This time around, he's after a new power source known as Quartz, which will lead him to take part in the events that will form the basis for&nbsp;<em>Of Orcs and Men</em>'s Black Hand organization's foundation.</p>

<p>Cyanide and Nacon say that they've made "freedom and creativity central to the experience" in&nbsp;<em>Styx: Blades of Greed</em>, too, promising "vast vertical environments" for you to explore, alongside "new tools and powers" to use on your enemies.</p>

<p>These powers include new Mind Control and Time Shift abilities, which will be granted to Styx thanks to his acquisition of Quartz, and abilities from the series like Cloning and Invisibility will return as well, so you should have a decent suite of tools at your disposal.</p>




<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Styx: Blades of Greed&nbsp;</em>when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3290690/Styx_Blades_of_Greed/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10013900" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/styx-blades-of-greed/9NZTKVTDZ2LB" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on February 19th next year. Stay tuned for more on this one (and all other things&nbsp;<em>Styx</em>).</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Planet Coaster 2 Toybox Pack DLC Brings Childlike Wonder This Week]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Frontier Developments has announced a brand new DLC pack for&nbsp;<em>Planet Coaster 2</em>, and it should help to bring a sense of childlike wonder back to your park when it launches later this week.</p>

<p>The Toybox Pack launches across all platforms on December 4th, and in scope terms, it's at about the same level as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/planet-coaster-2-sorcery-pack-dlc" rel="nofollow">September's Sorcery Pack</a>, so you can expect new rides, new scenery pieces, and a new Entertainer to thrill your guests.</p>

<p>As well as the Toybox Pack, a free update is also launching on December 4th, and it'll bring new weather types, changes to&nbsp;<em>Planet Coaster 2</em>'s economy and management systems, and the original&nbsp;<em>Planet Coaster</em>'s iconic Festive Theme, all gratis (assuming you own <em>Planet Coaster 2</em>, of course).</p>

I challenge you not to feel even a little bit of joy looking at the new elements.</p>

<p>A new Entertainer, Max Stormcloud, is also being introduced to "keep your park safe from evil", so if you've been having trouble with demonic invasions in&nbsp;<em>Planet Coaster 2</em>, he should be a boon for you.</p>

<p>New rides include the Vector, an inverting suspended coaster that you can tailor for all audiences, and the Wavesim, a new waterpark addition that gives your guests a realistic surfing experience without all of the training required to be an expert surfer.</p>

<p>As for the free update, you can expect new Snow and Thunderstorm weather effects, as well as a host of returning&nbsp;<em>Planet Coaster&nbsp;</em>blueprints, scalable animated scenery, and plenty of gameplay improvements and economy changes.</p>
