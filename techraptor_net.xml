  </picture><h2>Fifth Place - Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</h2><p>Developer: The Game Kitchen | Release Date: July 31st, 2025</p><p>Written by Austin Suther</p><p>It’s been a hot minute since we’ve seen <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> in 2D (it’s been, well, decades) so it was about time we saw this coveted series go back to its roots with <em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em>.</p><p>With <em>Blasphemous</em> developer The Game Kitchen at the helm of this project, we’re met with a hard-as-nails, fast-paced 2D platformer that feels like a faithful homage to <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> of yesteryear.</p><p>Ryu Hayabusa takes the bench as two new characters get some time to shine: &nbsp;. These two become fused together and have a wide range of exciting powers at their disposal. The player feels like the ultimate badass, slashing through demon enemies like butter and avoiding obstacles with the finesse only a shinobi can accomplish.</p><p>Furthermore, the two ninja’s personal dynamic holds a lot of promise too, so here’s hoping The Game Kitchen brings us a sequel!</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Fourth Place - Hollow Knight: Silksong</h2><p>Developer: Team Cherry | September 4th, 2025</p><p>Written by Tyler Chancey</p><p><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> is an experience that can easily be overshadowed by the fervent attitude of its fans. There was an almost zealous anticipation for Team Cherry's follow-up to the critically acclaimed <em>Hollow Knight</em>. That anticipation continued to grow in excitement as the developers went radio silent over years of development.</p><p><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> releasing this year wasn't just a release, it was an event. An event so momentous it crashed all major digital game storefronts; a feat no other release this year pulled off.</p><p>As for the game itself, it is a remarkable achievement of an action-platformer. It builds upon the foundation of its predecessor, pushes the limits of exploration and difficulty, interweaving it with a narrative about the dangers of organized religion.</p><p>For that achievement, Team Cherry's sophomore effort deserves its praise.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Third Place - Ball x Pit</h2><p>Developer: Kenny Sun | Release Date: October 15th, 2025</p><p>Written by Robert Scarpinito</p><p>Every now and then, an indie game comes around and mashes a couple well-known genres together to create something greater than the sum of its parts. That's exactly what<em> Ball x Pit</em> does. It takes the tried-and-true formula of <em>Arkanoid </em>and twists it into a roguelike, with a dollop of city building and pinball to round it all out.</p><p><em>Ball x Pit</em> has that classic "just one more run" hook to it, especially since each run only lasts a couple minutes. Punctuating each run is a little bit of base building, which slowly snowballs into arguably the more important part of the game.</p><p>The <em>Arkanoid</em>-style gameplay starts out pretty fun, and it only evolves into something more clever as you unlock more characters, items, and abilities. You'll find different strategies based on specific builds, and the endless combinations and low-stakes gameplay makes it so easy to lose hours to what was supposed to be one or two runs.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Second Place - Dispatch</h2><p>Developer: AdHoc Studio | Release Date: October 22nd, 2025</p><p>Written by Austin Suther</p><p>When<em> Dispatch</em>’s main character, Robert Robertson gets defeated by a villain, leaving his mechanical suit in shambles, he’s out of a job and rent is due. He still wants to make a difference with his strong sense of justice, and as fate would have it, he’s given an offer he can’t refuse: dispatch heroes for Torrance, California’s Superhero Dispatch Network, and they’ll help him get back on his feet and repair his suit.</p><p>While at first glance <em>Dispatch </em>plays like any other “choose your own adventure” type of deal, where your choices have impacts on the outcome of the story, this game innovates by fusing a strong narrative with the interactable dispatching mini-game.</p><p>With <em>Dispatch</em>’s lovable cast of villain-turned-heroes, Robert will send them from job-to-job in order to fight crime. Take into consideration if a hero is suited for the job, or else you might experience failure; though, failure isn’t always a bad thing as the writing leads to some pretty funny outcomes. In between your dispatching job, the narrative that gradually amps up over eight strong episodes is sure to capture your heart as much as it did for us at TechRaptor.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Winner - Blue Prince</h2><p>Developer: Dogubomb | Release Date: April 10th, 2025</p><p>Written by Andrew Stretch</p><p>In a world of AAA titles and never-ending sequels and remakes, it's always incredible when such a unique indie experience comes along. <em>Blue Prince</em> is an outstanding game with a simple idea that gets iterated upon, and iterated again, and used in ways that will break your brain to try to interpret.</p><p>Tonda Ros' story of creating <em>Blue Prince</em> is one that perfectly embodies the spirit of Indie game development. After enjoying games and seeing documentaries like <em>Indie Game The Movie</em> came the realization 'Yeah, I can probably do that'.&nbsp;</p><p>Eight years later, <em>Blue Prince</em> released as a game that you can "complete" in what you can consider a normal amount of time, rewarding players' interest and lateral thinking. Though, for those who are as interested in puzzle solving as Ros is for putting puzzles together, you'll get rewarded time and time again as you dig deeper and new discoveries teach you about an incredible larger world without leaving the grounds of the mansion.</p><p><em>Blue Prince</em> has truly infected my mind and the mind of many other gamers wanting to scratch just that little bit deeper. It more than deserves it's place as the Indie GOTY.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
