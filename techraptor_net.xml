            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-is-january-2025s-top-selling-game-according-to-us-sales-data.1115469/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-january-2025-circana-us-sales-data<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Circana has released its US gaming industry sales data for January 2025, and given that it's a month without many significant releases, the number one seller for the month probably won't surprise you.</p>

<p>As noted in a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lioxq6xkoc2w" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky thread</a> by Circana's Mat Piscatella,&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>is once again the month's biggest-selling game across all platforms. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/circana-us-sales-data-2024-top-selling-games" rel="nofollow">was also 2024's top-selling title</a>&nbsp;by Circana's reckoning.</p>

<p>In second place for the all-format chart is&nbsp;<em>Madden NFL 25</em>, which isn't surprising given the colossal commercial success of that franchise <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-sports-college-football-25-best-selling-sports-game" rel="nofollow">and&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football</em></a>, while&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth&nbsp;</em>is in third, bolstered by its January PC release. Perhaps now, it can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-16-rebirth-profits-square-enix" rel="nofollow">strive to meet Square Enix's expectations</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-january-2025-us-sales-data.jpg?itok=_9qjfds5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-january-2025-us-sales-data.jpg?itok=49ipegHv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</em>'s PC release helped it hit third place in Circana's January 2025 sales chart.</figcaption></figure><p>Rounding out the all-format top five are&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC 25</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-ea-sports-fc-25-underperformed" rel="nofollow">underperformed compared to EA's expectations</a>, and&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>, which probably <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/diablo-player-count-gta-5-sales" rel="nofollow">couldn't be said to have underperformed</a> by any expectations in the known universe.</p>

<p>When it comes to specific formats,&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>tops the PlayStation chart for January, while&nbsp;<em>Madden NFL 25&nbsp;</em>tops the Xbox chart. As always, the Switch is dancing to its own tune; Nintendo's chart is dominated by&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Country Returns</em>.</p>

<p>As for player engagement - that is, games on each platform ranked by monthly active users -&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>is top of the chart on PlayStation, while&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>tops Xbox's chart.&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-40m" rel="nofollow">recently hit 40 million players</a>, is number one on Steam.</p>

<p>Spending as a whole across the industry fell by 15% compared to the same period last year, although as Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lioxq42zqc2w" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">points out</a>, January 2025 consists of four weeks rather than last year's five-week tracking period.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-rivals-circana-us-sales-data-january-2025.jpg?itok=jbbUZD91 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-rivals-circana-us-sales-data-january-2025.jpg?itok=AE6L4Gpo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>topped Circana's Steam player engagement chart for January.</figcaption></figure><p>Hardware-wise, the PS5 <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lioxqlznlf2w" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">emerged victorious</a> once again in January, beating out the Xbox and Switch in units and dollar sales. Xbox was second in dollar sales, while Switch came second in units.</p>

<p>As ever, Piscatella's full thread is well worth a look if you want to see some other stats. You can <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lioxq23ems2w" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">check the thread out here</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Hades 2 Developer Says It Won't Recast Voice Actors or Use AI]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hades-2-supergiant-recast-statement</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hades-2-developer-says-it-wont-recast-voice-actors-or-use-ai.1115430/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hades-2-supergiant-recast-statement<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Hades 2&nbsp;</em>developer Supergiant Games has released a statement responding to a voice actor's recent suggestion that they may be recast owing to the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, voice actor Marin Miller, who voices characters like Athena in&nbsp;<em>Hades&nbsp;</em>and its sequel, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/marinmmiller.com/post/3likgdz5k722f" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">said via Bluesky</a> that followers "may hear me get recast in a particular game that is very popular" because "the employer refused to flip to an interim".</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/marinmmiller.com/post/3likglug3322f" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">followup post</a>, Miller made it very clear they were referring to Supergiant, stating that "it would be SUPER helpful if you wrote a GIANT email asking them to flip for their actors". By "flip", Miller presumably means they want Supergiant to put an interim agreement in place to allow them to continue working through the strike.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hades-2-supergiant-voice-actors-recast-statement-gameplay.jpg?itok=MpqsTd-o 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hades-2-supergiant-voice-actors-recast-statement-gameplay.jpg?itok=EK1NZ2eu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hades 2&nbsp;</em>voice actor Marin Miller suggested they may be recast during the SAG-AFTRA strike, but Supergiant denies it.</figcaption></figure><p>Responding - albeit indirectly - to Miller's post <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/supergiantgames.bsky.social/post/3lin7soibi22o" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on Bluesky</a>, Supergiant says it hasn't recast any of its&nbsp;<em>Hades 2&nbsp;</em>actors and that it doesn't intend to do so. The studio also says it "ha[s] respected and will continue to respect any actor needing to pause work" due to the strike.</p>

<p>Supergiant then says that none of its games have been subject to SAG-AFTRA contracts "for a variety of reasons", but that its own contracts "offer the strongest AI protections in the industry" and that its games are "intentionally made by human beings", pledging not to use generative AI in the creation of&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>.</p>

<p>So far, it doesn't look like Miller has responded to Supergiant on social media. It's possible we may hear from them in the coming days, or that Miller has decided to contact Supergiant directly to continue the dialog.</p>

<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Hades 2&nbsp;</em>itself, development on the game continues apace. Released in Early Access <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hades-2-release-date-early-access-now" rel="nofollow">in May last year</a>, the game sees Princess of the Underworld&nbsp;Melinoë battling the forces of Chronos, the Titan of Time.</p>




<p>Earlier this week, Supergiant released the Warsong Update for&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>, adding a number of new features to the game. You can check out the full patch notes for that update <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/503942841152569404" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>.</p>

<p><em>Hades 2&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145350/Hades_II/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>. You can check out our very own Tyler's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/hades-ii-preview-godlike-first-impression" rel="nofollow">preview of the game here</a> if you want to know how it stacks up compared to its predecessor.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-lawless-update-chapter-6-season-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic has released the&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>Lawless update for Chapter 6 Season 2, and it's bringing sweeping heist-themed changes to the map, as well as a&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat&nbsp;</em>crossover and much more.</p>

<p>New crime-themed locations like the Hostile Hotel, the Wise Guys Bookstore, and the Launder Mat (I see what you did there, Epic) have been added to the map, as well as "high-end hangout luxury spa" the Outlaw Oasis and the rather unfortunately-named Shiny Shafts mining operation.</p>

<p>You'll also have the opportunity to do battle with the lupine crime boss Fletcher Kane, and beating him will reward you with a Mythic Pistol and a Medallion that increases your sprint speed. Of course, like all Medallions, it'll also reveal your location to other players.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fortnite-lawless-chapter-6-season-2-big-dill.jpg?itok=YzfNuClL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fortnite-lawless-chapter-6-season-2-big-dill.jpg?itok=wr7ZQZ0m 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fortnite</em>'s new Season has more than just crime-themed updates to offer.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as the aforementioned changes, you'll also find the hip-hop duo known as the Tasty Bois making their debut in this Season, and their debut track "Runamok" is available as a Jam Track in the new Battle Pass.</p>

<p>As a reminder, XP earned in any of&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s gameplay modes <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-battle-pass-xp-simplified" rel="nofollow">now contributes to Battle Passes</a> across all of those modes, so you won't need to stick to Battle Royale to earn enough XP to play that track in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite Festival</em>.</p>

<p>Included in the new Season's Battle Pass are a number of skins, many of them originals; you'll be able to get the likes of Big Dill, Fletcher Kane, and Cassidy Quinn as skins if you pick up the paid pass.</p>

<p>However, you'll also get access to Lin Kuei ninja Sub-Zero, who's joining the pass as&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s first&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat&nbsp;</em>crossover skin. Prominent&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>leaker Shiina has also <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1890484917613498532" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reported</a> that revenant Scorpion will be available later in the season.</p>




<p>In addition to all of the above, Chapter 6 Season 2 also brings&nbsp;<em>Cowboy Bebop</em>-themed quests, new gameplay systems to engage with across&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s new map, and much more. You can read the <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/run-amok-in-fortnite-battle-royale-chapter-6-season-2-lawless?lang=en-US" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">full rundown of what's new right here</a>.</p>

<p><em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>is available to play right now for free across pretty much every platform going. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-friends-pass-crossplay</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/split-fiction-friends-pass-will-support-crossplay-on-any-platform.1115337/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-friends-pass-crossplay<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has revealed that the&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>Friend's Pass will allow you and a friend to enjoy the co-op adventure together on any platform, as long as at least one of you owns the full game.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/split-fiction/split-fiction/features/friends-pass-pc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">FAQ</a> detailing the Friend's Pass, EA says that you can invite a friend to play with you for free on PC, PS5, or Xbox Series X|S, and it doesn't matter which platform you're playing on; "as long as one of you owns the game, both of you can play".</p>

<p>This works in a similar way to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hazelight-josef-fares-new-ip-it-takes-two-sales" rel="nofollow">phenomenally successful&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two</em></a>'s Friend Pass, which also allowed you and a friend to play the whole game together with just one copy, although that pass didn't support crossplay.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/split-fiction-friends-pass-crossplay-sci-fi.jpg?itok=6fQ3REuh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/split-fiction-friends-pass-crossplay-sci-fi.jpg?itok=YciDjkgj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>is the latest game by&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two&nbsp;</em>studio Hazelight.</figcaption></figure><p>The Friend's Pass can also be used as a demo to let you and a friend experience the first few levels of&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>. All you need to do is download the Pass, make sure your friend has done the same, and fire the Pass version of the game up on your platform of choice.</p>

<p>What's more, the Friend's Pass can be used any number of times, so as long as you're playing with someone who owns the full game, your Friend's Pass will work, whether or not you've already used it.</p>

<p>Of course, if all of this doesn't sound like your bag, you can still enjoy&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>in local co-op. There are <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-ceo-25-million-income-layoffs" rel="nofollow">plenty of things</a> about which to (heavily) <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-the-veilguard-shared-world-elements" rel="nofollow">criticize EA</a>, but this isn't one of them, it seems to me.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>, it's the latest game by&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>A Way Out&nbsp;</em>developer Hazelight, led by Josef Fares.</p>

<p>The game sees two writers, Mio and Zoe, "trapped in their own stories after being hooked up to a machine designed to steal their creative ideas". You'll bounce between sci-fi and fantasy worlds, solving co-op puzzles and learning more about both characters in the process.</p>

<p><em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2001120/Split_Fiction/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/split-fiction/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/split-fiction/9N1WXXD1RL8D" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on March 6th. You can take a look at our Erren's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/split-fiction-preview-double-vision" rel="nofollow">very enthusiastic preview of the game here</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Tales of the Shire Delayed Again to July]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-of-shire-delayed-july</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tales-of-the-shire-delayed-again-to-july.1115313/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-of-shire-delayed-july<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Private Division and developer&nbsp;Wētā Workshop have announced that cozy hobbit life sim&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>has once again been delayed, this time to summer.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/talesoftheshire/status/1892635375165731165" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X,&nbsp;Wētā announces that the game's new release date will be July 29th. Rather endearingly, the studio says it wants&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>"to feel like a warm hug from Middle-earth" for all players, "no matter where you play".</p>

<p>While the platform isn't mentioned by name, that wording could suggest that the delay has been put into place to make sure the Switch version of the game is up to par, given that the console is significantly less powerful than its peers.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-the-shire-delayed-july-home.jpg?itok=sFfIdc1L 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tales-of-the-shire-delayed-july-home.jpg?itok=_In8arGv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>is now launching in summer.</figcaption></figure><p>Wētā goes on to say that it wants to make sure "every detail" is just right, "from foot-hair styles to the fluffiest cakes". Well, it wouldn't be a hobbit life sim without those things, I suppose.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there's no sweetener to go along with this announcement, so if you were hoping to try out a&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>demo ahead of the game's release, it looks like you're out of luck, at least for now.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire</em>, it's a cozy life sim set in the sleepy hobbit village of Bywater, where you'll be able to carve out a life for yourself as a peace-loving hobbit. Don't worry; you won't be tasked with throwing any rings into any volcanoes.</p>

<p>Instead, you'll be fishing, chatting to the locals, and arranging your hobbit-hole so that it looks just right. In general, if you've ever fantasized about living life in the Shire and shirking all of that pesky adventure nonsense, this is the game for you.</p>




<p>Revealed in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cozy-hobbit-game-tales-of-shire-announed" rel="nofollow">September 2023</a>,&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-of-shire-gameplay-announce-pc-consoles" rel="nofollow">set for a 2024 launch</a>, but was subsequently delayed to 2025, eventually receiving the aforementioned <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-of-shire-release-date" rel="nofollow">March release date</a> (which sadly no longer stands).</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2016460/Tales_of_the_Shire_A_The_Lord_of_The_Rings_Game/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10010195/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/tales-of-the-shire-a-the-lord-of-the-rings-game/9pkkjbvpp4gw" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/tales-of-the-shire-a-the-lord-of-the-rings-game-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> on July 29th.
