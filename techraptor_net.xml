            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-marine-2-2025-outline-pvp<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>publisher Focus Entertainment has shared what's coming to the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k&nbsp;</em>shooter in 2025, and if you're a fan of the PvP game modes, you'll be pleased with the roadmap.</p>

<p>In a new <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/135-december-community-update" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">December community update</a>, Focus first looks at the last few months for&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>, highlighting things like major updates and the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-player-count-5m" rel="nofollow">rather impressive sales figures</a>.</p>

<p>Following the 2024 recap, Focus then moves onto highlighting what you can expect from next year in&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>, and the first thing on the agenda is more PvP content. The publisher says it knows PvP fans feel "left out", and so next year will bring a new map, custom lobbies, and more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/space-marine-2-pvp-content-roadmap-2025-fight.jpg?itok=dtcfyyLb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/space-marine-2-pvp-content-roadmap-2025-fight.jpg?itok=Zq_a15T3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Focus Entertainment knows&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>PvP fans feel "left out" right now.</figcaption></figure><p>New PvE stuff is also coming next year, starting with the Horde mode, which was teased back when&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>'s first post-launch roadmap was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-roadmap" rel="nofollow">revealed in late August</a>. New Operations and enemies are also on the way for you to tackle.</p>

<p>We also got a look at the next champion making his way to&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>, and it's a Salamander sniper. Focus acknowledges that the Raven Guard Chapter would have been "an obvious choice" for a sniper, but that the studio has "different plans" for the Raven Guard.</p>

<p>More customization options are also coming, alongside a new Datavault option on the Battle Barge. It'll allow you to read "unlockable information on most elements from the game", in case you want to brush up on your&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>lore.</p>




<p>In case you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>, it's a third-person shooter set in the grim darkness of the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k&nbsp;</em>universe.</p>

<p>The game sees protagonist Demetrian Titus returning from the first game. Having spent time with the Deathwatch in order to prove himself free of heresy, Titus is re-inducted into the Ultramarines and tasked with eradicating a Tyrannid infestation on the planet Kadaku.</p>

<p>Like its predecessor,&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>emphasizes both close-quarters combat and ranged weaponry, and it's also got a renewed focus on co-op play. Fittingly enough, its credits also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-credits-totalbiscuit" rel="nofollow">feature a rather touching tribute</a> to a man who championed the original title.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/recettear-hd-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/item-shop-management-sim-recettear-is-getting-an-hd-remaster-next-year.1071294/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/recettear-hd-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EasyGameStation has announced&nbsp;<em>Recettear HD</em>, a remastered version of the cult classic 2007 item shop management sim that's coming next year.</p>

<p>Right now, we don't know a lot about the project. In <a href="https://x.com/Recettear_EGS/status/1873564667366506965" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an announcement post</a> on social media platform X (for which we're using machine translation), EasyGameStation simply says "we will open an item shop again in 2025", ending the post with the hashtag #RecettearHD.</p>

<p>Given the project's name, we're assuming it's not a ground-up remake of the game, but rather a remastered version for modern systems. Presumably, that also means we'll be seeing it on consoles, although it's difficult to say at this early stage.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/recettear-hd-remaster-2025-dungeon.jpg?itok=RTTQRLD5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/recettear-hd-remaster-2025-dungeon.jpg?itok=5v_BVVSw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Recettear HD&nbsp;</em>is coming sometime next year.</figcaption></figure><p>The screenshots released so far for the game include a shot of Recette standing in her item shop, as well as an adventurer exploring a dungeon and battling slimes.</p>

<p>In the first shot, we can see controller glyphs that somewhat resemble those of the Nintendo Switch, although all we've got to go on right now are an "A" and a "Y", which could also easily refer to Xbox controller glyphs.</p>

<p>We also don't yet know whether this version of the game will be localized outside of Japan, although one social media post seems to suggest that this will indeed be the case.</p>

<p>Andrew Dice, the founder of&nbsp;<em>Recettear&nbsp;</em>localization studio Carpe Fulgur, noted&nbsp;<em>Recettear HD</em>'s <a href="https://x.com/SpaceDrakeCF/status/1873584405652062392" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement on X</a>, promising more info "in the year to come". If Carpe Fulgur is involved, then it's very likely we will be seeing&nbsp;<em>Recettear HD&nbsp;</em>in the West.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/recettear-hd-remaster-2025-shop.jpg?itok=iq_StUKf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/recettear-hd-remaster-2025-shop.jpg?itok=wPFfYfby 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Recettear HD&nbsp;</em>looks like it'll be coming to the West, and probably to consoles as well.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with the original&nbsp;<em>Recettear</em>, it's an item shop management sim-slash-dungeon crawler along the lines of&nbsp;<em>Moonlighter&nbsp;</em>(which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/moonlighter-2-announced-2025" rel="nofollow">is itself getting a sequel next year</a>), although it's much more light-hearted and satirical than Digital Sun's game.</p>

<p><em>Recettear&nbsp;</em>revolves around Recette Lemongrass, a girl who must pay back a loan on behalf of her father by running an item shop. She must haggle with customers, send adventurers out on epic quests to retrieve loot, and generally deal with the vagaries of JRPG capitalism.</p>

<p><em>Recettear HD&nbsp;</em>lands sometime next year, although we don't know when or where yet. The original version is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/70400/Recettear_An_Item_Shops_Tale/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, and it's currently up for grabs at a tidy discount as well.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Stardew Valley Sales Have Now Passed the 40m Mark]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stardew-valley-sales-40m</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stardew-valley-sales-have-now-passed-the-40m-mark.1071276/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stardew-valley-sales-40m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Smash hit indie farming sim&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley&nbsp;</em>is somehow continuing its meteoric ascent despite the fact that it's almost nine years old, at least if its latest sales figures are anything to go by.</p>

<p>Over on the official <i>Stardew Valley&nbsp;</i>site's <a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/press/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press portal</a>, Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone says that the game has managed to shift a staggering 41 million copies "as of December 2024".</p>

<p>According to Barone, more than 26 million of those copies have been sold on PC alone, while 7.9 million copies have been sold on the Nintendo Switch. The game's success being primarily PC-based makes a lot of sense given that that's the first platform on which it was released.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stardew-valley-sales-40m-farm.jpg?itok=epDSYwLo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stardew-valley-sales-40m-farm.jpg?itok=-w6Y-sJZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Stardew Valley&nbsp;</em>has officially passed the 40 million sales mark.</figcaption></figure><p>It didn't take&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley&nbsp;</em>very long to begin its journey to success. Just a couple of months after the game's initial launch, it had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stardew-valley-breaks-million-copies-sold" rel="nofollow">crossed a million sales</a>, hitting <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stardew-valley-1-on-switch-eshop-over-35m-owners-on-steam" rel="nofollow">3.5 million players on Steam alone</a> in January 2018.</p>

<p>Even on mobile platforms, where free-to-play games reign supreme and upfront paid products often struggle,&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stardew-valley-ios-version-crosses-1-million-in-sales-on-itunes" rel="nofollow">managed to rake in $1 million</a> in sales on iOS within just a few weeks of its launch on the app store.</p>

<p>It's clear that&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley&nbsp;</em>has struck a chord to an even greater degree than other cozy farming sims; it arguably spearheaded the current wave of such games, especially in the indie sphere, so its success makes a lot of sense through that lens.</p>

<p>The game, which is heavily inspired by the&nbsp;<em>Story of Seasons&nbsp;</em>(formerly&nbsp;<em>Harvest Moon</em>) franchise, even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/harvest-moon-creator-on-his-new-game-and-how-stard/1100-6445583/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">attracted praise</a> from that franchise's creator Yasuhiro Wada, who said&nbsp;<em>Stardew&nbsp;</em>"carries on the legacy of the original&nbsp;<em>Harvest Moon&nbsp;</em>very well".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stardew-valley-sales-40m-sign.jpg?itok=ZE5YXRQO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stardew-valley-sales-40m-sign.jpg?itok=N9wkuq20 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's no wonder Eric Barone is taking his time with his next game.</figcaption></figure><p>As for what Barone is working on next, he's currently developing a new cozy life sim-style game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/haunted-chocolatier-is-next-game-from-stardew-valley-developer-concernedape" rel="nofollow">by the name of&nbsp;<em>Haunted Chocolatier</em></a>.</p>

<p>The game's development is progressing slowly, largely because Barone is still working on&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley</em>, which he describes as a "big and popular game" to which he has "a lot of attachment".</p>

<p>He also says that&nbsp;<em>Haunted Chocolatier&nbsp;</em>will "still take a while", but that following the&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley&nbsp;</em>1.6 release on all platforms, he "<a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/stardew-valley-1-6-mobile-console-release-date/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">would like to finish&nbsp;<em>Haunted Chocolatier&nbsp;</em>next</a>".</p>

<p>Here's hoping that happens sooner rather than later. Until then,&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/413150/Stardew_Valley/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/stardew-valley/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/stardew-valley/C3D891Z6TNQM" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/stardew-valley-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>, and mobile platforms.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/team17-co-founder-martyn-brown-passes-away-aged-just-57.1071264/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/team17-martyn-brown-dies-57<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Team17 co-founder Martyn Brown has passed away aged just 57. He worked with the publisher for two decades, helping to oversee the release of games like&nbsp;<em>Worms</em>,&nbsp;<em>Alien Breed</em>, and the PSP remake of&nbsp;<em>Lemmings</em>.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/team17-co-founder-martyn-brown-dies-aged-57" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GamesIndustry.biz report</a>, Brown's son Jack confirmed his death following "a prolonged battle with a series of strokes". Jack says Brown passed "on his own terms listening to his favorite music and surrounded by loved ones".</p>

<p>GI.biz points to a number of emotional tributes from other folks in the gaming industry, including one from Riot Games' EMEA publishing director Hannes Seifert, who somberly declares that "the light of our generation of developers is slowly but steadily dimming".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/team17-martyn-brown-dies-worms.jpg?itok=14rQ4uXI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/team17-martyn-brown-dies-worms.jpg?itok=oi1aCyJN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Team17 is best known for the&nbsp;<em>Worms&nbsp;</em>series, among others.</figcaption></figure><p>Brown's untimely death comes just a month after he <a href="https://gamerepublic.net/awards/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">received an award</a> from gaming body Game Republic.</p>

<p>The Games Legend award is reserved for industry figures who've had a major impact on the gaming world, with previous winners including the likes of Revolution Software's Charles Cecil and Noirin Carmody.</p>

<p>Indeed, Game Republic managing director Jamie Sefton was one of the industry figures paying tribute to Brown, calling him "such a friendly, funny person" and describing him as an "industry legend not just for Team17 but also for his incredible support and help" for other devs and gaming figures.</p>

<p>Brown co-founded Team17 in 1990 as a merger between two pre-existing companies: British studio 17-Bit Software and Swedish outfit Team 7. His co-founders include Debbie Bestwick, who <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/team17-ceo-to-step-down-after-over-30-years" rel="nofollow">stepped down</a> as Team17 CEO earlier this year following <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/team17-employees-allege-harassment-terrible-pay-and-more" rel="nofollow">allegations of a poor work culture</a> by employees.</p>

<p>As GI.biz says, he's survived by his wife Heather, as well as his children Jack and Harry and his stepdaughter Darcy.</p>
