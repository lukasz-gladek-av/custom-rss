            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Trails Beyond the Horizon </em>is packing some pretty nifty PC features, and some of those features might not be compatible with your machine, but engineering studio PH3 says it deliberately allows you to screw those settings up if you want to.</p><p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3316940/view/492713648032056900" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">news post</a> on Steam to mark <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/trails-beyond-the-horizon-release-date" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a8723995-8f57-4a9a-a7d9-11340a1ec1f8" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">the game's launch</a>, PH3 CTO Peter Thoman says he's learned during his time working on PC ports for games that "some players don't read", and that even when including "bright red warning text", players will push settings to Ultra and then complain about performance.</p><p>As such, Thoman says it's better to let players "shoot themselves in the foot" instead of "arbitrarily capping the high-end scalability of a game"; he believes that "a good PC version can benefit from future hardware without re-buying some remaster", which is a very refreshing attitude.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Trails Beyond the Horizon </em>has a refreshing attitude to PC tinkering.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Amusingly, Thoman points to one instance in <em>Trails Beyond the Horizon </em>in which in-game settings are hard-capped at "high"; the scene is a grain field, and without this cap, "utterly absurd amounts of individual, fully modeled stalks of grain being rendered" would become an issue at Ultra.</p><p>If, however, you do want to crank this hard-capped setting up for some reason, you can find a parameter in the settings file marked "allow_silly_grain_levels", and switching this to "true" will let you render those stalks. As Thoman says, though, there is "absolutely no reason to do this".</p><p>As well as discussing the pitfalls of porting games to PC, Thoman also says <em>Trails Beyond the Horizon </em>is being optimized to work with as many hardware configurations as possible.</p><p>He points to the example of one of the game's testers, who still uses an Nvidia GTX Titan, a GPU that was current about 13 years ago but which has since begun to lag behind. Surprise surprise, <em>Trails Beyond the Horizon </em>will support that GPU.</p>
<p><em>Trails Beyond the Horizon </em>is the latest game in <em>The Legend of Heroes</em>' ongoing <em>Trails </em>sub-series, continuing story arcs from various other <em>Trails </em>games including <em>Cold Steel </em>and <em>Daybreak</em>.</p><p>The game is available now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3316940/The_Legend_of_Heroes_Trails_beyond_the_Horizon/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10012789" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/the-legend-of-heroes-trails-beyond-the-horizon-switch/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch</a>.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-shovelware-psn-store-thigames</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It looks as though Sony has just deleted the entire back catalog of a certain publisher from the PlayStation Store, which means that if you're a PS5 owner, you now have significantly fewer shovelware games to slog through when you're browsing for discounts.</p><p>As spotted by self-proclaimed "trophy hunter" <a href="https://x.com/robthanatos/status/2011487254724952207" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">RobThanatos on X</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-wiped-over-1000-shovelware-games-off-the-playstation-store-without-warning-all-from-a-single-developer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eurogamer</a>), all of publisher ThiGames' titles appear to have been removed from the PSN Store, which amounts to precisely 1,194 titles.</p><p>If you're unfamiliar with the work of ThiGames, perhaps some of the studio's game titles will jog your memory; it's responsible for trophy-centric games like <em>The Jumping Food Memory</em>, <em>The Jumping Orange 2</em>, and <em>The Jumping Cheese Maze</em>. You may have spotted a pattern emerging here.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>If you've browsed the PSN Store during sales, you've probably seen stuff like this.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As RobThanatos points out, ThiGames enjoyed the distinction of having the fourth highest number of games on the PlayStation Store prior to Sony's cull, beaten out only by similarly low-scope publishers Webnetic and Ratalaika, as well as niche studio eastasiasoft.</p><p>It doesn't look as though games ThiGames has yet to release have been removed, however; at time of writing, the store page for <em>The Jumping Food Memory </em>(which I'm sure will buck the trend and turn out to be an all-timer) is <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10009259" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">still up</a>.</p><p>ThiGames' titles are, or at least seem to be, low-effort releases designed to rack up trophies quickly rather than to engage or stimulate. It's often possible to collect all of the trophies in a ThiGames release in a handful of minutes.</p><p>The games are usually incredibly simple in terms of gameplay and visuals, often consisting of a single backdrop accompanied by a familiar and very basic take on an existing genre (assuming the gameplay isn't just, well, jumping, that is).</p>
<p>Whether or not this is part of a wider effort on Sony's part to crack down on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/shovelware-importance-games-industry" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9ec3beae-77dd-466c-9dbd-b14356e65d73" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">shovelware</a> on the PlayStation Store remains to be seen, but at the very least, your trophy hunting has just gotten more difficult, it seems.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
