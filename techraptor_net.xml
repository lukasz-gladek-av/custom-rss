            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>producer Yoshi-P has declared that while he wants to keep supporting the MMORPG on PS4 for "as long as possible", technical limitations might mean the game drops support for the platform eventually.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://feed4gamers.com/game-news/317170/final-fantasy-xiv-s-next-chapters-an-exclusive-talk-with-yoshi-p.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an interview</a> with Feed4Gamers, Yoshi-P says that his "basic stance" is to continue supporting hardware "which has grown old", but that Sony's "hardware regulations" might make it difficult for&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>to remain on the last-gen console.</p>

<p>According to Yoshi-P, the game's continuous updates mean that Square Enix has been asking Sony to increase its data limits for&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>specifically, and while Sony has been happy to oblige, the company has told Yoshi-P and his team that "they are also reaching their limits", he says.</p>

<p>However, when that time comes, Yoshi-P promises that he will "provide clear reasoning for that decision", so if and when PS4 support does end for&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>, you'll know about it.</p>

<p>This discussion comes after a couple of prominent games recently ended support for the PS4; earlier this month, HoYoverse declared that PS4 support for gacha RPG&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-ps4-support-ending" rel="nofollow">will end next year</a>, and&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>publisher Krafton <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pubg-ps4-and-xbox-one-support-ending-in-november" rel="nofollow">subsequently followed suit</a> for its battle royale shooter.</p>

<p>In both cases, the studios said they wanted to focus on current-gen hardware for their games, and that's something for which Yoshi-P seems grateful too; in the aforementioned interview, he says current-gen hardware is "quite high spec" and that working with it is "easier...compared to back in the days".</p>




<p>This interview comes shortly after the release of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-patch-73-august" rel="nofollow">Patch 7.3</a> for&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>, which brought a brand new story dungeon, the second part of the&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XI</em>-themed 24-person raid, and more earlier this month.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Replaced&nbsp;</em>developer Sad Cat Studios has revealed that work on the game is still very much underway, and that it's now due to launch sometime in spring next year.</p>

<p>In a new development update, project lead Yura Zhdanovich acknowledges that&nbsp;<em>Replaced</em>&nbsp;has "seen a couple of delays", but he says that he and his team have always "been trying to do what's best for the project".</p>

<p>Zhdanovich says that he and Sad Cat Studios are "really close to finishing production" on&nbsp;<em>Replaced</em>, and that the next phase is "intense testing and polishing of the game", although he doesn't say exactly how long he expects that phase to take.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/replaced-spring-2026-gas-station.jpg?itok=ETJFF9v8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/replaced-spring-2026-gas-station.jpg?itok=21MHZPpp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Replaced&nbsp;</em>is now due in spring 2026.</figcaption></figure><p>To tide you over until spring, Zhdanovich reveals that Sad Cat has "improved every aspect of the game" since it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-announcement-from-xbox-bethesda-e3-2021" rel="nofollow">initially revealed back in 2021</a>. He says the team's goal was to make the game with "no shortcuts", and so everything has been made "in a classic way", with "handcrafted pixel art".</p>

<p>The rest of the trailer delves into&nbsp;<em>Replaced</em>'s animation and development processes. It's worth a look if you're interested in the story behind the game, and you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPoyEkQePA4&amp;ab_channel=IGN" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">check it out here</a> courtesy of IGN.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Replaced</em>, it's an upcoming action platformer that blends chunky 2.5D-style pixel art with gameplay that "combines cinematic platforming...and free-flow action combat".</p>

<p>Set in an alternative 1980s,&nbsp;<em>Replaced&nbsp;</em>casts you as an artificial intelligence known as R.E.A.C.H., who's trapped inside a human body. You'll have to adjust to life as a human, all while discovering that "everything comes at a price", according to Sad Cat.</p>




<p>When it does finally arrive,&nbsp;<em>Replaced&nbsp;</em>is set to launch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1663850/REPLACED/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, as well as on Xbox Series X|S, and it'll be a day one Game Pass title as well. A specific release date will be announced later this year.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Pokemon Go Level Cap to Increase to 80 in October]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-go-level-cap-80-october</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pokemon-go-level-cap-to-increase-to-80-in-october.1279752/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Niantic and The Pokemon Company have announced that later this year, the level cap for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Go&nbsp;</em>will be increased, which the developer says will lead to a "more fun and engaging" leveling experience.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://pokemongo.com/en/post/pgo-leveling-update-announce-2025" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a>, Niantic says that on October 15th, the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Go&nbsp;</em>level cap will increase from 50 to 80, which, according to Niantic, will lead to players "celebrating leveling milestones with new rewards, new cosmetics, and more".</p>

<p>According to Niantic, the new level cap means that some players "can expect to jump in level based on their total earned XP", but that nobody's level will decrease. As such, when the update arrives, if you suddenly find yourself at a higher level, that's why.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-go-level-cap-increasing-art.jpg?itok=eXrT9rau 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-go-level-cap-increasing-art.jpg?itok=GX_FWCQL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pokemon Go</em>'s level cap will be increasing in October.</figcaption></figure><p>Not only is the level cap itself increasing, but leveling between 1 and 80 will be rebalanced, according to Niantic. Naturally, Level-Up Research tasks for levels 41 through 50 will be replaced with tasks from levels 71 through 80.</p>

<p>You can also expect other goodies like a boosted chance of becoming Lucky Friends with other players when you hit level 70, as well as new rewards for progression, including increased storage capacity and new avatar items.</p>

<p>By the time October 14th (the day before the update is set to hit) arrives, you'll get a "special medal" commemorating the highest level you've achieved in&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Go</em>, and if you hit 50, you'll get a special jacket and avatar pose.</p>

<p>Between now and October 15th, you'll get double catch XP from Nice, Great, and Excellent throws, and you'll get an extra 3,000 XP for winning raids and Max Battles. Timed Research will also become available to those level 7 or over, giving you the chance to "earn over 7 million XP", Niantic says.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-go-level-cap-increasing-bonuses.jpg?itok=piSccBxn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-go-level-cap-increasing-bonuses.jpg?itok=AjXSrQJ5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you play&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Go&nbsp;</em>between now and October 15th, you'll get bonuses galore.</figcaption></figure><p>News of the level cap follows the announcement of a new season in&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Go</em>, with various new 'mons set to debut from September 2nd, including Mega Metagross, Keldeo, and more.</p>

<p>All of this follows the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/niantic-scopely-sale-games" rel="nofollow">sale of Niantic to the Saudi-backed firm Scopely</a> back in February, a move that Scopely was quick to reassure fans would not affect the day-to-day operations of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Go</em><em>.</em></p>
