            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Insomniac and Sony have revealed the <em>Marvel's Wolverine </em>release date, so get ready to extend those claws and start ripping and tearing your enemies apart.</p><p>As revealed on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/insomniac.games/post/3mfmnbgtbbg2x" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">social media</a> (and in a new, albeit very short, trailer), <em>Marvel's Wolverine </em>will be released exclusively for PlayStation 5 on September 15th. No other platforms have been listed for the game yet, but I'd be very surprised indeed if we don't see a PC release.</p><p>Insomniac's <em>Wolverine </em>game will share continuity with <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/marvels-spider-man" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5ac0af43-332e-4175-a13f-13885dcdef7e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">both</a> of the studio's <em>Spider-Man </em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/marvels-spider-man-2" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4c20da9d-d5d8-4520-b5d4-5d7b0be42289" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">outings</a>, but it'll be a standalone story, so you won't need to have played through either of Peter Parker's adventures in order to enjoy this one.</p><figure role="group">

<p>As the name suggests, the game will cast you as Wolverine, and while it's not an origin story, you won't need to know anything about the character's comic book exploits to play this one.</p><p>The story will revolve around Wolverine searching for "answers about his past", which is a pretty bog-standard setting to plonk Wolverine into, and he'll need to use "brutal claw combat, violent rage and relentless determination" to reach his goal.</p><p>From the gameplay segments we've seen so far, Wolverine will be battling both in his traditional yellow X-Men attire and in a more downhome plaid shirt outfit, and the combat will be suitably brutal as well, with plenty of blood to go around.</p><p>Strangely enough, it shares at least one thing with IO Interactive's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/007-first-light-delayed-may-2026" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e0d84f2a-3cf3-41a8-9a3a-eb43f66bc545" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">upcoming <em>007 First Light</em></a> in that it'll be a globetrotting adventure for our hero as well, taking him to locations as diverse as Tokyo, Canada, and Madripoor, to name but a few.</p>
<p>News of <em>Wolverine</em>'s release date comes hot on the heels of news that Sony <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-shutting-down-bluepoint-games-in-march" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="97877112-5514-4226-8057-9d99ef1d61c1" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">will close <em>Demon's Souls </em>and <em>Shadow of the Colossus </em>studio Bluepoint</a>, suggesting that there might be a little more riding on Insomniac's latest than just the studio's reputation.</p><p><em>Marvel's Wolverine </em>launches <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/marvels-wolverine/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">exclusively for PlayStation 5</a> on September 15th (although, again, I'd be very surprised if there's not a PC port of the game waiting somewhere down the line). Stay tuned for more on this and all other things Insomniac.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
