            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Netmarble has announced a delay for <em>The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin</em>, which means you'll no longer be getting your hands on the free-to-play anime RPG in January.</p><p>As revealed in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3679080/view/490461848218371595" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a post on Steam</a>, <em>The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin </em>will now be arriving in March. No more specific release date than that was given, though, so we still don't know exactly when you'll be able to play the game.</p><p>Netmarble says that the feedback it received during the game's recent beta period showed that more work was still needed on various key systems like UI, combat, and core controls, and so in order to deliver a more "polished experience", <em>The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin </em>will take another couple of months.</p><figure role="group">

<p>If you want to know exactly what's changing with those extra couple of months, Netmarble has handily provided an <a href="https://7origin.netmarble.com/en/news/3/59" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">incredibly exhaustive rundown</a> of what the devs are doing to address user feedback.</p><p>The list includes refinements to various combat systems, improvements to the "convenience" of exploring <em>The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin</em>'s world, and lots of quality-of-life improvements and visual enhancements as well.</p><p>If you're not familiar with <em>The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin</em>, it is, as you've probably already surmised, an action RPG based on the popular <em>Seven Deadly Sins </em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/seven-deadly-sins-origin-is-open-world-take-on-anime" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7c891282-93f2-45f2-b26d-54a896d4fd01" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">manga and anime series</a>.</p><p>The game, which will utilize gacha mechanics (because of course it will), casts you as Prince Tristan of Liones, who must embark on a journey through the land of Britannia to "restore order to a world thrown into chaos by the collision of time and space".</p>
<p>You'll be able to check out <em>The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin </em>when it launches sometime this March on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3679080/The_Seven_Deadly_Sins_Origin/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/the-seven-deadly-sins-origin/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a>, and mobile devices. Stay tuned for more on this, including a new release date, as soon as we get it.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
