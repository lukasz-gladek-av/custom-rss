            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-sales-200k<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Dragami Games has announced that&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw RePop&nbsp;</em>sales have passed a new milestone almost four months after the remaster's initial release.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Dragami_Games/status/1877626459386212769" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on social media platform X (for which we're using machine translation), Dragami confirms that&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw RePop&nbsp;</em>has sold over 200,000 copies worldwide since its release on September 12th.</p>

<p>While it's true those aren't exactly sales on the level of triple-A hits like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-9m" rel="nofollow">Resident Evil 4</a>&nbsp;</em>or indie smashes like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-hit-3-5m" rel="nofollow"><em>Balatro</em></a>, <i>Lollipop Chainsaw RePop&nbsp;</i>is a remastered version of an already-niche action game from 2012, so 200,000 isn't a bad figure at all to reach.</p>

<p>It was officially named&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw RePop&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lollipop-chainsaw-remake-officially-titled-lollipop-chainsaw-repop-delayed-to-2024" rel="nofollow">the following year</a>, at which point its release was also pushed back to 2024. Following that, Yasuda proved himself true to his word when it turned out that&nbsp;<em>RePop&nbsp;</em>would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-remaster-remake" rel="nofollow">serve as a remaster</a> rather than a full remake.</p>

<p>Back in June, the remaster's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-release-date" rel="nofollow">release date was set for September</a>. It's one of two 2012 action-adventure games involving auteur Goichi Suda, otherwise known as Suda51, to get itself a remaster this year, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shadows-of-damned-hella-remastered-release-date" rel="nofollow">the other being&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned</em></a>.</p>




<p><em>Lollipop Chainsaw RePop&nbsp;</em>is a remastered version of the 2012 action game, which was originally developed by Suda51's company Grasshopper Manufacture.</p>

<p>Maintaining the original game's story and atmosphere,&nbsp;<em>RePop&nbsp;</em>features upgraded visuals, "faster action", and plenty of other quality-of-life improvements to bring cheerleader Juliet Starling's zombie-slaying adventure into the modern era.</p>

<p>You can check out <i>Lollipop Chainsaw RePop&nbsp;</i>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2658450/LOLLIPOP_CHAINSAW_RePOP/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010519" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/lollipop-chainsaw-repop/9NTPB0C2028V/0010" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>. Here's hoping all this renewed interest in 2012 action games leads to some kind of remaster for&nbsp;<em>Binary Domain</em>. Come on, Sega.</p>
