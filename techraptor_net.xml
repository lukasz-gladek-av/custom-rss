But does it capture the feel of the lauded video game? We enter the&nbsp;Lands Between to find out.</p>

<p><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/elden-ring-review" rel="nofollow">Elden Ring</a> is probbbaly one of the greatest video games of all time, and for the last few years, Steamforged Games have been capturing the feel of video game IPs on the tabletop, including <a href="https://techraptor.net/originals/video-to-tabletop-resident-evil-2-board-game" rel="nofollow">Resident Evil</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/day-with-monster-hunter-world-iceborne-board-game" rel="nofollow">Monster Hunter</a>, and <em>Dark Souls</em>, which got a <a href="https://techraptor.net/originals/video-to-tabletop-part-2-board-game-dark-souls-board-game" rel="nofollow">board game</a>, and a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dark-souls-card-game-review-pick-class-shuffle-cards-and-prepare-to-die" rel="nofollow">card game</a> (which is still one of my favorite games of all time). The <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dark-souls" rel="nofollow">Dark Souls</a> video game is developed by FromSoftware, also the creators of the <em>Elden Ring</em> video game, so it was only natural that Steamforged Games picked that up, and after a successful Kickstarter, it's now heading to retail.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first thing you'll notice about <i>Elden Ring the Board Game: Realm of the Grafted King </i>is the size of the box (other smaller sets are available, and we discuss those below). Realm of the Grafted King is a mammoth box, and not just because of the number of miniatures it contains (which is substantial in number, 54, and the size of some of them), but the wealth of paper material that's also inside, including 1227 cards, and 6 books (1 rulebook, 1 scenario book and 4 encounter books).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite the scale of the box, getting into your first game isn't as daunting as it appears, which for new players is considerable (but there's a better entry point if you're brand new to board games, and we discuss below). Opening the box for the first time, there are several card decks to sort and the rulebook to read, but the actual setup simply involves gathering the components for each player's chosen character (in RofGL there are 4 choices) and then you open the scenario book at the Stranded Graveyard and the game begins.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-the-board-game-5.jpg?itok=LIwxZE6U 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-the-board-game-5.jpg?itok=JSmA-BM- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Each&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring the Board Game: Realm of the Grafted King </em>character starts with a class ability, and weapons that set your characters combat deck.</figcaption></figure><h2>Welcome To The Lands Between</h2>

<p><i>Elden Ring the Board Game: Realm of the Grafted King</i>, and all the other sets have 5 different types of gameplay. The game starts with the narrative, where players read through the scenario book and make decisions. Those familiar with the <em>Fighting Fantasy</em> books of old will feel nostalgic, but this also takes the place of a Games Master who usually controls the narrative in roleplaying games (or app, as so many digital hybrid board games are starting to take on).</p>

<p>The bulk of<em> Elden Ring the Board Game</em> gameplay is split between exploration, where players slowly build a map made up of hex pieces where they can interact with non-player characters, narrative elements, and enter combat areas, which make up the rest of the gameplay. Combat is split between dungeons, where the Tarnished work their way through enemies until they face a boss, gauntlet, where players face waves of enemies and also boss battles, where players take on powerful enemies.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-the-board-game-8.jpg?itok=Wn2kqBu_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-the-board-game-8.jpg?itok=AtYcLlSi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Enemies in&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring the Board Game: Realm of the Grafted King</em> have fixed attacks, unique even among those of the same type, and bosses have multiple attacks in a unique combat deck.</figcaption></figure><p>The combat in <em>Elden Ring the Board Game </em>is entirely diceless, and instead uses cards to randomise combat (and other tests). Attribute cards contain symbols from 5 attributes, and when a test is required, it will detail how many points each attribute is worth, or the effect gained on a combat card. During combat, players also use an individual combat deck, which is made up of cards indicated by their Tarnished's equipped weapons. This allows you to tailor your combat deck to suit your play style with the weapons and items that you find.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-the-board-game-7.jpg?itok=qw0POuge 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-the-board-game-7.jpg?itok=l1Wod9Ap 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Combat in&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring the Board Game: Realm of the Grafted King</em> takes place on grid maps, and attacks target areas depending on the character and enemy positioning.</figcaption></figure><p>All combat takes place on battlefield grids made up of 1 or more of the Encounter Books (my first fight using all 4 books was a very exciting moment). These grids have combat lanes, which, depending on the position of your miniature, can target specific areas in the enemy grid. There are also 3 different rows for the player characters, with different effects depending on where they are positioned. Right at the front of the grid, head-on to the enemy, allows players to draw 2 cards from their attribute deck when making attacks, choosing which they use for maximum attack potential. The centre lane allows them to move their initiative card, gaining an element of control on when they act during the turn, and the furthest lane back allows you to draw 2 cards when making a defensive action, choosing the card with the best attributes for your defense.</p>

<p>Enemy attacks are also handled by cards, and each enemy has a unique card, unique even between those of the same type, which lists their behaviors for movement and attacks. Bosses have their own deck of attacks and attack multiple times each turn.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-the-board-game-6.jpg?itok=pmO0Enpw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-the-board-game-6.jpg?itok=s0vo6GK5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Prophet in&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring the Board Game: Realm of the Grafted King</em> starts with the Finger Seal and Rickey Shield, and the 10 cards that form that combination's combat deck.</figcaption></figure><h2>Rise Tarnished</h2>

<p>Each <em>Elden Ring The Board Game c</em>ore set has different Tarnished characters to play (we discuss the different sets below), and<em> Elden Ring the Board Game: Realm of the Grafted King </em>includes the following:</p>

<ul><li>Astrologer - This class likes to&nbsp;chain attacks together for combination bonuses</li>
	<li>Prophet - Has healing abilities, but also starts with the highest damage-dealing card out of the starting characters</li>
	<li>Samurai - An agile fighter, most cards allow them to move and strike</li>
	<li>Vagabond - A defensive fighter who can shove enemies to reposition them for effective attacks</li>
</ul><p>Each character starts with a weapon and shield, which have their own combat decks, their own unique attributes deck, a class feature, and a unique quest to set them off on their campaign.</p>

<p>During the campaign, after each scenario, players can buy new weapons, armor, talismans, trait, and attribute cards (buying and equipping new weapons and armor also changes the combat deck), or they can upgrade weapons and attach memories to cards, which add spell cards to your combat deck.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-the-board-game-4.jpg?itok=MVYsgwO7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-the-board-game-4.jpg?itok=7tM_y81a 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring the Board Game: Realm of the Grafted King </em>comes with 4 encounter books, which have the combat play mats and can be combined for larger maps.</figcaption></figure><h2>Guiding Light</h2>

<p>As you might have guessed from the contents of <em>Elden Ring the Board Game: Realm of the Grafted King</em>, it offers a significant playtime out of this box. Each scenario takes around an hour, with some stretching a little longer depending on player choices while they're exploring, which sets you up for over 50 hours to finish the campaign. There's replayability out of the box as well, with the 4 different characters to explore, different builds for them to make, and the exploration map will look different each time too.</p>

<p>Realm of the Grafted King can also be combined with other sets. There are 2 other core sets,&nbsp;Weeping Peninsula and&nbsp;Stormveil Castle, which have smaller campaigns, but still contain 4 player classes to choose from. Both of these boxes include 2 new classes, and 2 that are already included in Realm of the Grafted King. Those duplicates contain a unique sculpt, and come with different class quests and starting decks for a different experience.</p>

<p>All 3 of the core sets can be combined, or played independently, but there are also additional add-on sets,&nbsp;Limgrave Depths,&nbsp;Erdtree Avatar, and&nbsp;Flying Dragon Agheel that add new rules and enemies to your games, but they can only be added to the Realm of the Grafted King set.</p>

<p><em>Elden Ring:&nbsp;Weeping Peninsula</em> is the ideal starting point for anyone who's new to board games and is looking to pick this up because they're an <em>Elden Ring</em> video game fan. Which can then be combined with Realm of the Grafted King, reviewed here, and additional sets for extra content. If you like what you've read here, and want to just get straight into the longest campaign, then Realm of the Grafted King won't disappoint.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-the-board-game-3.jpg?itok=-QsELwS9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-the-board-game-3.jpg?itok=SaN9wAQm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>2 other&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring the Board Game</em> sets are available, both can be played seperately or combined with each other.</figcaption></figure>

<p><em>Elden Ring the Board Game: Realm of the Grafted King </em>is a monster of a game in size and depth. It opts for sheer volume of content over the app control that many games are starting to take on. The blending of narrative and exploration is done well, and while combat is challenging (bosses are very challenging), it feels rewarding, and the combat and attribute deck that you can customise over the game are particularly well done. This box, RotGK, will be quite daunting for a brand-new tabletop player, and they should probably look to start their <em>Elden Ring</em> tabletop journey with Weeping Peninsula instead.</p>

<p>Each of the 4 player classes feels unique and offers a different experience, and the game plays well solo, or up to 4 players, I had the best experience playing solo, with 2 characters (samurai of course and astrologer) to get the blending of abilities, but being able to play through the game and experience the campaign my way. Despite the huge box size, there does feel like there's a lot more to explore in the Lands Between. We're only touching the surface in terms of weapons, class builds, enemies, and areas in <em>Elden Ring the Board Game</em>, and I hope that we get more.</p>

I wanted to round up a number of the titles that I got to experience at The MIX, an indie and small publisher focused mixer event where I got to get hands-on with half a dozen titles.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Be sure also to check out our separate coverage on several other Indie titles, including <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c2784bed-f2a5-412f-8652-af732f40e227" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/dosa-divas-preview-cooking-up-storm" rel="nofollow">Dosa Divas</a>, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5819adb2-3b4d-4d3a-96a5-9f3a96f86bc8" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/relooted-is-unique-heist-game-for-2d-platforming-speedrun-fans" rel="nofollow">Relooted</a></em>, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="10524fe9-b6ba-4bb9-8b1e-ef2fd24e2da2" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/interview-with-ndreams-and-shuhei-yoshida-about-reach-vr-and-what-indies-can-do-to" rel="nofollow"><em>Reach</em></a>, and more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the Mix, I got to check out the following games. I've listed them not only with their name, but also their genre in case you're wanting to look through to find something you're specifically interested in.</p>

<h2><em>Captain Wayne - Vacation Desperation</em></h2>

<p>Boomer Shooter<br>
Developed by Ciaran Games LLC and published by Silver Lining Interactive</p>

<p>The first game I got buried into was <em>Captain Wayne - Vacation Desperation</em>. Picking up the controls, I was off with a sprint, making my way through a building and out to a dock, dodging the oncoming attacks of strange boxing cat-like creatures.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-mix-sgf-2025-captain-wayne_0.jpg?itok=ESkC1cVY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-mix-sgf-2025-captain-wayne_0.jpg?itok=TsD4u10m 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>You could attack physically, use the shotgun built into the main character's arm (if you hadn't already used up all of the ammo), and perform flying kicks that would ramp up your character's momentum.</p>

<p>After a brief linear section, I'd reach an arena only to be absolutely swarmed by enemies, but coming close time and time again, I was always ready to hop right back into action. Each death I'd learn a bit more, become a bit faster, and more accurate as I took out waves of enemies.</p>

<p>While not traditionally my cup of tea, I can imagine that those who are fans of the genre would get a kick out of the action and comedy behind <em>Captain Wayne</em>. You can also play the<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2319790/Captain_Wayne__Vacation_Desperation/" rel="nofollow"> demo right now on Steam</a> if you're interested to learn more.</p>

<h2><em>Death Howl</em></h2>

<p>Soulslike Deck Builder<br>
Developed by The Outer Zone and published by 11 bit studios</p>

<p>In <em>Death Howl</em>, you are a grieving woman trying try chase after her child, who she believes was turned into a deer and escaped. To do so, you'll need to make it through a dangerous forest, defeating enemies, collecting resources, and powering yourself up to take on ever-growing challenges.</p>

<p>When I first read the genre match up I wasn't quite sure about it, but I immediately saw the potential after reaching my first battle.</p>

<p>Stepping towards an enemy a grid will slowly appear, stepping into it combat will initiate. Each site takes turns moving a performing actions. For the player there is a set limit of actions you can take, playing cards from your hand has a certain cost, as does moving. Once you pass the turn the relatively simple AI of the monsters will then take theirs.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-mix-sgf-2025-death-howl.jpg?itok=EcpezF7w 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-mix-sgf-2025-death-howl.jpg?itok=IDZXiRvZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This game isn't just about the tactical knowledge of your own cards, but also understanding the way that the AI will work. In my second battle, an enemy bird that I learned can only attack at a distance was positioned near a wall. I was able to use my movement to trap it in a corner, meaning it couldn't attack.</p>

<p>Between battles, there's an overworld to explore and larger enemies to encounter, but returning to the <em>Death Howl</em> equivalent of a Bonfire will let you spend souls for upgrades, craft new cards, but also cause all enemies to respawn.</p>

<p>If you're after a tough tactical combat game with deckbuilding mechanics that might scratch the Soulslike itch, then I couldn't recommend Death Howl more. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2825880/Death_Howl/" rel="nofollow">Check out the Demo now on Steam</a>, I know <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="40310ab5-423c-4eee-903b-b3e8faa3c6bd" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/10-steam-next-fest-demos-you-need-to-try-june-2025" rel="nofollow">our very own Don Parsons enjoyed it too</a></p>

<h2><em>ANIMO Stars Arena</em></h2>

<p>Arena Mech Shooter<br>
Developed and Published by ANIMO Industries, Inc</p>

<p><em>ANIMO Stars Arena</em> is an arena shooter that borrows the ideas of cute animals as well as mecha inspired combat games like <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b376023c-fb2d-49ea-b4df-5f3a8a5044c4" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/gundam-breaker-4-review-build-fighters" rel="nofollow"><em>Gundam </em></a>or <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="03244906-2902-4e23-85ef-5130a9a95ce8" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/armored-core-vi-fires-of-rubicon-review-claw-grip-forever" rel="nofollow"><em>Armored Core</em></a>. Sure you're going into a competitive battle as a chicken in a tank, but each part of that tank can be customized.</p>

<p>Adjust the way you move, the defenses you have, and what types of weapons you're armed with to create a build that best fits your playstyle, or have a few prepared to swap between during battle.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2323240/ANIMO_Stars_Arena/" rel="nofollow">demo is also available on Steam.</a></p>

<h2><em>Prison of Husks</em></h2>

<p>PS2-Inspired Soulslike<br>
Developed and Published by Glass Head Dolls</p>

<p>I'm really not much of a Soulslike person, but I couldn't help but stop in front of <em>Prison of Husks</em>, a game where everything about the gothic castle setting, to blocky PS2 models just screamed at me to play it. We're not talking late PS2 either, this is like launch-title PS2 blockyness.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-mix-sgf-2025-prison-of-husks.jpg?itok=dVDZBRmg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-mix-sgf-2025-prison-of-husks.jpg?itok=d3ebZPWg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>You play as a pale doll that has come to life to try to explore or escape the castle.</p>

<p>The gameplay was quick fast paced and filled with all of the standard soulslike faire. Recharging stamina that you'll need to keep an eye on, a parry mechanic, and all kinds of secrets hidden around to stumble into.</p>

<p>While it looks like a PS2 title, there's no need to fear, the controls are incredibly fluid and it runs fantastically.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2975260/PRISON_OF_HUSKS/" rel="nofollow">demo is available on Steam</a> to play now!</p>



<p>Survival<br>
Developed and published by Channel37 Ltd</p>

<p>On a world where Humankind needed to leave earth it was discovered that in space it wasn't possible for new humans to be born. The solution to this was to gestate humans on earth with robot caretakers and send them up into space. In <em>The Last Caretaker</em>, you take on the role of a Caretaker who woke up long after the others all went offline… for some reason.</p>

<p>It's your goal to discover what happened as you explore the large open world, and also recover new means to create humans and send them up into space.</p>

<p><em>The Last Caretaker</em> was a survival game that really blew me away but the sheer number of Quality of Life features. Crafting that automatically pulls from inventory and nearby storage, schedule components to be built to reduce repetitive tasks, and process junk from the world for new materials.</p>

<p>With a manually crafted world (no procedural generation) and a story and upgrade system that will push you to continue exploring this will likely become the new <em>Subnautica </em>that everyone is talking about.</p>

<p>While there's no demo the game will be releasing in Early Access, what that Early Access will consist of has been <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1783560/The_Last_Caretaker/" rel="nofollow">outlined on their Steam page</a>.</p>

<h2><em>Gunstoppable</em></h2>

<p>Boomer Shooter<br>
Developed and Published by CAGE Studios</p>

<p>Having tried one Boomer Shooter it made sense that I should try another one. Gunstoppable is an interesting indie shooter where momentum is key to everything. The faster you're moving at any given time the more powerful your weapons become.</p>

<p>To compliment this there are not only a variety of different weapon options — Katana, Pistol, and Rocket Launcher for each hand — but there's also a wide variety of movement options at your disposal for speeding up.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-mix-sgf-2025-gunstoppable.jpg?itok=GYlAR-OZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-mix-sgf-2025-gunstoppable.jpg?itok=uu0R-PGv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Wires around arenas will let you grind, nearly any surface is wallrideable, and there's also a grappling hook to help you reach those elevated spaces. There's a really natural feeling magnetism to different movement opportunities that allows you to just 'know' you'll end up landing on the rail so you can focus on looking the other direction and shooting at your enemies.</p>

<p>Another very nice touch on the rails is that your speed there is based on how you're holding the control stick, as opposed to being based on the momentum you mounted the rail with. This means that at any point it's incredibly easy to reverse direction while staying on the rail.</p>

<p>You can get <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3724710/Gunstoppable/" rel="nofollow">more information about <em>Gunstoppable </em>on their Steam page.</a></p>

<h2><em>OFF</em></h2>

<p>RPG<br>
Developed by Mortis Ghost and Fangamer and published by Fangamer</p>

<p><em>OFF</em> is an interesting addition to the list as it's not technically a new game. Released in 2008 on <em>RPG Maker 2003</em>, it was released in Belgian before getting a fan translation in 2011. Following the strange Batter character, this game takes players through four interesting zones that are uniquely themed with turn-based combat.</p>

<p>The portion of the game that I got to play had be navigating through a theme park area including a swan boat ride that functioned like a Pokemon tile puzzle, and having to push a statue of the boss of the theme park onto a rollercoaster, to ride the ride and receive the souvenir photo to then be able to convince people that the boss and I are friendly enough to ride rollercoasters together.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-mix-sgf-2025-off.jpg?itok=z435wUg0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-mix-sgf-2025-off.jpg?itok=lPf8AHYL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This is the definition of the kind of strange indie game that would have been shared around the internet and become a cult classic at your school back in the day.</p>

<p>With art resembling <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f6cf121a-943f-4747-80d5-94ee48dff3ed" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/earthbound-25-year-anniversary" rel="nofollow"><em>Earthbound </em></a>and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="15fafc39-2b3b-48a4-b13b-e5103c535798" href="https://techraptor.net/games/undertale" rel="nofollow"><em>Undertale </em></a>(to use a more recent example even though it was released after) it's clear that <em>OFF </em>will become a very popular title.</p>

<p>An interesting addition for the remaster is that it includes original tracks from Toby Fox, among a variety of other artists.</p>

<p>You can download a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3339880/OFF/" rel="nofollow">prologue demo for <em>OFF </em>from Steam</a>, and the game will fully release on August 15th for Steam as well as Nintendo Switch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/10-steam-next-fest-demos-you-need-to-try-june-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With over 2,500 demos, Steam Next Fest is busy, and the June showcases happen right during the middle of Summer Game Fest. I know it can be overwhelming, so just like I did in February, I'm here showing 10 of the best demos I tried out over the past two weeks.</p>

<p>Give these games a shot if they seem like they might interest you, or keep an eye on them for something different. The only thing it will cost you is a bit of time, and you might just find the game you were looking for that you might never have heard of.</p>

<h2><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2592160/Dispatch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Dispatch">Dispatch</a></em></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dispatch.jpg?itok=W7OmH9CA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dispatch.jpg?itok=TMlkW_Pr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Brought to you by some of the former people at <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/telltale-games" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Telltale Games">Telltale Games</a>, <em>Dispatch </em>aims to capture the spirit of the best of Telltale with some added actual mechanical functions to it.</p>

<p>In what is essentially a playable superhero workcom, you are a dispatcher for a list of C-list villains and misfits who are in a second chance redemption program, and send them to put out fires, rescue cats from trees, and other do-gooder deeds.</p>

<p>You need to mix and match your team to send them to problems based on their skills and personalities, while protecting your town in a funny and compelling experience.</p>

<h2><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3404260/Dead_as_Disco/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Dead as Disco">Dead as Disco</a></em></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dead-as-disco.jpg?itok=L42eyt5H 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dead-as-disco.jpg?itok=0VWa1RUT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>A stylish high-octane rhythm beat-em-up, <em>Dead as Disco</em>&nbsp;is a really fun game to play, and is one of the trend of rhythm games that reward hitting on beat but don't require it. Being more accessible in that way, it's easy to recommend, as even if you don't hit perfectly, you feel great fighting foes, including in the set-piece battles that are showcased in their alpha stage like in the middle of a subway line.</p>

<p>The inclusion of a music importer for your own songs means this is going to be a game with almost infinite replayability beyond the core stages the developers are making.</p>

<h2><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1435410/Shrines_Legacy/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Shrine's Legacy">Shrine's Legacy</a></em></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shrines-legacy.jpg?itok=V7RoACdD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shrines-legacy.jpg?itok=Mbs_K0Q- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>There are many games that claim to be 16-bit inspired, but few manage to really capture the spirit of the generation as well as&nbsp;<em>Shrine's Legacy</em>.</p>

<p>Showcasing the best of action RPGs of the era, it feels like a game that was almost unlocked and given a few touchups with visuals, music (including chiptune versions of songs), gameplay, and even story that nail the feel of the classics in the genre. It brings co-operative play as well, and the whole experience was like cuddling into a nice warm blanket on a cold winter day.</p>

With cards representing the different mechs at your command, the battles play out with positioning, various energies to consider, and drones to deploy for satisfying gameplay that isn't a roguelite like many deckbuilders.</p>

<p>A colorful cast, intriguing premises to be explored, voice acting, and wonderful music,&nbsp;<em>Battle Suit Aces</em>&nbsp;is shaping up to be a big 2025 hit.</p>

It's pretty chill and has co-op for you to work with friends, though the demo's play space is limited.</p>

<p>A cozy puzzle experience with optional challenges and things to discover as you piece together the mysteries of a lost civilization, you'll make maps of various islands that you explore.&nbsp;<em>Map Map</em>&nbsp;leans into the creative side, as you can decorate your maps in a lot of ways if you choose, or keep strictly to business on what is shown on your map.</p>

<p>It could be perhaps a touch more challenging on when it accepts answers or letting you retry them, but the game was fun, and it prompts you to think about the world you're exploring.</p>

<p>You play as Ro, trying to reach and revive her recently deceased son. The spirit world is dark and full of terrors that you confront in tactical battles with your deckbuilding-based actions.</p>

<p>You build your deck from the resources you gather while fighting and exploring the world, a choice that is key to the atmosphere and sets it apart from many deckbuilders. The narrative is intriguing, the characters are compelling, and it looks to be another hit from publisher <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/11-bit-studios" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="11 Bit Studios ">11 Bit Studios</a>.</p>

It features an idea of the 'rural simple life' but it is willing to interrogate the concept unlike many games that go down that route, while the story also hints and shows mysteries to be uncovered on this island.</p>

<p>The characters are distinct and well realized it seems, and the gameplay featured involves stuff like inventory puzzles, minor obstacles (like balancing on a log over water), and figuring out the best routing for the limited time and energy you have.</p>

Solve puzzles and battle enemies in a game that captures the feel of the old 3D adventure RPGs with its own quirks and takes on things.</p>

There's a mystery at the core of the plot here, and you examine it from different angles. A theme of characters with psychological problems is present in it, and there's a very nice comic-book aesthetic to tie it all together with some interesting ideas.</p>
