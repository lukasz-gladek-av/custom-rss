<p>In the briefing, Zakeel Gordon, Executive Producer, Gavin Verhey, Principal Designer &amp; Set Design Lead for FINAL FANTASY, Dillon Deveney, Principal Game Designer, and Daniel Holt, Senior Game Designer, showed off cards featuring characters and moments from all 16 FINAL FANTASY games! There's so much to do through, so I'm highlighting my favorite cards from the briefing.</p>

<h2>Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy 1 Cards Bring Jobs To The Game</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-1.jpg?itok=HZ_n2507 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-1.jpg?itok=BhLM8qCA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>These artifacts, which create heroes when you cast them and auto-attach, also each give an added creature type to the wielder of the equipment! There's so much room to play in this space, and I love how evocative it is!</p>

<h2>Final Fantasy II Cuts A Dash With Firion</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-2-magic-the-gathering.jpg?itok=f3aZQkwn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-2-magic-the-gathering.jpg?itok=hBIagxQh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Among the cards shown that align with<em> FFII</em>, I'm really loving just how aggro and equipment-heavy you can get with Firion, Wild Rose Warrior! And the artwork from Yoshitaka Amano on the second Firion card is just... showstopping.</p>

<h2>Final Fantasy IV Jumps In With Dragoons!</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-4.jpg?itok=ugWa0dND 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-4.jpg?itok=-PkJyJtZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>I think that Jump mechanic on Kain is just so damn cool, and perfectly captures the feeling of Dragoons in the&nbsp;<em>FF&nbsp;</em>world. And check out this alt-art card for Cecil (not to mention the incredibly powerful ability on his card).</p>

<h2>Final Fantasy VII Has All The Heavy Hitters</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-7.jpg?itok=o9hEI9iu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-7.jpg?itok=tFMlXr91 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>We got to see so many&nbsp;<em>FFVII</em>&nbsp;cards at the preview event, but these were my favorite three. Cloud's ability to search up equipment is so good, Tifa's Landfall ability can make her pretty huge with the right lay-up, and this is one of 77 Golden Chase Chocobo cards which will only be available in Collector Booster packs! I confirmed via the press briefing that this Chocobo will be the&nbsp;<em>only</em>&nbsp;serialized card in the set.</p>

<h2>So... Many... Cids!!!</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/untitled-presentation.jpg?itok=94r0CtN_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/untitled-presentation.jpg?itok=dCM8CRI8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>There are so many more cards to go over from the reveals today, but in the interest of time we're going to leave you with... all of these Cids!!! Showing up in almost every game, these mechanically identical Cids each got their own art treatment tied to the games they show up in! Love him!</p>

<p>That's all for now, we'll keep adding more images along the way as we track the thrilling release of <i>Magic The Gathering Final Fantasy!</i></p>
