            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/lord-of-rings-battle-of-edoras-review-horses-and-pitchforks<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The clash of swords, the thunderous pounding of horses’ hooves - these of the sounds of war in the world of <i>Lord of the Rings</i>. And now, Games Workshop’s releasing a brand new Starter Set for their miniature wargame set in Tolkien’s universe (the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/lord-of-rings-middle-earth-strategy-battle-game-review-spring-2022-releases" rel="nofollow"><i>Middle-Earth Strategy Battle Game</i></a>). Following the story of the upcoming animated feature film, GW sent along a copy for me to review - so check out my thoughts on this epic, massive box in my <i>The Lord of The Rings: The War of the Rohirrim</i> – Battle of Edoras review.</p>

<h2><b>What’s Included in the Battle of Edoras Box?</b></h2>

<p>Battle of Edoras as a Starter Set truly does contain just about everything you need to begin your journey. The official contents are:</p>

<ul><li>Haleth, Prince of Rohan - mounted and on foot</li>
	<li>Háma, Prince&nbsp;of Rohan - mounted and on foot</li>
	<li>24 Rohan Warriors</li>
	<li>Wulf, High Lord of the Hill Tribes - mounted and on foot&nbsp;</li>
	<li>General Targg - mounted and on foot</li>
	<li>24&nbsp;Hill Tribesmen</li>
	<li>Two Rohan Houses</li>
	<li>The full hardcover 176-page rules manual</li>
	<li>48-page scenario and profiles booklet</li>
	<li>Double-sided 3’x3’ playmat, two reference guides, a range ruler, and 12 dice</li>
</ul><p>As you can see, this is a truly robust starter set, which you'd expect to see for its $220 USD MSRP. Now let's get into the box contents, the new rules of the game, and more!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battle-of-edoras-starter-set-pitched-battle-2.jpeg?itok=G6ScBJtD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battle-of-edoras-starter-set-pitched-battle-2.jpeg?itok=Uduml4Vd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The forces of Rohan square off against the Hill Tribesman in this epic showdown, featuring terrain from Battle Systems.</figcaption></figure><h2><b>How Does It Play/New Rules</b></h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-us/articles/2ifuwrwc/middle-earthtm-strategy-battle-game-key-changes-in-the-new-edition/" rel="nofollow">official article breaking down many of the larger changes</a> to the new set should serve as a go-to resource for tracking everything this new edition brings, but to quickly run through the details:</p>

<h3>New Profiles Break Things Up, Simplify</h3>

<p>Each and every character and unit in the game has undergone a significant change to their profiles. Some of these changes include new and different abilities, special gear, etc., while other changes are foundational to the very construction of the profile itself.</p>

<p>For instance, Courage is now a target number to beat, vs. a static ability. And the Shoot Value and Fight Value have been broke up into their own categories, which all just serve to simplify the process. In my opinion, <i>Middle-Earth Strategy Battle Game</i> has always been on the crunchier side of things - and there are still charts to consult based on the strength of weapons, etc. - but the changes here do hint at making the game more approachable.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battle-of-edoras-pretty-image.jpeg?itok=o9z_MXci 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battle-of-edoras-pretty-image.jpeg?itok=Do4oxLLT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The forces of Rohan clash with General Targg and Wulf, High Lord of the Hill Tribes. Image: Games Workshop.</figcaption></figure><h3>Intelligence Hints At Narrative Moments</h3>

<p>There’s a new stat on the profile of all units and characters: the Intelligence stat! This stat feels like a flexible stat that can be used in a variety of ways throughout the gameplay. For instance, the rulebook presents two opportunities: in one, a character is trying to free a relic from the ground and must pass an Intelligence check. In the other, Frodo’s been attacked by a special power from the Nazgul that forces him to make an Intelligence test to avoid being affected by it.</p>

<p>Here’s why I love this new addition, I think it truly does a lot of work to add the potential for narrative moments into the game. For a wargame based on some of the best storytelling of the twentieth century, it can sometimes feel like - aside from warriors squaring off 1v1 - it’s light on narrative touches. But now, with Intelligence, there’s so much open room in abilities, narrative play scenarios, and more to add even more storytelling moments and flourishes.</p>

<p>Beyond these two major changes, there are small tweaks and what I would call “quality of life improvements” to be found across the ruleset. Nothing here is earthshakingly different from the previous edition, but it feels very tightened up and tidy.</p>

<h3><b>The Models Included In The Battle for Edoras Box</b></h3>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battle-of-edoras-starter-set-good-heroes_0.jpg?itok=JNUICBNd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battle-of-edoras-starter-set-good-heroes_0.jpg?itok=M530e8q9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The princes of Rohan are shown here, both mounted and unmounted, in front of Battle Systems scenic terrain.</figcaption></figure><p>At this point - fair warning - there might be some slight spoilers for <i>The War of the Rohirrim</i> - at least in the fact that character’s crucial to the film will be discussed here. Nothing major, but worth shouting out.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The models included in the box feel very evenly balanced against one another, with all four good and evil heroes shining in their own light. To start, there’s Haleth, Prince of Rohan. He’s a strong fighter with three attacks, and comes mounted on an armored horse, and his special ability allows him to re-roll failed Wound rolls when he’s outnumbered.</p>

<p>Next up is Haleth’s brother, Háma, Prince of Rohan. He’s equipped with a bow, hand weapons, and is an expert rider on his mount. Though he only has two attacks, his special ability allows him to spend Will Points to allow nearby Rohan warriors to re-roll Wound Rolls of 1.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battle-of-edoras-starter-set-evil-heroes.jpeg?itok=5QHVwPSQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battle-of-edoras-starter-set-evil-heroes.jpeg?itok=qBAU-yP3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Evil Heroes, Wulf and General Targg, are seen here mounted and unmounted in front of Battle Systems terrain pieces.</figcaption></figure><p>On the evil side, there’s Wulf, High Lord of the Hill Tribes, who is also a strong fighter with three attacks, comes mounted, and can re-roll a single D6 during the duel roll (and <i>must</i> re-roll To Wound Rolls of natural 1 against an enemy Hero).</p>

<p>Alongside him is General Targg, a strong fighter with the Master of Battle ability (which lets him copy another friendly hero’s Heroic Action on a roll of 4+), and a more strategic ability that allows other friendly Dunland Warrior models near him to re-roll To Wound rolls of 1 if you’ve given priority to your opponent.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rohan-warriors.jpg?itok=LvmBks9O 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rohan-warriors.jpg?itok=FJk_h4LJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Battle of Edoras Rohan Warriors on display</figcaption></figure><p>The additional Rohan Warriors and Hill Tribesman are also fun, if standard, additions to the kit - and make up the great bulk of the forces. Rohan has armor, and the Hill Tribesman can bring flaming brands (which are pretty potent weapons with the Terror (Cavalry) and Terror (Beast) abilities). Overall, as you might expect, the Rohan Warriors have slightly better defense, and they also have a better Intelligence Score.</p>

<h2><b>The Look of the Models of Battle of Edoras</b></h2>

<p>The models included in this set all look really nice. While the Rohan Warriors are fairly standard in terms of their design and sculpt, I like the look of them all on foot. When I get these painted up in their traditional Rohan colors, I think they’re really going to stand out with their uniform design and long, pointed spears.</p>

<p>Contrasting them nicely is the chaotic look of the Hill Tribesman. With burning brands, pitchforks, and other improvised weapons, and with all of their models sculpted to look like they’re mid-run, there’s a kind of wild energy to these models that I really like.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battle-of-edoras-starter-set-hill-tribesman-sprue.jpeg?itok=zw28w7lk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battle-of-edoras-starter-set-hill-tribesman-sprue.jpeg?itok=9ucdDEh6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>An image of the sprue for the Hill Tribesman from Battle for Edoras, including lots of different rough-hewn weapon options.</figcaption></figure><p>Constructing these models, and the Rohan houses included in the kit, is a bit finicky. That’s my biggest (and really only) complaint with this set - there’s so much gluing of tiny pieces - in a way that feels a little outdated. I shouldn’t have to glue the front of a models face to the back of their head in the year of our Ilúvatar 2024.</p>

<h2><b>Special Note: Easy Rohan Terrain Perfect for Battle of Edoras</b></h2>

<p>I also wanted to take a moment here before the end of the review to make a special callout for one of my all-time favorite terrain solutions, <a href="https://battlesystems.co.uk/product-category/terrain/fantasy/" rel="nofollow">Battle Systems Fantasy Terrain</a>, because it fits so perfectly with the look, feel, and theme of <i>Lord of the Rings</i> and <i>War of the Rohirim. </i>This hard cardboard terrain, which comes pre-printed with lush imagery, snaps together easily, is highly modular, and takes a fraction of the time to set up.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battle-of-edoras-starter-set-battle-systems-terrain-showpiece.jpg?itok=DnL55YtR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battle-of-edoras-starter-set-battle-systems-terrain-showpiece.jpg?itok=6vbo-jZc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This setpiece from the Fantasy Village Battle Systems terrain kit adds some verticality and vivid design to the game.</figcaption></figure><p>Whenever I’m playing a skirmish wargame like <i>MeSBG</i>, <i>Frostgrave</i>, and <i>Warcry</i>, etc. I’m almost always reaching for this terrain vs. heavier plastic options. And while the terrain you see in my photos is from the Fantasy Village and Ruined Settlement kits, the set that really would be a one-to-one match for Rohan is the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/battle-systems-northern-settlement-and-ruined-monastery-preview" rel="nofollow">Northern Settlement set, which TechRaptor’s own Adam Potts reviewed a few years back</a>.</p>

<p>These pieces are obviously not part of this Starter Set (which comes with sprues for two Rohan Houses - I’ve only built the one so far), but I thought they deserved a callout here for anyone interested in getting into <i>War of the Rohirrim</i>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battle-of-edoras-starter-set-hill-tribesman.jpg?itok=f6PaWl7N 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battle-of-edoras-starter-set-hill-tribesman.jpg?itok=OhPL3yiK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Hill Tribesmen bring a ferociousness to the battlefield.</figcaption></figure><h2><b><i>The Lord of The Rings: The War of the Rohirrim</i></b><b> – Battle of Edoras - Final Thoughts</b></h2>

<p>There’s no other way of putting it - this Starter Kit is a masterpiece and a must-have for newcomers hoping to get into Games Workshop’s <i>Lord of the Rings</i> miniature game. Battle of Edoras is such a hugely robust kit, with over fifty models, to large buildings, the entire core rulebook in hardcover, and more.</p>

<p>The gameplay has been nicely streamlined in ways, though this still isn’t even as simple as <i>Age of Sigmar</i> (which of course has its own moments of crunchiness). So while brand new newcomers to wargaming might feel a bit stumped by the ruleset here and the intricacy of constructing these models, anyone familiar with wargaming at all will fall right in with this Starter Set.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stalker-2-review-flawed-yet-compelling.1049856/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/stalker-2-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In an alternate future, former Soviet scientists inadvertently created a dangerous region filled with mutants and strange phenomena. It has been 15 years since we've last had a chance to step foot in the Zone — in this&nbsp;<em>STALKER 2</em>&nbsp;review, I'll explain how GSC Game World has succeeded (and failed) at bringing this classic survival game into the modern era.</p>

<p><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d17f3e9f-b364-4022-97dc-49c7e0851506" href="https://techraptor.net/games/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl" rel="nofollow"><em>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl</em></a>&nbsp;is the latest entry in a niche subgenre of survival games. As is tradition, players take on the role of someone new to the enigmatic "Zone" — the region surrounding the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant that exhibits strange, physics-defying "anomalies" and is filled to the brim with deadly mutants and even deadlier men.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stalker-2-review-holding-a-bolt-given-to-you-by-richter.jpg?itok=FivDrhfy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stalker-2-review-holding-a-bolt-given-to-you-by-richter.jpg?itok=6nI2Bjs5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A simple bolt is enough to reveal (and in many cases, temporarily disable) the strange anomalies in the Zone.</figcaption></figure><h2>Stepping Into the Zone</h2>

<p>Each&nbsp;<em>STALKER</em>&nbsp;game gives its protagonist a burning motivation to explore the Zone. Our hero "Skif" has managed to sneak in after the Zone quite literally reached out and touched him, depositing a mysterious <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="791ae017-1b00-44d7-b743-dd1d4d274208" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/stalker-2-artifacts" rel="nofollow">artifact</a> in his apartment's laundry basket (and leaving a hole in the wall, to boot).</p>

<p>Skif's naivete and inexperience with the Zone make him a perfect audience surrogate. Neither he nor the player truly knows what to expect, and you're carefully guided through the potential hazards you'll encounter in the first hour of gameplay: strange anomalies, deadly mutants, and merciless bandits.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are several competing factions in the Zone, and your actions and choices could make a faction completely hostile to you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The prologue is very much on rails, but the time after it represents the heart of&nbsp;<em>STALKER 2</em>&nbsp;well — you could opt to head straight to the nearby town of Zalissya, you could chase down some nearby side quests, or you could also disregard these options entirely and start exploring the Lesser Zone region of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c6b0767a-b575-4657-971f-daae39968aae" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/stalker-2-map-and-locations" rel="nofollow">the map</a>&nbsp;on your own.</p>

<p>As someone who played some of the original&nbsp;<em>STALKER: Shadow of Chernobyl</em>, I was initially impressed by&nbsp;<em>STALKER 2's</em>&nbsp;presentation. It&nbsp;seemed to be everything that a fan of the franchise would have wanted: a stable, relatively bug-free representation of the unique&nbsp;<em>STALKER</em>&nbsp;experience in a modern engine. Sadly, that sense of wonder didn't last for long.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stalker-2-review-the-whip-rifle-jammed-due-to-low-durability-in-stalker-2.jpg?itok=5j9b8ejk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stalker-2-review-the-whip-rifle-jammed-due-to-low-durability-in-stalker-2.jpg?itok=_CN64RPl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Low durability causes guns to randomly jam, forcing you to clear the stovepipe before you can shoot again.</figcaption></figure><h2>Flimsy Guns Falling Apart</h2>

<p>The first major issue I noticed with&nbsp;<em>STALKER 2</em>&nbsp;was with its guns. Firing a few dozen rounds would absolutely tank the condition of your firearm. The durability damage to weapons and armor alike is simply far too harsh, especially with legendarily resilient weapons platforms such as the AK series of rifles.</p>

<p>To illustrate this point, one of the final story missions features a running gun battle through a large underground facility. My high-quality, unique sniper rifle was in perfect condition at the outset, and it was practically falling apart at the halfway point of the mission. I had to pick up guns from dead enemies to have a fighting chance.</p>

<p>Adding insult to injury is the need to pay Technicians to maintain and repair your weapon for you. These repair costs were frankly absurd at launch (and have since been toned down in a post-launch patch), but the durability issue remains a seriously annoying problem.</p>

<p>There's no way to repair or maintain your weapons in the field, either, despite the fact that Skif shows off his ability to expertly reassemble an AKM-74S in under a minute during an early-game cutscene. Either the durability of guns needs to be substantially increased or there needs to be a mechanic to repair them a small amount in the field.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stalker-2-review-the-player-equipped-with-a-shotgun-in-front-of-three-dead-bloodsucker-mutants-in-zaton-in-stalker-2.jpg?itok=aIm-W_7s 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stalker-2-review-the-player-equipped-with-a-shotgun-in-front-of-three-dead-bloodsucker-mutants-in-zaton-in-stalker-2.jpg?itok=WNdVty-X 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bloodsuckers are notorious for appearing seemingly from nowhere.</figcaption></figure><h2>Enemy Spawns Are a Farce</h2>

<p>Gun issues aside, I fully embraced the spirit of a clever, cautious Stalker as I explored the Zone. I'd carefully check my corners and sweep rooms before moving forward, lest I be ambushed from behind. Unfortunately, the game was rigged from the start.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>STALKER</em>&nbsp;franchise was once renowned for its "A-Life" system of interacting NPCs. You could be trodding along a relatively safe path and happen upon two groups of men in a gun battle or a group of mutants attacking a lone Stalker. That happens here, but the way these events and NPCs spawn is, frankly, atrocious.</p>

<p>Enemies would simply pop into existence within my line of sight. Sometimes, they would appear within a few meters of me! This didn't always happen, but the game does a poor job of hiding random enemy spawns much of the time.&nbsp;<em>STALKER 2's</em>&nbsp;handling of enemy spawns is downright clumsy.</p>

<p>This is especially frustrating in confined spaces. In one side mission, I went into a junkyard maze of crushed cars. I activated a side objective and was immediately set upon by two groups of bandits, even though I had checked all approaches and there was no one in sight. It shattered my suspension of disbelief then and there.</p>

<p>As with previous&nbsp;<em>STALKER</em>&nbsp;games,&nbsp;<em>STALKER 2</em>&nbsp;requires you to make choices that will affect the world around you and, ultimately, which ending you get. There are several competing factions in the Zone, and your actions and choices could make a faction completely hostile to you. None of this is communicated as clearly as it should be.</p>

<p>For example, some major choices are presented to the player with a unique interface showing a choice on either side. Each choice shows a particular symbol, but there is no easy way to know which faction these symbols represent or what the effects of your actions are on the world, nor is there any way to see your overall standing with a faction.</p>

<p>These same symbols are shown on the major bases (that is to say, towns) on the map. I intuited that the funky B symbol represented the Ward, but what faction is represented by the radiation symbol? How will my choices benefit them or harm them? I had no idea and no real way to find out.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I could imagine asking any character about a particular faction and they'd be able to tell me anything I wanted to know, but that's simply not an option</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Identifying these factions and what their motivations are is difficult, and this has consequences for you. I found myself completely cut off from several major bases simply because I opposed the Ward. In a game with limited fast travel, that made exploring certain regions of the map a downright ordeal.</p>

<p>There is no recorded in-game information for mutants, anomalies, or other zone phenomena, either. I only learned the names of Bloodsuckers and Poltergeists after I killed a truckload of them and happened upon their names through random NPC dialogue or mission objective text.</p>

<p><em>STALKER 2</em>&nbsp;needs&nbsp;a way to clearly find out this information and a section of the PDA to catalog what you've learned about the Zone. I could imagine asking any character about a particular faction and they'd be able to tell me anything I wanted to know, but that's simply not an option. This lack of information made it difficult to truly understand the world I was in.</p>

<p>I spent close to 200 hours thoroughly exploring&nbsp;<em>STALKER 2</em>&nbsp;at a fairly relaxed pace. While it has its flaws, most of these are minor issues that are easily fixable; gun durability could be buffed a bit without too much work, and GSC Game World has already addressed the problem of outrageous repair costs and paltry payouts for mission rewards.</p>

<p>The more substantial issues such as a lack of information about factions or the janky enemy spawns can be fixed, too, although that will probably take a little more time. Thus far, the developers have shown a commitment to ironing out the rough edges and I believe that they'll make the overall experience much smoother in time.</p>

<p>Still, I can't help but love the Zone and its colorful cast of characters. There are no good guys or bad guys, there are just guys, and they all have their own motivations for the actions they take. It's up to you to hear them out and decide which choices will be best for you, the Zone, and all of the odd people (and mutants) who dwell within.</p>

<p>If you can get past these flaws,&nbsp;<em>STALKER 2</em>&nbsp;is a unique flavor of survival game that can be enjoyed by veterans of the franchise and new players alike. If you can't stand the occasional jankiness, though, it would be best to wait a few months and see if GSC Game World can iron out the more serious problems.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/towers-of-aghasba-early-access-preview-promising-future<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ever since the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4194f220-0158-4c21-86bf-7d9322d3390d" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/towers-of-aghasba-hands-off-preview-revitalize-island-with-new-mechanics" rel="nofollow"><strong>hands-off preview event</strong></a> showcasing&nbsp;<em>Towers of Aghasba,&nbsp;</em>I've been excited to get my hands on a copy and see how the ecosystems and biomes work. The art looked amazing, the creature designs varied, and being able to heal animals and the land is something I love IRL. Getting to try out new mechanics related to restoring the environment, as well as the fresh take it gives crafting games, really drew my interest. After multiple ecosystems, two save games, and more, this is my take on the title.&nbsp;</p>

<hr><p><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b2ff7c2f-3a27-4fa4-89cd-ea40cb660f04" href="https://techraptor.net/games/towers-of-aghasba" rel="nofollow"><strong><i>Towers of Aghasba</i></strong></a>&nbsp;is a new crafting-building game under the survival genre. To call it a simple survival game, however, is to diminish the unique mechanics that set it apart from other titles. A focus on restoring the natural world, balancing human expansion, and defeating the Withered corruption combine to create a visually compelling and saturated world that is ever-changing.&nbsp;</p>

Depending on where you put your Colossal Seed, the types of animals attracted will change. Different biomes sprout different plants, and each time you grow the tree, you'll see new plants and animals appear.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You're not tasked with just revitalizing the ecosystems of Aghasba, but the civilization of the Shimu, as well. Collecting resources, building up different villages, and restoring relics of the past are linked to the colossal trees. There's a price for human expansion, however.</p>

<p>Amity, the essence of life found in living things, is used to fuel the environments around the Colossal trees, activate portals, and more. Picking plants, chopping trees, and killing animals all deplete your Amity. Rarer resources take larger amounts of Amity. You'll even take damage if you pick something with no Amity to give.</p>

Without Amity you won't be able to upgrade ecosystems, unlock any fast travel, or restore Sacred Forests. These are all needed to keep your villages and capital city going.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On top of that, there's the Withered, the main enemies in <em>Towers of Aghasba</em>. A pestilence on the land, Withered areas sap your health. Withered nests are surrounded by various enemies, all looking to take your life. There's some variation to the enemies, but most of the ones you'll encounter are humanoid, giant hands, or spiders. There's an arachnophobia setting for those who fear the creepy crawlies. With that said, there's not a lot of variety in Withered enemies as of yet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first chapter of the Shimu in&nbsp;<em>Towers of Aghasba</em>&nbsp;is fully fleshed out in the Early Access release. There's humor in the narrative, as well as a serious tone concerning the extinction of the Jubanga and nature. Most of the story revolves around learning the history of the Shimu and their flight from Aghasba.&nbsp;</p>

All backgrounds are hand-painted with inspiration drawn from Studio Ghibli films, such as&nbsp;<em>Naussica of the Valley of Wind.&nbsp;</em>When a shrine is restored or a tree upgraded, the transformation art is amazing. The unfurling of vines, sprouting of grass, and blossoming of flowers is a sight to see.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While it all sounds fantastic,&nbsp;<em>Towers of Aghasba</em>&nbsp;is an early access title that comes with its own share of problems. Some bugs are to be expected, but you can clip through rocks while swimming, lag can cause enemies to jump locations, game crashes, and inconsistent atmospheric music. Some things have been greatly improved in the few patches that have gone live since the game's release, but there are still various glitches that need to be worked out.</p>

<p>This has caused multiple changes in recipes and items. Some recipes haven't appeared where they're supposed to. Stations are having their plans changed, if they show up at all. Animals and plants aren't loading properly, even though a fix was deployed. The first month may be filled with multiple small updates to improve the quality of the game and address issues players experience.&nbsp;</p>

Having different creatures spawn depending on ecosystem proximity, and other location factors, is a complex mechanic. This also impacts resources in the area and what becomes available to the player. Balancing the inputs, outputs, how these resources affect multiplayer interactions, and game requirements all take fine-tuning.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thankfully, the dev team at Dreamlit is on top of it all, ensuring bugs are dealt with quickly, while focusing on continuing to create more compelling content. The roadmap for future updates is impressive, and will include access to the region the fourth god is in. It's expected access to the Sea Temple to the southwest of mainland Aghasba will also come soon.&nbsp;</p>

Swamp and Mountain are in the works, with a Mountain biome most likely going to the north of Moyo Vale and containing snow. While these ecosystems appear to be coming towards the end of 2025, a new area is set to come in an update in early 2025. With the roadmap going into 2026 it can be surmised that the Early Access phase will last over a year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I know I'm excited to see new enemies, new animals, how creature relationships can improve, and potentially expand the game further. For those that are interested in a new take on city building, and crafting, with some survival mixed in,&nbsp;<em>Towers of Aghasba</em>&nbsp;is the game to try. I'll be keeping an eye for future development and new content to see where Early Access takes the game.&nbsp;</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Call of Duty Squid Game Crossover Announced for January]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-squid-game-crossover</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-squid-game-crossover-announced-for-january.1049778/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-squid-game-crossover<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Activision Blizzard has announced a&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty Squid Game&nbsp;</em>crossover for January, and if that one was on your bingo card, then I'm going to need you to tell me where you get your bingo cards from.</p>

<p>We don't know too much about the crossover yet; it's presumably set to coincide with the start of&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6</em>'s Season 2, so we likely won't learn more until we're just a couple of weeks away from that season's commencement.</p>

<p>However, we do know that the worlds of&nbsp;<em>Squid Game&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>will collide in some way. Presumably,&nbsp;<em>Squid Game&nbsp;</em>will worm its way into both&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Warzone</em>, but we'll have to wait and see.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-duty-squid-game-paper.jpg?itok=qpX5rIBU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/call-of-duty-squid-game-paper.jpg?itok=fqCLmqDW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The worlds of&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Squid Game&nbsp;</em>are about to collide.</figcaption></figure><p>In the very brief teaser trailer released earlier today, a soldier walks into a room and sees two other soldiers on the floor, presumably dead.</p>

<p>Between the soldiers' bodies, he sees a small piece of paper, which he picks up. On that paper are three symbols: a circle, a triangle, and a square. They're not PlayStation symbols, though; they're the distinctive&nbsp;<em>Squid Game&nbsp;</em>shapes that appear on workers' masks in the show.</p>

<p>We then cut to a rather clever variation on the&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>logo that includes the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Squid Game&nbsp;</em>symbols. It's really not much to go on, but hey, if you're a&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>fan, you can have some fun theorizing what the crossover might entail before it lands.</p>




<p>This is, of course, far from&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em>'s first weird crossover. The franchise has previously entertained the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shredder-from-tmnt-stalks-into-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-warzone-2" rel="nofollow"><em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em>' Shredder</a>, noted gamer fuels <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-teams-up-with-mt-dew-and-doritos-for-charity-and-loot" rel="nofollow">Mountain Dew and Doritos</a>, and other strange collaborations as guests.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>news, the franchise's latest game&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>apparently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-series-sales-black-ops-6-launch" rel="nofollow">enjoyed the biggest launch</a> the series has ever seen, helping to catapult&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>as a whole over the 500 million sales mark.</p>

<p>That's despite a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-paid-audio-option" rel="nofollow">rather dubious audio pack</a> announced prior to the game's launch, one that seemingly enhances in-game audio like gunshots and footsteps for players willing to fork out a little extra cash.</p>
