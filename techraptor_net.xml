            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP&nbsp;</em>developer Dragami Games has announced it's signed an agreement with Taiwanese "IP investment and development" company Nada Holdings to develop new projects based on the aforementioned hack-and-slash property.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://nadaholdings.com/nada-holdings-and-dragami-games-launch-new-ip-development-for-lollipop-chainsaw/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on the official Nada Holdings website, the company says "multiple new projects" based on&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw</em>&nbsp;will be launched as a collaboration between Nada and Dragami, although the company stops short of saying exactly what those projects will be.</p>

<p>Nada does, however, say that "cumulative sales" of&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw&nbsp;</em>have reached 1.5 million. That figure presumably includes both the original&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-release-date" rel="nofollow">last year's remaster</a>, since the company makes reference to "13 years of continued fan support".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lollipop-chainsaw-new-projects-combat.jpg?itok=tjF6mMgJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lollipop-chainsaw-new-projects-combat.jpg?itok=uSgYR-QP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>More&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw&nbsp;</em>is on the way.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Nada, the new collaboration between itself and Dragami aims to expand <i>Lollipop Chainsaw&nbsp;</i>through "multifaceted projects and cross-industry collaborations", so presumably, it's not just new games the two are working on.</p>

<p>Dragami CEO Shohei Sato says the new projects will "carry on the spirit and charm of the original while bringing fresh value to the franchise", while Nada Holdings chairman Joe Teng says his company will "devote itself wholeheartedly to preserving the spirit of the original work and meeting the expectations of its fans".</p>

<p>Teng also says the collaboration will result in a "wide range of new projects", which, again, indicates that we're not just in for a&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw&nbsp;</em>sequel. I'd be surprised if there isn't some kind of anime series or streaming show in the works, as well as a spinoff or two.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw</em>, it's a hack-and-slash action game that was originally released way back in the mists of 2012 for seventh-gen machines. The original game was the result of a collaboration between&nbsp;<em>Killer7</em>'s Suda51 and James Gunn, who's currently helming the latest&nbsp;<em>Superman&nbsp;</em>movie.</p>

<p>In 2022, a remake of&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lollipop-chainsaw-remake-as-close-as-possible-to-original-say-devs" rel="nofollow">was announced</a>, but following requests from fans, the remake was subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-remaster-remake" rel="nofollow">scaled back to a remaster</a>, likely to stick to the developers' intentions of making the new version "as close as possible" to the original.</p>

<p>In any case, <i>Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP&nbsp;</i>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2658450/LOLLIPOP_CHAINSAW_RePOP/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010519" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/lollipop-chainsaw-repop/9ntpb0c2028v" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>&nbsp;(as well as Switch 2 via backwards compatibility).</p>
