            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Frogwares has revealed that its upcoming horror game&nbsp;<em>The Sinking City 2&nbsp;</em>will be delayed into next year, and it's all down to the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://frogwares.com/the-sinking-city-2-delay-announcement/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on its official website, Frogwares says that although it technically hasn't announced a release window for the survival horror sequel, it acknowledges that both its fans and Frogwares itself "were expecting a 2025 launch".</p>

<p>However, thanks to "frequent drone and missile attacks, incoming power outages, and the need to adapt to unstable conditions" owing to Russian attacks on Ukraine, Frogwares says it needs additional development time to "finish the game properly".</p>

<p>Frogwares promises that the extra time will allow it to make&nbsp;<em>The Sinking City 2&nbsp;</em>"tense, atmospheric, and deeply unsettling in all the right ways", promising to honor the survival horror genre's focus on "tension, pacing, combat, and atmosphere".</p>

<p><em>The Sinking City 2&nbsp;</em>was originally announced back in March 2024 during that month's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-partner-preview-recap-check-out-all-news-and-reveals" rel="nofollow">Xbox Partner Preview</a> showcase. Like the first game, it promises to deliver "a distinct atmosphere of cosmic horror and twisted designs" inspired by the writing of H.P. Lovecraft.</p>

<p>Unlike the first title, however,&nbsp;<em>The Sinking City 2&nbsp;</em>will focus on survival horror mechanics; Frogwares promises "inventory management, optional puzzles, and backtracking to newly unlocked areas and hidden treasures", just like the genre's stalwarts.</p>




<p><em>The Sinking City 2&nbsp;</em>is set to launch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2825860/The_Sinking_City_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10009208" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and Xbox Series X|S sometime next year.

            <title><![CDATA[New Report Alleges Over a Quarter of European Game Devs Lost Their Jobs This Year]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/report-european-game-devs-quarter-layoffs</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-report-alleges-over-a-quarter-of-european-game-devs-lost-their-jobs-this-year.1330606/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report claims that over a quarter of people working in the gaming industry in Europe have lost their jobs over the last twelve months or so, with many of those affected still looking for work.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/over-26-of-european-game-professionals-were-laid-off-in-the-past-year-more-than-10-still-searching-for-jobs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, the latest Big Games Industry Employment Survey reports that over 26% of workers in game development in Europe have been laid off over the last year or so, and 10.4% of that number are still searching for a new job.</p>

<p>According to the survey, the most commonly-affected areas for layoffs are design, art, and QA testing, and those on the creative side of the industry "also felt the least secure in their roles". Perhaps unsurprisingly, management, HR, and analytics felt a much stronger sense of job security.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gaming-industry-europe-layoffs-report-office.jpg?itok=O-B75yie 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gaming-industry-europe-layoffs-report-office.jpg?itok=DTc-9xz0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Developers across Europe are losing their jobs at a rate of knots, apparently. Sony Santa Monica shown only for illustrative purposes.</figcaption></figure><p>Salaries for many jobs across Europe have fallen as well, including programming, project management, and recruitment. Naturally, that also means salary satisfaction is lower than it was last year.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the survey also found that the gender pay gap is very much alive and well in the gaming industry, with huge gaps between men and women in areas like the C-suite executive level and project management.</p>

<p>That disparity extends to diversity and inclusion initiatives as well; the report found that the majority of studios polled don't have dedicated DEI specialists, and that number has risen since last year as well.</p>

<p>Generally, this year's Big Games Industry Employment Survey does not paint a particularly positive picture of the industry, but given the sheer amount of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hyper-light-breaker-development-ending-layoffs" rel="nofollow">layoffs</a>, project <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">closures</a>, and studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">shutdowns</a> over the last few years, that's hardly surprising.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/funcom-european-game-developer-layoffs.jpg?itok=Yqj8hVBW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/funcom-european-game-developer-layoffs.jpg?itok=AY5KVBjG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Many European studios, like Norwegian outfit Funcom, have let employees go over the last twelve months.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, many of the studios laying employees off, whether that be in Europe or elsewhere, aren't exactly struggling.</p>

<p><em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>has proven a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-sales-1m-infographic" rel="nofollow">very successful project</a> for Funcom, but the studio decided to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-funcom-layoffs" rel="nofollow">lay employees off earlier this month</a> anyway. Similarly, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" rel="nofollow">sweeping layoffs</a> at Xbox don't seem to be down to any performance lull on the studio's part, as its&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-revenue-up-microsoft-2025" rel="nofollow">revenue grew this fiscal year</a>.</p>
