            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>A Short Hike&nbsp;</em>developer Adam Robinson-Yu has announced that he's ceased work on his project&nbsp;<em>Untitled Paper RPG</em>, but he's released a free demo if you want to know how the game would have turned out.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://adamgryu.itch.io/paper-game/devlog/971220/i-might-never-finish-this-game-so-im-releasing-the-demo" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> on his Itch.io page, Robinson-Yu says that after taking a break from <i>Untitled Paper RPG&nbsp;</i>to work on&nbsp;<em>A Short Hike</em>, as well as its various ports and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/short-hike-99-is-multiplayer-mod-for-up-to-99-players" rel="nofollow">updates</a>, he found he "didn't really want to go back to [<em>Untitled Paper RPG</em>]".</p>

<p>He says development on the project "had become difficult", which was the reason for taking a break from it in order to work on&nbsp;<em>A Short Hike</em>. The game technically isn't completely canceled; Robinson-Yu says he "might return" to it someday, but that he "[doesn't] see [himself] making time for this RPG in near future".</p>

<p>In the end, Robinson-Yu says he simply "started to lose the joy that [he] felt working on [<em>Untitled Paper RPG</em>]", which is usually a pretty good sign that it's time to stop and look for something new, if you ask me.</p>

<p>However, if you do want to know how&nbsp;<em>Untitled Paper RPG&nbsp;</em>might have turned out, then there's a free demo available from <a href="https://adamgryu.itch.io/paper-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Robinson-Yu's Itch.io page</a> right now. It constitutes around an hour or two of gameplay, but don't expect it to feel like a finished product.</p>

It's not clear whether any of these games will see the light of day, of course.</p>

<p>If you want to check out what Robinson-Yu was doing during his&nbsp;<em>Untitled Paper RPG&nbsp;</em>sabbatical,&nbsp;<em>A Short Hike&nbsp;</em>is available now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1055540/A_Short_Hike/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/a-short-hike/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 4</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/a-short-hike/9nk78df207sd" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox One</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/a-short-hike-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>, and you can play it on all of those consoles' successors through backwards compatibility as well.</p>
