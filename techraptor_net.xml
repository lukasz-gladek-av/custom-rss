Here's everything that was shown during this year's Summer Game Fest presentation!</p>

<hr><h2><em>Mortal Shell 2&nbsp;</em>looks suitably brutal, out 2026</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mortal-shell-ii-summer-game-fest-2025.jpg?itok=e9LlRZC5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mortal-shell-ii-summer-game-fest-2025.jpg?itok=aGUNkDhX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A new&nbsp;<em>Mortal Shell&nbsp;</em>is on the way.</figcaption></figure><p>A sequel to the grimdark Soulslike&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/mortal-shell" rel="nofollow">Mortal Shell</a>&nbsp;</em>was the first trailer on the ticket, and it looks like exactly what you'd expect from a&nbsp;<em>Mortal Shell&nbsp;</em>sequel. It's coming to PC and current-gen consoles in 2026.</p>

<h2>Kojima talks&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2</em></h2>

<p>Next, we got to see a Summer Game Fest-exclusive clip of the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2</em>, which launches for PlayStation 5 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">on June 26th</a> (so in just a couple of weeks!).</p>

<h2><em>Chronicles: Medieval&nbsp;</em>is a strategy sandbox with a silly name</h2>

<p>After Kojima's&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>talk, a new medieval sandbox strategy game by the name of&nbsp;<em>Chronicles: Medieval&nbsp;</em>(yes, really) was revealed. We didn't get to see gameplay, just a rain-soaked trailer. It's coming to Early Access on PC in 2026.</p>

<h2><em>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds&nbsp;</em>launches in September, gets&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>team-up</h2>

<p>If you haven't gotten around to playing&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">Mario Kart World</a>&nbsp;</em>yet, don't worry; as usual, Sonic is here to pick up the slack.&nbsp;<em>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds&nbsp;</em>launches on September 25th, and it's getting a&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>crossover as well.</p>

<h2><em>Code Vein II&nbsp;</em>brings more anime Soulslike action next year</h2>




<p>Everything in this show is lining up for 2026, isn't it? Well,&nbsp;<em>Code Vein II&nbsp;</em>is no exception. It's a followup to Bandai Namco's <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/code-vein" rel="nofollow">2019 anime Soulslike</a>, and it's got plenty of nasty monsters to slay and anime cuties to gawk at.</p>

<h2><em>End of Abyss&nbsp;</em>is a horror game from ex-<em>Little Nightmares&nbsp;</em>folks</h2>

<p>Next up, we got a first look at&nbsp;<em>End of Abyss</em>, a watery top-down horror game from a new studio comprising some of the folks who worked on&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares&nbsp;</em>at Tarsier Studios. Take a guess when this one's coming out! (It's 2026.)</p>

<h2><em>Game of Thrones: War for Westeros&nbsp;</em>is a "premium real-time strategy game" for PC</h2>

<p>We didn't get much info about the next title,&nbsp;<em>Game of Thrones: War for Westeros</em>, other than the fact that it's a "premium real-time strategy game" built for PC. Hey, you'll never guess wh-yep, it's 2026.</p>

<h2><em>Atomic Heart II</em>'s debut trailer looks suitably wacky</h2>




<p>Developer Mundfish announced the sequel to 2023's&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/atomic-heart" rel="nofollow">Atomic Heart</a>&nbsp;</em>next, and it looks about as crazy as you'd expect; it seems that the studio is leaning into the wackiness inherent in the first game's setup. No 2026 release for this one yet; we don't know when it's coming.</p>

<h2><em>The Cube&nbsp;</em>is another Mundfish game, and it sounds like it wants&nbsp;<em>Destiny</em>'s crown</h2>

<p>After the&nbsp;<em>Atomic Heart II&nbsp;</em>trailer, we got to see a reveal for&nbsp;<em>The Cube</em>, another Mundfish game that takes the form of an "MMORPG shooter" set in the same universe as&nbsp;<em>Atomic Heart</em>. Again, no release window for this one.</p>

<h2><em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword&nbsp;</em>looks like it's got parrying in it</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-summer-game-fest-2025.jpg?itok=Id-cRYf7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-summer-game-fest-2025.jpg?itok=P4PqXPUL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword&nbsp;</em>is another parry-centric action game, it seems.</figcaption></figure><p>Next, it's Capcom's turn to show off, and a new trailer for&nbsp;<em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword&nbsp;</em>appears to confirm that yes, the game will have a parry system in it, like many other action games (and turn-based RPGs) nowadays. 2026 for this one, shockingly.</p>

<h2><em>Felt That: Boxing&nbsp;</em>appears to be some kind of Muppet-like boxing game</h2>

<p>The next trailer to be shown during Summer Game Fest 2025 was an odd duck, to say the least.&nbsp;<em>Felt That: Boxing&nbsp;</em>is a Muppet-style boxing game with adorable fuzzy characters and lots of swearing. No release window, but it does have a Flying Lotus soundtrack.</p>

<h2>Square Enix's&nbsp;<em>Killer Inn&nbsp;</em>is a social deduction game with a unique style</h2>

<p>Next, it's&nbsp;<em>Killer Inn</em>, a social deduction game from Square Enix. Someone has been murdered, and players will either take the role of the hunter or the hunted. From there, you'll need to deduce who committed the crime. This one's coming soon, and there'll be a closed beta too.</p>

<h2><em>Arc Raiders&nbsp;</em>gets an October release date</h2>

<p>Extraction shooter&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders&nbsp;</em>is up next, and it's got an October release date now, plus a new sparkly trailer that shows off its aesthetic.</p>

<h2>MMORPG&nbsp;<em>Chrono Odyssey&nbsp;</em>will let you try it out later this month</h2>

<p><em>Chrono Odyssey</em>, the upcoming "<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/open-world-mmorpg-chrono-odyssey-made-in-unreal-engine-5-finally-reveals-gameplay" rel="nofollow">next-generation action MMORPG</a>", will be hosting a Steam playtest between June 20th and 22nd, so if you want to try out this (admittedly great-looking) action RPG, that'll be your chance.</p>

<h2><em>MIO: Memories In Orbit&nbsp;</em>has a demo you can check out now</h2>

<p>Want to give pretty-looking Metroidvania&nbsp;<em>MIO: Memories In Orbit&nbsp;</em>a go? Well, the good news is that you can do exactly that right now on PC, since a demo was revealed during the Summer Game Fest 2025 showcase.</p>

<h2><em>Out of Words&nbsp;</em>is a "handcrafted" platformer from Epic</h2>

<p>Epic Games Publishing stepped up next to reveal&nbsp;<em>Out of Words</em>, a "handcrafted" puzzle-platformer that looks like it has more than a touch of&nbsp;<em>Unravel&nbsp;</em>about it. You guessed it: this one is coming in 2026.</p>

<h2><em>Lego Voyagers </em>looks adorable, frankly</h2>




<p>Annapurna Interactive and Light Brick, the folks behind&nbsp;<em>Lego Builder's Journey</em>, have announced&nbsp;<em>Lego Voyagers</em>, a rather cute-looking co-op puzzler coming to PC and consoles...err, sometime in the future.</p>

<h2><em>Nicktoons &amp; the Dice of Destiny&nbsp;</em>brings Nickelodeon characters together</h2>

<p>Nickelodeon characters like SpongeBob, Danny Phantom, and the FairlyOdd Parents together for a fantasy action game from the folks at the rather unfortunately-named GameMill. This one is coming in fall.</p>

<h2>Surprise!&nbsp;<em>Lies of P</em>'s DLC is out now</h2>

<p>The next trailer was for the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lies-of-p-dlc-q1-2025-new-ip" rel="nofollow"><em>Overture&nbsp;</em>DLC</a> for puppet Soulslike&nbsp;<em>Lies of P</em>, and hey, it's available to play right now, so if you want more of P's adventures in Krat, you can check that out at your earliest convenience.</p>

<h2><em>Fractured Blooms&nbsp;</em>is a cozy game with a dark twist</h2>




<p>As someone who's pretty burnt out on cozy games, this one intrigued me.&nbsp;<em>Fractured Blooms&nbsp;</em>is a "time loop life sim" in which you must tend your garden while "something" blooms. It looks creepy as all get-out.</p>

<h2><em>Jurassic World Evolution 3&nbsp;</em>has an October release date</h2>

<p>Just like&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders</em>, the latest game in the&nbsp;<em>Jurassic World Evolution&nbsp;</em>series of management games now has a release date, and it's October 21st. Some art in the game uses generative AI, though. Boo.</p>

<h2>Yacht Club's Game Boy homage&nbsp;<em>Mina the Hollower&nbsp;</em>launches on Halloween</h2>

<p>Next, it's time for a look at Yacht Club's newest game&nbsp;<em>Mina the Hollower</em>, which pays homage to Game Boy-style action games. It's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mina-the-hollower-release-date-yacht-club" rel="nofollow">coming on October 31st</a>, and you can check a demo out right now on Steam.</p>

<h2><em>Deadpool VR&nbsp;</em>sure is a thing, and it's Meta Quest 3 and 3S-exclusive</h2>

<p>I'm pretty sure nobody wanted a VR-exclusive&nbsp;<em>Deadpool&nbsp;</em>game, but I'm also pretty sure that list of people dwindles even further if it's a Meta Quest-exclusive&nbsp;<em>Deadpool&nbsp;</em>VR game. Ah, well. Late 2025 for this one.</p>

<h2><em>Dying Light: The Beast&nbsp;</em>launches in August</h2>

<p>First revealed back in 2024,&nbsp;<em>Dying Light: The Beast&nbsp;</em>got itself an August 22nd release date during this year's Summer Game Fest showcase, so if you're after more zombie-killing action, you know when you'll get it.</p>

<h2><em>Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree&nbsp;</em>sure has a real long name</h2>

<p>Next, it's Bandai Namco's&nbsp;<em>Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree</em>, an isometric roguelike coming to PC and current-gen consoles (and also the Switch) on September 19th. It looks fine, I guess.</p>

<h2><em>Acts of Blood&nbsp;</em>has very strong&nbsp;<em>Sifu&nbsp;</em>vibes</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/acts-of-blood-summer-game-fest-2025.jpg?itok=bVY6l1n2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/acts-of-blood-summer-game-fest-2025.jpg?itok=qQzWIkcE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Acts of Blood&nbsp;</em>bears more than a passing resemblance to&nbsp;<em>Sifu</em>.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Acts of Blood&nbsp;</em>is a beat-'em-up from a solo developer with extremely strong&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/sifu" rel="nofollow">Sifu</a>&nbsp;</em>vibes; in fact, I'm pretty sure the corridor shown in the trailer is making a cameo appearance from Sloclap's brawler. Summer 2026 for this one.</p>

<h2><em>Scott Pilgrim EX&nbsp;</em>is a "brand new brawling adventure" due next year</h2>

<p>Another game that's due next year is&nbsp;<em>Scott Pilgrim EX</em>, which appears to be a brand new game despite its rather "remaster"-implying title. You'll have to wait until 2026 to find out.</p>

<h2><em>The First Descendant: Breakthrough&nbsp;</em>is coming in August</h2>

<p>A major new update for&nbsp;<em>The First Descendant</em>,&nbsp;titled&nbsp;<em>Breakthrough</em>,&nbsp;is coming in August. It'll add hoverbikes, eight-player raids, and more to the looter-shooter, so if you're into this game, that's something to look forward to.</p>

<h2><em>SCUM&nbsp;</em>1.0 launches in just a few days</h2>

<p>Open-world survival-crafter&nbsp;<em>SCUM&nbsp;</em>finally has its 1.0 release date, and it's June 17th, so you won't have to wait too long to check out the full version of this one.</p>

<h2>IO Interactive has some stuff to reveal</h2>

<p>Next, we get a look at what IO Interactive is cooking up. There's a new trailer for&nbsp;<em>MindsEye</em>, a collaboration between&nbsp;<em>Hitman&nbsp;</em>and that game, and the appearance of Mads Mikkelsen's iconic 007 villain Le Chiffre in&nbsp;<em>Hitman&nbsp;</em>as well.</p>

<h2><em>Lego Party&nbsp;</em>looks like a pretty blatant&nbsp;<em>Mario Party&nbsp;</em>tribute</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lego-party-summer-game-fest-2025.jpg?itok=ccNYAeVq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lego-party-summer-game-fest-2025.jpg?itok=hyF0wFqU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hey, look! It's&nbsp;<em>Mar</em>-erm,&nbsp;<em>Lego Party</em>!</figcaption></figure><p>Have you ever wanted to play&nbsp;<em>Mario Party</em>, but with Lego characters? Well,&nbsp;<em>Lego Party&nbsp;</em>will let you do just that when it launches sometime later this year. It looks pretty fun.</p>

<h2><em>Wildgate&nbsp;</em>is a shooter promising "space shenanigans" in July</h2>

<p><em>Wildgate&nbsp;</em>is a colorful, fast-paced shooter blending "tactical ship-to-ship combat with fast-paced first-person action", and it's out on July 22nd, with an open beta available between June 9th and 16th.</p>

<h2><em>Blighted&nbsp;</em>is the next game from&nbsp;<em>Guacamelee!&nbsp;</em>studio Drinkbox</h2>

<p>Offering yet more&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hades" rel="nofollow"><em>Hades</em></a>-style isometric action is&nbsp;<em>Blighted</em>, the next game from<i>&nbsp;Guacamelee!&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<em>Nobody Saves the World&nbsp;</em>developer Drinkbox. Once again, this one is coming your way next year.</p>

<h2><em>Ill&nbsp;</em>wants to scratch your&nbsp;<em>Condemned&nbsp;</em>itch</h2>




<p>If you've been after more first-person survival horror a la&nbsp;<em>Condemned&nbsp;</em>or the last couple of&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>games,&nbsp;<em>Ill&nbsp;</em>looks like it'll scratch that itch. It doesn't have a release window yet, though, so you might have to wait a while.</p>

<h2><em>Mecha Break&nbsp;</em>launches on July 1st</h2>

<p>When its demo launched in February,&nbsp;<em>Mecha Break&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mecha-break-demo-player-count-300k" rel="nofollow">managed to hit a 300,000 player count</a> within its first day, so the full release on July 1st will almost certainly be even more spectacular.</p>

<h2><em>Infinitesimals&nbsp;</em>looks like&nbsp;<em>Grounded&nbsp;</em>meets&nbsp;<em>Pikmin</em></h2>

<p>From Cubit Studios comes&nbsp;<em>Infinitesimals</em>, a sci-fi adventure in which you play an alien who crashlands on a planet and must find their way back to safety. Yeah, it's&nbsp;<em>Pikmin&nbsp;</em>meets&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/grounded" rel="nofollow"><em>Grounded</em></a>, and it's coming next year.</p>

<h2>Capcom isn't ready to reveal&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 9&nbsp;</em>yet...</h2>

<p>Aww, it looks like Capcom just isn't ready to lift the lid on the much-mooted&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 9&nbsp;</em>yet, huh? Never mind. On with the show!</p>

<h2><em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>is getting more DLC fighters</h2>

<p>Surprise, surprise: more DLC fighters are heading to&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/street-fighter-6" rel="nofollow"><em>Street Fighter 6</em></a>, with fan favorites like Sagat due to come to the game over the next few months.</p>

<h2><em>Last Flag&nbsp;</em>has clearly taken a look at&nbsp;<em>Team Fortress 2</em>'s homework</h2>

<p>Next up, it's a capture-the-flag shooter by the name of&nbsp;<em>Last Flag</em>, and judging by its deliberately retro stylings and cartoony visuals, this one has been cozying up to Valve's&nbsp;<em>Team Fortress 2&nbsp;</em>of a cold evening. No release window for this yet.</p>

<h2><em>Wu-Tang: Rise of the Deceiver&nbsp;</em>is a weird-looking anime brawler</h2>

<p>Up next is&nbsp;<em>Wu-Tang: Rise of the Deceiver</em>, an anime brawler that has that distinct&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hi-fi-rush" rel="nofollow"><em>Hi-Fi Rush</em></a>-slash-<em>South of Midnight&nbsp;</em>low-frame look. I have to say, this one definitely wasn't on my bingo card.</p>

<h2><em>Stranger than Heaven&nbsp;</em>is the next game from Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio</h2>




<p>Remember&nbsp;<em>Project Century</em>, the next game from <i>Like a Dragon&nbsp;</i>developer Ryu Ga Gotoku? Well, it's now called&nbsp;<em>Stranger than Heaven</em>, and it looks stylish as heck. No release window though, sadly. Hopefully it'll be sooner rather than later.</p>

<h2>Psych!&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil Requiem&nbsp;</em>is coming in February next year</h2>




<p>Oh, Capcom, you rascals! It turns out&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil Requiem&nbsp;</em>was ready to reveal, although we don't really get to see much in the way of gameplay. This survival horror game takes you back to Raccoon City, and it's coming on February 27th next year.</p>

<hr><p>Well, that sure was a show! That's it from Geoff for now, and that's it from us as well. A few announcements piqued my interest here, and I hope they did for you as well!</p>
