            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-3-3m-33-days<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sandfall Interactive has announced that its turn-based RPG&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>has reached a fun sales milestone in a very appropriate number of days.</p>

<p>Speaking on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:kazma5qkd2r37qfwftqh3lct/post/3lq5u7no5522n" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>, Sandfall says that&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>has reached 3.3 million sales in 33 days. As the studio says, it "couldn't make that up"; Sandfall describes the milestone as "another entry on the long list of surreal moments that [fans'] support has made real".</p>

<p>The new sales milestone means that&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur&nbsp;</em>has picked up another 1.3 million sales for itself <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">in the last three weeks</a>, so while sales have perhaps slowed down a tad since launch, the game is still performing admirably.</p>

<p>These sales milestones are particularly impressive considering that Sandfall's game is available via Game Pass, which means that 3.3 million players have picked the game up outside of Microsoft's subscription service.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, it's a turn-based RPG in which you play as the titular Expedition 33, a group who must set out from the Paris-inspired city of Lumiere to seek out and defeat a figure known as the Paintress.</p>

<p>In the world of the game, the Paintress paints a number each year, and everyone of that age dies. The number decreases by one each year, and so it's up to Expedition 33 to figure out what's going on and put a stop to it if possible.</p>




<p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>mixes traditional JRPG-style overworld and dungeon exploration with a turn-based combat system that also includes a real-time parry mechanic, so if you like your turn-based battling with a bit more spice, this one's for you.</p>
