            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ultrakill-ultra-revamp-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Arsi Patala and publisher New Blood have released the&nbsp;<em>Ultrakill&nbsp;</em>Ultra Revamp update, and its impressive visual and performance improvements appear to have resulted in a player count surge for the ultraviolent shooter.</p>

<p>Released yesterday, the update is described by its developer as "a complete visual and technical overhaul of&nbsp;<em>Ultrakill</em>". The game's eighth layer is still in development, but Patala and artist Victoria Holland decided to use that time to bring previous layers' visuals up to par with the latest as well.</p>

<p>Patala acknowledges that "you won't notice a lot of the technical work that's been done under the hood", but he does say that the game's performance has been vastly improved, bragging that he and Holland have "improved the visuals of the entire game while also improving performance in each and every level". Fair play.</p>

<p>While they were previously "mere replayable levels with radiant enemies", they're now essentially new stages that don't look or play "anything like the levels they're based on", as well as being "about 10x harder" than those levels.</p>

<p>Not only that, but if you're a fan of Australian psych-prog band King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard (and you should be, because they're great), you'll now find three of the band's songs in the game, including certified banger "Robot Stop" from the excellent 2016 album&nbsp;<em>Nonagon Infinity</em>.</p>

<p>If you want to see how the visuals for&nbsp;<em>Ultrakill&nbsp;</em>have changed in the Ultra Revamp update, you can check out a before-and-after comparison video right here. It's the only way to do the update justice.</p>




<p>The update has resulted in a huge player upsurge for&nbsp;<em>Ultrakill</em>, too. According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1229490/charts/#1y" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, while the game has been averaging around 3-4,000 players per day for the last year or so, its 24-hour peak shot up to 23,011 at the time of the update's release, and at time of writing, 12,055 players are enjoying&nbsp;<em>Ultrakill</em>.</p>

<p>It's been a busy old time for&nbsp;<em>Ultrakill&nbsp;</em>recently. Back in December, the game got itself a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/free-mullet-madjack-update-features-ultrakill" rel="nofollow">crossover with fellow ultraviolent shooter&nbsp;<em>Mullet MadJack</em></a>, bringing a brand new&nbsp;<em>Ultrakill</em>-themed boss fight to developer Hammer95's game.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Ultrakill&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1229490/ULTRAKILL/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/striking-distance-layoffs-callisto-protocol<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>The Callisto Protocol&nbsp;</em>developer Striking Distance Studios has apparently laid off the majority of its staff, at least according to two employees who were let go from the company.</p>

<p>As spotted by ResetEra user <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-callisto-protocol-dev-striking-distance-studios-has-made-another-round-of-layoffs.1117866/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Cyberia</a> (who also spotted posts confirming Wizards of the Coast subsidiary Skeleton Key's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wizards-of-the-coast-skeleton-key-project-canceled" rel="nofollow">project cancellation</a>), Striking Distance staff members <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jesseleeconceptart_opentowork-activity-7298625255500091392-t4QX" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Jesse Lee</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/zach-volker_it-was-a-tough-morning-at-striking-distance-activity-7298480796674183168-Ft3a" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Zach Volker</a> posted on LinkedIn earlier this week confirming that they were laid off.</p>

<p>Lee, who served as concept art director for Striking Distance for four years, says in his post that "most of the devs" at the studio "were laid off", while Volker says there were "lots of layoffs, including [himself]".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/striking-distance-layoffs-callisto-protocol.jpg?itok=eS6XZYbJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/striking-distance-layoffs-callisto-protocol.jpg?itok=PqLNC9S5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Striking Distance is best known for its work on&nbsp;<em>The Callisto Protocol</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Striking Distance itself has yet to comment on these layoffs, but we've reached out to the studio and will update this story if we hear from them.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with Striking Distance, it's a studio founded by&nbsp;<em>Dead Space&nbsp;</em>creator Glen Schofield back in 2019. The studio's first project was survival horror title&nbsp;<em>The Callisto Protocol</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/callisto-protocol-is-set-in-pubg-universe-apparently" rel="nofollow">originally to be set in the&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>universe</a>, although this aspect of the game was subsequently downplayed.</p>

<p>The game's production was reportedly troubled, with staff <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/callisto-protocol-crunch-is-problem-with-100-hour-work-weeks" rel="nofollow">being asked to work 100-hour weeks</a> in order to finish the project on time.</p>

<p>Eventually,&nbsp;<em>The Callisto Protocol&nbsp;</em>was released in 2022, attracting a range of opinions. Our own Sam <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/callisto-protocol-review" rel="nofollow">"awarded" the game a 4.5 out of 10</a>, praising its "beautiful" visuals but criticizing its story, chaotic combat, and "terrible" boss encounters.</p>




<p>Following&nbsp;<em>The Callisto Protocol</em>'s release, Striking Distance founder Glen Schofield <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-space-co-creator-pursuing-new-opportunities-less-than-year-after-callisto" rel="nofollow">departed the studio</a>, with parent company Krafton confirming his departure was in order to "pursue new opportunities".</p>

<p>A spinoff game,&nbsp;<em>[Redacted]</em>, was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/redacted-callisto-protocol-spinoff-release-date" rel="nofollow">released back in October</a>. Set in the same universe as&nbsp;<em>The Callisto Protocol</em>, the game eschews the&nbsp;<em>Dead Space</em>-style survival horror trappings of its parent, opting instead for a top-down action roguelike approach.</p>

<p>Striking Distance is far from the only studio to lay off staff in recent months. Others include&nbsp;<em>Killer Instinct&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rumbleverse-and-killer-instct-studio-iron-galaxy-suffers-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Iron Galaxy</a>,&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioware-layoffs-veilguard-failure" rel="nofollow">BioWare</a>, and tech giant <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-layoffs-january-2025" rel="nofollow">Microsoft</a>, among many, many others.</p>
