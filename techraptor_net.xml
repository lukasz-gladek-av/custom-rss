            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A retail release of the Welcome to Night Vale RPG is on the way. After a successful <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/welcome-to-night-vale-rpg-comes-to-backerkit-this-october" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Backerkit campaign</a>, Night Vale Presents and Renegade Game Studios will be bringing a box set of their licensed TTRPG to hobby shops this September.</p>

<h2>The <em>Welcome to Night Vale RPG</em> Retail Release Date</h2>

<p>In an official newsletter, Renegade Game Studios has confirmed that the <em>Welcome to Night Vale RPG</em> boxed set will be coming to retail stores on September 9. This is roughly one month after the game's Backerkit supporters have received their copies of the game.</p>

The podcast began in 2012 and has since become a multimedia property with vinyl records and book spin-offs. Given that its Backerkit campaign raised over half a million dollars, it is a series with a large, passionate fanbase.</p>

<p>The game contains the show's unique blend of surreal, absurd, and dark atmosphere alongside an expansive cast of characters. It uses a simplified version of Renegade's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/essence20-field-guide-to-action-adventure-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Essence20</a>&nbsp;RPG system, which has been used in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/power-rangers-beneath-helmet-review-herolife-balance" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Power Rangers</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/transformers-enigma-of-combination-review-new-meaning-of-teamwork" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Transformers</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/my-little-pony-dark-skies-over-equestria-review-changeling-mischief" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>My Little Pony</em></a> RPGs.</p>

<p>The <em>Welcome to Night Vale RPG</em> boxed set will contain the following:</p>

<ul><li>Complete rules for playing the game</li>
	<li>A Citizen's Guide for character creation, a Host's Guide to help you share strange tales in Night Vale, and a Visitor's Guide that helps flesh out the desert town</li>
	<li>The <em>Skeleton Gorge Incident</em>, a five-part mystery adventure that leads characters through different Night Vale locations including the Numbers Station and the Library</li>
	<li>Eight dice and a Welcome to Night Vale-themed Game Master Screen</li>
	<li>Eleven pregenerated character sheets to help bring new players to the game quickly</li>
	<li>Nine new Threats for the players to encounter in the town of Night Vale&nbsp;</li>
</ul><p>The <em>Welcome to Night Vale RPG</em> box set will be sold at an MSRP of $65.</p>
