There's no mention of a Switch 2 port for the game, however.</p><p>Naturally, this means that Alkimia and THQ didn't quite meet the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gothic-1-remake-2025-release-window" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="72174643-d030-49a5-b4e6-42d44e594b13" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">2025 release window promised by the developer</a> last year, but it's nice to finally put a date to something that's been in the works for quite some time.</p><figure role="group">

<p>The <em>Gothic </em>remake was originally announced back in 2019 alongside a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/surprise-thq-nordic-releases-gothic-remake-prototype" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f554aef5-6d1b-4d62-a48a-cb5b3f360c30" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">surprise release for a teaser version</a> of said remake, which publisher THQ Nordic released in order to gauge interest for a full-length version of the project.</p><p>Suffice it to say that interest was piqued, and development began in earnest <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-thq-nordic-studio-alkimia-interactive-to-develop-gothic-remake" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4a13632a-3f54-4724-af3d-e1887eb5c6c5" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">under developer Alkimia Interactive</a>, which is itself a subsidiary of THQ Nordic.</p><p>Piranha Bytes, the developer of the original <em>Gothic</em>, isn't involved in this project; indeed, the studio isn't involved in any projects at all, since it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/piranha-bytes-shut-down-report" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2b3d24ae-f166-4005-a78e-9753966f948f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">shut down in mid-2024</a> following the release of its final RPG, <em>Elex 2</em>, in 2022.</p><p>Piranha Bytes' work on the franchise hasn't gone away, though; the original <em>Gothic </em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gothic-switch-port" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9e473693-38ae-482f-bb24-c789f308d39f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">released for the Switch in 2023</a>, with the appropriately-named followup <em>Gothic 2 </em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gothic-ii-switch-port" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2beaa571-4297-4f94-81f4-79703ef18e30" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">getting a port for itself later that year</a>.</p>
<p>As for <em>Gothic 1 Remake </em>itself, it's more of a reimagined version of the original game than a straight one-to-one remake; this is more of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/final-fantasy-vii-remake" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a4e42e5a-dfe6-4ff1-8f4c-038c992edcea" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em></a><em> </em>situation than a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/super-mario-rpg-review-slightly-unbalanced-but-fun-romp" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="dbab7858-34dc-4ed1-a3cf-da929c9ba3b0" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Super Mario RPG </em>setup</a>.</p><p>You'll be able to see for yourself what THQ and Alkimia have done with the original when <em>Gothic 1 Remake </em>arrives on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1297900/Gothic_1_Remake/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/gothic-1-remake/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/gothic-1-remake/9nbrlcpw4zgv" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a> on June 5th.
