            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>2017's indie 3D platformer&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/yooka-laylee-review-flying-lizard-monster" rel="nofollow">Yooka-Laylee</a>&nbsp;</em>from Playtonic Games, a studio founded by former Rare staffers, was aiming to catch "lightning in a bottle" with the release, which was positioned to be <em>Banjo-Kazooie's</em> spiritual successor. While the game received mixed responses following its release and a spin-off game, <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/yooka-laylee-and-impossible-lair-out-this-october" rel="nofollow">Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair</a>,</em> launched some time later, there were calls for another adventure with Yooka and Laylee, and after eight years, Playtonic returns with <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/yooka-replaylee-release-date" rel="nofollow">Yooka-Replaylee</a>.</em></p>

<p>Quite simply, it's "better late than never," as nearly a decade later, with <em>Yooka-Laylee</em> becoming a cult favorite among platformer enthusiasts and eventually the broad gaming community, the time felt perfect for these tandem adventurers to reemerge once again.</p>

<p>This time around, Playtonic paid attention to the players and the community with a thoughtful remaster of the 2017 release to include new content and optimizations for modern consoles, resulting in the epic grand return of Yooka and Laylee.</p>

<p>Much like the original 2017 indie platformer release,&nbsp;<em>Yooka-Laylee</em>, the game's remaster sees our heroes briefly recounting their past adventures aboard "The Batship Crazy" in epic fairytale style&nbsp;before their fleet got beached due to an incoming storm. Nevertheless, this mishap didn't deter the duo, as after landing safely and repairing their ship, they traversed their new location and encountered a caged magical book, the One Book.</p>

<p>While their deeds were truly appreciated, this event annoyed&nbsp;the nefarious&nbsp;CEO Capital B (who looks like Gru from&nbsp;<em>Despicable Me</em>) and his underappreciated yet equally villainous cohort, Dr. Quack, back at the Hivory Towers. Distraught at the disappearance of the One Book, Dr. Quack switched to Plan B to recapture the book; however, while vacuuming all the books, several pages or Pagies of the One Book gets ripped from its spine, thus getting scattered across the world levels. It's up to Yooka and Laylee to collect the Pagies to reassemble the One Book before Capital B and Dr. Quack.</p>

<p>And this is where the journey for the adventurous duo begins, as they must collect the Pagies across world levels or Grand Tomes while acquiring their first in-game currency of gold coins called Q.U.I.D.S,&nbsp;Quills, and puzzle pieces along their journey. But they won't be alone, as a few familiar faces will aid them with unique upgrades called Tonics, some snazzy customization pieces, clues, and a spade-donning knight who seemingly found themselves lost but comes to Yooka and Laylee to call for help in taking down&nbsp;Capital B and&nbsp;Dr. Quack for good this time around.</p>

<h2>Yooka-Replaylee Review:&nbsp;An Absolute Page Turner</h2>

<p>Playtonic Games has listened to player feedback and delivered what could possibly be the best <em>Yooka-Laylee</em> game we needed by overhauling everything that first appeared in the original release, including the world design, gameplay mechanics, puzzles, challenges, audio, and visuals.</p>

<p>While these mass changes from top to bottom make <em>Yooka-Replaylee</em> vastly different from the&nbsp;2017 release, much of the story, hilarious jokes, and puns are still the same, retaining that nostalgic feeling we first experienced in <em>Yooka-Laylee</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/yooka-replaylee-screenshot-642.jpg?itok=AmOtCOf7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/yooka-replaylee-screenshot-642.jpg?itok=0dDjjcc_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Players get to revist key Grand Tome locations, including Moodymaze Marsh, all revamped and reimagined for Yooka-Replaylee. (Picture: Playtonic Games / Ashleigh Klein)</figcaption></figure><p>Speaking of the game's story, after Yooka and Laylee free the One Book before the book got vacuumed, Yooka and Laylee must explore several Grand Tomes by jumping into large storybooks and exploring these areas to find Pagies, Quills, puzzle pieces, and&nbsp;Q.U.I.D.S before moving to the next world level. As previously mentioned, the story and narrative beats are still the heartbeat of <em>Yooka-Replaylee</em>, by introducing slight changes to the story's presentation and pacing, leaving room for the developers to showcase their comedic writing.</p>

<p>In the words of the salesman Trowsers, "thank goodnessss," because while the devs can truly let their writing take centerstage, the execution in how the narrative beats, jokes, and puns were delivered was outstanding, as one can feel the writing team has more confidence and pride in their work. This also gives Yooka and Laylee, as well as the supporting characters, so much more personality and wit, while much of the fluff and annoying dialogue has been scrubbed away, allowing one to truly appreciate the remaster's story and the cast of characters.</p>

<p>In terms of gameplay, <em>Yooka-Replaylee</em> is still very much a 3D platformer collect-a-thon game, which players will spend much of their time collecting Pagies to unlock doors within the Hivory Towers and locate other Grand Tomes. Quills and Q.U.I.D.S serve as the in-game currencies for Yooka and Laylee to spend on various items and upgrades. Players assume control of this tandem as they explore multiple world levels, utilizing various abilities already accessible at the start of the game, with tighter gameplay controls that make traversal and platforming smoother and more rewarding.</p>

<p>There were times when the controls failed us, mostly when platforming, but this was largely attributed to the camera angles guiding us off the platform or not being able to use specific abilities like the Sonar Shot and Sonar 'Splosion to hit invisible targets effectively. What was a blessing was the ability to use rolling to knock down enemies, move up slippery surfaces, destroy crates, or evade danger swiftly, which players can now roll infinitely and mind their business without consuming energy.</p>

<h2>Yooka-Replaylee Review:&nbsp;Sssay It Ain't Ssso</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/yooka-replaylee-screenshot-643.jpg?itok=SR_MkYk9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/yooka-replaylee-screenshot-643.jpg?itok=ywUD-nDd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Having a map really comes in handy as it helps players track all challenges, fast travel, and Pagie locations.&nbsp;(Picture: Playtonic Games / Ashleigh Klein)</figcaption></figure><p>As each world level has been massively revamped to accompany the overhaul of gameplay mechanics, the world levels are now significantly larger for players to explore, featuring overworlds, cavern systems, and underworld areas, as well as a World Map to refer to and check which areas haven't been explored or Pagies haven't been collected.</p>

<p>Traversal feels more fun and exciting with the fast-travel system, as players can locate and activate bookmarks called Mark to warp to specific areas to revisit challenges or farm more Q.U.I.D.S., so players' time isn't wasted by dashing from one corner of the map to the next.</p>

<p>Gameplay progression has also been reworked for <em>Yooka-Replaylee</em> as players are now geared to collecting a specific number of Pagies needed to unlock new areas within the Hivory Towers to access Grand Tomes. While the previous level progression system, which was controversial at the time, has been done away with in <em>Yooka-Replaylee</em>, the removal of this system does lead to unusual difficulty spikes in the remaster, which caught us off guard at times.</p>

<p>Given the brilliance with which Playtonic has remastered&nbsp;<em>Yooka-Laylee</em> for modern hardware, there are a few minor bugs that we're sure Yooka will gobble up in no time. Sure, some of the challenges in&nbsp;<em>Yooka-Replaylee</em>&nbsp;have upped the difficulty, which will require players to "lock in" (certainly one did even after multiple failed attempts), players may encounter a few visual and latency issues on PC for the time being, but it's not too bothersome.</p>

<h2>Yooka-Replaylee Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/yooka-replaylee-screenshot-641.jpg?itok=5mNU8PVi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/yooka-replaylee-screenshot-641.jpg?itok=WnydVLQ_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Yooka-Replaylee</em> does have its shortcomings; however, the new changes and improvements certainly makes it stand out from its original release. (Picture: Playtonic Games / Ashleigh Klein)</figcaption></figure><p>Overall, fans of this iconic duo will certainly not be disappointed with this outstanding and "definitive remastered and enhanced version" of <em>Yooka-Laylee</em>. Boasting a revamp of the classic 3D platformer, which sees multiple Grand Tomes and their worlds reimagined with new challenges, more Pagies to collect, familiar faces to aid Yooka and Laylee and assist in navigating the terrains, and so much additional content to keep players coming back to test their platforming skills.</p>

<p>Likewise, some of Yooka and Laylee's moveset and team combos have been reworked and are much easier to acquire by visiting the various vendors found within these worlds, and they can bag themselves some new threads to don and show off their fashionista sides. And let's not forget that the devs retained the game's sense of humor, as the jokes and puns have been one-upped, which had left one giggling long after they were mentioned.</p>

<p>Mind you, the game does have a few optimization errors, such as cutscenes and entering new Grand Tomes having slight latency bugs momentarily, but they didn't affect the overall gameplay experience. Additionally, the issues with the level progression system have left the game riddled with random difficulty spikes that will cause some frustration when exploring each world level, while leaving these levels with no structured design, but it didn't deter us from having an incredible, nostalgic trip down memory lane.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Netflix has just greenlit an official <em>Clue</em> TV show. The major streaming platform's latest show will be an unscripted competitive experience where players will need to solve a murder mystery straight from the iconic social deduction board game.</p>

<h2>The Clue TV Show Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official report <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/10/clue-competition-series-netflix-1236571635/" rel="nofollow">by Deadline</a>, the <em>Clue</em> TV show will feature a competitive game show experience. Contestants will face physical and mental challenges to collect clues. Those clues will aid them in a real-life game of social deduction. Contestants will need to outwit their opponents and identify who killed whom, where, and with what.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/clue-classic-game-board.jpg?itok=3eR3zsPv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/clue-classic-game-board.jpg?itok=EdouKvqz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>If the contestants guess correctly, money will be added a major prize pot. If they guess incorrectly, they are eliminated. The report does confirm that the usual suspects from the Clue board game, Colonel Mustard, Professor Plum, Mrs. White, and Miss Scarlett, will be present for these sections. The show will be produced by&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Like so many families and friends over the years, we’ve gathered around the table trying to figure out who did it—making Clue a source of nostalgia that everyone shares,” said Jeff Gaspin, VP of Unscripted Series, Netflix. “Thanks to the incredible vision of our partners at Hasbro Entertainment, IPC, and B17, we’re delivering a fresh, imaginative whodunit competition that will invite today’s audiences into that iconic world.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Netflix <em>Clue</em> TV show is a notable departure from the board game's roots. It was originally a broad tabletop experience imitating posh Agatha Christie murder mysteries.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/clue-movie-screenshot.jpg?itok=88EHWKUH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/clue-movie-screenshot.jpg?itok=fc2WQSMl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>But it is not the first time <em>Clue</em> has gotten the cinematic treatment. There was the 1985 feature film directed by Jonathan Lynn starring major stars like Tim Curry and Christopher Lloyd. The film was a dark murder mystery satire,, complete with outrageous murder methods, convoluted character motivations, and farcical slapstick. It even had three different endings, meant to invoke the replayability of the <em>Clue</em> board game.</p>

<p>The <em>Clue</em> TV show is in keeping with company Hasbro's recent stint of adapting their various properties to film and tv. Those projects include another game show based on Monopoly and a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-movie-screenwriters-have-been-summoned" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">feature film</a> based on the iconic card game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a>.</p>
