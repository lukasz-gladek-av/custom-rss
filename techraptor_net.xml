It's game time. We need to run through several training scenarios with you before you can take the field again after your injury. So grab your gear and head into the War Games Combat Arena for the first cycle of training, and get ready because you're training against other Spartans who are also eager to prove themselves.</p>

<p><em>Halo Flashpoint</em> is a brand new miniatures game from Mantic Games, of which we've covered several of their products over the years, from the sci-fi skirmish game <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/deadzone-3e-two-player-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow">Deadzone</a>, the sports battler <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/overdrive-review" rel="nofollow">OverDrive</a>, and their awesome fantasy mass battle game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/kings-of-war-guide" rel="nofollow">Kings of War</a>. In this article, we'll have a look at the <em>Halo Flashpoint</em> Recon Edition set, talk about what it contains and how it plays.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/halo-flashpoint-recon-edition-3.jpg?itok=f4pGHW9A 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/halo-flashpoint-recon-edition-3.jpg?itok=HlU0b-hu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The <em>Halo Flashpoint</em> Recon Edition box is a great place for anyone to start their <em>Halo Flashpoint</em> journey (Photo: Mantic Games).</figcaption></figure>

<p>For those who don't know <em>Halo</em> was a popular first-person shooter series of games that started in 2001, with its latest release, <em>Halo Infinite</em> in 2021. <em>Halo Flashpoint</em> is a licensed release between 343 Industries and Mantic Games, and brings the first-person deathmatch game to the tabletop, using Mantic's <em>Deadzone</em> rules system, with some tweaks to add <em>Halo</em> theme to it.</p>

<p>The Halo Flashpoint Recon Edition contains:</p>

<ul><li>8x Spartan models</li>
	<li>Rulebook</li>
	<li>Playmat</li>
	<li>Pre-coloured card terrain and tokens</li>
	<li>10x Weapon cards</li>
	<li>8x Player/model cards</li>
	<li>2x Reference cards</li>
	<li>12x D8 dice</li>
	<li>6x Command dice</li>
</ul><p>The miniatures are single piece and ready to play (also colored Red and Blue, which is a nod to the Red vs Blue <em>Halo </em>TV show). This, combined with the beginner's mission on one side of the game mat, which features a smaller map and the rules printed around the edge, makes getting <em>Halo Flashpoint</em> from opening to play extremely fast and beginner-friendly. The scenery is also printed card, that slots together easily and quickly, so you can get the whole Recon box set up extremely fast.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/halo-flashpoint-recon-edition-1.jpg?itok=WDnYXdjc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/halo-flashpoint-recon-edition-1.jpg?itok=_F2dbpjM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The upcoming&nbsp;<em>Halo Flashpoint</em>&nbsp;War Games expansion will make all your <em>Halo</em> Wargames dreams come true (Photo: Mantic Games).</figcaption></figure><h2>Is Halo Flashpoint A Full Wargame?</h2>

<p>The Recon Edition of the game is just the start of Mantic's <em>Halo</em> plans and works as a starter set for the system, and also as a standalone product. There is a larger version of the game available, the Spartan Edition, which includes more miniatures and scenery, and early next year, Mantic will release the War Games Expansion, which will turn <em>Halo Flashpoint</em> into a full tabletop wargame, with points values and list building, taking it away from the limited draft you have out of the Recon Edition.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/halo-flashpoint-recon-edition-5.jpg?itok=1xTOPiIn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/halo-flashpoint-recon-edition-5.jpg?itok=wSfLAxXw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The <em>Halo Flashpoint</em>&nbsp;Spartan miniatures come pre-colored red and blue, but look even better painted&nbsp;(Photo: Mantic Games).</figcaption></figure><h2>How Do You Play Halo Flashpoint?</h2>

<p>For those coming from Mantic's <em>Deadzone</em> rules, much will be familiar here, with a few tweaks for the full <em>Halo</em> thematic experience. For those unfamiliar, games of <em>Halo Flashpoint</em> are played on gridded maps with scenery known as cubes. Models use their movement value to move between cubes, freely placing them within the cube itself. This also covers movement up and down over the scenery. This system keeps everything straightforward for movement, as well as measuring range and working out line of sight for units. This system, like the Deadzone rules they come from, makes this extremely beginner-friendly, but also offers veteran wargames a simple system, so they can focus on the other areas of tactical combat.</p>

<p>To shoot and attack, players roll 3 eight-sided dice (D8) and compare the roll to the Ranged or Fight characteristics on the Spartan's profile card, which details what they need to roll to succeed. Modifiers to the roll add or subtract dice, depending on if the target is in cover, or you are on higher ground, or for melee combat, if there are additional units in the same cube. The target of the attack also rolls 3 dice and compares it to their Survive characteristic, each success cancels out an attack dice. If attack dice remain, damage is dealt.</p>

<p>The <em>Halo</em> experience comes into <em>Halo Flashpoint </em>not only through the miniatures, artwork, and attention to detail that the designers have put into the arms and equipment from the <em>Halo</em> universe, but the way it's designed actually feels like a Team Deathmatch. One of the key mechanics to this is the respawn, which allows removed models to return to the field the next time they would activate, losing their first activation to move back onto the field and then continue with their actions as normal. This removal and slight delay, while simple mechanics-wise, really captures the feel of the game, and with scenarios like Capture the Flag and Stronghold, makes it a perfect example of getting the video game theme onto the tabletop.</p>

<p>You can absolutely play Master Chief in <em>Halo Flashpoint</em>, unfortunately just not out of the Recon Edition box. Master Chief is available in the <em>Halo Flashpoint</em> Paint Set, which includes 8 Army Painter paints, a brush, the Master Chief miniature, and a profile card to use him in game.</p>

<p>The Recon Editon includes 2 identical teams of 4 Spartans. Each team contains:</p>

<ul><li>Spartan MK VII - The MK VII comes armed with an MA40 Assault Rifle, they can pin targets down or take them out with the accuracy that comes from a high rate of fire. They also have the Tactician ability,&nbsp;which means you roll&nbsp;more command dice to access extra abilities for the fire team.</li>
	<li>Spartan Brawler - The Brawler has a better Fight stat than the others, but a lower Ranged stat, and they come armed with the close-range but lethal CQS48 Bulldog.</li>
	<li>Spartan Zvezda - The Zvezda has the scout ability, which lets them advance one cube after set up, letting them close on objectives. They have an average shoot and a poor fight stat, but the VK78 Commando they come armed with has Optics, which improves their shooting ability.</li>
	<li>Spartan Deadeye - The Deadeye has the best range&nbsp;stat of the 4 Recon Edition Spartans, and the M392 DMR rifle they come armed with has optics for even better accuracy, and lethal for extra damage on each hit.</li>
</ul><figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/halo-flashpoint-recon-edition-4.jpg?itok=IyPxevNb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/halo-flashpoint-recon-edition-4.jpg?itok=KFwi4f5f 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The 4 different&nbsp;<em>Halo Flashpoint</em>&nbsp;Spartan miniatures from the Recon Edition box&nbsp;(Photo: Mantic Games).</figcaption></figure><h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On Halo Flashpoint Recon Editon?</h2>

<p><i>Halo Flashpoint </i>is one of the best playable out-of-the-box wargames I've seen, with an incredible open-to-table time. While the box itself is fairly limited in play for veteran wargamers with 2 teams of equal Spartan types, it gives a solid starting point for anyone looking to get into the game, and it's perfect for beginners. If you're looking for more variety before the expansion that opens up the game is released, then consider the Spartan Edition that we hope to review soon on the site. The <em>Deadzone</em> rules still hold up, and play perfectly into not only the <em>Halo</em> theme but also captures the overall Team Deathmatch style of the game. Now we wait for the solo Master Chief narrative campaign that Mantic is definitely going to release right?</p>

<h2>Should I Buy Halo Flashpoint Recon Edition?</h2>

<p>If you want an incredible beginner-friendly quick-to-table game, just in time for Christmas, then <em>Halo Flashpoint</em> is for you. If you're a <em>Halo</em> fan, <em>Halo Flashpoint</em> is definitely for you. If you want a great tabletop iteration of Team Deathmatch, <em>Halo Flashpoint</em> is for you. If you want a <em>Halo</em> wargame, <em>Halo Flashpoint</em> is for you, but not just yet, you'll have to wait for the War Games Expansion next year, but still pick <em>Halo Flashpoint</em> up, because you still get the full rules and some great miniatures to start playing with. If you want a huge amount of replayability and variety out of the box, then the Recon Edition might not be for you, but consider the Spartan Edition, which comes with more Spartans and some Elites and we'll comment on how much variety it has when we get hold of a copy.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/puella-magi-madoka-magica-magia-exedra-delayed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Upcoming anime RPG&nbsp;<em>Puella Magi Madoka Magica: Magia Exedra&nbsp;</em>has been delayed beyond 2024, and the reasons given by the devs are exactly what you'd expect from a delay.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://madoka-exedra.com/en/news/?id=66647" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a notice on the game's official website</a> (which is in both Japanese and English), Aniplex says that the game has been pushed back to spring 2025. It was originally intended for release sometime this year, but given that we're in mid-November and no release date was forthcoming, a delay probably isn't surprising.</p>

<p>According to Aniplex,&nbsp;<em>Magia Exedra&nbsp;</em>was delayed in order to "deliver the best possible gaming experience" and "ensure even higher quality in the final game", which is a pretty broad statement. This is where we wheel out that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/did-miyamoto-really-say-a-delayed-game-is-eventually-good-but-a-rushed-game-is-forever-bad" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">supposed Miyamoto quote</a> about delayed and rushed games, right?</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/puella-magi-madoka-magica-magia-exedra-delayed-combat.jpg?itok=sFYTJWlK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/puella-magi-madoka-magica-magia-exedra-delayed-combat.jpg?itok=aEJohUuR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Puella Magi Madoka Magica: Magia Exedra&nbsp;</em>has been delayed beyond 2024, unfortunately.</figcaption></figure><p>There's no hint of a new release date in the delay announcement post, either. The devs simply say they're "working diligently towards a release that will exceed player expectations", thanking fans for their patience. Looks like we'll have to wait a little while before we know when we can play this one.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Puella Magi Madoka Magica</em>, it's an anime series that serves as a sort of deconstruction of the classic anime "magical girl" trope; in fact, the Japanese title is&nbsp;<em>Mahō Shōjo Madoka Magika</em>, with&nbsp;<i lang="ja-Latn" xml:lang="ja-Latn">mahō shōjo&nbsp;</i>being the Japanese term for "magical girl".</p>

<p>The story revolves around a group of girls who sign contracts to become magical girls and battle witches, but the narrative and themes&nbsp;<em>Puella Magi Madoka Magica&nbsp;</em>goes for might surprise you if you're expecting a typical magical girl anime.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-plans-for-cyberpunk-2077-ps5-pro-patch<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>CD Projekt Red has confirmed that it currently doesn't have any plans to release a&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>PS5 Pro patch, so if you were hoping the game was about to get cyber-augmented for Sony's beefy new machine, you're out of luck, unfortunately.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1859151714747552122" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, CDPR crushes the dreams of anyone who was hoping for a PS5 Pro-enhanced version of&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>in just nine words (or ten if you consider "PS5" two words): "we currently have no plans for PS5 Pro patch".</p>

<p>Of course, CD Projekt Red is fully entitled to do whatever it likes with its games, but the lack of a PS5 Pro patch for&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>feels a touch disappointing given the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-2077-opencritic-page-will-warn-players-about-technical-issues" rel="nofollow">history of technical issues</a> (although those issues admittedly weren't anywhere near as bad in the PS5 version).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cyberpunk-2077-ps5-pro-patch-not-coming-combat.jpg?itok=nRZbaz4E 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cyberpunk-2077-ps5-pro-patch-not-coming-combat.jpg?itok=sME3GoAc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>isn't getting a PS5 Pro patch anytime soon, sadly.</figcaption></figure><p>CD Projekt Red also hasn't said anything about its seminal action-RPG&nbsp;<em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt&nbsp;</em>getting any kind of PS5 Pro patch, so whichever of the studio's two biggest RPGs you're into, you're out of luck if you're a PS5 Pro owner.</p>

<p>It's likely that production on the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-team-relocating-to-boston" rel="nofollow">sequel</a> is taking precedence over further major changes to the original game.

<p>Although&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>won't be enhanced for the PS5 Pro, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/full-ps5-pro-enhanced-list-launch" rel="nofollow">host of other games</a> do have enhancements for Sony's new console. Titles like&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls</em>,&nbsp;<em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</em>, and the recently-released&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>all have extra visual or performance features on Sony's new console.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shiren-wanderer-mystery-dungeon-of-serpentcoil-island-pc</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/shiren-the-wanderer-the-mystery-dungeon-of-serpentcoil-island-pc-release-confirmed.1040721/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shiren-wanderer-mystery-dungeon-of-serpentcoil-island-pc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Spike Chunsoft has announced that roguelike RPG&nbsp;<em>Shiren the Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island</em>, which proved pretty popular on Switch, is officially heading to PC via Steam.</p>

<p>In a press release, the company reveals that&nbsp;<em>The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island&nbsp;</em>is the fastest-selling game in the&nbsp;<em>Shiren the Wanderer&nbsp;</em>series, having surpassed 200,000 copies shipped in Japan "quickly" following its launch in January.</p>

<p>That sales performance is probably why Spike Chunsoft has decided to release this one on Steam as well, although we don't know when the game is arriving on the platform, unfortunately; the Steam page simply reads "coming soon" under the release date heading.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shiren-the-wanderer-the-mystery-dungeon-of-serpentcoil-island-steam-combat.jpg?itok=8g0-XUCD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shiren-the-wanderer-the-mystery-dungeon-of-serpentcoil-island-steam-combat.jpg?itok=FMrBh5EE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Shiren the Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island&nbsp;</em>is officially coming to Steam.</figcaption></figure><p>As the press release points out,&nbsp;<em>The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island&nbsp;</em>is the first&nbsp;<em>Shiren the Wanderer&nbsp;</em>game to make its way to the West since 2016's <i>The Tower of Fortune and the Dice of Fate</i>, which also came to Switch in 2020.</p>

<p>In fact, that game itself was originally released in 2010 for the DS before getting a PlayStation Vita port in 2015, which was subsequently released in the West the following year.</p>

<p>In the years between 2010 and this year, only one&nbsp;<em>Shiren the Wanderer&nbsp;</em>game was released: 2013's&nbsp;<em>Princess Suzune and the Tower of Slumber</em>, which was...a pachinko game. Hardly counts as a&nbsp;<em>Shiren the Wanderer&nbsp;</em>release, if you ask me.</p>

<p>That means that technically,&nbsp;<em>Shiren the Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island&nbsp;</em>is the first full game in the series for a staggering 14 years.</p>




<p><em>The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island&nbsp;</em>introduces some new elements to&nbsp;<em>Shiren the Wanderer</em>, including 3D visuals, creating "a fresh and exciting adventure", as Spike Chunsoft puts it.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with the basic structure of the game, it's a roguelike RPG in which you must explore a series of dungeons filled with monsters, traps, and items to collect. Dying during exploration will mean losing everything you've collected, so this is very much not one for the faint of heart.</p>

<p><em>Shiren the Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island&nbsp;</em>is available <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/shiren-the-wanderer-the-mystery-dungeon-of-serpentcoil-island-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right now on Switch</a> and is launching for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2178480/Shiren_the_Wanderer_The_Mystery_Dungeon_of_Serpentcoil_Island/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> sometime in the future. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-review-bomb<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024&nbsp;</em>is being hit with extremely negative reviews on Steam after seemingly launching with extensive server issues, with users pointing to server loops, excessive loading times, and login queues as major issues, as well as problems with the game's cloud asset infrastructure.</p>

<p>Just yesterday, Microsoft and developer Asobo Studio released the latest iteration of the&nbsp;<em>Microsoft Flight Simulator&nbsp;</em>franchise, but it's already run into major issues, accruing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2537590/Microsoft_Flight_Simulator_2024/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an Overwhelmingly Negative rating on Steam</a> across 2,955 reviews (at time of writing).</p>

<p>One of the biggest issues users seem to be pointing out has to do with how&nbsp;<em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024&nbsp;</em>loads its assets. Much of the game's asset loading, including for aircraft, liveries, and more, is tied to cloud streaming, and since servers are struggling, that seems to be leading to problems.</p>

<p>Another <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198192847703/recommended/2537590/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">points out some of the aforementioned issues</a>&nbsp;and says&nbsp;<em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024&nbsp;</em>"feels like an alpha build", concluding that it "looks pretty and has potential but needs a lot of work". That's particularly damning for a game with a hefty asking price of $69.99.</p>

<p>The game's developers have said they are aware of the issue, dedicating a developer livestream to the problem earlier today.&nbsp;<em>Microsoft Flight Simulator&nbsp;</em>head Jorg Neumann said the team had "completely underestimated how high" pre-release excitement had been for the game.</p>

<p>Asobo Studio CEO Sebastian Wloch offers a technical explanation for the issues; players are asking&nbsp;<em>Flight Simulator 2024</em>'s servers for data, which is then cached in a database, but said cache is "currently getting saturated".</p>




<p>Wloch says the team stress-tested&nbsp;<em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</em>'s servers during the game's tech alpha, with the team performing load tests "simulating 200,000 users", but he concedes that the game has been "completely overwhelmed".</p>

<p>Community manager Jayne, also known as Jummivana, pledges to keep players updated via social media, and Neumann concludes the stream by apologizing to affected players, acknowledging that many are "frustrated" with the game's issues.</p>

<p>He says that although he knows the development team "had some problems today", the devs are "on it" and attempting to fix&nbsp;<em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</em>'s issues. Unfortunately, though, for now, if you're stuck, it looks like there's no fix yet.</p>
