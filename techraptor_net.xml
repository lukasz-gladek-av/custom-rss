            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Conatus Creative has announced that its retro side-scrolling beat-'em-up <em>River City Ransom: Underground </em>is being delisted from Steam soon, so if you want it, grab it while you can.</p><p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/422810/view/524236943144258012" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">rather brief post</a> on Steam, the developer says that the delisting is happening "due to the expiration of a licensing agreement", and that the delisting process "is currently underway", which likely means you can expect the game to disappear from Steam in the next week or two.</p><p>If you already happen to own <em>River City Ransom: Underground</em>, then, as Conatus says, "nothing changes". You'll still be able to play the game, and it'll still appear as part of your Steam library. It's worth saying that the game is also currently on sale at an 85% discount, so now's the time to pick it up.</p><figure role="group">

<p>It's not clear whether this delisting also applies to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gog-acquired-original-co-founder" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ac0fe303-b1f6-4fb9-85b5-0996e982944e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">under-new-management GOG</a>, where <em>River City Ransom: Underground </em>is also currently available (although the Steam discount doesn't apply there, so you'll be paying full price for the game if you pick it up from GOG).</p><p>Conatus also hasn't been clear about exactly what the "licensing issue" in question is, but it's possible it relates to a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/river-city-ransom-underground-changing-soundtrack-alex-mauer-saga" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b63edfed-3fed-4ec0-8058-2670c03f1458" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">dispute with music creator Alex Mauer</a> back in 2017, which saw the creator issuing DMCA claims not only to Conatus, but also to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/updated-another-week-more-sets-of-dmcas-alex-mauer-saga" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e2e1c438-2fdb-407b-885c-ad191b1b159c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">other creators on YouTube</a>.</p><p>If you're not familiar with <em>River City Ransom: Underground</em>, it's a beat-'em-up in the <em>River City </em>series, which is known in Japan as <em>Kunio-kun</em>. Unlike 2023's <em>River City: Rival Showdown</em>, this one <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/river-city-ransom-remake" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e10f316f-6ac8-4a1e-b2d7-9d8209ad5f21" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">isn't a remake</a>; rather, it's a completely new title in the franchise.</p><p>Like its forebears and successors, <em>River City Ransom: Underground </em>is a story-driven side-scrolling fighter in which you'll control one of 10 playable heroes across a campaign that will let you explore 140 different levels and upgrade your characters across 22 shops.</p><figure role="group">
