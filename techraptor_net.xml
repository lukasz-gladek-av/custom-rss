At Summer Game Fest we got to sit down with <em>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault</em>, continuing the story of Will and adding a whole lot more challenge to his adventure.</p>

<p>My time with the game caught me up on Will's story, seeking to adventure and raise money in the small town of Rynoka, as well as set up where we meet the characters at the beginning of the adventure. After opening the 5th dungeon, learning they were connected to alternate dimensions, they were tricked by Morloch the Interdimensional Collector who kicked them out of Ryoka.</p>

<p>This demo was an efficient and effective tutorial. Within moments, you're thrown into combat, have to explore a wasteland, and return to sell your wares. After your first dive you're introduced to a mysterious sentient cube that introduces her/itself as the Endless Vault, from there you're challenged to recover goods enough to gather a large sum of gold.</p>

<p>Combat is a fast-paced hack-and-slash where you'll push to get deeper and deeper into each dungeon with every event. Along the way you'll encounter different 'arenas' where you'll take on enemies, claim a reward, and progress to the next room.</p>

<p>There was some very interesting modifications to each of the runs that I was able to try including causing hazardous effects to deal additional damage or effects, or that certain locations you could travel to as you dungeon crawled would be inhabited by more difficult enemies. The battles would be more difficult, but the reward even greater.</p>

<p>Exploring the town, there were a number of shopkeepers with interesting-looking signs that lent themselves to the idea that, as the story progresses,d there would be a lot to do in terms of upgrading your equipment, abilities, and capacity for items.</p>

<p>In every way this experience felt like <em>Moonlighter </em>but bigger and better. If you were a fan of the original game, or like the idea of a roguelite with a very robust gameplay loop then you should 100% try <em>Moonlighter 2 </em>and it's available demo.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/mouse-pi-for-hire-preview-spilling-buckets-of-ink<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've been following&nbsp;<em>Mouse: P.I. For Hire</em>&nbsp;for quite a while now, and it really is awesome to see a game grow into something truly special. The progress Fumi Games has made since first showing off&nbsp;<em>Mouse</em>&nbsp;is nothing short of incredible.</p>

<p>To that end, I was honored to get a hands-off look at&nbsp;<em>Mouse: P.I. For Hire</em>&nbsp;during Summer Game Fest 2025. We followed the protagonist, Jack Pepper, as he shoots his way through an Opera House in order to prevent an assassination.</p>



<h2>Taking on Big Mouse</h2>

<p>Before my presentation, I was under the impression&nbsp;<em>Mouse: P.I. For Hire</em>&nbsp;was a boomer shooter. The type of FPS that's mostly pure run-and-gun, non-stop shooting. That perception is wrong, and I'm actually glad to see it's something much more.</p>

<p>Boomer shooters are great and all, but it's quite a saturated field at this point. <i>Mouse: P.I. For Hire</i>&nbsp;may or may not have started development as a simple shooter, but it's definitely grown into its own thing.</p>

<p>It's more narrative-laden and exploration of levels also seems to be emphasized in the demo. Jack Pepper talks with several different NPCs throughout the demo, and each character has its own voice actor, too.</p>



<p>Jack Pepper is voiced by Troy Baker, so you know that his performance is going to knock it out of the park. Other characters have a squeaky, gangster-like accent which is what I'd expect from the noir vibes&nbsp;<em>Mouse: P.I. For Hire&nbsp;</em>is going for.</p>

<p>So, our player explores ways to enter the Opera House to prevent an assassination of a mouse named Stilton. It's a bit difficult to understand the context of the story at this point, but the main thing I want to focus on is that there is definitely a goal in the story Jack is working towards.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He combs his way through this Opera House, first incognito through the kitchen (staffed by cartoonish mice, of course) then through an air duct. Either way, his plans on going in quiet go awry, and it's time to take out the big guns.</p>





<p>Gunplay in&nbsp;<em>Mouse: P.I. For Hire&nbsp;</em>looks nothing short of excellent. Every 2D element in the game is hand-drawn the old-school way, so that means guns are expertly animated, as are various NPCs, since they're all 2D too.</p>

<p>Guns have this wiggly look to them that oozes with old fashioned charm. Everything about the firing animations are exaggerated. Enemies die in the goofiest ways. Words really can't do it justice.</p>

<p>One gun, in particular, left me laughing. The Turpentine Gun melts enemies, literally. Since&nbsp;<em>Mouse: P.I. For Hire</em>&nbsp;enemies are hand-drawn, turpentine, a paint, strips their skin down to the bone. Regular guns make enemies bleed ink, which is just as ridiculous and silly.</p>



<p>After fighting through various rooms across this surprisingly large opera house, we reach the backstage and foil the assassination plot. Prima Donna, a portly mouse, drops from the ceiling and attacks Jack.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A short mini-boss battle ensues. Prima Donna seems tough, but it's nothing you can't handle. Her gimmick is charging after you, so dodging and weaving is the key here. She takes more bullets than your normal enemy,&nbsp; but the turpentine gun makes short work of her.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Mouse: P.I. For Hire&nbsp;</em>Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>The remainder of the demonstration involves a chaotic, mad dash to the exit of the building. The building is now burning down, and various enemies are charging after you while parts of the environment crumble away, trying to bar your path.</p>

<p>I really can't praise&nbsp;<em>Mouse: P.I. For Hire&nbsp;</em>enough. It's a game that oozes with creativity in a genre that's already highly competitive. I would still love to get my hands on it and play it for myself, but for now, just watching it is more than enough to know I'm sold.&nbsp;</p>
