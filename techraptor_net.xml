            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For decades, <em>Halo </em>was Xbox's crown jewel. The two were intertwined to the point that you couldn't mention Xbox without also mentioning <em>Halo</em>&nbsp;and vice versa.&nbsp;<em>Halo </em>effectively gave Xbox a fighting chance in the console market after all. By the time&nbsp;<em>Halo 3&nbsp;</em>came out, it was almost impossible to imagine that Xbox would ever part with the game franchise that defined the console multiplayer FPS experience.</p>

<p>Alas, all things must change. With the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/halo-campaign-evolved-announced-for-2026-coming-to-xbox-series-pc-and-playsation-5" rel="nofollow">upcoming release of <em>Halo: Campaign Evolved</em>&nbsp;on the PlayStation 5 in 2026</a>, Xbox will have officially ceded the exclusivity status of the&nbsp;<em>Halo </em>franchise. Although technically speaking&nbsp;<em>Halo </em>has been on PC for quite a while by now, not to mention a couple of mobile game forays.</p>

<p>In any case, this unprecedented change of events didn't come out of nowhere. Recent happenings at Microsoft, notably the firing of thousands of workers and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-price-increase" rel="nofollow">recent Xbox Game Pass Ultimate price hike</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-xbox-profit-margins-30-percent-report" rel="nofollow">suggest that Xbox is simply not making enough money</a>&nbsp;for the bigwigs. Since Xbox can't magically make bestselling games appear overnight, the only remaining move left would be to publish games on every available platform.</p>

<h2><em>Halo: Campaign Evolved |&nbsp;</em>Master Chief, Do You Mind Telling Me What You're Doing On That Console?</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/halo-ce-warthog.jpg?itok=7dUh9pCa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/halo-ce-warthog.jpg?itok=a1obI2o5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Warthog looks great and all, but what's going on with those clouds?</figcaption></figure><p>From the outside looking in, this almost feels like an act of desperation. If Xbox leadership felt confident about the direction of the brand, there would be no reason to ever bring&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>to PlayStation. Xbox could port over every single other exclusive to PlayStation under the guise of being player friendly, but the Master Chief is to Xbox as Mario is to Nintendo.</p>

<p>Make no mistake, this is no eulogy for the practice of console exclusivity. At the same time, most people would've probably envisioned the end of console exclusives to be a gradual process where PlayStation and Xbox exchange games on a mutually beneficial basis. Most people would've probably never expected that Xbox would give up all of its exclusives over the span of a single console generation.</p>

<p>While it's too early to say that&nbsp;<em>Halo's&nbsp;</em>appearance on PlayStation is a death knell for Xbox's hardware endeavors, it's also hard to view this as anything other than Xbox looking for a soft exit from the console market. You don't give up your literal console-defining franchise if you don't intend to wave the white flag after all.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even if everything was going according to plan at Xbox, the main question that every&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>fan should have when it comes to&nbsp;<em>Halo: Campaign Evolved&nbsp;</em>is "Why does this exist?"&nbsp;<em>Halo: Combat Evolved&nbsp;</em>was already remastered in 2011 and subsequently packaged into the <em>Master Chief Collection</em> in 2014.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If the idea was to release&nbsp;<em>Halo: Campaign Evolved&nbsp;</em>onto PlayStation to establish an initial fanbase in preparation for a future major&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>title, surely there are other ways to approach this. If you were on PlayStation and diving into&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>with no context on why it was so popular, you end up with a third of the original trilogy's story and none of the franchise's signature multiplayer. Would that be enough to create loyal fans of a franchise that would've otherwise had literal decades of media to build upon? Xbox seems to think so.</p>

<h2><em>Halo: Campaign Evolved |&nbsp;</em>In Truth, This is a Time to Rejoice</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/halo-ce-grunt.jpg?itok=baLWEFfK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/halo-ce-grunt.jpg?itok=I7ew7tvj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The fiercest enemies in all of&nbsp;<em>Halo</em>, ready&nbsp;to brutalize a new generation of players</figcaption></figure><p>Frankly, this brings up the question of why <em>Halo 3 </em>wasn't&nbsp;remade instead. A hypothetical&nbsp;<em>Halo 3&nbsp;</em>remake can be sold as a standalone product, possibly even bundled with an updated&nbsp;<em>Master Chief Collection</em>. That way new players on PlayStation will have a better idea of what's going on in the story and existing fans will have an excuse to relive the original trilogy.</p>

<p>If presented alongside<em> Halo 3's </em>story<em>,&nbsp;Halo: Campaign Evolved's&nbsp;</em>new prequel missions featuring Sgt. Johnson&nbsp;would arguably have a greater emotional impact as well.&nbsp;The missions would admittedly have to be shoehorned into&nbsp;<em>Halo 3</em>, yet it would make sense given Sgt. Johnson's role in the game's<em>&nbsp;</em>narrative.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The elephant in the room is that the status of the next main&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>game is kind of up in the air. If a successor to&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/halo-infinite" rel="nofollow">Halo Infinite</a>&nbsp;</em>was in a presentable state, one would assume that it would've been announced by now.&nbsp;One could conceivably announce the <em>Halo: Campaign Evolved</em> remake, then follow it up with a short teaser of the next main&nbsp;<em>Halo</em> game to the mutual benefit of both games. Of course, if there's nothing to show then there's nothing to show.</p>

<p>Either way, the release of&nbsp;<em>Halo: Campaign Evolved&nbsp;</em>will mark the end of an era for Xbox, but at least it gives a wider audience the chance to experience one of the most influential FPSs in video game history. That alone should be cause for celebration for any&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>fan, and if <em>Halo: Campaign Evolved </em>can give the franchise a second wind, hen all the better.</p>
