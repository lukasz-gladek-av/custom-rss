            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/aloft-early-access-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Funcom and developer Astrolabe Interactive have announced the Early Access release date for co-op survival game&nbsp;<em>Aloft</em>, which takes place in a world in which you can transform floating islands into "your personal skyship".</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Aloft&nbsp;</em>launches into Early Access on January 15th, which is roughly two months off at time of writing. It's due to land on Steam, and there's no word about whether a console version is on the way anytime soon.</p>

<p>Unlike other Funcom survival games like&nbsp;<em>Conan: Exiles&nbsp;</em>or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-reveals-spectacular-gameplay-and-details" rel="nofollow">the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Aloft&nbsp;</em>takes place in a bright, cartoony world in which you can freely soar through the skies, searching for resources and looking for an island to call your own.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aloft-early-access-release-date-archery.jpg?itok=-CEo7HWX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aloft-early-access-release-date-archery.jpg?itok=_iyOw2sq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Aloft&nbsp;</em>takes place in a whimsical world overtaken by fungal corruption.</figcaption></figure><p>Although&nbsp;<em>Aloft</em>'s world is more breezy (no pun intended) than other survival games offer, that doesn't mean there's no darkness lurking beneath the surface. A fungus-based corruption is taking hold of the islands, and it's up to you to put a stop to it.</p>

<p>With that said, though,&nbsp;<em>Aloft</em>'s Steam page says the game is "more about rewarding positive action than punishing mistakes", so if you've been looking for a survival game that doesn't break you in half when you mess up, this seems like it'll be up your street.</p>

<p>Once you discover the island you want to call your own, you'll be able to build it into a skyship and use it to traverse&nbsp;<em>Aloft</em>'s world of floating archipelagos in a manner not dissimilar to Bossa Studios' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bossa-studios-worlds-adrift-is-shutting-down-this-summer" rel="nofollow">ill-fated&nbsp;<em>Worlds Adrift</em></a>. Let's hope this one fares a bit better!</p>




<p>Over the course of its Early Access run, which the developers estimate will last "at least a year",&nbsp;<em>Aloft&nbsp;</em>will be regularly updated with new mechanics, biomes, and challenges, plus lots more.</p>

<p>You can wishlist&nbsp;<em>Aloft&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1660080/Aloft/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> ahead of its Early Access release on January 15th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenimax-qa-union-strike<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>ZeniMax Workers United, a gaming union consisting of quality assurance workers from across the studios of Bethesda's parent company, is going on strike today over what it alleges to be excessive outsourcing of QA on parent company Microsoft's part.</p>

<p>As revealed in <a href="https://x.com/ZeniMaxWorkers/status/1856714377992278336" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, the union wants Microsoft to "meet [it] at the bargaining table over key issues like remote work options and outsourcing", <a href="https://x.com/ZeniMaxWorkers/status/1856714480413003983" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">demanding</a> "job security and improved working conditions".</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/bethesda-strike-zenimax-xbox-microsoft" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Inverse report</a>, QA test lead Rhyanna Eichner says ZeniMax Workers United members are "all really looking forward to coming together and spending time together", and that "this is what needs to be done to move on".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-elder-scrolls-online-zenimax-workers-united-strike.jpg?itok=iLZ6m1w6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-elder-scrolls-online-zenimax-workers-united-strike.jpg?itok=Dg4PltUN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>ZeniMax Workers United comprises QA workers of all stripes from across Bethesda's offices.</figcaption></figure><p>Eichner also says that the union is striking over its parent company's remote work proposals, which she says are not good enough. She says Microsoft has "continually given us their first proposal again and again", and that it's obvious to her the union's "different mobilization tactics have not worked".</p>

<p>Senior QA tester Juniper Dowell adds that many employees would be forced to consider alternative employment if they were required to be at the office five days a week because they were hired under remote working conditions.</p>

<p>Dowell says that while striking "isn't fun or ideal", there's a "satisfaction in having a concrete physical action" to help the union and its members "fight for better work conditions". She's hoping that Microsoft and ZeniMax will "stop dragging their feet and meet us at the table".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bethesda-zenimax-workers-united-strike-starfield.jpg?itok=mv-ewWrh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bethesda-zenimax-workers-united-strike-starfield.jpg?itok=OoFPjxfo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>ZeniMax Workers United wants to negotiate for better remote working policies and less QA outsourcing.</figcaption></figure><p>ZeniMax's union isn't the only one to go on strike in recent months. Last week, employees at French studio Don't Nod <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-nod-employees-strike" rel="nofollow">went on strike</a> following the announcement that almost 70 jobs at their studio could be at risk, with remote working policies also on the list of issues employees raised.</p>

<p>Gaming giant Ubisoft also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-strike-investor-letter" rel="nofollow">faced a strike in October</a>, again in part over remote working policies, as well as what the employees involved perceived to be inadequate salaries.</p>

<p>ZeniMax Workers United's strike will last a single day, running between 10am and 6pm local time. We'll have to wait and see whether Microsoft and ZeniMax pay enough attention for negotiations to truly begin.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[GOG Preservation Program Aims to Make Your Games "Live Forever"]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gog-preservation-program</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gog-preservation-program-aims-to-make-your-games-live-forever.1034688/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gog-preservation-program<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GOG has announced the GOG Preservation Program, an initiative that aims to keep certain games playable forever no matter whether their developers are still supporting them or not.</p>

<p>Over on the official Preservation Program <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/gog-preservation-program" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, the company warns that "time is erasing the games that shaped you", but that "we can fight back" through the program, which "ensures classic games remain playable on modern systems".</p>

<p>According to GOG, games that belong to the initiative will be DRM-free and eligible for "dedicated tech support", so even if something does go wrong, you'll be able to get help to fix it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gog-preservation-program-games.jpg?itok=8mrmRJ9h 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gog-preservation-program-games.jpg?itok=jt7K9zVg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The GOG Preservation Program currently covers 100 games, and more are coming.</figcaption></figure><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1856698605563793789" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">followup thread on X</a> (formerly Twitter), GOG says that the initiative features "updated, improved, or quality-tested builds", and that if you see the Preservation Program stamp on a game's GOG page, that means you'll be able to enjoy it on your PC "hassle-free".</p>

<p>Games currently included in the program include the likes of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-3-classic-gog-re-release" rel="nofollow">original three&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>games</a>, the original&nbsp;<em>Diablo&nbsp;</em>and its&nbsp;<em>Hellfire&nbsp;</em>expansion, and&nbsp;<em>Heroes of Might and Magic 3</em>, as well as&nbsp;<em>Legacy of Kain: Defiance</em>,&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: Origins</em>, and more.</p>

<p>GOG cites the Video Game History Foundation as saying that "87% of games created before 2010 are inaccessible today", a sobering statistic that demonstrates just how necessary an initiative like this really is.</p>




<p>You'll also find an FAQ on the Preservation Program's website that provides more information about the initiative. It includes info like what to do when a stamped game doesn't work, as well as whether classic GOG games are necessarily worse than those included in the Program (the answer being no, of course).</p>

<p>GOG says it wants "hundreds of games" to come with the GOG Preservation Program stamp by the end of 2025, so you can expect lots more games to be added to this initiative as time goes on. Stay tuned for more.</p>
