            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has released new <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> Unearthed Arcana. This latest batch of playtest material features new apocalyptic-themed character subclasses, which may hint at the company returning to one of its older, and darker, settings.</p>

<h2>The <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Unearthed Arcana Apocalyptic Subclass Announcement</h2>

<p>As always, the latest <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Unearthed Arcana is free to download from <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/ua/apocalyptic-subclasses" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">D&amp;D Beyond</a>. The new playtest material uses the 2024 rules and features four new character subclasses for the Druid, Fighter, Sorceror, and Warlock. Each subclass appears to take on a darker, postapocalyptic theme.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dungeons-dragons-unearthed-arcana-circle-of-preservation-text-screenshot.jpg?itok=gueOLHGJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dungeons-dragons-unearthed-arcana-circle-of-preservation-text-screenshot.jpg?itok=k2tE8BeD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The Circle of Preservation Druid is all about protection. Druids of this circle can expend a use of their Wild Shape to create a large area of vegetation to grow which heals allies and cures them of certain conditions. At later levels, you can even eschew expensive material components for more advanced spells and have your hallowed areas deal radiant damage to enemies.</p>

<p>The Gladiator Fighter features a combination of martial prowess and bloody showmanship. Their Brutality mechanic lets them layer on additional weapon mastery effects with every hit like Vex or Topple, and can add their Charisma bonus to certain skill rolls. At later levels, the Gladiator also gets a Parry and Mutilate ability, which can debuff bloodied enemies.</p>

<p>The third subclass in this <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Unearthed Arcana is the Defiled Sorcery Sorceror. This Sorceror can expend hit dice to increase the damage of a spell attack. The twist is the hit dice spent can either be theirs or the enemy. At later levels, they gain auras which grant resistance to certain damage types and helps them regain sorcery points.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dungeons-dragons-unearthed-arcana-sorceror-king-warlock-text.jpg?itok=NJk6qhxA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dungeons-dragons-unearthed-arcana-sorceror-king-warlock-text.jpg?itok=RSw-Bxw9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Finally, there is the Sorcerer-King Patron Warlock. As the name implies, Warlocks make a pact with a tyrannical demigod or incredibly powerful magical despot for power. As a result, you can cast certain spells like <em>Command</em> or <em>Hold Person</em> without verbal or somatic components and create auras that can make enemies frightened of you. Their endgame features include forcing enemies to auto-fail attacks.</p>

<p>On the surface, the new <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Unearthed Arcana appears to be an innocuous batch of playtest material. But it is no secret that UAs usually allude to future books or supplements that Wizards of the Coast are working on. Their<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/latest-dungeons-dragons-2024-unearthed-arcana-revisits-arcane-subclasses" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"> Arcane subclass UA</a> hinting at the new Forgotten Realms books, or the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dd-beyond-releases-dungeons-dragons-2024-artificer-unearthed-arcana" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">revised Artificer</a> foreshadows the new <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-announces-new-eberron-2025-supplement-bringing-back-older-dd-setting" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eberron</a> book.</p>

<p>With that in mind, there is a strong chance this Unearthed Arcana may imply Wizards of the Coast may return to the apocalyptic world of Dark Sun in a future book. This would be a major departure from the high fantasy of Faerun or the steampunk sensibilities of Eberron.</p>

<p>Dark Sun is set in the post-apocalyptic world of Athas, full of barren wastelands, slavery, and wizard tyrants that use the lives of their subjects to power spells. It has more in common with <em>Mad Max</em> or the classic <em>Conan The Barbarian</em> stories than <em>Lord of the Rings</em>. It is also a notoriously problematic setting packed various negative stereotypes.</p>

<p>Given the thematic text and mechanical function seen in the UA, these subclasses would be right at home in such a setting. But does beg the question as to how WOTC will present the dark themes in the setting if they choose to revisit it in 2024.</p>

      <div><p>Stone Blade Entertainment recently launched a crowdfunding campaign for <em>Ascension 15th Anniversary Edition</em>. The campaign celebrating a milestone for the iconic deckbuilding game is a runaway success, reaching its goal within minutes of it going live.</p>



<p>According to its campaign page, <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/projects/stoneblade/ascension-15th-anniversary#/section/rewards/reward-product-85307" rel="nofollow"><em>Ascension 15th Anniversary Edition</em></a> provides both newcomers and veteran players a pristine version of the game, complete with a promotional embossed tin case, foil cards, and more.</p>

<p>If you already have copies of <em>Ascension</em>, the <em>Ascension 15th Anniversary Edition</em> campaign is full of optional add-ons. In addition to center decks for all 15 expansions, you can purchase discounted card sleeves, playmats, the Ascension Tactics spin-off and another deckbuilding game, <em>Shards of Eternity</em>. The sleeves and center decks are exclusive to this Gamefound campaign.</p>

<p>The different pledge levels of <em>Ascension 15th Anniversary Edition</em> are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>15th Anniversary Collector's Edition for $99:</strong> A copy of the game with all foil cards, a limited edition tin, and every Year One promo card.</li>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-version-22-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/zenless-zone-zero-version-2-2-set-for-september-release.1278279/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has revealed that&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 2.2 will be arriving in early September, bringing with it new Agents for your squad, a new story chunk to uncover, and more.</p>

<p>Following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-version-21-release-date" rel="nofollow">July's Version 2.1 update</a>, Version 2.2 of&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero</em>&nbsp;is launching on September 4th (which, given <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-september" rel="nofollow">recent developments</a>, is a pretty daring release date to commit to on HoYoverse's part, it must be said).</p>

<p>Story-wise, you'll be dealing with the fallout of the Exaltists' conspiracy and getting to know the Obol Squad, a new elite unit alongside whom you'll be working in order to "uncover long-buried truths", as well as to reveal the hidden stories behind one of its members.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zenless-zone-zero-version-2.2-seed-orphie.jpg?itok=roa5RDDh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zenless-zone-zero-version-2.2-seed-orphie.jpg?itok=xlZ7I-ZC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Two new Agents are joining the fray in&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 2.2.</figcaption></figure><p>That agent is Seed, and you'll be getting the chance to add her to your team in&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 2.2. She's a genius mechanic and Electric Attack Agent who can enhance sustained damage across her whole team.</p>

<p>Joining Seed is the twofer unit Orphie &amp; Magus, a Fire Attack Agent who can boost team Attack and cause Aftershocks to ignore part of your enemy's Defense stat. They're joined by S-rank Bangboo Mercury, who can serve as a tank for their team.</p>

<p>Alongside Seed and Orphie &amp; Magus, you'll also get another chance to pick up Evelyn and Trigger throughout the course of Version 2.2's cycle, and Soldier 0 - Anby, who's "currently undergoing intensive training", will be returning "in future versions" as well.</p>

<p>Of course, Version 2.2 will also bring with it plenty of new events and gameplay improvements, so once you've played through the main part of the new update's story, there should still be plenty for you to do.</p>




<p><em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>is <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">available to check out right now for free</a> on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and mobile devices. Version 2.2, "Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night", launches on September 4th.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Splitgate Peer-to-Peer Support Confirmed After Sequel Returns to Beta]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splitgate-peer-to-peer-support-confirmed</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/splitgate-peer-to-peer-support-confirmed-after-sequel-returns-to-beta.1278234/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher 1047 Games has announced that peer-to-peer support is coming to&nbsp;<em>Splitgate</em>, allowing you to continue playing the game online even after the central servers are shut down.</p>

<p>Back in July, 1047 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splitgate-2-beta-layoffs" rel="nofollow">announced</a> that in order to focus on rebuilding&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>(which is returning to beta following negative feedback for its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splitgate-2-1-0-release-date" rel="nofollow">initial release</a>), servers for the original&nbsp;<em>Splitgate&nbsp;</em>will be closed down, but at the time, the devs said they would consider either offline play or peer-to-peer support.</p>

<p>Now, in a news post on the official&nbsp;<em>Splitgate&nbsp;</em>website, 1047 confirms that the direction it's chosen to go down is peer-to-peer play, which means you'll still be able to play with others online, although you'll do so via direct connection and not through a central server.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/splitgate-peer-to-peer-servers-shooting.jpg?itok=HlgMDqex 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/splitgate-peer-to-peer-servers-shooting.jpg?itok=gOsRvXZq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you love the original&nbsp;<em>Splitgate</em>, fear not; it'll still be playable after next week.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as introducing peer-to-peer play, 1047 says it's made "previously unreleased, stockpiled, or work-in-progress" content for&nbsp;<em>Splitgate&nbsp;</em>playable, including 14 new maps for you to gallivant around.</p>

<p>In essence, peer-to-peer play means that certain players will act as hosts, so the stability of the game will depend on how strong their connection is. You'll be able to view in-progress&nbsp;<em>Splitgate&nbsp;</em>games from the server browser.</p>

<p>You'll also be granted all in-game cosmetics to enjoy, and all of your previous progression will remain intact as well, so everything you've unlocked over the course of your time with&nbsp;<em>Splitgate&nbsp;</em>will still be accessible.</p>

<p>PC and console play will still be supported, as will cross-play, so you'll be able to play&nbsp;<em>Splitgate&nbsp;</em>alongside players on other platforms. Anticheat, however, will not be enabled, so there's a chance you may come across more nefarious behavior than before.</p>




<p>You can read the full FAQ for how peer-to-peer play will work in&nbsp;<em>Splitgate&nbsp;</em>via the <a href="https://www.splitgate.com/news/splitgate-1-lives-on-through-peer-to-peer-support" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement post</a>, and you can check the game out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/677620/Splitgate/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/splitgate/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/splitgate/9P4S1BPJLPHZ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.</p>
