            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As the season of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d6ed521c-5f08-4830-865a-d3f962e557b4" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-underworlds-emberguard-new-edition-with-plenty-of-changes" rel="nofollow"><em>Warhammer Underworlds Embergard</em></a> continues, the latest Warband to be released is <em>Kamandora's Blades</em> alongside the <em>Raging Slayers Rivals Deck</em>. This five-Fighter Warband is a group of savage warriors ready to "weaken and bleed their foes" and "hack their heads free." Mixed with the aggressive Raging Slayers deck this is a Warband for those who like picking a target and going until they're destroyed.</p>



<p>The five fighter warband is made up of Kamandora, the guiding hand and matriarch of the group, the powerful Throkk, and the nimble and deadly Ghalista, Antro Krast, and Kannat.</p>

Already in their description, you'll begin to get an idea of how they function.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Ghalista, Antro Krast and the hound Kannat weaken and bleed their foes before Throkk hacks their heads free."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The core mechanic of this Warband revolves around the "A Worthy Skull" ability. At the start of the first Action step of each Battle Round a single enemy fighter is selected to be the 'worthy skull'. This ties into not only the narrative, of Kamandora picking what fights her Blades take part in, but also into the Inspiration mechanic of this Warband.</p>

<p>First, you'll be inspiring each friendly fighter adjacent to the enemy worthy skill after a power step, but also if the worthy skull is killed by a friendly fighter they will also be inspired. Tracking down and dealing damage to the worthy skull is further enhanced by the Slaughterous Pilgrimage ability. After picking the worthy skill each friendly fighter must be pushed 1 hex closer.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-underworlds-kamandoras-blades-warband-sheet.jpg?itok=WC-gZ8N1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-underworlds-kamandoras-blades-warband-sheet.jpg?itok=Zj0kZBgV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This all lead to a LOT happening at the beginning of each battle round as your opponent gets to learn who your target is, every friendly fighter moves closer, and those who are adjacent get to be inspired.</p>

<p>Inspiring, as you'd expect, will power up each of the Fighters attacks, as well as their defences. This Warband is a seek and destroy machine intended to deal constant damage one enemy at a time. It is a wave that's going to be constantly putting pressure on dealing damage to your enemies and whittling down their forces before they can do anything to push back on you.</p>

<p>The engine of this Warband is extremely clear to understand, it's formulaic yes but if you're wanting to get a better understanding on the rest of the game and want to just run your Warband with a simple strategy it's a great first step to be taking. It's also great for someone like me who tends to appreciate an aggressive approach, as well as the consistency that comes with it.</p>

<h2><em>Raging Slayers</em> Rivals Deck</h2>

<p>When talking about the <em>Kamandora's Blades</em> and their consistent strategy, rolling dice normally laughs in the face of that. With a Rivals Deck like <em>Raging Slayers</em> you can negate that.</p>

<p>When using the <em>Raging Slayers Rivals Deck</em> you'll be able to place a Rage token on any fighter that you pick to use a Charge attacks. These Rage tokens will stay on the fighter until the end of the battle round.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-underworlds-raging-slayers-01.jpg?itok=C1B3oQy4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-underworlds-raging-slayers-01.jpg?itok=IBmkWROl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>A fighter with a Rage token can reroll 1 attack dice immediately after making a melee attack, and if you're attacked and not driven back or grapples you can then push your fighter 1 hex away from the attackers.</p>

<p>Combining the two, you've got a force of enraging fighters, that advance on a selected opponent and power up, and if they're hit have a chance to back away while Enraged.</p>

<p>The Objective Cards of this set are just as aggressive as the abilities would have you believe. Points are scored for killing, enraging, and having a large number of enraged fighters in various areas of the map. If you're playing as aggressively as this deck wants you to then achieving something like having all friendly fighters enraged and in your opponent's territory.</p>

<p>To back up these aggressive Objectives the Power Cards are your disposal are all about making your attacks even more consistent, how you can mitigate taking damage by allowing rerolls on saves, and moving enraged fighters further towards targets.</p>

<h2><em>Kamandora's Blades </em>and <em>Raging Slayers</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Never before have I see a combination Warband and Rivals Deck that is so straightforward and blood thirsty. The ever encroaching fighters, empowered and buffed, are going to be a terrifying force that will just become scarier as your battles go on.</p>

<p>Seeing either of these players should be warned that they need to take action to slow this Warband's development, or hope they can stay out of reach while working on their own objectives.</p>

<p>For a player who is into a linear strategy, while it might seem obvious, it's surely going to be a consistent strategy to create a tidal wave of attacks making it harder for your opponent to focus on objectives while they're just trying to protect themselves.</p>
