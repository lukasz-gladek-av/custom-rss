            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/teamlfg-playstation-studios-ex-bungie<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>PlayStation Studios has announced the formation of teamLFG, a brand new studio comprising ex-Bungie staffers and "developers from across the industry", and the studio is already hard at work on its first game.</p>

<p>As revealed in a PlayStation Blog <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/07/welcome-teamlfg-to-the-playstation-studios-family/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, teamLFG "originated at Bungie", but it's now a separate entity that's working on what Sony Interactive head Hermen Hulst describes as "an ambitious incubation project that [he's] very excited about".</p>

<p>Just in case you're wondering, yes, the "LFG" in teamLFG's name stands for "Looking for Group", MMORPG-style. The studio says it's "driven by a mission to create games where players can find friendship, community, and belonging", hence the name.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/destiny-2-teamlfg-playstation-studios.jpg?itok=TGyMDIDC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/destiny-2-teamlfg-playstation-studios.jpg?itok=MSEYX2WM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Staffers at teamLFG have worked on&nbsp;<em>Destiny</em>,&nbsp;<em>Halo</em>,&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>, and other games.</figcaption></figure><p>In the PlayStation Blog announcement, teamLFG says its debut project is "a team-based action game that draws inspiration from fighting games, platformers, MOBAs, life sims, and frog-type games". It'll all take place in a "lighthearted, comedic world".</p>

<p>If that wording sounds familiar to you, it's probably because the exact same project was "announced" by Bungie <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-teases-new-team-based-action-game-set-in-lighthearted-science-fantasy-universe" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">in August 2023</a>, and it was still classed as an "incubation" project then, too. Looks like the game may still be some way away from being officially revealed.</p>

<p>According to teamLFG, its goal is not only to react to player feedback "in our lead-up to launch" (although it feels a little premature for the studio to say that when the game hasn't even been revealed yet), but also "throughout live service", so it sounds like this'll be yet another live-service experiment for Sony.</p>

<p>It'd be remiss of me not to once again bring up&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>here; the first-person shooter was a hugely costly endeavor for Sony, but it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds" rel="nofollow">closed its doors</a> within just weeks of its launch, resulting in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-shuts-down-two-studios-including-concord-creator" rel="nofollow">closure of its developer</a>. I'm not sure yet another live-service game is the way to go, but hey, I'm not Sony.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marathon-bungie-playstation-studios.jpg?itok=YJSd8EUE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marathon-bungie-playstation-studios.jpg?itok=Br3HrOUx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bungie, from which teamLFG is a spinoff, is currently gearing up for the release of extraction shooter reboot&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>The new studio's game will also find itself entering a landscape occupied by Bungie's next major live-service project, extraction shooter reboot&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marathon-release-date-gameplay-revealed" rel="nofollow">due to launch in September</a>.</p>

<p>Whether or not&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>succeeds could well inform whether teamLFG's game manages to see the light of day, or whether it gets canned in a similar manner to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/respawn-layoffs-project-cancellations" rel="nofollow">two Respawn incubation projects</a> which were shut down recently. Stay tuned for more.</p>
