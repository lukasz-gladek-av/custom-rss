            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-30m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's time once again to cast your gaze to the Lands Between, as publisher Bandai Namco and developer FromSoftware have revealed another major&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>sales milestone has been passed.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1916855058097938564" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X,&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>has managed to pass the 30 million sales mark, which means the open-world Soulslike action RPG has picked up another five million sales for itself <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-25-million" rel="nofollow">since June last year</a>.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that this figure refers to sales across all platforms, and it also appears to include both digital and physical shipments. Additionally, the figure doesn't include sales for&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-sales" rel="nofollow">hit five million after just three days</a>&nbsp;on its release last year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-sales-30m-cliff.jpg?itok=3_--U5rJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-sales-30m-cliff.jpg?itok=Nbh0jMGK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>has managed to cross the 30 million sales mark.</figcaption></figure><p>It's fair to say that by any metric, this new milestone further cements&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s remarkable success. The figure puts the game in the same league as Warner Bros' phenomenally popular&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-sales-30m" rel="nofollow">crossed the same milestone back in November</a>.</p>

<p>Given&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s huge success, then, FromSoftware and Bandai Namco's decision to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nighreign-release-date" rel="nofollow">create a followup to the game</a> in the form of the multiplayer-focused&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>makes a lot of sense, at least from an intellectual property-focused perspective.</p>

<p>Even if you're not feeling up to trying out&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>'s formula-departing&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>-inspired gameplay, though, you needn't fret.&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>is also making its way to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch 2</a> this year, complete with the&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>expansion and some special new armor.</p>

<p>The game isn't even the only FromSoftware title in development for Nintendo's new console; it's joined by&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-duskbloods-fromsoftware-nintendo-switch-2" rel="nofollow"><em>The Duskbloods</em></a>, a PvPvE-focused title coming to the new machine in 2026.</p>




<p>While you wait for&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>to land on Switch, you can pick the game up right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1245620/ELDEN_RING/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/elden-ring/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/elden-ring/9p3j32ctxlrz" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wii-homebrew-channel-shut-down-dev-says-community-built-on-lies.1175418/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wii-homebrew-channel-shut-down<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Popular Wii homebrew tool Wii Homebrew Channel has been shut down, and its developers have launched an excoriating attack on the originators of the software on which the channel is (or was) based.</p>

<p>As spotted by X user <a href="https://x.com/OatmealDome/status/1916557212509478946" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">OatmealDome</a>, the Wii Homebrew Channel <a href="https://github.com/fail0verflow/hbc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a> has now been archived, and homebrew group Fail0verflow has blamed the shutdown on the discovery that the libogc library, on which Wii Homebrew Channel is based, contains stolen code.</p>

<p>According to Fail0verflow, "large portions of libogc were stolen directly from the Nintendo SDK (software development kit) or games using the Nintendo SDK". The group says it "thought that at least significant parts" of the library "were original", and so "reluctantly continued to use the project".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wii-homebrew-channel-shut-down-github.jpg?itok=WcPtCnIt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wii-homebrew-channel-shut-down-github.jpg?itok=KWi5liHs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This is what you'll find if you visit the Wii Homebrew Channel GitHub page (at time of writing).</figcaption></figure><p>However, Fail0verflow says it was recently revealed that certain parts of libogc were "stolen from RTEMS", an open-source real-time operating system for which the library "remove[d] all attribution and copyright information".</p>

<p>According to the group, libogc's developers' actions go "far beyond ignorance about the copyright implications of reverse engineering Nintendo binaries" and stray into "outright deliberate, malicious code theft and copyright infringement".</p>

<p>Fail0verflow says libogc's developers are "not interested in tracking this issue, finding a solution, [or] informing the community of the problematic copyright status of the project", going as far as to say the Wii homebrew community as a whole is "built on top of a pile of lies and copyright infringement".</p>

<p>As OatmealDome further <a href="https://x.com/OatmealDome/status/1916557214904430754" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">points out</a>, libogc serves as "the core of all homebrew apps" when it comes to GameCube and Wii homebrew solutions, so Fail0verflow's accusations aren't small potatoes in this regard.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gamecube-libogc-homebrew.jpg?itok=0DIBWMLl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gamecube-libogc-homebrew.jpg?itok=2n6xU0zE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>libogc also forms the basis of GameCube homebrew.</figcaption></figure><p>The shutdown of the Wii Homebrew Channel, or rather the cessation of ongoing development, is a massive blow to the Wii homebrew scene, but unfortunately, Fail0verflow says it can't encourage further development as it's "impossible to legally and legitimately compile this software".</p>

<p>Some might say Fail0verflow is being hypocritical given emulation is a common usage for Wii homebrew software, but I don't think that's entirely fair. Modding a Wii with homebrew software is far from illegal; it's playing copyrighted games or software that crosses that particular line.</p>

<p>In any case, we'll have to wait and see what impact this has on the Wii homebrew scene as a whole, but it's not likely to be a positive one. Stay tuned for more.</p>
