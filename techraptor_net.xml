            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Xseed has announced the release date for&nbsp;<em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</em>, a strategy JRPG from the creators of the&nbsp;<em>Danganronpa&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Zero Escape&nbsp;</em>franchises.</p>

<p>Per a new trailer, the game will launch for PC and Nintendo Switch on April 24th, so you'll only have a few more months to wait to get your hands on it. There's no word of a release for other major platforms yet, sadly.</p>

<p>It's good to know that&nbsp;<em>Danganronpa</em>'s Kazutaka Kodaka and&nbsp;<em>Zero Escape</em>'s Kotaro Uchikoshi have managed to get this one over the line. Back in June, Kodaka <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/danganronpa-creators-new-game-risking-lives" rel="nofollow">said that he and his team were "risking their lives"</a> to secure financing for the game and get it made.</p>

Can you tell?</figcaption></figure><p><em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy&nbsp;</em>will tell the story of Takumi Sumino, a "totally average teenager" who's whisked away to the titular Last Defense Academy following an attack on his hometown by monsters.</p>

<p>Sumino, along with 14 other students, must keep their school safe for 100 days as part of the Special Defense Unit, and as they fight, they'll learn how much they're "willing to sacrifice to take back their normal lives and save the world".</p>

<p>Appropriately enough, the premise feels rather like a marriage between&nbsp;<em>Danganronpa&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Zero Escape</em>, and since&nbsp;<em>The Hundred Line&nbsp;</em>is the brainchild of the creators of those franchises, that probably shouldn't come as a surprise.</p>

<p>You can check out the new "Extreme Despair Trailer" for&nbsp;<em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy&nbsp;</em>below. As you can probably surmise from that title, we're not exactly in for a laugh-a-minute comedy extravaganza with this one.</p>




<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy&nbsp;</em>when it launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3014080/The_Hundred_Line_Last_Defense_Academy/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, as well as Nintendo Switch, on April 24th. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/deceive-inc-developer-sweet-bandits-shuts-down.1051575/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/deceive-inc-developer-sweet-bandits-shuts-down<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Deceive Inc.&nbsp;</em>developer Sweet Bandits has announced that it will close down, but the studio says it's currently "considering options" with regards to what will happen to the game itself.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://forums.tripwireinteractive.com/index.php?threads/a-message-from-sweet-bandits.2340721/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on the forum of <i>Deceive Inc.&nbsp;</i>publisher Tripwire, lead designer and Sweet Bandits co-founder&nbsp;Philippe Pelletier Baribault, also known as Baribandit, says he and his company have "reached the breaking point", and that they are "unable to continue this adventure".</p>

<p>Baribault says he and Sweet Bandits walked a "long and difficult road of trying to get&nbsp;<em>Deceive Inc.&nbsp;</em>in a state where it could thrive", but that they haven't managed to achieve this goal, hence the studio's closure.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/deceive-inc-sweet-bandits-shut-down-punch.jpg?itok=MzxVFU2h 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/deceive-inc-sweet-bandits-shut-down-punch.jpg?itok=QUe5-KeL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Deceive Inc.&nbsp;</em>developer Sweet Bandits is shutting down.</figcaption></figure><p>With regards to "the path ahead" for&nbsp;<em>Deceive Inc</em>., Baribault says that he and his studio are considering the best way for "maintaining this game that we all love". It's possible, then, that&nbsp;<em>Deceive Inc.&nbsp;</em>won't be shutting down.</p>

<p>In fact, right now, servers and access to the game will remain active, although a <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/820520/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">quick look at the game's SteamDB numbers</a> indicates that this might not be the most meaningful decision, unfortunately.</p>

<p>Even if&nbsp;<em>Deceive Inc.</em>'s servers do remain available for play, however, it doesn't look like we'll be getting any new games from Sweet Bandits in the future, which is a shame.</p>




<p><em>Deceive Inc.&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/deceive-inc-release-date-unmasked-for-march" rel="nofollow">released back in March last year</a>. It's a competitive multiplayer shooter based on espionage and subtlety; you're better off sneaking around rather than going in guns blazing.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it seems that the game's quirky, cartoony art style and focus on stealth rather than arena combat failed to help it find an audience.</p>

<p>That said, Sweet Bandits' demise is just the latest tragedy in a long line of studio closures, project cancellations, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-june-14th" rel="nofollow">widespread industry layoffs</a> that have affected both big companies and small developers alike.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xdefiant-shutting-down-as-two-ubisoft-studios-close.1051527/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has announced that it will shut down the servers for its competitive first-person shooter&nbsp;<em>XDefiant&nbsp;</em>next year, and two of the company's studios will close while a third will "ramp down" production.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/xdefiant-our-message-to-players" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message on its official website</a>, Ubisoft says that the "sunset process" for&nbsp;<em>XDefiant&nbsp;</em>has already begun. As of yesterday, you can no longer download&nbsp;<em>XDefiant&nbsp;</em>as a new player, register to play it, or purchase any in-game content.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that&nbsp;<em>XDefiant&nbsp;</em>is shutting down, its third season will still launch, although after that, no new content will be added to the game. We don't yet know when Season 3 will launch, but you can expect it to land in the next couple of months.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-shooting.jpg?itok=-vVJW1Sb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-shooting.jpg?itok=md2O6Kdl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>XDefiant&nbsp;</em>will shut down next year, Ubisoft has announced.</figcaption></figure><p>If you bought&nbsp;<em>XDefiant</em>'s Ultimate Founders Pack, you'll be entitled to a full refund, and if you bought any virtual currency or DLC for the game on or after November 3rd, you'll get a refund for that as well.</p>

<p>Additionally, if you do want to keep playing&nbsp;<em>XDefiant</em>, you'll be able to do so until the servers shut down, which will happen on June 3rd. That's only if you've already signed up and downloaded it, of course.</p>

<p>What's more, according to Ubisoft's chief studios and portfolio officer <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-gb/article/1EywTnGrZdDqCoxKs2zNhZ/ubisoft-discontinues-development-on-xdefiant" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Marie-Sophie de Waubert</a>, Ubisoft's San Francisco and Osaka studios will close down.</p>

<p>The San Francisco studio was the one responsible for developing&nbsp;<em>XDefiant</em>, while the Osaka studio has worked on several of Ubisoft's games over the years, including series like&nbsp;<em>Petz&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Rocksmith</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ubisoft-san-francisco-osaka-shutdown-rocksmith.jpg?itok=3jHrMorJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ubisoft-san-francisco-osaka-shutdown-rocksmith.jpg?itok=2mQNZ7gi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Both Ubisoft San Francisco and Ubisoft Osaka have worked on the&nbsp;<em>Rocksmith&nbsp;</em>franchise.</figcaption></figure><p>In her post, de Waubert also refers to the "ramp down of the Sydney production site". She expresses her "deepest gratitude" to "those team members leaving Ubisoft", although she doesn't confirm how many people the shutdowns will affect.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/stephentotilo/status/1864109024939049085" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Game File's Stephen Totilo</a>, up to 277 people could lose their jobs, although Totilo also says that half of the&nbsp;<em>XDefiant&nbsp;</em>team will be reallocated to other Ubisoft projects.</p>

<p>It's been a rough year for Ubisoft; the company has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-h1-2024-25-fiscal-results" rel="nofollow">hemorrhaged money</a>&nbsp;this year after seemingly suffering high-profile financial flops, including <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-february" rel="nofollow">the likes of&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-february" rel="nofollow">Star Wars Outlaws</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown </em>(and now&nbsp;<em>XDefiant&nbsp;</em>as well).</p>

<p>Ubisoft's performance has led to angry investors calling for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activist-ubisoft-investor-open-letter-change" rel="nofollow">structural change</a> at the company, with heads the Guillemots and investor Tencent reportedly considering <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-bosses-tencent-private-buyout-report" rel="nofollow">taking the company private</a> in response.</p>

<p>Layoffs at Ubisoft are part of a wider industry wave that has affected big and small companies alike. Latest <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rajio.bsky.social/post/3lcgx6aeglk2i" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">estimates</a> suggest that 2024's layoffs total more than 2023's and 2022's combined, and that this year is just a few hundred layoffs away from doubling 2023's total.</p>
