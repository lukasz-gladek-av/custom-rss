            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tribe-nine-shutdown<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Akatsuki Games has announced that its free-to-play "brutal action RPG"&nbsp;<em>Tribe Nine&nbsp;</em>will be ending service, and the announcement comes just a few months after the game's initial release.</p>

<p>Following in the footsteps of other Japanese mobile-focused games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-brave-exvius-shutting-down" rel="nofollow">Final Fantasy Brave Exvius</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nier-reincarnation-shutting-down" rel="nofollow"><em>Nier Reincarnation</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Tribe Nine&nbsp;</em>will be shutting down in November, according to a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2376580/view/500572747038983820" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the game's official Steam page.</p>

<p>In the post, Akatsuki Games says that the decision to shut down&nbsp;<em>Tribe Nine&nbsp;</em>was taken after "careful consideration". The studio doesn't provide any more specific reason for the game's closure, but it does say that its development team worked hard to "provide excellent service and improve player experience".</p>

<p>Not only that, but all "new features, adjustments, and known-issue fixes previously announced" won't be implemented, so&nbsp;<em>Tribe Nine&nbsp;</em>will remain in its current state until November.</p>

<p>Additionally, new characters Ichinosuke Akiba and Saizo Akiba, who were both due to debut as part of&nbsp;<em>Tribe Nine</em>'s roadmap, will be canned, and any Paid Enigma Entities you've used in the game will be fully refunded. Naturally, in-game shop items won't be available to buy for real money either.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Tribe Nine&nbsp;</em>is, it's the flagship video game of an intended multimedia franchise masterminded by Akatsuki Games and Kazutaka Kodaka's Too Kyo Games, which is also responsible for&nbsp;<em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tribe-nine-shutdown-announcement-warning.jpg?itok=-g4cl_Fm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tribe-nine-shutdown-announcement-warning.jpg?itok=hwcJmLqa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Tribe Nine&nbsp;</em>will remain in its current state until shutdown in November.</figcaption></figure><p>Too Kyo Games is currently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hundred-line-last-defense-academy-ps5-xbox-unlikely" rel="nofollow">struggling with its financial situation</a> following the release of&nbsp;<em>The Hundred Line</em>, and while that's not given as a reason for&nbsp;<em>Tribe Nine</em>'s shutdown, it probably won't help matters either.</p>

<p>In any case, you can still play&nbsp;<em>Tribe Nine&nbsp;</em>on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2376580/TRIBE_NINE/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and mobile devices for the time being. The game will shut down on November 27th.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[More Ubisoft Layoffs Probably Coming After Grim Year for Sales]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-financials-layoffs-possible</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/more-ubisoft-layoffs-probably-coming-after-grim-year-for-sales.1190028/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-financials-layoffs-possible<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has released its latest financial summary, which covers the 2024-25 fiscal year, and it's safe to say that things aren't exactly looking up for the studio right now.</p>

<p>In its presentation, Ubisoft reveals that both sales and profit are down compared to last year. The period in question technically also covers the launch of recent flagship game&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>, so although the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-circana-march-2025-sales" rel="nofollow">sales performance was strong</a>, it wasn't enough to save the studio from a tough year.</p>

<p>In an accompanying <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/75aGUbWM9kwnQj44Tr7d6H/ce4ca047ddadf45cf1e98cea8d1d7a78/Ubisoft_FY25_PR_English_vfinal.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a>, Ubisoft says it will refocus its efforts towards "more evergreen offering(s)" as part of a "product roadmap optimization", presumably meaning we can expect to see fewer one-off titles and more live-service-adjacent games from the company.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-financials-2024-25.jpg?itok=suJOpzQH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-financials-2024-25.jpg?itok=DpKAnvcB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>did well, but not well enough to save Ubisoft from a grim year.</figcaption></figure><p>Additionally, Ubisoft says it will continue its ongoing cost reduction program, as part of which the company hopes to slash "at least&nbsp;€200m" from its costs by the next financial year.</p>

<p>The studio says it's already achieved a reduction of "around&nbsp;€205 million" as of March 31st, but that a further&nbsp;€100m will need to be cut over the next two years, which means that we could see a repeat of the sweeping cuts that saw three Ubisoft <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing" rel="nofollow">studios</a> close their <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-layoffs-leamington-closure" rel="nofollow">doors</a> in the last six months or so.</p>

<p>Company CEO Yves Guillemot says the plan is to build "evergreen, billion-euro-brand ecosystems" based on Ubisoft's three most successful franchises:&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed</em>,&nbsp;<em>Rainbow Six</em>, and<i>&nbsp;Far Cry</i>.</p>

<p>That's the rationale behind the creation of a brand new corporate entity for the company's core IP, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft--report-new-gaming-entity-core-ip" rel="nofollow">first mooted back in March</a> before being made official later in the year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rainbow-six-siege-ubisoft.jpg?itok=8iuSFH_B 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rainbow-six-siege-ubisoft.jpg?itok=VrilsPYK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ubisoft is betting big on core franchises like&nbsp;<em>Rainbow Six Siege&nbsp;</em>for its future.</figcaption></figure><p>Guillemot goes on to say that as part of a "review" of Ubisoft's "pipeline", the studio has made the decision to "provide additional development time to some of [its] biggest productions".</p>

<p>He doesn't name those productions, but upcoming titles include mobile game&nbsp;<em>The Division Resurgence&nbsp;</em>and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sands-of-time-remake-another-studio" rel="nofollow">long-awaited&nbsp;<em>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake</em></a>, so it's entirely possible that both of these productions will be delayed even further.</p>

<p>You can check out Ubisoft's <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/6pXJlDFC1Nrw8mwM4M8Nr8/d4036561f95076c3acdb1003819058ef/Ubisoft_FY25_Slideshow_vfinal.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">full financial presentation here</a> if you want to read an overwhelming amount of corpo-speak (and look at some numbers as well, I suppose).</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Persona 5: The Phantom X Release Date Seemingly Leaked Ahead of Reveal]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-5-phantom-x-release-date-leaked</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/persona-5-the-phantom-x-release-date-seemingly-leaked-ahead-of-reveal.1189980/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-5-phantom-x-release-date-leaked<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Update: Atlus has now <a href="https://x.com/P5XOfficialWest/status/1923019286508880119" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">officially confirmed</a> that&nbsp;<em>Persona 5: The Phantom X&nbsp;</em>is launching on June 26th in the West. Original story follows below.</p>

<p>Original story: The release date for upcoming mobile RPG&nbsp;<em>Persona 5: The Phantom X&nbsp;</em>appears to have been leaked ahead of an official reveal later today hat's likely to contain said information.</p>

<p>As spotted by&nbsp;<em>Persona&nbsp;</em>fan site&nbsp;<a href="https://personacentral.com/p5x-english-release-date/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Persona Central</a>, the game, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-5-phantom-x-western-release-atlus-tease" rel="nofollow">teased for a Western release earlier this week</a>, now has live listings across the Play Store, the App Store, and Steam. Apple's App Store is the one to give the game away, listing an expected release date of June 26th.</p>

<p>Of course, since neither the Steam page nor the Play Store listing have the same date, Apple's date could be a placeholder, but that seems unlikely given how oddly specific said date would be if it was just for demonstration purposes.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/persona-5-the-phantom-x-release-date-leak-1-more.jpg?itok=itV_oBUt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/persona-5-the-phantom-x-release-date-leak-1-more.jpg?itok=9Ozki6xo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Persona 5: The Phantom X&nbsp;</em>looks to be coming West in June.</figcaption></figure><p>The App Store description of&nbsp;<em>Persona 5: The Phantom X&nbsp;</em>promises a "captivating RPG experience that takes you beyond the world of&nbsp;<em>Persona 5</em>". You'll play as a new original character who's "thrust into a changed world drained of hope" following a "nightmare".</p>

<p>Before long, he meets an "eloquent owl named Lefaye" and "a long-nosed man" alongside a "beauty donned in blue", which presumably refers to Igor and his new assistant character. Evidently, twin youngsters Caroline and Justine will not be returning for&nbsp;<em>The Phantom X</em>.</p>

<p>Like the original&nbsp;<em>Persona 5</em>, you'll be switching between the Metaverse and the real world, exploring dungeons and balancing your adventuring life with socializing and building relationships.</p>

<p>Combat will follow the original&nbsp;<em>Persona 5</em>&nbsp;rather than either of its spinoffs; it'll be a strictly turn-based affair, so don't expect to be doing any <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/persona-5-strikers" rel="nofollow">real-time hack-and-slash-style fighting</a> or grid-based tactical strategizing here.</p>
