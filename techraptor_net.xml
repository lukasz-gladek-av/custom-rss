            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Sad Cat Studios and publisher Thunderful have announced the release date for long-delayed 2.5D narrative action-platformer (whew, that's a lot of descriptors) <em>Replaced</em>, and it's coming early next year.</p><p>As revealed in a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1663850/view/530991074580104075" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">post</a>, <em>Replaced </em>will be arriving on March 12th next year. As far as we know, it's set to arrive on PC and Xbox Series X|S, with an Xbox One version also in development, although given Microsoft's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-hardware-revenue-q1-2026" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ba6a7b14-7c36-438c-952b-7ec1e2422993" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">position in the hardware market</a>, that version may be scrapped in the fullness of time.</p><p>Back in August, Sad Cat revealed that <em>Replaced </em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/replaced-spring-2026-release-window" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e1909a0a-08c9-41e1-bf76-76966ced7965" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">set for a spring 2026 release window</a>, with project lead Yura Zhdanovich acknowledging at the time that the project had been delayed numerous times but assuring fans that the studio was doing what it thought was best for the game.</p><figure role="group">

<p>Originally announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-announcement-from-xbox-bethesda-e3-2021" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a8f02423-4316-4b53-9fae-e0c65906486c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">all the way back at E3 2021</a>, <em>Replaced </em>is a 2.5D narrative-driven action platformer that takes place in an "alternate 1980s America scarred by nuclear catastrophe".</p><p>You play as R.E.A.C.H., an AI (as in a real one, not a glorified chatbot) stuck in a human's body, and you must discover the reason for your creation while exposing the sinister agenda of Phoenix Corporation. It's a cyberpunk story, so obviously, the corporation has a sinister agenda.</p><p>Gameplay-wise, <em>Replaced </em>appears to be paying homage to the cinematic platformers of time gone by; think <em>Heart of Darkness</em>, <em>Out of This World </em>(also known as <em>Another World</em>), and <em>Flashback</em>, and you'll be roughly in the right ballpark.</p><p>The game will blend exploration with "fluid movement and fast, responsive combat" in which you'll use both melee and ranged options to take down your enemies.</p>
<p>Thunderful Publishing will no doubt be hoping that <em>Replaced </em>is a hit; recently, the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/coatsink-layoffs-half-workforce" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="dcff6b51-8929-4c5a-be4c-7c30472c88e2" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">laid off half of the workforce</a> at subsidiary Coatsink, and it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/thunderful-layoffs-development" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bf6695fa-ab97-46be-9d58-8cb656c8713e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">hasn't exactly had</a> the most <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/thunderful-closes-studio-financials" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fd190875-f6e6-478f-9ed2-35e6192ff578" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">secure eighteen months or so</a> either.</p><p>In any case, <em>Replaced </em>will arrive on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1663850/REPLACED/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/replaced/9mz1c8d26b7h" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a> on March 12th. It'll also be on Xbox Game Pass on day one (although only for certain tiers since <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-tiers-reworked-2025" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="795e0fac-68cc-49c8-9d89-14648af21c55" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">the service's rework earlier this year</a>).</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <guid>1373074</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Spry Fox, the studio behind cozy games like <em>Cozy Grove </em>(the clue's in the name, I suppose) and <em>Spirit Crossing</em>, has been sold back to its original owners by now-former parent company Netflix.</p><p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netflix-sells-game-studio-spry-fox" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Game File</a>, the sale of Spry Fox is part of an ongoing effort on Netflix's part to reconfigure and reassess its gaming division, an operation that has already seen <em>Squid Game: Unleashed</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/boss-fight-entertainment-netflix-shutdown" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9711bede-314c-4ee1-8135-fe8d85504170" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Boss Fight Entertainment closed down</a>, along with a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-team-blue-shut-down-report" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c5effee2-78cf-4130-87e2-24dccd22c939" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">star-studded internal studio full of industry veterans</a>.</p><p>Unlike Boss Fight and the mooted Team Blue, however, Spry Fox hasn't been closed; rather, it's been sold back to Daniel Cook and David Edery, and will remain operational as an independent studio, according to Game File's report.</p><figure role="group">

<p>Edery told Game File that his studio is "grateful" for its time under the auspices of Netflix, which will still publish <em>Spirit Crossing </em>on mobile. The studio will, however, be free to ask other publishers to take the game on for other platforms, which Edery says is "truly the best thing" for the project.</p><p>Netflix isn't the only streaming giant to be taking a long, hard look at its role in the gaming industry. Back in October, Amazon <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazon-luna-rework-later-this-year" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a4199f9c-3f78-478b-b2f3-b566d7133e1b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">announced a major overhaul</a> to its Luna streaming service, which involved a refocusing on party games and smartphone-based play.</p><p>The retail giant also revealed that it would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-world-development-ending-amazon-layoffs" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="96fc63cd-c591-42ec-8af0-59f8445fa07b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">end development on MMORPG <em>New World</em></a>, with several staffers in Amazon's gaming division also losing their jobs as a result of that decision.</p>
<p>Spry Fox's split from Netflix doesn't seem to have affected the studio's plans in the near term; <em>Spirit Crossing </em>is still in development, and <em>Cozy Grove </em>remains available <a href="https://cozygrovegame.com/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">across PC and consoles</a>, with versions of <em>Spirit Crossing </em>for those platforms also seemingly in the works. Stay tuned for more on this.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
