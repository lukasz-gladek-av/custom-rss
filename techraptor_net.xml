            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/midnight-society-shutdown-dr-disrespect<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Dr. Disrespect's former studio Midnight Society has announced that it's closing down, which presumably also means that work on first-person extraction shooter&nbsp;<em>Deadrop&nbsp;</em>will also come to an end.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/12am/status/1885061680398213160" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">notice</a> on X, Midnight Society says it's "closing its doors after three incredible years", which also means that its "amazing team of over 55 developers" are now looking for work. The studio says it's "actively seeking other game studios" to provide those employment opportunities.</p>

<p>Although Midnight Society doesn't explicitly say that&nbsp;<em>Deadrop&nbsp;</em>has been canceled, it's unlikely that work on the game will continue; that would require another studio to pick up the slack or for Midnight Society members to form a new outfit, and there's no indication that will happen, so it looks like the game is, er, dead.</p>

<p>The studio's first project,&nbsp;<em>Deadrop</em>, was revealed under the codename&nbsp;<em>Project Moon</em>, and the studio said back in 2022 that it would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/drdisrepects-game-studio-wants-player-feedback-every-6-weeks" rel="nofollow">collect user feedback on a regular basis</a>, using it to shape the direction of the game.</p>

<p>In June, however, Dr. Disrespect <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dr-disrespect-fired-midnight-society-sexting-minor" rel="nofollow">was fired</a> from Midnight Society following allegations of sexual misconduct, which were apparently part of the reason for the content creator's lifetime Twitch ban in 2020.</p>

<p>His YouTube channel was also demonetized, although YouTube recently <a href="https://kotaku.com/drdisrespect-twitch-ban-minor-youtube-monetization-1851752083" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reversed that decision</a>, allowing Dr. Disrespect (real name Guy Beahm) to continue to make money through his channel.</p>




<p>Following Beahm's ousting from Midnight Society, the studio was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/midnight-society-deadrop-layoffs-dr-disrespect" rel="nofollow">hit by layoffs</a>&nbsp;back in September, with one of&nbsp;<em>Deadrop</em>'s Founders (essentially a major contributor to the studio rather than an actual founder) claiming that around 50% of the studio's workforce was let go. It looks like now we know why.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/killing-floor-3-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Tripwire Interactive has announced the&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</em>release date, so get ready to start slaying some zeds come springtime.</p>

<p>Per a press release, the third installment in the studio's&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor&nbsp;</em>series will launch on March 25th across PC and current-gen consoles, and pre-orders are open now if you already know you're going to be playing this one on day one.</p>

<p>Several versions of the game will be available at launch, and pre-ordering any of them will net you a bonus that includes a weapon skin, a trinket, and a player card. Of course, you'll get a bunch of extra goodies if you order any of the non-standard editions as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/killing-floor-3-release-date-giant-zed.jpg?itok=aNSyQFki 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/killing-floor-3-release-date-giant-zed.jpg?itok=tlyplPpP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</em>launches in March.</figcaption></figure><p>If you pick&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</em>up at retail, you'll be able to get the Standard Edition in North America or the Day One Edition outside of that territory. The latter comes with the Flatline Tactical Bundle and a special skin pack, while the former either comes with the skin pack or the bundle (and costs a little less into the bargain).</p>

<p>As for digital editions, you will,óf course, be able to buy the game on its own, but you'll also be able to pick up the Deluxe and Elite Nightfall Editions, which pack in a bunch of extras and some Creds to go along with them.</p>

<p>If you want to check out <i>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</i>before it's released, you can still <a href="https://killingfloor3.com/#signup" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">gain access</a> to the game's closed beta, which runs from February 20th to 24th. You can check out the trailer below to learn more about that.</p>




<p>If you're wondering what&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</em>is, it's a multiplayer FPS that serves as the third installment in the&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor&nbsp;</em>franchise. It takes place 70 years after the events of the second game and once again sees you teaming up with your buddies to fight off waves of hostile "zeds" (read: zombies, but with qualifications).</p>

<p><em>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</em>is set to launch for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1430190/Killing_Floor_3/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/killing-floor-3/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/killing-floor-3/9pfzlckhc1vm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on March 25th.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[N64 Classic Ridge Racer 64 Comes to Nintendo Switch Online]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ridge-racer-64-nintendo-switch-online</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/n64-classic-ridge-racer-64-comes-to-nintendo-switch-online.1096839/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ridge-racer-64-nintendo-switch-online<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced another N64 classic for Nintendo Switch Online, and this one's perfect if you're a fan of retro racing games.</p>

<p>Today's new Switch Online addition is&nbsp;<em>Ridge Racer 64</em>, and just like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-banjo-tooie" rel="nofollow">other</a> N64 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-n64-halloween" rel="nofollow">games</a> on the service, you're going to need an Expansion Pack addon if you want to play it.</p>

<p>As a reminder, the basic Nintendo Switch Online subscription will get you access to the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-january-2025" rel="nofollow">SNES</a> and NES games, as well as Game Boy classics, but you'll need to fork out a little extra if you want N64, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-genesis-november-2024" rel="nofollow">Genesis</a>, and Game Boy Advance games (as well as DLC for a couple of Switch games).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-online-ridge-racer-64-car.jpg?itok=ly6uTtsP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-online-ridge-racer-64-car.jpg?itok=ZEyywH0G 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Ridge Racer 64&nbsp;</em>is yours to check out on Switch Online, assuming you have an Expansion Pack.</figcaption></figure><p>As for&nbsp;<em>Ridge Racer 64&nbsp;</em>itself, it was first released in 2000, and it's the series' first foray outside of PlayStation (not counting arcade versions, of course). Unusually, it's also one of the only times Nintendo itself has worked on an IP that isn't its own.</p>

<p>The game received a DS port in 2004, but obviously, it's the N64 version you'll be getting here, complete with its full track complement and range of unlockable extra cars.</p>

<p>You can also enjoy local multiplayer with up to three friends, as well as several different gameplay modes including Grand Prix, Quick Play, and special modes like Time Attack and Car Attack.</p>

<p>If you want to know what you're getting into when you play&nbsp;<em>Ridge Racer 64</em>, you can check out Nintendo's new trailer for the game on Switch Online right here.</p>




<p>Nintendo is currently gearing up for the impending launch of the Switch 2, having <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">announced the console</a> earlier this month.</p>

<p>We don't know when it's releasing yet, but we do know that the Switch Online service will continue to be available on Switch 2, so it's likely that the current console's retro game lineup will also be accessible on the new machine.</p>

<p><em>Ridge Racer 64&nbsp;</em>is available right now for Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack holders.</p>
