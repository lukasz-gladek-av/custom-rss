            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/inzoi-release-date-delayed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Krafton has announced the Early Access release date for its upcoming life sim&nbsp;<em>inZoi</em>, but there's some bad news if you were hoping for the game to launch in 2024.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1162040845181124618/1207578601008926791/1303969784550920273" rel="noopener" target="_blank">message on the game's official Discord server</a>, director Hyungjun Kim, also known as "Kjun", announces that the&nbsp;<em>inZoi&nbsp;</em>release date is March 28th. He then apologizes that the team wasn't able to "bring you the game sooner", but that the delay is necessary to give&nbsp;<em>inZoi&nbsp;</em>"the best possible start".</p>

<p>Kjun goes on to say that the response to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sims-like-inzoi-character-creator-tool">its character creator test</a>, as well as its trial of user-generated content platform Canvas, was "amazing", and that seeing "such engagement" led the team to realize the responsibility it has to "provide players with the most complete experience possible".</p>

<p>When it does arrive,&nbsp;<em>inZoi&nbsp;</em>will be one of a rapidly-dwindling handful of competitors to EA's titanic&nbsp;<em>The Sims</em>, which essentially currently stands unopposed in its niche (and which isn't going to be getting <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sims-like-inzoi-character-creator-tool">a new numbered mainline entry</a> any time soon).</p>

<p>Paradox was working on a&nbsp;<em>Sims</em>&nbsp;competitor by the name of&nbsp;<em>Life by You</em>, but the game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/life-by-you-paradoxs-sims-competitor-has-been-cancelled">canceled back in June</a>, causing the studio's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paradox-profits-life-by-you-canceled">profits to nosedive</a>&nbsp;as a result.</p>

<p>Perhaps the only other major rival to&nbsp;<em>The Sims&nbsp;</em>that's currently in development is&nbsp;<em>Paralives</em>, which is currently scheduled for an Early Access release sometime next year as well (assuming it doesn't get delayed, of course).</p>

<p><em>inZoi&nbsp;</em>is due to land on PC via Steam Early Access on March 28th. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2456740/inZOI/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wishlist it here</a> if you want to keep up with its progress.</p>
