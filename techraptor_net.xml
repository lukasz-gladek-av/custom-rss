            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Stories about artificial intelligence aren’t a new phenomenon, but they’re increasingly relevant in relation to the real world.<em> D-topia</em>, a new game in development by Marumittu Games and published by Annapurna Interactive, looks to bridge their own take on an AI world with a gentle-paced puzzle adventure.</p>

<p>In <em>D-topia</em>, you take on the role of a Facilitator, whose job is to keep the residents of D-topia happy and the facility running as it should, as part of a project known as Utopia. We had a chance to check out a short demo that introduces us to this world, as well as what to expect in terms of puzzle-solving and the adventure aspect.</p>

<p>The demo opens with the newly minted character, known in the world as No. 046. From the jump, we can see that the world of <em>D-topia</em> is very clean and minimalistic – certainly by design.</p>

It’s an apartment of sorts that can be explored and used as a place for easy-going life-sim moments. For example, food is provided, so it’s appropriate to eat. No. 046 can check today’s weather and then prepare to leave by washing up.</p>

<p>Once that’s done, it’s time for No. 046 to fulfill their role as the newest Facilitator, so it’s off to the factory. On the way, he can talk to the numerous bystanders scattered around, who have plenty of positive things to say about D-topia.</p>

<p>The work component involves solving a series of puzzles, and the ones in the demo seemed straightforward enough. Most of them involve moving numbered blocks to their marked endpoints. For example, blocks marked 1 and 2 need to be dragged to the 1 and 2 labeled on the field.</p>

<p>These puzzles do get more complex as No. 046 completes each one – some involve passing through a barrier that increases the number, or some involve having to move a block to keep down barriers and figure out how the correct blocks need to move across the board.</p>

Solving each puzzle earns points, which then turns into the currency earned for the day.</p>

<p>After work, No. 046 is afforded some leisure time, so it’s worth exploring around D-topia. He runs into a curious character named Eebie, who drops his a memory card and skates away. No. 046 can choose to pursue him and learn a little more about them.</p>

<p>During this encounter, there’s a bit of a disturbance, and No. 046 is able to enter a nearby shop to see what’s going on. As the Facilitator, he learns from the shop manager that there’s a malfunctioning robot that needs attention, and can be investigated by interacting with a panel that triggers the Block Side.</p>

<p>By completing this particular task, he earns some plants that can be decorated in his room. The demo wraps up here, but not without some mysterious dialogue that suggests No. 046 is going off-key, that he needs to be investigated.</p>

<p>So while time with <em>D-topia</em> was short, it was just enough to get a taste of what this AI-based world is all about and how small decisions move the adventure forward. With its cute art style and soothing music similar to Annapurna's own <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/stray-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Stray</em></a>, it’s easy to see <em>D-topia</em> as the type of game to relax and vibe with when it comes out in 2026.</p>
