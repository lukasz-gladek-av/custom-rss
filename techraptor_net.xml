The&nbsp;Lunar Frontier Authority is simply trying to make a better life for everyone amongst the stars. Of course, there's profit to be made, but that simply funds future endeavors. The hackers want to hold the moon to ransom, and not just the moon, but the entire power grid on it. You need to stop it. I want you to throw everything at them, make them wish they'd never tested us. Welcome to the Line of Fire, Burnt Moon.</i></p>

<p><em>Line of Fire Burnt Moon</em> is a new deck-building lane battler from Osprey Games. We've covered the full range of their <em>Undaunted</em> series on the site, from the recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/undaunted-2200-callisto-old-mechanics-new-tricks" rel="nofollow"><em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto</em></a>&nbsp;to the original <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/undaunted-normandy-north-africa-and-reinforcements-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Undaunted Normandy.</em></a></p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/line-of-fire-burnt-moon-4.jpg?itok=4uFZhHV1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/line-of-fire-burnt-moon-4.jpg?itok=Ov5S5dG4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Line of Fire Burnt Moon</em> includes 4 different types of units.</figcaption></figure><h2>Send In The Drones</h2>

<p><i>Line of Fire Burnt Moon&nbsp;</i>is listed as a card game, deck-building lane battler. It uses some mechanics from the awesome <em>Undaunted</em> series, but in a more compact package. It takes place in the same setting as <em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto</em>, with the LFA batting a group of hackers, rather than a group of protesting miners.</p>

<p><em>Line of Fire Burnt Moon</em> keeps the deck-building elements, action, and damage elements of <em>Undaunted</em>, meaning that you play each turn using the cards in your hand. 1 card is played each turn for its initiative value, and the remaining 3 are used for actions, either to place a drone on one of the 5 lanes, activate a drone already in a lane that matches the card being played, or gain an effect from a personnel card.</p>

<p>When a unit is damaged in <em>Line of Fire</em>, as with <em>Undaunted</em>, you remove a matching card from your hand, discard pile, deck, or board in that order, meaning that taking damage also affects your ability to activate a unit in the future, possibly that turn. You start the game with a set deck, and certain cards allow you to draw from your supply to your discard pile, waiting for your current deck to run out so they can be shuffled in. This allows you to tailor your deck as you play, drawing in the units that will be the most useful to you.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/line-of-fire-burnt-moon-3.jpg?itok=v0embd7Y 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/line-of-fire-burnt-moon-3.jpg?itok=PVnup-bp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Rather than on a game board,&nbsp;<em>Line of Fire Burnt Moon</em> takes place in lanes.</figcaption></figure><h2>Pick A Lane</h2>

<p>The deck-building elements are where the similarities to <em>Undaunted</em> end. Rather than taking place on a map with tokens, each player has 5 lanes that they are trying to control. <em>Line of Fire</em> is won when either player has 8 control points on the 5 lanes, or if their opponent has no MOSS-type units on the board. This changes the style of play from <em>Undaunted</em> dramatically, removing the strategic movement of the map and replacing it with lane control. This makes the board space a lot more compact for <em>Line of Fire</em>, but also means that you're going to be in your opponent's face, right from the start.</p>

<p>This immediacy has an effect on game length too, and games of <em>Line of Fire</em> can be extremely fast compared to <em>Undaunted</em>. There's also no randomness in the attacks, with attack and defence values fixed to the units and zone, and modified by controlling the zone, having certain types of units in the lane, and having fortifications present. This means that you always know in advance if your attack will be successful or not, and puts a focus on the activation order that you will take each round.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/line-of-fire-burnt-moon-6.jpg?itok=sJ9L5-sI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/line-of-fire-burnt-moon-6.jpg?itok=b8cNX7S_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Lanes in&nbsp;<em>Line of Fire Burnt Moon </em>can be controlled, and have fortifications built and destroyed on them.</figcaption></figure><h2>Choose a Side</h2>

<p><em>Line of Fire Burnt Moon</em> has 2 different factions, the corporate LFA and the POSIWID hackers. They both come with identical decks and a set of 5 identical lanes and are identified by unique artwork and the icon colors (blue for the LFA and pink for POSIWID). I initially felt like I wanted a difference in the forces, the different troop types in <em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto</em> gave each force a unique feel, but after a few games, the tighness of play and the ability to tailor your deck as you play means that an initial deviation in forces could have a signification impact on balance.</p>

<p>The short length of <em>Line of Fire</em> games means that every turn counts, and poor draws can have a big impact. There's a balance to be found in going first (which is a big advantage as you can decimate your opponents' turn by removing cards from their hand), with high initiative cards usually having the best abilities, and once used for initiative, they can't be used that round, and saving that card for a big effect, if you get a chance to after your opponents turn.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/line-of-fire-burnt-moon-2.jpg?itok=1hCytoQo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/line-of-fire-burnt-moon-2.jpg?itok=5Bc5CWl2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I'm a huge fan of how compact and tidy the&nbsp;<em>Line of Fire Burnt Moon </em>components are.</figcaption></figure><p>The game length also means that if you are decimated, draw poorly, or make some bad supply draw choices, the game is usually over quickly, and you can jump straight back into another game. The quick setup and play also mean that you don't get heavily invested in a game, and losing and starting again isn't as painful as an evening-long strategic masterpiece.</p>

<p>It's also worth noting how well all the components fit together in the small box. Both forces have their own colored box to keep them separate, which also fits the fortifications and site tiles. The only other components are an initiative card, 4 player aid cards, and two tiny rulebooks, which makes the components as tight, clean, and compact as the table space it takes up, and the gameplay itself.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/line-of-fire-burnt-moon-5.jpg?itok=rZpqeI_B 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/line-of-fire-burnt-moon-5.jpg?itok=ADbaJq6Q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Personel cards in&nbsp;<em>Line of Fire Burnt Moon </em>have an ingame effect but aren't played into the lanes.</figcaption></figure><h2>Line of Fire Burnt Moon Final Thoughts?</h2>

<p>My first thought was, 'Why is it not called <em>Undaunted</em>? I love <em>Undaunted</em> and this is <em>Undaunted</em>, right?' But I think that the <em>Line of Fire</em> name makes it clear that while there are <em>Undaunted</em> elements, this is new, and while players of <em>Undaunted</em> will feel comfortable, players who find <em>Undaunted</em> too complex, random, or too large on the tabletop shouldn't approach this expecting any of those things.</p>

<p><em>Line of Fire Burnt Moon</em> has gameplay as light and tight as the components that fit perfectly into the small box, but gameplay that well outgrows the small package. Games are fast and can be brutal, but the small play time means that if your opponent decimates you, you can get right back in for another quick game. The deck-building element means that small changes can have a big impact (good or bad), but the short game lengths mean that poor picks won't affect you for long. Players who like long-term deck-building strategy won't find it here, but players looking for a quick and sharp deck builder will love it.</p>

But every adventure, no matter how great, deserves a second season (or more)! Which is why we're thrilled to preview <em>The Mandalorian Adventures - Clan of Two</em>, which the fine folks at <a href="https://unexpectedgames.com/clanoftwo" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Unexpected Games</a> (via distributor <a href="https://store.asmodee.com/products/the-mandalorian-adventures-clan-of-two-expansion" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Asmodee USA</a>) sent along a copy of for us to check out!</p>



<p><em>The Mandalorian Adventures - Clan of Two</em>&nbsp;is an expansion to&nbsp;<em>The Mandalorian Adventures</em>, inspired by events taking place in the second season of&nbsp;<em>The Mandalorian</em>. With new heroes to play as and new missions to tackle, this great expands the base game - but, be warned,&nbsp;<strong>you need the base game to be able to play&nbsp;<em>The Mandalorian Adventures - Clan of Two</em>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Box Contents Include:</strong></p>

<ul><li>1 Rulebook</li>
	<li>1 Mission Book</li>
	<li>95 Cards (Including 4 New Heroes)</li>
	<li>18 Mini Cards</li>
	<li>137 Tokens</li>
	<li>4 Standees</li>
	<li>2 Mercenary Mission Sheets (Double-Sided)</li>
</ul><h2>What New Heroes Are Included In&nbsp;<em>The Mandalorian Adventures - Clan of Two?</em></h2>

<p>There are four new heroes included in&nbsp;<em>The Mandalorian Adventures - Clan of Two&nbsp;</em>that you can play as with both these expansion missions and the missions included in the core game. These include: the exiled Jedi Ahsoka Tano, famed bounty hunter Boba Fett, Mandalorian heiress Bo-Katan Kryze, and master assassin and sharpshooter&nbsp;Fennec Shand.</p>

<p>Each of these characters also have new persistent character abilities, changing how they play and making them feel wholly unique compared to the characters contained in the core box. Let's take a look hero by hero and chat briefly about their abilities!</p>

<h3>Ahsoka Tano</h3>
<p>Ahsoka Tano's hero card may seem like it comes with a major drawback - she can only attack enemies within the same space as her? But along with it perfectly fitting her flavor (she is, after all, a lightsaber wielder), but with her "Shoto Lightsaber" card shown above (of which she has two in her deck), she could potentially dish out 6 damage!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-mandalorian-adventures-clan-of-two-ahsoka-cards.jpg?itok=Q2W_Sk7R 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-mandalorian-adventures-clan-of-two-ahsoka-cards.jpg?itok=zK4iBW8Q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ahsoka's cards keep her very free-wheeling and float-y around the battlefield, just like a Jedi!</figcaption></figure><h3>Boba Fett</h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-mandalorian-adventures-clan-of-two-boba-fett.jpg?itok=HVgHcCQo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-mandalorian-adventures-clan-of-two-boba-fett.jpg?itok=wqQ4FR6L 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Everyone's favorite bounty hunter Boba Fett blasts onto the scene with the persistent character ability you see above, allowing him to attack twice in a turn (as long as there aren't too many other cards in the action slot). Another great ability that gives you a huge benefit while also making you think carefully about how you play!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-mandalorian-adventures-clan-of-two-boba-cards.jpg?itok=Ew8KNleG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-mandalorian-adventures-clan-of-two-boba-cards.jpg?itok=qsEjwT9z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Boba Fett is, as expected, extremely combat focused, with cards that help you mitigate his character ability's downside of strength restriction in action spaces.</figcaption></figure><h3>Bo-Katan</h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-mandalorian-adventures-clan-of-two-bo-katan.jpg?itok=C6SBbUou 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-mandalorian-adventures-clan-of-two-bo-katan.jpg?itok=zasn13Pp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Bo-Katan is the most unique of any hero we've seen come to the game, as her persistent character ability says that she has to keep the top card of her skill deck faceup! This is a very fun mechanic, leading to a lot of shenanigans with trying to manipulate your skill deck to get the most out of her every turn, while giving you a bit of extra info you wouldn't normally know.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-mandalorian-adventures-clan-of-two-bo-katan-cards.jpg?itok=ma0w-DqC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-mandalorian-adventures-clan-of-two-bo-katan-cards.jpg?itok=iycHl-mv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bo-Katan's cards truly focus on her ability to use and manipulate her skill deck, and is one of the trickier (but more satisfying) characters to play.</figcaption></figure><h3>Fennec Shand</h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-mandalorian-adventures-clan-of-two-fennec-shand.jpg?itok=zDQlndW2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-mandalorian-adventures-clan-of-two-fennec-shand.jpg?itok=8fGyMqfS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Fennec Shand is an unparalleled sniper in the&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em>&nbsp;universe, and her ability to increase the range of her attack by one (at the cost of one strength) will make her close some pretty incredible distances in the game. Remember, three spaces can often feel like half the board when you're winding around the map!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-mandalorian-adventures-clan-of-two-fennec-cards.jpg?itok=d3eYZN8o 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-mandalorian-adventures-clan-of-two-fennec-cards.jpg?itok=FoJzAakf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Fennec is especially good at keeping enemy forces reined in and pinging out damage around the board.</figcaption></figure><h2>What Are The New Missions Like In&nbsp;<em>The Mandalorian Adventures - Clan of Two?</em></h2>

<p>The new missions in&nbsp;<em>The Mandalorian Adventures - Clan of Two</em>&nbsp;break the mold from the original game in fun and challenging ways, while providing a diverse set of challenges and maps that require different plans of attack! I don't want to spoil too much (that's part of the fun of playing&nbsp;<em>The Mandalorian Adventures</em>), so I'll stick with showing off and describing a bit about the first of the four missions in this expansion, which recreates the thrilling fight against the warlord Morgan Elsbeth on Calodan.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-mandalorian-adventures-clan-of-two-map-mission.jpg?itok=70oggOCw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-mandalorian-adventures-clan-of-two-map-mission.jpg?itok=IWmXa5bM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This first mission really feels like a race against time, as each time you trigger the 6+ space you'll be advancing the power track - this increases the hit points on Morgan Elsbeth, who you'll need to flush out&nbsp;<em>after</em>&nbsp;saving three different prisoners. It's a tough one, right out the gate, and introduces enemies with new abilities.</p>

<p>Along with the four core missions, there are also two new mercenary missions included in this expansion - and it all goes together to form what seems to me to be an extremely strong expansion. It's more of what we loved about&nbsp;<em>The Mandalorian Adventures</em>, but the abilities on these four new heroes feel&nbsp;<em>extremely</em>&nbsp;different!</p>

<p>With an MSRP at $39.99, this feels like a perfect addition if you've played through and explored all that the original&nbsp;<em>Mandalorian Adventures</em>&nbsp;had to offer. Hitting shelves everywhere Friday, June 6th!</p>
