            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Shenmue&nbsp;</em>auteur Yu Suzuki and his studio Ys Net have announced&nbsp;<em>Shenmue III Enhanced</em>, a...well...enhanced re-release of&nbsp;<em>Shenmue III&nbsp;</em>that brings visual and gameplay improvements aplenty.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/shenmue-iii-enhanced-announced-for-ps5-xbox-series-nintendo-and-pc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gematsu</a>,&nbsp;<em>Shenmue III Enhanced&nbsp;</em>is slated for release on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and "Nintendo" at some point in the future. No release date was revealed, and it's not specified whether "Nintendo" refers to both Switch 2 and the original Switch or just one of the two.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Shenmue III Enhanced&nbsp;</em>will bring improved visuals and performance, complete with 4K textures, support for DLSS and FSR on PC, and increased NPC density to help Niaowu feel "more alive with more characters populating the streets".</p>

Ys Net is also promising gameplay tweaks, including a new "classic" camera mode that brings&nbsp;<em>Shenmue III</em>'s gameplay perspective closer to that of its predecessors.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to stamina system adjustments, Ryo's health being restored before fights, and "reduced money barriers for smoother progression", as well as the opportunity to skip certain cutscenes and conversations.</p>

<p>All of the gameplay improvements promised by&nbsp;<em>Shenmue III&nbsp;</em>can be switched off if you want the original gameplay experience, though, so if you just want to enjoy the game with its new and improved visuals, you can do that as well.</p>

<p>If you missed out on&nbsp;<em>Shenmue III&nbsp;</em>the first time, it's the long-awaited sequel to 2001's&nbsp;<em>Shenmue II</em>. Launching <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shenmue-iii-release-date-delayed-three-months-to-november" rel="nofollow">eighteen years after that game</a>, it continues the story of protagonist Ryo Hazuki, who's on the hunt for his father's murderer.</p>




<p>Many of&nbsp;<em>Shenmue III Enhanced</em>'s additions have seemingly been introduced to combat much of the criticism of the original game, including its slow pace, gated money grinds, and frustrating combat.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has released a new&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 2042&nbsp;</em>update in preparation for the release of&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>later this year, and it's packed with stuff, including a new map, new weapons, and more.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1957412193198100646" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">social media post</a>, this latest&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 2042&nbsp;</em>update is intended to be one of the first steps on "the road to&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>", which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-6-revealed-release-date-october-maybe" rel="nofollow">due to launch in October</a>&nbsp;(and which, mercifully enough, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-6-no-80-pricing" rel="nofollow">won't cost you $80</a>).</p>

<p>The first big thing you're getting in this update is a new map in the form of Iwo Jima, which was, as EA says, "a fan favorite previously seen in&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 1942</em>,&nbsp;<em>1943</em>, and&nbsp;<em>V</em>".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-2042-update-iwo-jima.jpg?itok=9n-zLMWZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-2042-update-iwo-jima.jpg?itok=hU59xsQr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Battlefield 2042</em>'s latest update is bringing a brand new map, plus more.</figcaption></figure><p>The new version of the map is a "reimagined" space that EA says will "give you plenty of options to flex your tactical muscles", and it comes complete with an "active volcano" that you'll have to watch out for as well.</p>

<p>As well as Iwo Jima, you can also look forward to two new weapons in the form of the KFS2000 assault rifle and the Lynx sniper rifle.</p>

<p>The former is a "highly accurate" rifle that's also easy to control, and the latter is a "vicious semi-automatic anti-material rifle" that will be given to players who joined&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>'s open beta. If you didn't, however, you'll still get a chance to get this weapon "later down the line".</p>

<p>Two new vehicles are also being added: the A10 Warthog and the SU-25TM Frogfoot, both of which are attack jets that will be available in All-Out Warfare. They'll join a free battle pass that comes complete with 60 tiers of cosmetics to earn.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-2042-update-a10-warthog.jpg?itok=0DNJpXCB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-2042-update-a10-warthog.jpg?itok=QxiMk7zV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Battlefield 2042</em>'s Warthog is very different to&nbsp;<em>Halo</em>'s.</figcaption></figure><p>Completing some of the new battle pass' tiers will also grant you access to exclusive&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>rewards, so if you're intending to play the new game, it's worth dipping back into&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 2042</em>&nbsp;to bolster your cosmetic haul.</p>

<p><em>Battlefield 2042&nbsp;</em>is available now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1517290/Battlefield_2042/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/battlefield-2042/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/battlefield-2042-xbox-series-xs/9p0t51bddwvt" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>, meanwhile, is due for launch across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2807960/Battlefield_6/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/battlefield-6/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/battlefield-6-standard-edition/9pjxv87jtsvq" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on October 10th, and you can read our Erren's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/battlefield-6-multiplayer-preview-good-company" rel="nofollow">preview of it here</a>.</p>
