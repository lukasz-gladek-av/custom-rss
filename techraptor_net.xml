            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-sales-one-million<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher GSC Game World has announced that&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>sales have already crossed a big milestone, and the game has only been on release for two days.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/4455843903878201787" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam announcement</a>, a million copies of&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>have been sold since the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-delayed-once-again-november" rel="nofollow">launched on Wednesday</a>, a feat for which GSC Game World thanks the players who've already bought&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>.</p>

<p>The game's sales achievement is even more impressive when considering that it was a day-one Xbox Game Pass release as well, which means that a million players have bought&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>in addition to those who've checked it out as part of Microsoft's subscription service.</p>

Its Steam reviews are <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">broadly positive at time of writing</a>, but even many of those who recommend the game acknowledge that it's got more than its fair share of bugs (or "anomalies", if you will).</p>

<p>Speaking <a href="https://x.com/stalker_thegame/status/1859265478276894856" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on X (formerly Twitter) on Wednesday</a>, GSC Game World acknowledged that&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>has some "rough edges", but that hotfixes to correct some of the game's most egregious bugs are on the way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following those fixes, the development team has pledged to release larger updates that will include extra content for&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>, with a roadmap for the game on its way in December.</p>




<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>, it's the second mainline entry in GSC Game World's&nbsp;<em>Stalker&nbsp;</em>series, which combines open-world RPG-inflected gameplay with a non-linear, hands-off approach to exploration and combat.</p>

<p>The game has had a long and troubled development history; it was first revealed in 2010 before numerous delays and studio troubles saw the game shelved for a number of years.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>was then <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-heart-of-chernobyl-release-date-announced" rel="nofollow">reintroduced at E3 2021</a>&nbsp;with an intended April 2022 release date, although that was naturally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/post-apocalyptic-shooter-stalker-2-delayed-until-december" rel="nofollow">pushed back</a> several times. The invasion of Ukraine by Russia in early 2022 also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-developer-reportedly-leaving-ukraine" rel="nofollow">significantly impacted development</a> for GSC Game World, which is based in the besieged country.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/stalker-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and it's also available as part of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/all-confirmed-xbox-game-pass-november-2024-games" rel="nofollow">November's Xbox Game Pass lineup</a>.
