<p>The bonus path in question is called Frostfire, and it's launching a week later than the extension update on January 27th. It'll include extra rewards for both the free and paid paths of the Battle Pass.</p><p>You can complete this path alongside the main Season 1 route as well, so you don't need to worry about whether you're accruing XP for one or the other; they'll both progress beside one another.</p><p>Additionally, there won't be any Bonus Challenges for the Frostfire path; unlike previous bonus paths, everything you need to unlock things from Frostfire will be earnable through weekly challenges.</p><p>If you're unfamiliar, <em>Battlefield 6 </em>is the latest entry in the <em>Battlefield </em>series of first-person shooters.
