            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marathon-gameplay-reveal-date-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bungie has announced that it will premiere the first&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>gameplay trailer later this week, following an ARG (alternate reality game) the shooter's community worked together to solve over the weekend.</p>

<p>As revealed in a press release,&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>'s first gameplay trailer will air on Saturday, April 12th at 1pm Eastern (that's 10am Pacific and around 6pm GMT). Bungie says the trailer will contain "gameplay, news, and updates" about <i>Marathon</i>.</p>

<p>Whether or not a release date, or even a release window, for the game will appear remains to be seen. Bungie's&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>reboot was first revealed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-resurrects-marathon-playstation-showcase" rel="nofollow">all the way back in May 2023</a>, and after explaining the basic concepts of the extraction shooter <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/learn-what-marathon-is-all-about-in-new-video-from-bungie" rel="nofollow">in a followup video</a>, Bungie said it would go dark for "an extended period" to develop the game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marathon-gameplay-reveal-date-cat.jpg?itok=wrCIF9JL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marathon-gameplay-reveal-date-cat.jpg?itok=3PYUD971 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bungie's&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>gameplay reveal confirmation was characteristically odd.</figcaption></figure><p>Setting up an alternate reality game for a&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>reveal feels particularly appropriate given the esoteric nature of the original games' storytelling, so perhaps this is a signal that the new&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>intends to keep at least some of the narrative direction of its 90s forebears.</p>

<p>Reportedly, the new&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>has been experiencing something of a troubled production.</p>

<p>Not only has Bungie been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/destiny-2-developer-bungie-suffers-layoffs-among-reported-delays-for-final-shape-and" rel="nofollow">hit by layoffs</a>&nbsp;on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-layoffs-200-employees" rel="nofollow">more than one occasion</a> over the past couple of years, but&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>director Christopher Barrett was reportedly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marathon-director-fired-report-bungie" rel="nofollow">fired from the game in spring 2024</a>, a decision Barrett subsequently challenged in a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-christopher-barrett-lawsuit-evidence" rel="nofollow">lawsuit aimed at Sony</a>.</p>

<p>Amidst this turmoil, Bungie has always maintained that work on&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>continues apace, and it looks like we're about to see what the studio has been up to for the last couple of years.</p>




<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>, it's an extraction shooter in which players must scour the planet of Tau Ceti IV for loot while "exploring the lost colony that once inhabited the surface".</p>

<p>The game is a pseudo-reboot of the original&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>series, which Bungie developed in the 90s. In many ways, that series is the precursor to&nbsp;<em>Halo</em>&nbsp;(or perhaps that should be the "forerunner"), as it offers similarly elliptical storytelling based around alien civilizations, AI, and other sci-fi concepts.</p>

<p>In any case, we'll get to see what Bungie has been working on when the first&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>gameplay trailer debuts on Saturday, April 12th. Stay tuned for more.</p>
