            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft announced a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-canceled" rel="nofollow">major overhaul plan</a> today, and workers at the video game behemoth are not talking it well.</p><p>The reorganization calls for the cancellation of 6 projects, the delay of 7 others, and perhaps most notably for this story, an additional cost cutting of 200m Euros over the next two years, and they are implementing "acceleration of cost reduction initiatives to rightsize the organization", a phrasing that almost always means layoffs.&nbsp;</p><p>One of France's biggest unions, Solidares Informatique is calling for a half-day strike at Ubisoft Paris tomorrow morning. In their <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/solinfonat.bsky.social/post/3mcxfxwczwk2z" rel="nofollow">post</a> they call the reorganization plan "disastrous announcements" citing the cost-cutting plan, cancellation of projects, and end of remote working. They also issued demands for what they want for the employees:</p><ul><li data-list-item-id="e7737b53e138805cdc82eae6fa08c9855">The end of the cost-cutting plan,</li><li data-list-item-id="e44ef8cd911974bea45cf873a69c267e9">Maintaining and extending the teleworking conditions,</li><li data-list-item-id="eec8f920725ed9fbd9fd1977e4b4738c7">Decent pay raises this year.</li></ul><p>They go onto state that this is merely their initial reaction, and that they are discussing other strikes, presumably for longer periods or at other Ubisoft studios in France.</p><blockquote><p>It is out of the question to let a boss run wild and destroy our working conditions. Perhaps we need to remind him that it is his employees who make the games.</p></blockquote><p>This is the latest bit of difficulty for Ubisoft who is attempting to rebuild following some difficult fiscal periods. Only a couple days ago former <em>Assassin's Creed</em> boss Marc-Alexis Côté announced he was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-assassins-creed-boss-suing-ubisoft" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="da42bb57-e4f1-4a65-91eb-9ce61dfcfee5" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">suing Ubisoft </a>for over $1.3m following his 'constructive dismissal', which caused him to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-boss-leaves-ubisoft-report" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bedd26ab-2db9-443d-9a58-5d57561ce134" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">leave the company in October of 2025</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>That was tied to their organization into 'creative houses' which seems to have been partially done to get investment in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-creative-houses-q1-financials" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="acd9f3a1-9a63-4e42-9b91-122a243964e9" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Vantage Studios</a>, which will be managing Ubisoft's largest three IPs: <em>Assassin's Creed</em>, <em>Far Cry</em>, and <em>Rainbow Six</em>. Ubisoft has also recently closed its Halifax studio after it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-halifax-union" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="22333ad9-7422-4ae5-b9c7-e8c3a1c689d3" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">organized into a union</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-layoffs-massive-stockholm" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4b995302-57da-4b38-b244-d5e338eabf5f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">announced more layoffs </a>at Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft Stockholm last week.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
