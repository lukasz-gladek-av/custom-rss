            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ghost-of-yotei-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and Sucker Punch have announced the&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yōtei</em> release date, and it won't be long until you can check out the studio's sequel to&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>.</p>

<p>Per a new PlayStation Blog <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/23/ghost-of-yotei-comes-to-playstation-5-on-october-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, the game, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ghost-of-yotei-ghost-of-tsushima-followup-2025" rel="nofollow">first announced back in September</a>, will be launching exclusively for PlayStation 5 on October 2nd. If <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ghost-of-tsushima-announced-for-pc-with-nvidia-dlss-3-amd-fsr-3-unlocked-frame-rate-and" rel="nofollow">its predecessor</a> is anything to go by, however, we can probably expect a PC port somewhere down the line as well.</p>

<p>Pre-ordering the game will get you a special in-game mask and a set of PSN avatars, and multiple editions of the game will also be available, each of which comes with its own set of bonuses.</p>

<p>The Collector's Edition, meanwhile, gets you everything in the Digital Deluxe Edition, as well as "a replica display edition of Atsu's Ghost mask", which is made from resin and measures 6.8 by 5 by 5.9 inches.</p>

<p>Not only that, but you'll get a number of other goodies, including a replica sash inscribed with the members of&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yōtei</em>'s villainous Yōtei Six faction, plus a number of other great physical goodies. Sucker Punch&nbsp;says it considers this Collector's Edition "the best Collector's Edition we've ever produced".</p>

<p>All of this was announced alongside a brand new trailer that shows off the aforementioned&nbsp;Yōtei Six faction, as well as giving a couple of new glimpses into the game's world. You can check that trailer out here.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yōtei</em>, it's a followup to Sucker Punch's 2020 game&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>. Taking place over three hundred years after the events of that game,&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yōtei&nbsp;</em>follows Atsu, a woman on a quest to avenge her family against the Yōtei Six.</p>

<p><em>Ghost of Yōtei&nbsp;</em>launches exclusively for <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/ghost-of-yotei/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a> on October 2nd.</p>
