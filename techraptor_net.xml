            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-3m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>developer and publisher Warhorse Studios has announced that its medieval open-world RPG has managed to pass a brand new sales milestone.</p>

<p>Speaking <a href="https://x.com/WarhorseStudios/status/1918999047735857429" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">over the weekend</a>, Warhorse said that&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>sales have reached a rather impressive three million <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-moved-forward" rel="nofollow">in three months</a>, thanking players for "making history" with the studio.</p>

<p>The figure means that sales of the game have slowed down a little since its meteoric beginnings;&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>managed to surpass a million sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-1m" rel="nofollow">in its first day on release</a>, going on to break the two million barrier <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-2m-two-weeks" rel="nofollow">in under two weeks</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-3m-combat.jpg?itok=3tJMmDVY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-3m-combat.jpg?itok=WsDrtQ9j 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>is selling pretty well.</figcaption></figure><p>Even so, three million sales is a pretty impressive figure for what is, in the end, a fairly niche title.&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>places a heavy emphasis on realism rather than traditional RPG fantasy elements, so the fact it's managed to find an audience this wide is no mean feat.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>, it's the sequel to <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/kingdom-come-deliverance" rel="nofollow">the 2018 original</a>. Much like its predecessor, the game is a medieval RPG set in 15th-century Bohemia, and it follows the blacksmith's son Henry of Skalitz as he navigates a web of political and historical intrigue.</p>

<p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>boasts a world twice the size of the original game, and it's also got a script that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-script-words" rel="nofollow">runs to a formidable two million words</a>, according to Warhorse Studios.</p>

<p>Naturally, you'll also find new skills and systems to interact with, as well as an entirely new story to discover and a ton of sidequests to hunt down. If you're into open-ended RPGs, then this one should already be on your radar.</p>




<p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1771300/Kingdom_Come_Deliverance_II/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/9N4W31HSMVVD" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.
