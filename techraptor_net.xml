The game is being directed by former <em>Forza Horizon </em>lead Mike Brown.</p><p>An Amazon spokesperson told Dring that the company has "decided to release Maverick Games from [its] publishing agreement with Amazon Game Studios" as a result of a "strategic evolution to focus on projects that leverage Amazon's unique strengths and scale".</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Maverick Games has been "released" from its publishing agreement with Amazon.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Amazon goes on to say that it has "tremendous respect" for Maverick and its "narrative-led driving experience", and that it hopes Maverick can find a "publishing partner whose strategic priorities are better aligned with bringing [its] game to market".</p><p>For Maverick's part, Sangha and Brown say that they're "grateful" to Amazon for its "partnership and collaboration" and that the studio is currently in "active dialogue with partners who share [its] long-term ambition for the IP". More will apparently be shared later in the year.</p><p>This is the latest in a string of retreats from the gaming industry at large for Amazon. In January, the publisher announced its MMO <em>New World </em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazons-ill-fated-mmo-new-world-to-shut-down-next-year" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fa9fca01-ebe1-4d7d-9d03-0b8eab5c442a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">will shut down in 2027</a>, and just this week, Glowmade announced that its multiplayer dungeon-crawling platformer <em>King of Meat </em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/king-of-meat-shutting-down-in-april" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="702a0256-360f-4752-b32a-fd72f175e8c8" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">is closing its doors in April</a>.</p><p>Amazon also reiterates to Dring and The Game Business that it will continue to focus on streaming service Luna, which got a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazon-luna-rework-later-this-year" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a4199f9c-3f78-478b-b2f3-b566d7133e1b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">major overhaul late last year</a> and which is now geared more towards casual audiences than "core" players.</p><figure role="group">

<h2>Something from Nothing</h2><p><em>Nested Lands</em> is a survival colony sim akin to <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/medieval-dynasty" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6beadf03-42e1-4d12-b5d9-3dc7b07cf7d5" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Medieval Dynasty</em></a>. The game is essentially split into two parts: exploring the land and fighting bandits, and working to build a village of wandering survivors from nothing.</p><p>You won't have much of anything in the opening hours of the game; at best, you can manage to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/nested-lands-crafting-guide-how-to-make-items" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3e542191-86b3-41a2-9d3c-93c58871227b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">craft</a> a stone axe and a stone pickaxe. These two tools will allow you to gather additional wood and stone, both of which can be used to place your first <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/nested-lands-building-guide-village-structures" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="67d03475-9a7a-44ab-8425-d35a404fd97f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">buildings</a> in the village.</p><blockquote><p>There's no easy way to farm, and hunting opportunities are very limited.</p></blockquote><p>As a survival game, you'll need to make sure you get enough food, water, and sleep to keep going; all of the genre staples are here. Water is easy enough to get — your village has a pond nearby — but food is another story. There's no easy way to farm in the early game, and hunting opportunities are very limited.</p><p>It doesn't take long before you realize you'll run out of supplies. That leaves you with only one option remaining: explore the island and hope that you can find something useful.</p><figure role="group">

<h2>Battling Bandits</h2><p>There are nearly two dozen marked points of interest on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/nested-lands-map-guide-quest-item-locations" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6a535f2e-b1b1-4b8f-950d-1256eed05c80" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">the first island map</a> (and quite a few more unmarked locations). Virtually all of these are occupied by at least two or three bandits. (For a plague-covered hellscape, there sure are a lot of people running around.)</p><p>In the early game, your only option is melee combat. You might get lucky by finding a weapon in a container, but odds are you'll only have a makeshift stone knife to fend off enemies. Fortunately, you can almost always grab better (albeit broken) weapons off the corpse of any bandit you kill.</p><p>Most of the static points of interest do not respawn loot; once you've cleared them out, all of those supplies are gone for good. However, random events pop up as you move around the map, and these give you new opportunities to collect more <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/nested-lands-crafting-materials-guide-resource-locations" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="aa76f2fe-9b22-424e-8e09-5c8288868a90" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">crafting materials</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/nested-lands-food-guide-farming-and-hunting" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f93e66ec-fec5-46b7-8f83-3bf6dcf75376" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">food</a>.</p><p>These same random events have a good chance of spawning a caged <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/nested-lands-villager-guide-guards-and-workers" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fdda7fea-49da-4435-a2fa-41c34de01cdf" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">villager</a>. Kill the bandits holding them, and you can invite them to your settlement as long as you have an unoccupied house available. Repeat this process a few more times, and you'll have a bustling community before you know it.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>You can rescue villagers from random encounters that can pop up almost anywhere. Most villagers specialize in a particular profession.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Collecting Resources and Building a Village</h2><p>The survival half of the gameplay in <em>Nested Lands</em> is serviceable enough, but the village management portion of gameplay is pretty unforgiving. In fact, I'd say that the village management system has some serious problems that must be corrected sooner rather than later.</p><p>I've played many survival colony sim games. Typically, the premise of this genre is to manage the logistical challenges of meeting your villagers' needs for food, water, shelter, and so on. This is balanced by the villagers doing work and acting as a force multiplier for your own abilities to gather and craft items.</p><p>Unfortunately, the villagers in <em>Nested Lands</em> aren't very competent. You can have a maximum of 15 villagers; at one point, I had 3 Farmers, 3 Trappers, and a Cook. Despite this, their combined efforts were never enough to produce an adequate food supply for the village.</p><blockquote><p>I've occasionally encountered scenarios in similar games where I'd grow too fast and have some production problems, but Nested Lands was the first one where I could not find a way to make running a village profitable.</p></blockquote><p>Guards are similarly useless. I had 3 Guards at one point, and all of them died during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/nested-lands-raid-defense-guide-protect-village" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ffb29130-7789-483e-a8d7-a87f09347e25" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">a raid</a> despite being equipped with some midrange armor and weaponry. This happened multiple times, forcing me to go out and find more captured people to replace them.</p><p>Eventually, I concluded that there's no way for my village to feed itself or defend itself unless I took the time to gather food every couple of days and kill enemies during every raid. Trees and rocks do not respawn on the first island, so I had to go further and further afield for crafting materials as I went on.</p><p>I also had a serious problem with equipping my villagers with clothes and armor. There's no way to grow Cotton, so I had to spend hours looting every point of interest I could to get enough supplies to equip everyone. It was far too much work to get a 10% happiness boost and avoid a -10% penalty.</p><p>My solution was to reduce my village population to the lowest practical number. I've occasionally encountered scenarios in similar games where I'd grow too fast and have some production problems, but <em>Nested Lands</em> was the first one where I could not find a way to make running a village profitable.</p><figure role="group">

<h2><em>Nested Lands</em> Early Access Preview | Final Thoughts</h2><p>I spent around 86 hours playing <em>Nested Lands</em>. I reached the end of the Early Access build's story, fully upgrading my village and spending the better part of a day trying (and failing) to build a thriving community. I'm all for challenging games, but it got increasingly frustrating as time went on.</p><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/aska" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="dab330ac-4284-4049-a45e-f654eba2a7d9" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Aska</em></a> is a similar game that I had to restart several times after my village failed to thrive; while it was difficult, it felt like I could crack the code and figure out how to survive. I don't feel the same about <em>Nested Lands' </em>Early Access launch version; it appears impossible to run a self-sustaining village.</p><p><em>Nested Lands</em> doesn't feel completely unsalvageable; the game design has good bones, and the setting and story are both intriguing. I think it can develop into a solid entry in the survival colony sim genre once some of the rougher edges have been polished off.</p><p>As it stands today, though, <em>Nested Lands</em> feels far too grindy and frustrating. Instead of feeling challenging, it's more like a grindy mess with some serious flaws in its game design. A village simulator where the village can't ever seem to provide for itself is akin to the world's worst babysitting job.</p><p><em>Nested Lands</em> is worth checking out if you're interested in experimenting with a quirky, deceptively difficult survival colony sim. If you're not a hardcore fan of this genre, though, it's better to wait for some balance updates and some major fixes to the fundamental flaws of this game's design.</p><hr><p><em><strong>Nested Lands</strong></em> was previewed over approximately 86 hours of gameplay on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2553040/Nested_Lands/" rel="nofollow">Steam</a> with a key provided by the publisher.
