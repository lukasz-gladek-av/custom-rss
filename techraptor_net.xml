            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/halo-flashpoint-rise-of-banished-brings-alien-exiles-to-battlefield<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mantic Games' latest expansion for <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/halo-flashpoint-spartan-edition-and-paint-set-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Halo Flashpoint</em></a> is now available for pre-order. <em>Halo Flashpoint Rise of the Banished</em> introduces a new enemy faction to the licensed tabletop miniatures game. The same enemy faction introduced in <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/halo-wars-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Halo Wars 2</em></a>.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://haloflashpoint.manticgames.com/products/rise-of-the-banished-boxed-set/" rel="nofollow">store page</a>, <em>Halo Flashpoint Rise of the Banished</em> will introduce the titular Banished faction into the game. The set will also include Halo Wars 2 antagonist Warmaster Atriox and the army he convinced to defy the doctrines of The Covenant.</p>

It will include eight Jiralhenae (Brute) models, four Sangheili (Elite) models, a limited edition Atriox miniature, brand new terrain pieces, tokens, game cards, sets of dice, and a deluxe playboard.</p>

<p>True to the source material, the Brute miniatures tower over the other miniatures introduced in <em>Halo Flashpoint</em> to this point. Considering the only other miniatures available in the game are Spartans, the difference in size makes a considerable statement.</p>

<p><em>Halo Flashpoint</em> was announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/mantic-partners-with-343-industries-to-create-halo-miniatures-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">in January 2024</a> by Mantic Games. Since its release in November, the UK-based tabletop studio has provided steady support to the game based on Bungie's beloved sci-fi franchise. This support has included several fireteam expansions, a Master Chief miniature, and several map and terrain packs.</p>

<p>Mantic Games' has a respectable catalog of tabletop gaming. Alongside licensed board games based on <em>Hellboy</em>, <em>Invincible</em>, and <em>The Walking Dead</em>, they have produced fast-paced miniatures games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/mantic-games-announces-arena-sports-board-game-overdrive" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Overdrive</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dreadball-core-game-second-edition-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dreadball</em></a>.</p>

<p><em>Halo Flashpoint Rise of the Banished</em> boxed set is available for pre-order now on Mantic Games' web store. It is being sold at an MSRP of $125, not counting shipping, and is expected to ship in July. The miniatures, including the Atriox miniature, will be available shortly after at retailers at an increased MSRP of $212.</p>
