            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I played <em>Guitar Hero 3: Legends of Rock</em> constantly as a kid. I was hopeless using the guitar controller, and even had to use a standard controller. But what I remember most was how it introduced me to so many different songs. It was my first introduction to rock artists like Rage Against the Machine, and an obvious love letter to the whole art form. I got similar vibes from my hour and a half hands-on demo and preview event with <em>People of Note</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>A turn-based RPG all about music, Cadence and her band use the power of music while traversing the aptly-named land of Note. After my time with the game, I'm intrigued by the high notes, but worried by a few miscues.</p><h2>Systems That Sing</h2><p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/measures-pon-1.jpg?itok=gtRNko7w 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture>It should be noted first and foremost, as it was at our preview event, that <em>People of Note </em>is a music RPG, not a rhythm RPG. Other games, like the recent <em>UNBEATABLE</em>, have music as a part of the plot and heavily as part of the gameplay. <em>People of Note </em>is all about music, but in the gameplay itself, rhythm is about as present as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-french-revolution" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="07f3b1f2-234f-4782-8556-c21c1fb23302" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a><em> </em>attacks.</p><p>For a game all about creativity, I found the more technical parts of the game to be where it shone brightest. In the game's combat, I was really impressed by the game's turn order system. In a mechanic that <em>Final Fantasy X </em>seemed to solve, I felt there were some really creative things happening in <em>People of Note</em>.</p><p>Turns are measured in stanzas, and each turn is a measure. The number of turns you get is determined by a "time signature," where the top number is the amount of turns for your team and the bottom is for the enemy. Later fights in the demo even had modifications made to select measures. What at first seems to be a cosmetic choice seems to actually be one of its best mechanical ideas.</p><p>Management outside of combat allows a lot of creativity as well. <em>People of Note</em>'s Songstone system is a near one-to-one rip of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/ranking-all-of-magic-gathering-final-fantasy-legendary-creatures-part-2" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="83fd60e7-1407-46f1-ac0b-60b876ec8285" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Final Fantasy 7</em></a>'s Materia. That's not a bad thing at all, as it lets you build characters exactly as you want. Even in my hour and a half playtime, I was able to build characters with clear archetypes, with pop star Cadence as my primary damage dealer and the rocker Fret playing support with stat boosts and healing.</p><p>Speaking of characters, the character design is superb. The way Cadence's popstar look clashes with the rock-themed land the demo takes place in makes me really excited about the characters we've yet to meet. The developer at our preview event mentioned that each area in the game is themed after a different genre, and I'm really hoping we get to see a Classical crew decked out with powdered wigs and everything.</p><h2>A Few Sour Notes</h2><p><picture>

  </picture>Outside of the combat, there were a few places that felt like a miss. The dungeon in the demo felt very ho-hum, and navigating it was a real chore. With a good amount of backtracking required, it was easy to get disoriented in similar looking rooms, and the environmental puzzles were pretty by the numbers. It was nice to look at, but it was mostly repetitive and frustrating.</p><p>My other gripe was with the humor. There are puns <em>everywhere </em>in Note, and they start as fun and make some great environmental gags. In dialogue and songs themselves, though, they don't land quite as well. It's clear there's a sincerity behind the jokes, but it just feels like they're far too frequent. Though perhaps it's a little fitting that a love letter to music has band kid humor.</p><h2>People of Note Preview | Final Thoughts</h2><p><em>People of Note </em>went from a relative unknown for me to a game I'm at least intrigued by. I could see its dungeon design and punny dialogue wearing me down quite a bit during its runtime. However, I think its sincerity and sharp systems are interesting and rife with potential.</p><p><em>Guitar Hero </em>was always a love letter to rock. <em>People of Note </em>is striving to be a love letter not to a genre, but to a medium, complete with full musical numbers and loads of variety. It's a huge undertaking, and a big swing for a small team to take. The one certainty I have after my time with <em>People of Note</em>: it's ambitious as hell, and that's enough for me to see it through.</p><hr><p><em><strong>People of Note</strong> was previewed on PC using a copy provided by the publisher over the course of an hour and a half of gameplay.</em></p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-f7cce43c-7fff-fe01-2497-c7469a27d0e0">One thing that constantly persisted in my playthroughs of&nbsp;<em>Love Eternal</em>, the self-proposed “horror platformer” published by Ysbryd Games and developed by Brika, was a perversion of wanting. What I wanted wasn’t entirely clear, whether it was an answer, a challenge, cohesion, or even attrition, and even now, 3 playthroughs later, what&nbsp;<em>Love Eternal</em>&nbsp;*<strong>is</strong>* doesn’t necessarily aim itself towards any of those. Could it? Should it? Well, let’s delve deeper.</p><p dir="ltr">What is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/love-eternal-preview-stunning-precision-platformer" rel="nofollow"><em>Love Eternal</em></a>? Well, in many ways, it’s in the title, but to whom and to what end? Well, all manner of things, if you will. To companionship, creation, celebration, confusion, continuation, cycles, chores, and condemnations. As a product, it’s a buckling beast of wrath, all of it housed inside the cozy visual package of a freeware platformer from the Flash era.</p><p dir="ltr">It’s very unabashed about its inspirations, namely titles like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/i-wanna-be-guy-remastered-fans-developer-blessing" rel="nofollow"><em>I Wanna Be The Guy</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/celeste" rel="nofollow"><em>Celeste</em></a>, as well as PICO-8 platformers like <em>Pullfrog </em>and… well, <em>Celeste</em>, I suppose, and its slew of mods. Narratively, it seeks to emulate elements of David Lynch’s work, while also somewhat unintentionally running parallel to Joe Dante’s segment in the&nbsp;<em>Twilight Zone</em>&nbsp;movie, which is enticing, but horse before the cart, eh?</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/loveeternal_level.jpg?itok=wrnPtgma 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p dir="ltr"><em>Love Eternal</em> itself is an expansion of Brika’s previous hardcore platformer simply titled <em>Love </em>– not to be confused with Fred Wood’s 2008 2D platformer <em>Love</em>. While the latter is much more straightforward, Brika’s <em>Love</em>, and <em>Love Eterna</em>l, have a sneaky ace up their sleeve. At the push of a button, whether stationary or in mid-air, your character will invert their gravity and use the ceiling as their new platform.</p><p dir="ltr">How the game approaches this gimmick is largely through the use of increasing the length of stringing together how many times you can invert in one floating period through the use of red crystals, which refresh your one-time use. There are hazards like spikes and lasers, and these, in turn, close the timings tighter until it becomes more masochistic than precision. A meeting of the minds between its two main inspirations.</p><p dir="ltr">On the whole, this is the game. It is a maximum of three hours of this mechanic stretched to an atomically small width, where the margins get tighter, and the line of red crystals becomes longer. Is it fun? It is initially, before repeat playthroughs, which, due to the narrative, are outright encouraged, undermine how reliant the game is solely on one element of <em>Love Eternal</em>'s platforming possibilities. Instead, what we have is a story to sink our teeth into.</p><picture>

  </picture><p dir="ltr">You play as Maya, a young girl seemingly at odds with everything in her life, from her family and what they eat for dinner, to her friends and their failure to show up for events Maya’s scheduled. Her reactionary anger to friends like Lacey for failing to show up at an event with Maya, brings the wrath of a selfish god who, unbeknownst to Maya, invites her into a castle hosted of her memories, as fractured and as alien to Maya, as much as they are to the God itself.</p><p dir="ltr">What follows is a spotty, but nonetheless, consistently fascinating string of scenes detailing a lot of this nefarious God’s activity, and a lip service treatment of Maya’s history. Why she’s chosen is just down to bad luck on her part, and as such, <em>Love Eternal </em>is much more interested in detailing how this God interacts with the world around Maya – their new plaything – and their history of previous playthings. The result as a whole, is a memetic experience that is alluring, but aggravatingly impenetrable.</p><p dir="ltr">It’s branded as “an experimental narrative”, but in reality, it is an abstract story, almost completely detached from gameplay, and contextualized through two decades of internet history. If the screenshots fail to garner a reaction other than “buh?”, then just know that they DO make sense, in one very acute angle of how this game structures its writing. Otherwise, you mostly fall prey to this God's absurdist reactions to a world that has gone from temples to touchpads, the Baby Boomer to end all Baby Boomers.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/loveeternal_shout.jpg?itok=JC2NGDQf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p dir="ltr">It’s almost pointless trying to adequately compose a consistent chain of events that would make this even remotely make sense. The somewhat garbled memories of Maya intersecting with a previous victim of the God, Divesh, and why the two meet so frequently, when, even when it’s shown, Divesh shows nowhere near the same amount of ire towards his contemporaries like Maya does. Instead, what <em>Love Eternal</em> focuses on is Dadaism.</p><p dir="ltr">Watch! As the God assumes Maya is a girl wholly inspired by the use of 2010 rage comics, one Memebase watermark short of a negative vote rating on 9gag. Gasp! As they react to manga as if it is a coloring book! Chuckle! As the ending of&nbsp;<em>The Blair Witch Project</em>&nbsp;is referenced multiple times in the same scene, but with an irreverence of dopiness behind it! And finally, analog horror jumpscares that shut the game down when finished.</p><p dir="ltr">It should be noted that all of this takes place when the platforming is discarded for a genre switch to a point ‘n click, which falls just shy of being the worst kind of visual novel. Save for an ending which, without spoiling, throws an entirely new angle of commentary towards the player, the platforming element becomes a branch of the statement Brika is trying to make… I think.</p><picture>

  </picture><p dir="ltr">Is the mare meant to race? Should the child be coached? What follows these questions are historical context that no longer applies when we, as a collective, have fallen past the need for it. Marriage is no longer a bond of religious intent, but one with protections and privy to the human condition, ultra-modernized. A statement is a JPEG, a playground is a platformer, and you are still you, getting older, and with it, more despondent to a world that doesn’t want you. So you want it, more than food or water. You want it, never need it.</p><p dir="ltr">If that is the intent, it’s an absorbing diatribe, which deserves something a bit more welcoming to synchronicity. Towards the end, Brika seems to lament their creative intent, anger as progression is pushed into the player without the player actively engaging in it, almost furious that there’s a cage around them. Like all animals, they buckle, but to what end? Just living.</p><h2><em>Love Eternal </em>Review | Final Verdict</h2><p dir="ltr">I won’t say that <em>Love Eternal</em> is a great game. Despite its cost-effective batch of content, the reliance on its legitimately bewitching gimmick being one broad stroke of challenge leaves the player desiring more. While the story is a legitimately enthralling aspect, it betrays the supposed experimentation by just sitting alongside the gameplay, and never the two shall meet.</p><hr><p><em><strong>Love Eternal </strong>was reviewed on PC with a copy provided by the publisher over the course of 8 hours of gameplay.
