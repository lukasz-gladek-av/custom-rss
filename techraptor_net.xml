            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced two brand new features for its SNES Classics catalog on the Nintendo Switch Online service, and if you're a connoisseur of strategy and puzzle games, this one's for you.</p>

<p>First up, select SNES games now support mouse controls on Switch Online. Naturally, this includes&nbsp;<em>Mario Paint</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-paint-nintendo-switch-online" rel="nofollow">released on the service last month</a>; in fact, Nintendo says some games "can only be played using mouse controls", seemingly including&nbsp;<em>Mario Paint</em>.</p>

<p>Other games support mouse controls as well, though; the trailer demonstrating the new mouse control feature shows not only&nbsp;<em>Mario Paint&nbsp;</em>being played, but also&nbsp;<em>Mario's Super Picross&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Nobunaga's Ambition</em>, both of which are probably a lot more satisfying with a mouse.</p>

<p>As well as mouse controls, the new update also brings the ability to both view and change the controls for the SNES game you're playing. If there are button mappings that don't quite suit your play style, you can change them around to suit you.</p>

<p>Naturally, you'll also be able to save different mappings and configurations for each game, so you won't have to stick with the mappings you set up for&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Kart&nbsp;</em>in&nbsp;<em>Super Metroid</em>. Nintendo isn't that heartless.</p>

<p>You can check out a trailer showing off the new features being added to Nintendo Switch Online right here.</p>




<p>Both mouse controls and the ability to remap your buttons are available right now if you're a Nintendo Switch Online subscriber. Of course, if you're not, you'll need to sign up to get access to the SNES catalog.</p>
