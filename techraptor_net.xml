            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has revealed that its&nbsp;free-to-play&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>reboot has hit a major player count milestone less than a month after launching across PC and consoles in Early Access.</p>

<p><em>Skate&nbsp;</em>launched <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/skate-early-access-release-date-september" rel="nofollow">back in mid-September</a>, and according to a <a href="https://x.com/skate/status/1975229570807890000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">social media post</a> by the game's development team, it's managed to attract 15 million players since that time. That figure naturally includes all of the platforms on which&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>is available, but EA doesn't say which of those is most popular, sadly.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that, as with any "player number"-style announcements, this isn't a sales figure; since&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>is free at the point of entry, players can just jump in for ten minutes, decide they've had enough, and check out, and EA would still presumably count those players as part of the 15 million figure.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skate-reboot-15m-players-diving.jpg?itok=d_TpdO-F 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skate-reboot-15m-players-diving.jpg?itok=PuL1YWWX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Skate&nbsp;</em>appears to be pretty popular, if its player count is anything to go by.</figcaption></figure><p>Still, it is fair to say that&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>appears to be scratching an itch that hasn't been scratched for a long time. At time of writing, the game has around <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3354750/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">23,000 active players</a> on Steam, with a 24-hour high of about 57,000. Clearly, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-skate-reboot-no-offline-mode" rel="nofollow">the fact you can't play</a>&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>offline isn't turning people off.</p>

<p>As EA points out in the aforementioned social media post,&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>is about to embark on its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/skate-season-1-new-stuff" rel="nofollow">first post-launch season</a>, which will introduce new seasonal events and challenges to the game, as well as a raft of new cosmetics to unlock.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Skate</em>, it's the latest game in EA's&nbsp;skateboarding series of the same name. Unlike its predecessors, the latest&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>isn't a boxed premium product; it's a free-to-play experience with all of the usual trappings, so you can expect battle passes, cosmetic unlocks, and microtransactions galore.</p>




<p>Elsewhere in EA-related news, it was recently revealed that the veteran publisher is being <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-could-go-private-powered-by-saudi-and-private-equity-money" rel="nofollow">purchased by a consortium of different firms</a>, among them the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund and a company owned by President Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>for free right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3354750/skate/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/skate/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/skate-game-preview/9PHF9K5Q6ZLZ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and if you want to know what we thought of it, you can read our very own Andrew's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/skate-is-return-to-form-but-will-audience-be-there-to-support-it" rel="nofollow">preview right here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has revealed the Valley of Memory update for&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Mirage</em>, and it's bringing a ton of new story and gameplay stuff next month.</p>

<p>The update, which will be arriving across all platforms on November 18th, was revealed during a livestream in which Ubisoft delved deep into what we can expect from it. You can expect a brand new region to explore, new side quests and contracts, and lots more.</p>

<p>Valley of Memory will take place just before the main game's finale, and it revolves around Basim learning that his father may still be alive in the valley of AlUla, upon which he sets out to discover whether there's any truth to that rumor.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-mirage-valley-of-memory-update-swinging.jpg?itok=v3OLauJk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-mirage-valley-of-memory-update-swinging.jpg?itok=AjzIo3mA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Assassin's Creed Mirage</em>'s free Valley of Memory update should give you plenty of reason to revisit it next month.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, you can expect a brand new series of main missions in Valley of Memory, as well as new assassination targets to take down. Ubisoft is also promising parkour challenges that will reward you with music sheets, allowing Basim to play the songs he's discovered on the oud.</p>

<p>Rather excitingly, the studio is also teasing "a unique twist on&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed</em>'s classic black box missions" in Valley of Memory. Given that&nbsp;<em>Mirage&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-mirage-reveals-return-to-roots-trailer-featuring-gameplay-developer" rel="nofollow">originally touted</a> as a return to old-school&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed</em>, that's particularly tantalizing for me.</p>

<p>Valley of Memory will also bring a number of enhancements to the base game, including new parkour moves, replayable missions, and new skill and tool customization options, among other things.</p>

<p>While Ubisoft hasn't publicly confirmed this, it's very likely that Valley of Memory is the DLC that was first mooted back in January, when it was also suggested that the Saudi PIF (which is also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-could-go-private-powered-by-saudi-and-private-equity-money" rel="nofollow">one of the firms</a> chipping in to buy EA) <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-mirage-dlc-report-ubisoft" rel="nofollow">would fund the update</a>.</p>




<p>In any case, the Valley of Memory update for&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Mirage&nbsp;</em>will launch on November 18th for PC, PlayStation, and Xbox, and you can play the game on all of those platforms right now as well. Be sure to give our Andrew's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/assassins-creed-mirage-review-it-feels-so-good-to-be-back" rel="nofollow">review a read</a> if you want to remind yourself what he thought of the game!</p>
