            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>publisher Krafton has introduced a voluntary redundancy program just a couple of weeks after announcing that it intended to be an "AI first" company.</p>

<p>As spotted by news platform <a href="https://www.businesskorea.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=256319#google_vignette" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Business Korea</a>, the studio is offering resignation support to employees who decide to take voluntary redundancy, paying up to 36 months' salary depending on duration of employment. Even those who have been with Krafton for a year or less are being included in the program; they're being offered six months' salary to take redundancy.</p>

<p>Krafton itself says the goal with this program is to support employees in "proactively designing their growth direction" and that staffers will be given the choice to "continue the direction of change internally or expand externally", which sounds like a pretty classic piece of corporate-ese to me.</p>

<p>News of Krafton's voluntary redundancy program comes after the company <a href="https://www.krafton.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/KRAFTON-3Q25-Earnings-Release_ENG.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">posted</a> a revenue increase of 21% on a year-on-year basis this quarter and 31.5% on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Operating profit has also increased both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter, and Krafton's main IP,&nbsp;<em>PUBG</em>, has grown as well.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, studios firing employees despite recent successes <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-funcom-layoffs" rel="nofollow">isn't a new thing</a> in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-revenue-up-microsoft-2025" rel="nofollow">gaming industry</a>, and as the widespread push for AI continues, this isn't a situation that's likely to change significantly anytime soon.</p>

<p>Krafton's redundancy program also comes after the company became <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/subnautica-charlie-cleveland-lawsuit" rel="nofollow">embroiled in a legal battle</a> with former&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>developers following <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/subnautica-2-lawsuit-krafton-bonus" rel="nofollow">their dismissal</a> from subsidiary Unknown Worlds, a battle that still rages on at time of writing.</p>




<p>Whatever your stance on generative AI may be (and there are a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioshock-creator-ken-levine-generative-ai" rel="nofollow">number of opinions</a> among <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-generative-ai-vp" rel="nofollow">industry bodies</a>), one thing's for sure: Krafton is going <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-generative-ai-characters-pubg-inzoi" rel="nofollow">all-in on the technology</a>. Stay tuned for more.</p>
