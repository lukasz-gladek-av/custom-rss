            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Postal </em>studio Running With Scissors has announced <em>Postal: Bullet Paradise</em>, a bullet heaven FPS spinoff packed with plenty of high-octane action and references to classic <em>Postal </em>games.</p><p>As revealed on <a href="https://x.com/RWSstudios/status/1996223342316073303" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">social media</a>, <em>Postal: Bullet Paradise </em>will be developed by the rather unfortunately-named Goonswarm Games, whose name you might know from titles like roguelite RPG <em>Sin Slayers: Reign of the 8th </em>or psychological horror game <em>SCP: Control Error</em>.</p><p>The new game takes place in the appropriately-named Shitty Future, in which one of several Postal Dudes must do battle against "every robot, psycho, mutant, and corporate goon" flooding the streets. Naturally, this being a bullet heaven shooter, you'll have access to tons of weaponry to help you do just that.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Postal: Bullet Paradise </em>is a bullet heaven shooter set in the, er, world of the <em>Postal </em>games.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Running With Scissors and Goonswarm are promising the ability to play as several Postal Dudes from throughout the franchise's history, and they've also packed <em>Postal: Bullet Paradise </em>with "Easter eggs, references, and familiar faces for fans who know the chaos by heart".</p><p>Gameplay-wise, <em>Bullet Paradise </em>looks pretty similar to the likes of <em>Vampire Survivors </em>or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/megabonk-sales-1m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="dece44e2-9de8-42d4-8be9-cdc04699d879" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">indie hit <em>Megabonk</em></a>, albeit from a first-person perspective; you'll battle waves of enemies, building synergies between weapons and abilities as you go.</p><p>Unfortunately, despite only being announced earlier today, <em>Postal: Bullet Paradise </em>has already found itself at the center of a controversy surrounding its logo, with fans <a href="https://x.com/RWSstudios/status/1996223528698273970" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">alleging on social media</a> that the art is AI-generated, a claim that Running With Scissors has categorically denied.</p><p>Still, with AI use <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/over-500-steam-next-demos-disclosed-generative-ai-usage" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="605cb384-a6e4-42b3-8104-b8d3cce6d299" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">on the rise across the industry as a whole</a> and studios like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-hopes-to-use-generative-ai-to-drive-more-monetization-and-make-development-30-more" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="746600ea-ef36-4d95-b141-ab37281d9e3e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">EA</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-generative-ai-vp" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="affdbbdc-41b9-4313-aacc-396adb4aed5a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Netflix</a> wholeheartedly embracing it despite its controversies, it's not unreasonable for players to be hyper-vigilant about this sort of thing.</p>
<p>In any case, if you want to keep up with <em>Postal: Bullet Paradise </em>(which doesn't have a release date yet), you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4162690/POSTAL_Bullet_Paradise?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">wishlist it on Steam right here</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has released a brand new <em>Mario Kart World </em>update, and if you've been struggling to keep tabs on the game's banger-filled soundtrack or wishing you could change which items appear during races, this one's for you.</p><p>As revealed on the official Nintendo <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68580/~/how-to-update-mario-kart-world" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">support page</a> for the game, <em>Mario Kart World </em>Update 1.4.0 brings custom item rules to the racer, which allows you to set which items appear during play in various game modes. Note that this feature isn't supported in Grand Prix races or in Knockout Tour.</p><p>Additionally, you'll now be able to see the name and source game for each of the music tracks that plays during <em>Mario Kart World</em> in the pause menu. Incidentally, if you haven't paid much attention to the soundtrack before now, I'd strongly recommend doing so; it's filled with absolutely stellar musicianship.</p><figure role="group">

</figure>
<p>Various other quality-of-life features and improvements have been introduced as part of this update as well, including the ability to restart races or skip to the next race in the pause menu for the VS Race mode (in single-player, of course), as well as altered course layouts for various tracks between major courses.</p><p>If you're not familiar with <em>Mario Kart World</em>, it's the latest game in the <em>Mario Kart </em>series, as well as the main launch title for the Nintendo Switch 2, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c11b67d9-d8b1-4556-871d-041c5101dcf0" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">arrived back in June</a>.</p><p>Unlike its predecessors, the game takes an open-world approach, allowing you to explore the areas between its courses and hunt for optional challenges to complete. You'll also travel along these routes between races in <em>Mario Kart World</em>'s various game modes.</p>
<p>You can check out <em>Mario Kart World </em>right now exclusively on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/mario-kart-world-switch-2/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report has emerged which reveals exactly how much of EA the Saudi Public Investment Fund will own after the recent acquisition goes through, and it turns out it's not an insignificant percentage.</p><p>According to a filing seen by the Wall Street Journal (via <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/saudi-arabia-will-own-93-4-percent-of-ea-after-buyout" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Game Developer</a>), the Saudi PIF will own 93.4% of EA following the buyout, with fellow purchasers Silver Lake and Affinity Partners scoring 5.5% and 1.1% of the publisher respectively.</p><p>In case you need a reminder, it was announced back in September that EA <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-could-go-private-powered-by-saudi-and-private-equity-money" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">would go private</a> thanks to a buyout from the three aforementioned companies, who acquired the storied publisher for an eye-watering $55 billion (although that's still not the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-buys-activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick-staying-as-ceo" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ca03cb11-0e22-42e4-bb57-2d2f082d977b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">most expensive gaming acquisition in history</a>, of course).</p><figure role="group">

<p>After the acquisition was announced, EA was quick to <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ea-creative-control-sale-saudi-arabia-silverlake-affinity-partners?utm_campaign=email-post&amp;r=2ov77y&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">assuage fears</a> that the new buyers would affect its creative direction, with the publisher claiming that it will "maintain creative control" after the purchase and that its "track record of creative freedom and player-first values will remain intact".</p><p>However, concerns remain around the involvement of the Saudi PIF in EA's business, especially given that its chair, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2024/11/20/man-who-bought-world/rights-abuses-linked-saudi-arabias-public-investment-fund" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">presided over</a> a number of <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/projects/saudi-arabia-kingdom-of-repression/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">human rights abuses</a> in Saudi Arabia.</p><p>Still, EA isn't the only pie in which the Saudi PIF has its proverbial fingers. Others include <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/niantic-scopely-sale-games" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e6689aac-8eaa-48c0-8d94-17b0503eec20" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Niantic</a>, the developer behind <em>Pokemon Go</em>, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/saudi-pif-becomes-nintendos-largest-outside-shareholder" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="50e39fd5-7ec3-478c-beba-17ca57c82457" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Nintendo</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/saudi-arabia-pif-adds-stakes-in-capcom-nexon" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="46a762d4-47ce-48d7-bfd7-7975e6c98413" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Capcom</a>, and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/saudi-pif-buys-1-billion-stake-in-embracer-group" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ab671b09-1a39-4525-9aa9-265f9efd8734" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Embracer Group</a>, to name but a few.</p><p>There don't appear to have been any major changes in creative direction among those companies since the PIF invested in them, but since the fund has a majority stake in EA, things could well be a little different in this case.</p><figure role="group">

<p>EA will, however, likely be hoping that the new investment can boost its financial performance a little, especially given the underperformance of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-ea-sports-fc-25-underperformed" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="0c1c6926-0cf4-46ae-b617-dfc9e08b91de" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">some of the studio's biggest titles</a> recently.
