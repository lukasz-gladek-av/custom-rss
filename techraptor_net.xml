            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-pc-sales-1m-three-days<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>PC sales of the hack-and-slash actioner&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>apparently reached a major milestone within just three days of the game's release, according to a new report.</p>

<p>Per Korean news platform <a href="https://bbs.ruliweb.com/news/read/211821" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Ruliweb</a>&nbsp;(via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-proves-theres-appetite-for-playstation-5-games-on-pc-as-it-blasts-past-one-million-sales-in-three-days" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>),&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade</em>'s PC version, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-pc-release-june-leak" rel="nofollow">released last week</a>, racked up a million sales for itself on PC alone within the first three days of its release on the platform.</p>

<p>According to Ruliweb, that brings the game's total sales up to over three million around the world. That's on both PlayStation 5 and PC, of course, and it also includes both digital and physical shipments. Still, that's not a bad figure at all, and it means&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>has picked up an extra two million sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-sales-one-million" rel="nofollow">since June last year</a>.</p>

Released last year, the game revolves around Eve, who must rid Earth of a hostile force known as the Naytiba.</p>

<p>Since launch,&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>has received a number of updates, including the addition of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-new-game-plus-mode" rel="nofollow">New Game Plus mode</a>, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-nier-automata-crossover" rel="nofollow">crossover with&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-nier-automata-crossover" rel="nofollow">Nier: Automata</a>&nbsp;</em>(one of the game's biggest inspirations), and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/festive-stellar-blade-update" rel="nofollow">lots of new outfits</a> for several of the game's characters as well.</p>

<p>Supposedly, the game did so well that Shift Up <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-shift-up-ps5-pro-bonus" rel="nofollow">gifted all of its employees PS5 Pro consoles</a> as a Christmas bonus last year, and since&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>boasts PS5 Pro improvements (along with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/full-ps5-pro-enhanced-list-launch" rel="nofollow">several other games</a>), I'm sure that came as a welcome surprise.</p>




<p>As for what's next for Shift Up, a <i>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</i>sequel has been confirmed to be in the works, although we don't know when it's due yet. Additionally, the studio is currently working on a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-developer-shift-up-new-action-rpg" rel="nofollow">new next-gen action-RPG</a>&nbsp;with an urban sci-fi theme.</p>
