            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/seafarer-the-ship-sim-astragon<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Construction Simulator&nbsp;</em>studio Astragon has announced&nbsp;<em>Seafarer: The Ship Sim</em>, and as the title suggests, it'll put you in command of your very own ship.</p>

<p>Built in Unreal Engine 5,&nbsp;<em>Seafarer&nbsp;</em>promises to do for maritime simulation what&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/get-to-work-in-construction-simulator-this-september" rel="nofollow"><em>Construction Simulator&nbsp;</em>did for, well, construction</a>. Astragon describes the game as a "fully interactive ship experience" with a variety of missions and two different game modes to enjoy.</p>

<p>In Story Mode, you'll take on "unique missions" and receive rewards from different factions. You might be transporting cargo one minute, then fighting fires on open waters the next. Astragon is even promising treasure retrieval missions, which...well, who hasn't dreamt of that at some point?</p>

<p>You won't just be piloting one type of ship, either. Astragon is promising a variety of different ships, "from small tugboats to gigantic freighters", so you'll be able to get a sense of what it's like to sail ships big and small.</p>

<p>The game will offer a variety of different tasks to complete, as well. You won't just be sailing your ship; you'll also have to operate machinery and even use water cannons to put out fires.</p>

<p>If you're expecting ship combat from&nbsp;<em>Seafarer: The Ship Sim</em>, though, you might want to look elsewhere. This is very much not a pirate sim, nor is it an arcade-style ship battler; it's an Astragon simulation through and through, by the looks of things.</p>




<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Seafarer: The Ship Sim&nbsp;</em>when it launches for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2582140/Seafarer_The_Ship_Sim/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a> and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/seafarer-the-ship-sim-bbbc39" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Epic Games Store</a> this summer. It'll set you back $24.99 and will be an Early Access release to begin with.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/humble-games-showcase-2025-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Indie publisher Humble Games has announced that it's hosting a new Humble Games Showcase next week, and it'll feature updates on some of the publisher's upcoming games, plus two brand new titles.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/03/humble-games-showcase-2025-set-for-march-12" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gematsu</a>, the 2025 Humble Games Showcase will air on March 12th, which is exactly one week today. It'll be available at 12pm Eastern, which works out as 9am Pacific and 5pm GMT.</p>

<p>The showcase will be hosted by content creator and streaming personality <a href="https://www.ashsaidhi.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">AshSaidHi</a>, and it's set to feature reveals for a number of games being published by the Humble Games label in the next few months.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monaco-2-humble-games-showcase-2025.jpg?itok=fNsCYaeA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monaco-2-humble-games-showcase-2025.jpg?itok=lj5-2SMm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Monaco 2&nbsp;</em>is one of the games that will be featured during next week's Humble Games Showcase.</figcaption></figure><p>First up, you'll be getting some new info about the Bossa Studios game&nbsp;<em>Lost Skies</em>. The developer, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bossa-studios-layoffs-restructuring" rel="nofollow">hit by layoffs earlier this month</a>, recently announced it would focus on launching&nbsp;<em>Lost Skies&nbsp;</em>before pivoting towards smaller projects that could be released sooner.</p>

<p>Developer Pocketwatch Games will also unveil new information about stealth game&nbsp;<em>Monaco 2</em>, and since both games are yet to get a concrete release date, I wouldn't be surprised if just such a thing were to be announced next week.</p>

<p>We'll also get some more information about the heavily&nbsp;<em>Chrono Trigger</em>-inspired&nbsp;<em>Threads of Time</em>, as well as a new look at musical 3D platformer&nbsp;<em>Billie Bust Up</em>. Updates on recently-released games&nbsp;<em>On Your Tail&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Wizard of Legend 2&nbsp;</em>are also expected.</p>

<p>Lastly, Humble Games says it will reveal two "never-before-seen world premieres", so we'll be getting a look at two brand new Humble Games titles as well. Of course, we'll have to wait for the show to find out what they are.</p>

At that time, it was believed that Humble Games was to shut down, but that demonstrably turned out not to be the case.</p>

<p>The Humble Games Showcase airs on March 12th at 9am Pacific/12am Eastern/5pm GMT. Stay tuned for more.</p>
