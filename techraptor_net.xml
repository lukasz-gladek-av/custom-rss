            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You airdropped in with the <em>Warmachine</em> <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warmachine-gravediggers-command-starter-and-battlegroup-box-review" rel="nofollow">Gravediggers Command Starter and Battlegroup Box</a>, but the enemy has dug in harder than you thought, and you call for reinforcements. Steamforged Games has answered those calls, and the Gravediggers Core and Auxiliary Expansions are ready for deployment.&nbsp;In&nbsp;this article,&nbsp;we'll have a look at what both boxes contain and how they fit into the Command Starter and Battlegroup Box.</p>

<p><i>Warmachine</i>, a tabletop wargame that initially came to life to focus on balanced and competitive gameplay, has been around since 2003 under Privateer Press, until last year when Steamforged Games announced that they had <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/steamforged-games-acquires-warmachine-and-whole-iron-kingdom-ip-0" rel="nofollow">bought the IP</a>. <em>Warmachine</em> had recently moved into a new edition of the rules, and SFG has continued to run with that, kicking off a <a href="https://steamforged.com/en-gb/blogs/brands/iron-kingdoms-manifesto-part1?srsltid=AfmBOoqbPX8-yaogfTtpMsWSffAvNYYnSy0vGEqaKdAeX5njSJbqbpHm" rel="nofollow">roadmap</a> of new and exciting releases. These releases began with a brand-new 2-player starter set, which we reviewed <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-review-metal-and-magic" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>The Gravediggers are a new army under the Cygnar faction, and can trace their history back to the early days of <em>Warmachine</em> in 2003. The Gravediggers come from a group known as the Trenchers, who were a theme army in the original <em>Warmachine</em> and grew and developed through the various editions of the game. Now, under Steamforged Games, the Gravediggers bring the Trenchers back with a unique twist: they can airdrop weapons, supplies, and even Warjacks into the battlefield, letting them react to the changing landscape and keep your opponents on their toes.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-core-and-auxiliary-expansion-sets-2.jpg?itok=bFIAVlEI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-core-and-auxiliary-expansion-sets-2.jpg?itok=_v3MY3Up 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Warmachine</em> Gravediggers Core Expansion includes a whole host of new units to add somre new tricks to your army.</figcaption></figure>

<p>The Gravediggers Command Core Expansion Set includes a force that can be played out of the box, but you will have to make some choices on force construction, unlike the Gravediggers Command Starter Set, which will get you straight into the game. But if you're looking for a larger force, or you already have the command starter and want to expand, then the Core Expansion will suit you well.</p>

<p>The Gravediggers Core Expansion Set contains:</p>

<ul><li>Major Grant Vargus (Warcaster)</li>
	<li>Lieutenant Stella Barron (Character Solo)</li>
	<li>Gravedigger Rangers A (Unit)</li>
	<li>Gravedigger Rangers B (Unit)</li>
	<li>Trollkin Express Sniper (Command Attachment)</li>
	<li>Heavy Machine Gun Crew (Solo)</li>
	<li>Mantlet (Light Airdrop / Defense)</li>
	<li>Gun Mages (Unit)</li>
	<li>Blocker (Light Warjack / Heavy Airdrop)</li>
	<li>Skirmisher (Light Warjack / Heavy Airdrop)</li>
</ul><p>Leading the box from the front is Major Vargus, who has Fleet and Evasive to allow them to get to the front quickly and attack with their powerful Balefire Cannon with D3+1 shots. They also give other Cohort units in their battlegroup Fleet, which lets them spend 1 focus point to add 2 speed that turn. Their feat also gives nearby friendly units +3 armor, allowing you to set up a gunline in the face of the enemy and hamper the power of their return fire. Vargus is backed up by Lieutenant Barron, who, once per turn, can use their Battle Plan ability to give a friendly model a bonus from a choice of 3, like Sneak, which gives a nearby unit with concealment, stealth.</p>

<p>The box comes with 3 units, 2 units of 5 Rangers, and a unit of 3 Gun Mages. The Gun Mages can deploy further forward than normal at the start of the game, and come armed with Magelock Pistols, which can fire 3 different types of ammo, giving them either +3 range, an additional dice on attack (then discarding the lowest), or an Electro Leap, which can damage another enemy nearby to their target. The Rangers come in units of 5, and each has 3 heavy rifles and 2 machine gun-armed Rangers. The Rangers can dig in to give their unit concealment and combine their attacks for brutal strikes against resistant enemies.</p>

They can make a free attack once per turn if an enemy comes within 8 inches, and their weapon's tracer round attack ignores stealth, and lights up enemies,s making them easier for your other units to hit. A Trollkin Express Sniper is also included and can only be attached to a Ranger unit. The Trollkin ignores concealment and cover when making attacks, and when targeting warjacks, they can pick the damage column when they hit. They also give the unit their attached to a once per game&nbsp;Cautious Advance ability, where the unit makes a full advance, digs in, and then performs combat actions.</p>

<p>The box completes with airdrop units and has 2 of the 3 Heavy Airdrop warjacks (with the third, the Raider, in the Auxiliary Expansion), and the Light Airdrop Manlet. These units can arrive as part of the Heavy and Light Airdrop command cards, and appear 1 inch away from the unit playing the command card. The warjacks in this set can come in under the control of Vargus (who doesn't have a Warjack in this set, but can use one from other sets), or under the control of Stella, the Rangers, or Gun Mages.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-core-and-auxiliary-expansion-sets-4.jpg?itok=wuRHM26G 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-core-and-auxiliary-expansion-sets-4.jpg?itok=xUiv-mhu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The <em>Warmachine</em> Gravediggers Auxiliary Expansion offers some specialized units to your force and rounds off the airrop command card options.</figcaption></figure><h2>Warmachine Gravediggers Auxiliary Expansion Set</h2>

<p>The Gravediggers Auxiliary Expansion Set, like the Core Expansion detailed above, can be used by itself with some choices out of the box or combined with the Command Starter (or any other Gravedigger set). This expansion adds more specialized units and completes the options for the Light and Heavy airdrop command cards (if you've picked up with Command, Battlegroup, and Core sets, you will have all of the airdrop options).</p>

<p>The Gravediggers Auxiliary Expansion Set contains:</p>

<ul><li>Colonel Allison Jakes (Warcaster)</li>
	<li>Gravedigger Commandos (Unit)</li>
	<li>Commando Officer (Command Attachment)</li>
	<li>Captain Argo Brock (Character Solo)</li>
	<li>Beaker (Character Heavy Warjack)</li>
	<li>Raider (Light Warjack / Heavy Airdrop)</li>
	<li>Fuel Canister (Light Airdrop)</li>
</ul><p>The Auxiliary Expansion Set is commanded by Colonel Jakes, the highest-ranking Gravedigger available. Jakes likes to synergize with multiple units, using abilities like Butcher's Bill, which allows you to advance 3 inches and attack with a nearby unit, if one of your units was damaged that turn. This combines with the Synergy spell, which provides a cumulative bonus (capping at +3) on melee attacks and melee damage to each subsequent model hitting a unit. Backing up Jakes is the warjack Breaker, with an empowered arc node, which reduces the cost of spells channeled through it by one. Breaker is extremely durable, removing an additional damage when the repair action is used on it, along with the ability to spend a focus point once per turn to remove D3 damage, further boosted by being resistant to corrosion, electricity, and fire.</p>

Their rate of fire D3 chain gun is effective against medium and large models, and they can draw fire from nearby friendly units with their Shield Guard ability. The Commandos in this set are a unit of 3 Grunts and 2 Support Troopers, and also come with the Command Attached, Commando Officer. As you would imagine, the Commandos can forward deploy, and they can also deploy in any of our control phases after the first turn with their Ambush ability. When attacking, if they hit and fail to damage, they always deal 1 damage, and they can drop a smoke template as an action to avoid return fire. If the unit has the Officer attached, they get access to the Mission Objective ability once per game, which gives all members of this unit +2 to hit and damage a chosen unit for the rest of the turn.</p>

<p>The Auxiliary Expansion closes with a Raider warjack, that is the third type that can be deployed using the Heavy Airdrop command card (along with the Blocker and Skirmisher from the Core Expansion) and the Fuel Canister from the Light Airdrop command card, which can be deployed instead of the other Light Airdrop options from the other Gravedigger sets.</p>

<h2>Warmachine Gravediggers Core and Auxiliary Expansion Sets Final Thoughts?</h2>

<p>If you're just starting out in your <em>Warmachine</em>&nbsp;or Gravediggers journey, then I do encourage you to start with the Gravediggers Command Starter, which gives a solid impression of the faction and a good core for starting out. After that, adding in either the Battlegroup Box for extra warjacks, or the Core or Auxiliary Expansion sets adds some real flair for what the faction can do. The Core Expansion Set adds a lot of unit options, empowering your gunline, whereas the Auxiliary Expansion adds some synergies with Jakes and the sneaky options of the Commandos. If you are serious about the Gravediggers, then you will want to purchase all 4 boxes, which will give you access to everything currently released for the Gravediggers (except the massive Boom Boom McCoy warcaster), which will give you a lot of army creation options, especially for your light and heavy airdrops.</p>

<p>The standout units from the Gravediggers Core and Auxiliary Expansions Set for me are the Commandos and Rangers. I love how they capture the airborne nature of the real-world units, but beyond that, the Rangers Trollkin Express Sniper is a lot of fun (for you, not your opponent).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Asmodee has announced a new strategic partnership. The <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/asmodee-rebrands-for-30th-anniversary-with-inspired-by-players-label" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">recently rebranded</a> tabletop publisher has signed a deal with Maestro Media, which will provide the company with extensive tabletop game distribution in English-speaking territories.</p>

<h2>The Asmodee Maestro Media Distribution Agreement</h2>

<p>In an official press release, Maestro Media has agreed to an exclusive distribution partnership with Asmodee. Under this agreement, effective immediately, Asmodee will be the exclusive distributor of all English-language versions of Maestro Media's products across the United States, the United Arab Emirates, and South Africa.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/maestro-media-the-binding-of-isaac-four-souls-box-artwork.jpg?itok=KtzkvfT5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/maestro-media-the-binding-of-isaac-four-souls-box-artwork.jpg?itok=9eYsCUj6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This distribution is in keeping with Asmodee's renewed company strategy. As part of their new "Inspired by Players" label, the tabletop giant is pushing forward with bringing high-quality tabletop games to players worldwide. It's an apt label considering their recent announcements of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/asmodee-group-announces-catan-sixth-edition-is-out-now" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Catan Sixth Edition</em></a> and the acquisition of the co-op zombie franchise <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/asmodee-acquires-zombicide-ip-from-board-game-publisher-cmon" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Zombicide</em></a> from CMON.</p>

<p>This strategy aligns with Maestro Media's recent activities. The company, founded in 2015, has earned a reputation of bringing various established IPs into the tabletop space. Those include the board game <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-donald-duck-happy-camper-board-game-celebrates-characters-90th-anniversary" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Donald Duck: Happy Camper</em></a><em>,&nbsp;The Binding of Isaac: Four Souls</em>, a board game adaptation of the iconic Stanley Kubrick movie <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/2001-space-odyssey-board-game-tasks-you-with-outsmarting-hal-9000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em></a>, and the Kickstarter smash success <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/maestro-media-announces-clash-of-clans-epic-raid-board-game-based-on-hit-mobile-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Clash of Clans: The Epic Raid</em></a>.</p>

<p>“Partnering with Asmodee is a defining moment for Maestro Media,” says Javon Frazier, CEO and Founder of Maestro Media. “As we enter this next stage of growth, we’re focused on expanding the ways fans connect with our games—and there’s no better partner to do it with. Asmodee’s reach, reputation, and commitment to quality align perfectly with our vision of continuously creating unforgettable, community-driven experiences. We’re honored to keep growing alongside them.”</p>

<p>At time of writing, there are little details on product availability and release timelines for Maestro Media's catalog.</p>
