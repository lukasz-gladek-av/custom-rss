            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-rumble-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega has announced the release date for upcoming free-to-play party game&nbsp;<em>Sonic Rumble</em>, which is due to hit Steam and mobile devices next month.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/04/sonic-rumble-launches-may-8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gematsu</a>,&nbsp;<em>Sonic Rumble&nbsp;</em>will be arriving on May 8th, and pre-registrations are open right now on mobile platforms. You'll unlock more rewards the more pre-registrations Sega gets, so if you want some&nbsp;<em>Sonic Rumble&nbsp;</em>goodies, be sure to add your name to your platform's list.</p>

<p>Pre-registration rewards include bonus rings, a Chao sticker, and skins for various characters, including a crystallized "Garnet Knuckles" skin and a look for Sonic himself based on the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-the-hedgehog-movies-1b-box-office" rel="nofollow">hugely successful Paramount movies</a>.</p>

<p>Several game modes will be available in&nbsp;<em>Sonic Rumble</em>. As you'd expect, there's a Run mode in which you must race against your opponents to win, and you'll also be able to battle against your rivals in Survival mode.</p>

<p>Sega says the idea behind&nbsp;<em>Sonic Rumble&nbsp;</em>is that matches are "short, so anyone can pick [the game] up and play in their spare time".</p>

<p>Playable characters include Sonic (of course), Tails, Knuckles, and Amy Rose, as well as Shadow and Dr. Eggman. Several other characters from across the&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>series will also be available for you to play as.</p>




<p><em>Sonic Rumble</em>'s release comes after what has been a pretty successful year for Sonic. A fourth&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>movie has already been greenlit and is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-hedgehog-4-movie-march-2027" rel="nofollow">set for a 2027 release</a>, and latest mainline entry&nbsp;<em>Sonic x Shadow Generations&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-x-shadow-generations-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">crossed two million sales</a> back in January.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Sonic Rumble&nbsp;</em>when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2951690/Sonic_Rumble/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and mobile devices on May 8th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/another-crabs-treasure-new-game-plus-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Another Crab's Treasure&nbsp;</em>developer Aggro Crab has announced that the game is getting a major update later this month, and it'll bring some oft-requested features like New Game Plus, a new boss, and more.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1887840/view/507324341817443971" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Steam, Aggro Crab says the update, which is "slightly earlier than our 1 year anniversary", will finally add a New Game Plus mode to last year's cartoony Soulslike adventure when it lands on April 21st.</p>

<p>Aggro Crab goes on to say that the mode doesn't "just lazily scale up enemy stats and call it a day", but instead adds new moves to certain bosses, new items, and remixes to "almost every enemy encounter in the game", plus a higher threshold for upgrading your fork and stowaway weight.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/another-crabs-treasure-new-game-plus-update-boss.jpg?itok=1Jv8E5I8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/another-crabs-treasure-new-game-plus-update-boss.jpg?itok=cmsScLS5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Another Crab's Treasure&nbsp;</em>is getting a big update later this month.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as New Game Plus, the update is also bringing the ability to confront any boss you've already fought again, and you'll be able to do so from any of the game's Moon Snail Shell checkpoints (think&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls</em>' bonfires).</p>

<p>A new Boss Rush mode will also be made available, allowing you to take on bosses in "a variety of themed sequential fights" and win rewards like new costumes.</p>

<p>You'll also now find a Bestiary within the newly-reopened Museum, allowing you to see the range of enemies you've taken on as part of your journey through&nbsp;<em>Another Crab's Treasure</em>'s underwater kingdom.</p>

<p>Excitingly, a new boss fight has also been added. Aggro Crab stops just short of revealing said boss, but does say it'll be a "well deserved fight". Hmm.</p>




<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Another Crab's Treasure</em>, it's a Soulslike that melds the genre's classic third-person lock-on combat with 3D platforming elements and a greater emphasis on a linear narrative.</p>

<p>The game, which sees you playing as timid hermit crab Kril, was popular following its release, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/another-crabs-treasure-sales" rel="nofollow">racking up 150,000 sales</a> within just a couple of weeks of its launch.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Another Crab's Treasure&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1887840/Another_Crabs_Treasure/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/another-crabs-treasure/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/another-crabs-treasure/9P97ZTRTH25W" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/another-crabs-treasure-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.
