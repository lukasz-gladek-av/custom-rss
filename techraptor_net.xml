Bender says he "fucking hate[s] gen AI art" and that it has "made [his] life more difficult in many ways" due to its tendency to "infest shit in a way it shouldn't".</p><p>He says "no fucking AI assets" is now written into Hooded Horse's contracts with developers, although I would assume that the terms used are perhaps a little more legally friendly than that. Still, perhaps they're not. Wouldn't that be a fine thing?</p><figure role="group">

<p>Bender says he and his team are "constantly having to watch and deal with [generative AI usage] and try to prevent it from slipping in", calling the technology "cancerous" (in the sense that it grows and takes over large portions of development if undealt with).</p><p>The Hooded Horse lead goes on to say that he "wouldn't be able to face" the publisher's marketing artists if the studio used generative AI, but that Hooded Horse is also "committed ethically, for all the reasons you know, against [gen AI]".</p><p>Hooded Horse's position is by no means shared by every company in the industry. Giants like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-generative-ai-characters-pubg-inzoi" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5b68d64e-aec4-43ca-8198-297e274eb0d3" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Krafton</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-hopes-to-use-generative-ai-to-drive-more-monetization-and-make-development-30-more" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="746600ea-ef36-4d95-b141-ab37281d9e3e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">EA</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-generative-ai-vp" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="affdbbdc-41b9-4313-aacc-396adb4aed5a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Netflix</a> have all declared in favor of generative AI, and it's even being used by smaller studios like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-alters-possible-generative-ai" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="70a76a76-3e61-48bd-baae-32ea0467d92d" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">11 bit</a> and <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 </em>developer Sandfall Interactive.</p><p>Still, not everyone is gung-ho about generative AI. <em>BioShock </em>and <em>Judas </em>creator Ken Levine <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioshock-creator-ken-levine-generative-ai" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b482e315-0649-4a0c-8971-fb19868c9087" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">says he's not "impressed" by the tech</a> in its current state, and Nintendo has claimed it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-generative-ai-no-plans" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e1df5ed3-cf83-4cac-80e6-db82201d5a87" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">has no plans to use</a> gen AI in first-party development.</p><figure role="group">

  </picture><h2>Fifth Place - Hollow Knight: Silksong</h2><p>Developer: Team Cherry | Release Date: September 4th, 2025</p><p>Written by Andrew Otton</p><p>Everything about <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> just feels right. The movement, the animations, the frenetic pace to combat, the wonderfully weird world to explore... It's no surprise to see this rank on our list.</p><p>Sometimes <em>Silksong </em>can feel unfairly hard, but there is a certain ethos to most of the game. There's always an advantage to be found, a pattern to be learned. It's never cheap deaths, but certainly punishing ones as you learn new enemies or boss encounters (though I could do without some of those delivery quests).</p><p>As one of the most highly anticipated games in the last few years, I think <em>Silksong </em>lived up to expectations. There's a lot to love for action platformer fans, metroidvania fans, those that love the lore of the series, and just generally gaming fans as it's just solid through and through.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Fourth Place - Ghost of Yotei</h2><p>Developer: Sucker Punch Productions | Release Date: October 2nd, 2025</p><p>Written by Austin Suther</p><p>I got around to <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> in December, a couple of months after it was initially released. Maybe it’s because I was trying to avoid spoiling myself, but I didn’t see a great deal of talk about <em>Ghost of Yotei</em>. At least, not when compared to other PlayStation exclusives.</p><p>Nonetheless, <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> deserves your attention. It took TechRaptor’s top spot for Best Visual Design of 2025, and well, go figure. Take one look at the game and you’ll see why: It’s jawdroppingly gorgeous. The world is large but densely-packed, so it’s very easy to find yourself going off course and completing various quests or side objectives, though it also doesn’t feel like a collect-a-thon, a common pitfall many open world games fall into.</p><p>Outside of visuals, though, we get to see the journey of Atsu as she sets out on a journey of revenge many years in the making. She’s out to kill the Yotei Six, a group of evildoers that killed her family and now threaten to control all of Hokkaido.</p><p>In this quest for revenge, gameplay is a standout. Combat is smooth but weighty, as Atsu delivers devastating blows with her varied arsenal, including katanas, spears, and shinobi weapons. Atsu is more in-your-face than <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>’s Jin Sakai, so while you can resort to stealth, there’s a larger focus tackling your foes up front and in their face.</p><p>For a game as long as <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> is, one would think combat gets stale after a while, but that never happened. Enough new weapons and enemies are introduced to make encounters feel fresh, and man, the feedback from that DuelSense is really somethin’ else.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Third Place - Hades II</h2><p>Developer: Supergiant Games | Release Date: September 25th, 2025</p><p>Written by Robert Scarpinito</p><p>Hades II builds on its predecessor in arguably every department, both in terms of quantity and quality. There are twice as many levels, even more bosses, and a nearly doubled soundtrack. All that centers around the already-impeccable gameplay loop that Supergiant built in the previous game.</p><p>It would be so easy to say<em> Hades II</em> is just its predecessor but bigger, and that captures a majority of it. It's a classic case of not breaking what worked so well while iterating to make parts of it fresh.</p><p>Playing as a witch instead of a warrior comes with some nuances, like how Melinoe has to play it safe at the start. But usually by the end of a run, you're melting entire rooms of enemies with a chaotic chain of curses and effects.</p><p><em>Hades II </em>features a satisfying combat gameplay loop peppered with narrative moments from characters in the Crossroads and out in the wild. Even the bosses all have their own stories, making the world feel that much richer.</p><p>So yes, <em>Hades II</em> is just <em>Hades </em>but better—but the first game didn't win our GOTY in 2020 for no reason, after all.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Second Place - Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</h2><p>Developer: Sandfall Interactive | Release Date: April 24th, 2025&nbsp;</p><p>Written by Tyler Chancey</p><p>Sandfall Interactive's <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> was a major success by all accounts for the studio. Their debut title managed to gain a spotlight in the gaming community thanks to its modern blend of stunning visuals, gripping character performances, and impressive symphonic musical score.</p><p>The biggest secret to its success is how <em>Clair Obscu</em>r manages to put a new look and feel on familiar turn-based RPG gameplay. While the individual elements aren't new to veterans of the genre, the distinct mix presented helped lower the barrier for many who were dismissive of the genre's merits.</p><p>For those accomplishments, this title deserves its spot.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Winner - Blue Prince</h2><p>Developer: Dogubomb | Release Date: April 10th, 2025</p><p>Written by Andrew Stretch</p><p>There hasn't been a game that I've thought about more this year. Stepping into Blue Prince you're met with an entertaining puzzle roguelite experience of trying to build your way through a house of ever-changing rooms. This simple plan gets bogged down as suddenly you need to learn how to unlock a door, or reach a basement, unlock a side gate or get into an orchard.</p><p>Blue Prince does a fantastic job of starting simple, with a clear goal for the player to complete, while simultaneously seeding in other mysteries and puzzles. By the time you are at the end of one thread, there are four or five other threads that have come up. Simple mechanics get iterated upon until you complete the game, and this serves as a fine point to step off the ride, but for those wanting further puzzles to complete the game doubles in length.</p><p>Blue Prince is a true indie development story of how time and a single great idea were able to capture the minds of thousands and leave us wanting just one more puzzle to complete, even after it's all over. Blue Prince joins the ranks of many other meta puzzle games that I'll be recommending to friends for years to come.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
