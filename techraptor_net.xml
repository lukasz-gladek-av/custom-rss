            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Riot Games has revealed new details on upcoming Riftbound products. The studio's State of the Game update includes new details of upcoming sets for the official <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/league-of-legends" rel="nofollow"><em>League of Legends</em></a> TCG, and a reprint of the highly sought after Proving Grounds.</p><h2>The <em>Riftbound </em>State of the Game Announcements</h2><p>As part of their State of the Game column on their website, Riot Games gave players an update on <em>Riftbound</em>. This included the announcement of Regional Qualifiers for Organized Play across North America, Europe, APAC, including cities like Lillie, Atlanta, Sydney, Vancouver, Barcelona, Singapore, and Los Angeles.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>For those interested in how Riot will address the competitive meta, they plan on being minimal at this point in the game's life cycle. The game is relatively new, and implementing restrictions on certain cards this early may not be a wise long-term decision. They have stated that they will avoid power-level errata, changing the core rules to address power creep.</p><p>The State of the Game also confirms the release dates of upcoming sets and teases some unique selling points. These sets were originally announced as part of their <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/everything-announced-at-riftbound-pax-unplugged-panel" rel="nofollow">PAX Unplugged</a> panel, but were light on detail.</p><p>The fourth set, <em>Riftbound: Vendetta, </em>will launch globally on July 31 in a synchronized English and Simplified Chinese language release. This is a departure from the game's more staggered release, starting in Chinese before being localized to English at a later date. In addition, Vendetta will introduce enemy faction pairings to the game for the first time.</p><p>For dedicated <em>League of Legends</em> fans, the State of the Game does confirm that the fifth set, <em>Riftbound: Radiance</em>, will include two fan-favorite champions. Ekko, which same may recognize from the Netflix animated series Arcane, and Seraphine.</p><p>These upcoming <em>RIftbound</em> sets will have preview seasons throughout this year. These previews will start with the game's third set, <em>Unleashed</em>, on March 16, followed by <em>Vendetta</em> this Summer, and the fifth set, <em>Radiance</em>, will be previewed this Fall.</p><p>Lastly, competitive players and collectors can relax since Riot has confirmed a reprint of Proving Grounds. This introductory product was designed to bring new players into the game. But, the set contained unique cards that are currently vital in the competitive meta, causing much higher demand.&nbsp;</p><p>Riot has stated more copies are coming and have stated they have learned a lesson from the situation. Going forward, any starter sets will not contain unique cards.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
