            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-patch-73-august<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has revealed roughly when you can expect&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>Patch 7.3 to land, as well as what it'll bring to the long-running MMORPG when it arrives.</p>

<p>Per a new <a href="https://x.com/FF_XIV_EN/status/1936032284802793652" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">thread</a> on social media platform X, Patch 7.3 will arrive in early August, and it'll continue the story of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-patch-72-release-date" rel="nofollow">March's Patch 7.2</a>. As part of that story continuation, you can look forward to a new dungeon by the name of the Meso Terminal, which will serve as a "glittering monument to Alexandria's eternal queen".</p>

<p>The new update will also continue the ongoing&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XI</em>-themed 24-person raid, the second part of which will be called "San d'Oria: The Second Walk". Presumably, you'll be exploring the city of the same name from&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XI</em>, although given that these raids often take players through some weird and wonderful setpieces, that may not be where you end up.</p>

<p>The Cosmic Exploration feature, which is open to crafting and gathering professions, will expand in the new update as well, giving you a whole new planet to discover in the form of Phaenna. Who knows what you'll find for your Hand or Land journey there?</p>

<p>A new Deep Dungeon, Pilgrim's Traverse, will also be available, so if you prefer to take on combat-oriented challenges rather than crafting (or if you're planning to do both), you'll probably want to tackle that one as well.</p>

<p>If you play as a Hrothgar or a Viera, you'll be pleased to know there are also new headgear options available for these races, so your fashion options will be expanded when August rolls around.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-34-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/honkai-star-rail-version-3-4-release-date-set-for-july.1224030/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-34-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.4, the latest update for HoYoverse's turn-based gacha RPG, launches early next month, the developer and publisher has announced.</p>

<p>Per a press release, Version 3.4, also known as "For the Sun Is Set to Die", arrives on July 2nd. Following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-33-release-date" rel="nofollow">May's Version 3.3</a>, the new update will see you stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Phainon "at the crossroads of destiny" in order to "take a decisive step that may ignite the dawn of the Era Nova".</p>

<p>Since this is a&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>update, you can, of course, also look forward to brand new characters, and this time around, you're getting three, although two of them are guests from another franchise altogether.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/honkai-star-rail-version-3.4-phainon.jpg?itok=BXCfkQTw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/honkai-star-rail-version-3.4-phainon.jpg?itok=LiySLaWd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Phainon is joining the roster in&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.4.</figcaption></figure><p>The first new character joining the roster in&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.4 is Phainon, who can essentially take over the battlefield when he transforms into his Ultimate form. As you can probably imagine, he's a pretty reliable damage-dealer, so take him if you need some destruction in your lineup.</p>

<p>Your other two characters in this update are both visitors from the&nbsp;<em>Fate/stay night&nbsp;</em>franchise, namely Archer and Saber. Archer will be available for free once the crossover event begins, as will Saber. The latter will be a five-star fighter as well, so she'll be a valuable addition to your team.</p>

<p>This update will also bring reruns for&nbsp;Tribbie, Sunday, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-introduces-new-character-sparkle-and-she-goes-from-cute-to-crazy" rel="nofollow">Sparkle</a>, while in the second half, you'll get another chance to add&nbsp;Firefly, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-teases-new-character-jingliu-ahead-of-14-ps5-release" rel="nofollow">Jingliu</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-showcases-its-edgiest-character-blade-launches-flappy-birds-clone" rel="nofollow">Blade</a> to your team.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.4 right here. It gives a flavor of what you'll be doing when you begin your adventure next month.</p>




<p><em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.4 lands on July 2nd across <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">all platforms</a>. The game is currently available on PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices running both major operating systems.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Palworld Terraria Update Arrives Next Week, New Animated Trailer Released]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-terraria-update-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/palworld-terraria-update-arrives-next-week-new-animated-trailer-released.1223958/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-terraria-update-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Pocketpair has revealed when we can expect the&nbsp;<em>Palworld Terraria&nbsp;</em>crossover to land, and we're just a few days away from the creature-collecting survival game's first ever collaboration.</p>

<p>Per a new trailer, you can expect&nbsp;the appropriately-named "Tides of Terraria" update to arrive on June 25th, and it sounds like you can look forward to a new dungeon to explore, new enemies to fight, and perhaps even some sweet gear to net yourself.</p>

<p>According to Pocketpair, the <i>Terraria&nbsp;</i>bosses Eye of Cthulhu and Moon Lord will both be appearing in the crossover as well, so if you haven't had your fill of fighting those enemies in&nbsp;<em>Terraria</em>, you're in luck.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-terraria-update-release-date-shock.jpg?itok=oYBA9FKt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-terraria-update-release-date-shock.jpg?itok=Va1ltcsk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Palworld</em>'s upcoming&nbsp;<em>Terraria&nbsp;</em>update lands next week.</figcaption></figure><p>The&nbsp;<em>Palworld Terraria&nbsp;</em>crossover was first announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-terraria-crossover-2025" rel="nofollow">all the way back in November</a>, so Pocketpair and&nbsp;<em>Terraria&nbsp;</em>studio Re-Logic have been cooking this one up for quite some time.</p>

<p>It'll serve as&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>'s first crossover, but it likely won't be the game's last; in the&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>roadmap <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-roadmap-january-2025" rel="nofollow">released in January</a>, Pocketpair teased "game collaborations (including&nbsp;<em>Terraria</em>)", which would indicate that more crossovers are on the way later down the line.</p>

<p>For now, though, you'll have to content yourself with this one, as well as all the other stuff&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>has going on. Back in March, for instance, Pocketpair released an update for the game that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-crossplay-update-patch-notes" rel="nofollow">introduced crossplay</a>, allowing you to team up with your friends to take on challenges and raise Pals (or exploit them, if such is your wont).</p>

<p>It's not all fun and games, though. In May, it was revealed that some of&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-mechanics-changing-nintendo-lawsuit" rel="nofollow">mechanics have changed</a> because of an ongoing lawsuit brought against the game and its developer by Nintendo. As you've probably guessed, the lawsuit alleges legally spurious similarities between&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>and the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>franchise.</p>




<p>In any case, the&nbsp;<em>Palworld Terraria&nbsp;</em>collaboration launches on June 26th. You can check the former out right now (albeit in Early Access) on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/palworld/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/palworld-game-preview/9nkv34xdw014" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.</p>
