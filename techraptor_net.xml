      <div><p>The <em>Cyberpunk Legends</em> Kickstarter campaign is live now. This official card game set in the dystopian metropolis of Night City, developed by Night Crew Games, is packed with cards and characters that fans know and love. So much so, the project was funded in under an hour.</p>

<h2>The <em>Cyberpunk Legends</em> Kickstarter Campaign</h2>

<p>The official <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cyberpunklegends/cyberpunk-legends-into-the-night/description" rel="nofollow">campaign page</a> for the <em>Cyberpunk Legends</em> Kickstarter is light on text, but packed with detail. As mentioned before, during its initial <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/talsorian-games-announces-cyberpunk-legends-rpg-lite-card-game-set-in-night-city" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement in June</a>, the game is a co-op experience for 1-4 players. Each player chooses one of four roles: Netrunner, Solo, Nomad, or Rocker, and works together doing jobs, getting paid, chippin' in with cyberware, and improving themselves via RPG-lite mechanics.</p>

The game will allow players to live out history in this dark sci-fi future. A history that leads to the Time of the Red in the TTRPG <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/cyberpunk-red-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Cyberpunk Red</em></a>, followed by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-edgerunners-2-officially-confirmed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Cyberpunk Edgerunners</em></a> anime and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/cyberpunk-2077" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></a> video game.</p>

<p>Because of this potent setting, the <em>Cyberpunk Legends</em> Kickstarter is packed with campaign-exclusive add-ons and stretch goals. These include story cards featuring the Bozos Gang, card sleeves, themed deck boxes, and playable versions of Night City legends before they became legends like Santiago and Kerry Eurodyne.</p>

<p>In addition, certain add-ons will let you create your own scenarios and custom character art. If you have especially deep pockets, you can even immortalize your own <em>Cyberpunk</em> character by having a drink at the Kernal Bar named after them.</p>

<p>The different pledge tiers of the <em>Cyberpunk Legends</em> Kickstarter are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Base Runner for $50:</strong> The base version of the game with all unlocked physical stretch goals</li>
	<li><strong>Legendary Edition for $130:</strong> The Legendary Edition of the game (which includes all add-on cards and playable Santiago, Bartmoss, Santiago, and Blackhand character decks) and all physical stretch goals</li>
	<li><strong>Guns and Clowns for $75:</strong> The base game and the Weapons, Bozos, and Cyberware card add-ons</li>
	<li><strong>Silverhand Special for $210:</strong> Everything in the Legendary Edition tier, the Hard Mon add-on, four sets of card sleeves, two deck boxes, and a play mat</li>
	<li><strong>Fixer's Edition for $350:</strong> Everything in the Silverhand Special tier, and the ability to play the first scenario of the game with the design team through Tabletop Simulator.</li>
	<li><strong>Burning Chrome for $500:</strong> Everything from the Silverhand Special tier, plus all cards in the game get a foil treatment</li>
</ul><p>At the time of writing, the <em>Cyberpunk Legends</em> Kickstarter has raised&nbsp;<span><span>$201,420, which is almost three times its initial funding goal of $75,000. The campaign concludes on October 23.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
