            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>From the North they come, via the sea. For pillage, plunder, and slaughter, before disappearing back across the ocean, leaving the survivors to pick up again amongst the destruction. But the last few times have been different, and warriors have remained and are pushing further and further South, and they will continue to do so unless someone pushes them back into the ocean. The Chaos Marauders have arrived with the <em>Warhammer The Old World</em> Chaos Marauders Reinforcement Set. In this article, we'll have a look at the boxed set and the&nbsp;Arcane Journal: The Razing of Westerland supplement that contains their rules.</p>

<p><i>Warhammer The Old World </i>is a rank and flank wargame, brought back from retirement and based on the original <em>Warhammer</em> fantasy tabletop game after Games Workshop changed the setting into the current <em>Age of Sigmar</em>. You can check out our review of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-old-world-review-hit-refresh" rel="nofollow">Warhammer The Old World Starter Set</a> that launched the release.</p>

<p>To celebrate the release of the new Chaos Marauders miniatures, Games Workshop is launching them with a Reinforcement Set that contains:</p>

<ul><li>40x Chaos Marauder miniatures that can be built as 2 units of 20, or 4 units of 10, each with a headman (champion), standard bearer, and musician, and they can be armed with either&nbsp;hand weapons and shields, great weapons, or flails.</li>
	<li>10x Chaos Marauder Horesmen that can be built as 1 unit of 10, or 2 units of 5, each with a horsemaster (champion), musician, and standard bearer, and they can be armed with either cavalry spears, or flails.</li>
	<li>2x new Warriors of Chaos transfer sheets, each containing 246 Norscan tribes icons and rune decals.</li>
</ul><figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-the-old-world-chaos-marauders-reinforcement-set-3.jpg?itok=Faas2KC5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-the-old-world-chaos-marauders-reinforcement-set-3.jpg?itok=JERmuLXY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The new command units for the Chaos Marauders really stand out against the rest of the unit.</figcaption></figure><p>The multitude of weaponry and head options means that you can create several unique-looking units with the set, and the option to have all units (6 if split into their smallest forms) with a champion, standard bearer, and musician is great for optionality. The Chaos Marauders are also now on 30x30mm bases (25x25mm base before), which they fill, so they look a lot more beefier than before, accurately reflecting the battle-hardened warriors that they are. I love the Marauder standard bearer with axe, he looks like an absolute unit, only held back from devastating his enemies because he's carrying a huge banner.</p>

<p>The new&nbsp;Arcane Journal: The Razing of Westerland, sold separately from the Mauraduers Reinforcement set, but containing their profiles, fits alongside the <em>Warhammer The Old World</em> Ravening Hordes rules for making your Warriors of Chaos army, supplementing and replacing some rules.</p>

<p>The book starts by detailing Frydaal the Chainmaker’s invasion of Westerland, along with a map of the invasion and background on the Marauder tribes and their 4 cults. It also includes a Path to Glory campaign, where players start with a small force and build up to full-sized armies over several linked games. You will need the Arcane Journal: The War of Settra’s Fury book as well, which details how to play the smaller-scale games that make up the first few campaign games. To supplement the campaign, the Razing of Westerland contains 3 scenarios that you can use in your Path to Glory campaign, reenacting&nbsp;the Chainmaker’s early battles in Westerland.</p>

<p>Arcane Journal: The Razing of Westerland also includes new profiles for Chaos Marauders and Marauder Horsemen, which replace those in Ravening Hordes. The main change is taking away the option to take a Chaos god mark and changing it to a mark of 1 of 4 Chaos Cults, either the Bloodied Hound, Carrion Crow, Slithering Serpent, or Fell Raptor. I prefer the Cult of the&nbsp;Bloodied Hound, which can gain the Marauders a +1 boost to their weapon skill once per game by passing a leadership test in the command phase, because if Chaos Marauders aren't attacking, what are they doing?</p>

<p>The journal also has a new magic lore for Chaos Sorcerers, Lore of the Shadowlands, which has spells like Shadowed Assailants, that deals 3D6 strength 1 hits to an enemy the caster is engaged with, with no armor or regeneration save allowed. The book closes with 18 new magic items that can be used by any Old World army.</p>

<p>The new Chaos Marauders and Marauder Horsemen miniatures are fantastic, and really capture the frozen waste barbarian nature of the warriors. The Chaos Marauders Reinforcement Set is a great way to start or expand your force with them, containing either 3 large units or 6 smaller ones, with full optionality, no matter how you spread your units. The Arcane Journal: The Razing of Westerland has some great background, and the Path to Glory campaign feels very in keeping with the Chaos Marauders campaign as they ravage Westerland. The new Cult and Chaotic Traits also allow you to flesh out your forces a lot more, giving some real individuality to your units and flexibility on the battlefield.</p>
