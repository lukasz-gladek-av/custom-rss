            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Sony and developer Arrowhead have announced a new&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Warbond by the name of Control Group, and as usual, this one's packing plenty of new gear to help you give those troublesome Terminids, Automatons, and Illuminate what for.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/10/helldivers-2-control-group-warbond-launches-july-17/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation Blog post</a>, Control Group launches across PC and PS5 on July 17th, which is next Thursday at time óf writing. The Warbond's first major addition is the VG-70 Variable, a three-mode gun with seven barrels. You can fire on auto, choose to fire one barrel at a time, or discharge all of your ammo at once.</p>

<p>A new support weapon, the PLAS-45 Epoch, will also be added as part of this Warbond. It fires a plasma sphere that will explode if you overcharge it, so as with many of&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>'s other weapons, you should be careful not to misuse this gun.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-control-group-warbond-plas-45-epoch.jpg?itok=nR3BijWt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-control-group-warbond-plas-45-epoch.jpg?itok=is0Iinli 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Control Group Warbond has plenty of new toys for you to try out.</figcaption></figure><p>A new electric grenade will also be introduced in the form of the G-31 Arc grenade, which discharges electricity that hits everything in its proximity. That includes your fellow Helldivers, so once again, be careful when it comes to friendly fire.</p>

<p>If you're one for turret deployment, then you may want to give the new&nbsp;A/LAS-98 Laser Sentry a try. It'll continuously fire a laser beam to devastate your enemies, but it will overheat and explode if it isn't put on cooldown, so you'll have to watch for that as well.</p>

<p>Most excitingly, the LIFT-182 Warp Pack allows you to teleport short distances without needing to jump. You should, however, be aware that the singularity you're generating with the pack will deteriorate with each jump, and you may "experience death should the singularity fully collapse". Uh-oh.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-control-group-warbond-warp-pack.jpg?itok=-mTcyGA4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-control-group-warbond-warp-pack.jpg?itok=h9kaFJQj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>What if I told you you could teleport short distances with the new&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Warbond?</figcaption></figure><p>As always, the new Warbond also brings some new armor for you to kit yourself out with, as well as new capes and other extras. Let it never be said you're not being given the opportunity to express your individuality within the Super Earth ranks.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>news, an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-xbox-series-xs-august" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S version</a> of the game was recently confirmed; it's launching in August, on the same day as both&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gears-of-war-reloaded-announced" rel="nofollow">Gears of War: Reloaded</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-ps5-release-date-enhancements" rel="nofollow">Senua's Saga: Hellblade II</a>&nbsp;</em>land on the PS5.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nba-2k26-announced</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nba-2k26-announced-for-september-switch-2-version-also-coming.1240287/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>2K has announced that&nbsp;<em>NBA 2K26</em>, the latest installment in the long-running&nbsp;<em>NBA 2K&nbsp;</em>series of basketball sim games, will be launching in September, and that the game is coming to the Nintendo Switch 2 as well.</p>

<p>Judging by the <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250709742024/en/NBA-2K26-Unveils-2025-MVP-and-Finals-MVP-Shai-Gilgeous-Alexander-WNBA-All-Star-Angel-Reese-and-Hall-of-Famer-Carmelo-Anthony-as-Cover-Athletes" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a> in which the game was revealed, the Switch 2 version will boast the same features as the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions, so for the first time in many years, Nintendo's platform won't be getting the last-gen edition.</p>

<p>Those features include an updated ProPLAY system, which 2K says will allow you to "experience the immersive technology like never before", as well as the City hub, the WNBA-focused The W game mode, and the MyNBA mode, in which you can lead your own franchise to legendary status.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nba-2k26-shai-gilgeous-alexander.jpg?itok=yy1vmEts 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nba-2k26-shai-gilgeous-alexander.jpg?itok=0L2guqkw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>NBA 2K26&nbsp;</em>will feature Shai Gilgeous-Alexander as its cover star.</figcaption></figure><p>The cover athlete for the Standard Edition of&nbsp;<em>NBA 2K26&nbsp;</em>will be none other than Oklahoma City Thunder point guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, while WNBA star Angel Reese will adorn the cover of the GameStop-exclusive WNBA Edition of the game. Finally, the Superstar Edition's cover star is Hall of Famer Carmelo Anthony.</p>

<p>As well as all of the above, 2K says you can look forward to "a reimagined MyCAREER journey" in&nbsp;<em>NBA 2K26</em>, in addition to "a fresh and more optimized City" in the current-gen versions of the game. This iteration's MyNBA mode will feature "30 unique storylines", as 2K tells it.</p>

<p>Otherwise, you know what to expect from&nbsp;<em>NBA 2K26&nbsp;</em>if you're a fan of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nba-2k25-release-date" rel="nofollow">the series</a>:&nbsp;a slick basketball sim with plenty of improvements and new features, plus the usual egregious microtransactions, I'd imagine. You can check out the debut trailer for the game right here.</p>




<p><em>NBA 2K26&nbsp;</em>launches across PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch consoles on September 5th. Picking up the Superstar Edition or the Leave No Doubt Edition of the game will allow you to check it out a week early, as has become customary among new releases.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Subnautica 2 Delayed to 2026, New Gameplay Trailer Revealed]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/subnautica-2-delayed-2026</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/subnautica-2-delayed-to-2026-new-gameplay-trailer-revealed.1240257/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Krafton has announced that upcoming underwater survival sequel&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>has been delayed to next year, but we've got a new gameplay trailer to keep us going in the meantime.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1962700/view/528724684296950298" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on Steam, Krafton and developer Unknown Worlds (which Krafton <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pubg-owner-krafton-buys-subnautica-dev-unknown-worlds" rel="nofollow">acquired back in 2021</a>) say that while early player feedback convinced the studios they were "swimming in the right direction", more development time is needed to "improve" in "a few areas", as well as to provide "a little bit more content" for the Early Access release.</p>

<p>This new content will, according to Krafton, include "more biomes, more vehicle upgrades, additional tools", and an expanded story, as well as "more creatures to discover". Given the breadth of the biological phenomena in the original&nbsp;<em>Subnautica</em>, I'd call that a good reason for a delay.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/subnautica-2-early-access-delayed-2026-lava.jpg?itok=98lLW2Ye 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/subnautica-2-early-access-delayed-2026-lava.jpg?itok=mWXu_PLk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Subnautica 2</em>'s Early Access release has been delayed.</figcaption></figure><p>Although&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2</em>'s Early Access release won't be happening in 2025 anymore, Krafton says it doesn't intend to change anything about the game's creative direction or the team working on it, although that presumably doesn't include the former leaders of Unknown Worlds, who <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/subnautica-developer-unknown-worlds-loses-leadership-team" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">left the studio</a> earlier this month. No reason was provided for their departure.</p>

<p>Additionally, Krafton says you can look forward to a new&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>devlog that will provide more information about the game soon, although it'll be coming out "a little later than intended".</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2</em>, it's the upcoming sequel to the 2018 survival game&nbsp;<em>Subnautica</em>, which has already had one standalone followup in the form of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/subnautica-below-zero" rel="nofollow">2021's&nbsp;<em>Below Zero</em></a>.</p>

<p>Unlike the original game,&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>will emphasize co-op play, although it will also feature a solo play option. The game will tell a new story set on a brand new planet full of strange aquatic life to discover (and run away from screaming, if it's anything like the first game).</p>




<p><em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>is due to launch for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1962700/Subnautica_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/subnautica-2/9PJPCB188SVG" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> via Early Access in 2026. Stay tuned for more.</p>
