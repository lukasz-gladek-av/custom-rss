            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-og-permanent-december<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic has announced that the popular&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>OG game mode is coming back, and this time, it won't be a temporary mode, so you'll be able to ask your friends "where we droppin?" whenever you like.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1856351379838701691" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Epic reveals that&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>OG will return on December 6th, and that it's "here to stay". You'll be able to "explore the OG map, collect OG loot, and relive OG seasons".</p>

<p>It sounds like the new, permanent version of&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>OG will function in a similar way to when this mode appeared as <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-og-drop-back-into-battle-royale-chapter-1?lang=en-US" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">part of the game's fourth season last year</a>, focusing on multiple seasons rather than a single point in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s history.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fortnite-og-permanent-shooting.jpg?itok=3TBk39WX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fortnite-og-permanent-shooting.jpg?itok=rM_jPV6K 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>OG is coming back, and this time, it's "here to stay".</figcaption></figure><p>We don't have much more info about the way&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>OG will work as a permanent game mode, but I expect it'll function similarly to experiences like&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Fortnite Festival</em>, i.e. as a menu option you can pick whenever you want to go back in time.</p>

<p>Epic had already announced that&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>OG <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-will-bring-back-og-in-2024-after-it-shattered-records-with-100-million-players" rel="nofollow">would return at some point</a> this year following the original OG run <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-achieves-biggest-day-ever-with-447-million-players-following-return-of" rel="nofollow">shattering player records in November 2023</a>. They had not, however, revealed that it would be a permanent mode rather than a limited-time seasonal affair.</p>

<p>In any case, if you and your friends want to relive the glory days of&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>(assuming you consider the original seasons to be those glory days, of course), then you now know when you'll be able to jump in and do just that.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fortnite-og-permanent-shotgun.jpg?itok=Dpf74Wxk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fortnite-og-permanent-shotgun.jpg?itok=0IKcvzxp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll soon be able to revisit&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s past whenever you want.</figcaption></figure><p>As a reminder, Epic recently consolidated all of its previously-disparate&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>battle passes, allowing you to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-battle-pass-xp-simplified" rel="nofollow">gain XP for any mode</a> when playing any other mode. That means if you're playing&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>OG, you're also amassing XP for the main battle royale mode,&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite</em>, and everything else.</p>

<p>OG&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>arrives on December 6th, presumably across all platforms on which the game is currently available. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-dungeon-masters-guide-review-true-dms-best-friend<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the most highly criticized books from 2014's <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3579fb91-ffa9-4c99-a750-de9f92ba642f" href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> release is the <em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em>. This book meant as a resource for DMs to craft their own worlds and adventures had issues with it's structure as well as efficiency of contents leading to a book that was cumbersome to get through. Now that we have our hands on the 2024 DMG how much of an improvement is it?</p>

<h2>Running A Game</h2>

<p>The first two sections of the DMG focus on running the game. The basic things that every DM should know and the rules and resolving outcomes. It might seem smart to begin at the beginning, but when the 2014 rulebook launched potentially new DMs into the rules with the pantheon of Gods this revised layout is great.</p>

<p>DMs will be taught what they need – players, dice, ways to make notes – and the preparation tools for running a session. Much like the revised <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ed2ad5c2-7b7b-4a5a-84ff-eb15f1121885" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-player-handbook-review-mixed-messaging-around-strong" rel="nofollow"><em>Player Handbook</em></a> the DMG also includes examples of play.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-5e-dmg-2024-running-the-game.jpg?itok=VgpNwqNG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-5e-dmg-2024-running-the-game.jpg?itok=f6Kr693O 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>These scripted session provide an example for the potential DM reading to not just understand what they need to be aware of, but also why they're making those choices. As the party heads into a dangerous location asking something simple like "Whose leading the way" doesn't just help the players, but it also means if that hidden monster is to jump out who will be the one getting ambushed.</p>

<p>This section also highlights how differently something can be ran at a table. This is very important, especially for new DMs, as you don't want to fall into the trap that there's one perfect way to run a D&amp;D game but instead try out a few different methods and see not only what works well for you, but also your table.</p>

<p>As this portion of the book continues there's an excellent balance of offering the DMs a wide variety of possibilities to pick from while also letting them know that they don't need to offer players the world. There are limits that DMs need to know to set, whether that be content limits or calming down disruptive players. I spoke about some of the good ways that the PHB subtly taught that DMs can say 'no' to a player while still enabling a fun game and it's in this section that you'll also learn that players should be respectful of you and your efforts.</p>

<p>This approach to teaching DMing, first in the tools you'll need and how to run the game, to the different expectations you should understand and accept for yourself but also all of your players is an excellent tact. It starts small, building up the game from the ground, without scaring a new DM with any big-picture ideas from the get-go.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-5e-dmg-2024-magical-items.jpg?itok=PgwHZKqj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-5e-dmg-2024-magical-items.jpg?itok=cH-rDs8D 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Enabling The DM To Create Wonders</h2>

<p>This DMG offers a LOT of different tools for DMs to fill their worlds with entertaining objects and obstacles. Here you'll find instructions for creating items for players to interact with like magic items and spells, as well as elements of the world like gods and settlements.</p>

<p>The range of things to learn, and a variety of their permutations was incredible. All of the things you could think you would need to build up a session or a world are present, and so many other things you might not have ever thought about. Want to run a chase sequence but need mechanics for it? What about if the magic potion wasn't brewed correctly and has a side effect? How should I balance the damage of a trap of my own design?</p>

<p>Most of these sections also have context for premade ideas, like traps, and then how to build them yourself. The DMG continues its methodology of showing you something to prompt your creativity, and then handing you the tools to carry your creation to the finish line.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-5e-dmg-2024-map-creation.jpg?itok=BrO0dxol 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-5e-dmg-2024-map-creation.jpg?itok=8Fi8aNw- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Building Your Own Adventures</h2>

<p>Forty two pages of the 2024 DMG are dedicated to the creation of Adventures, the generic term for a one-shot/smaller group of sessions, and for full-on Campaigns. Each of these sections details how you should go about creating the premise for the journey, how you can make the characters relevant to the world, and how you can plan encounters to be driving the plot forward.</p>

<p>This is a must-read section for DMs of any level of experience. Does well to explain and highlight the collaborative nature of storytelling in D&amp;D, not just an adventure for the DM to write for the party to read but how they can all influence the world that they'll be joining.</p>

<p>This section also highlights important aspects of planning for multiple avenues of problem solving and how to get players more invested.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-5e-dmg-2024-greyhawk.jpg?itok=hh2ISjNc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-5e-dmg-2024-greyhawk.jpg?itok=NXAPNtbl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>I also appreciated how it demonstrated that you could use the book to build a competent and fun adventure, and then string it to another, and another, and another to create a campaign that successfully builds upon itself, but it fun for everyone the whole way. It's not just about the destination or the journey, but both.</p>

<h2>Campaign Setting, Some Assembly Required</h2>

<p>A campaign setting for Greyhawk has been included as a reference for the DM to craft adventures within. This is a great setting off point.</p>

<p>This section gives a good overview of the regions and major locations of Greyhawk as well as cultural information like local gods, and a map of the world. It feels like a nice blueprint for any of the adventures that reading through the prior segments could be built up from.</p>

<p>That being said this isn't going to be a comprehensive guide to the ins and outs of Greyhawk, a DM will still need to do a lot of fill up this world as their players continue to progress through it.</p>

<h2>Bastion Sweet Bastion</h2>

<p>The final major section details Bastions, a returning mechanic from older editions of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> that allows the party to create a "home base" that they will likely call home between adventures. Bastion's can be introduced as early as level 5 and will continue to grow with the party.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-5e-dmg-2024-bastions.jpg?itok=I7rJhOYi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-5e-dmg-2024-bastions.jpg?itok=rKh595mq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This is a really fun way to allow your party to have a piece of the world to call their own, something that players of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="76148372-10c1-43b3-929d-4f8aa273a684" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-waterdeep-dungeon-of-mad-mage-board-game-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Waterdeep: Dragon Heist</em></a> might be familiar with but with a whole lot more practical uses.</p>

<p>Bastion's start as a blank slate, but can be leveled up with different facilities that can offer all kinds of amazing effects. A meditation hall that can offer advantage on saving throws, a workshop to crate new tools, or a place to craft Spell Scrolls.</p>

<p>This adds further to the idea that was important in shaping the adventure, it's not just a story for the DM to write, but a place where all players are collaboratively able to craft a world and adventure together.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-5e-dmg-2024-curses.jpg?itok=RoQKWDAr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-5e-dmg-2024-curses.jpg?itok=AEaZD9EK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2><em>Dungeon Master's Guide 2024</em> Review | Final Thought</h2>

<p>The <em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em> has managed to completely eclipse it's predecessor and become exactly what this book is meant to be, a guide (and best friend) to the Dungeon Master. Actually playing the game will be on your shoulders to do, but this book offers everything you need to know before become a DM, clear instructions not just how to run a game but the variety of ways a game can be run, and mechanics behind almost everything that your players will interact with in the world.</p>

<p>It's laid out well, features plenty of alternative ways of learning, and is quick to reference those minor details mid-game. This does feel like an upgrade in all ways, while you might not want to pick up the new PHB immediately, the DMG is definitely a must purchase for a DM planning their next session.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/raid-shadow-legends-developer-bought-620m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Raid: Shadow Legends&nbsp;</em>developer Plarium has been acquired by Swedish entertainment conglomerate Modern Times Group, and the amount for which the studio was acquired may well surprise you.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.mtg.com/press-releases/mtg-acquires-plarium-developer-of-global-1-mobile-rpg-raid-shadow-legends-and-strengthens-mobile-gaming-position/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a press release</a>, MTG (that's Modern Times Group, of course, not&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering</em>) acquired Plarium for a staggering $620 million, of which $20 million will be deferred to 2026.</p>

<p>That goes to show just how huge the mobile gaming business still is (although, of course,&nbsp;<em>Raid: Shadow Legends&nbsp;</em>is also available on PC). We're not quite in the realms of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-acquires-zynga-to-strengthen-mobile-gaming-division" rel="nofollow">Take-Two's monumental Zynga acquisition</a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-activision-blizzard-merger-finalized" rel="nofollow">Microsoft's huge Activision Blizzard merger</a>, but $620 million is not to be sniffed at.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/raid-shadow-legends-developer-acquired-combat.jpg?itok=9RDRq_Sp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/raid-shadow-legends-developer-acquired-combat.jpg?itok=62ml8zur 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Raid: Shadow Legends&nbsp;</em>is big money, believe it or not.</figcaption></figure><p>The amount for which Plarium was acquired might sound like a lot, but as MTG points out, the studio "generated $613 million in revenues" between September 2023 and September 2024, so the purchase is worth roughly one year of Plarium's revenue.</p>

<p>The group says that Plarium's "tech and deep expertise in live-ops, marketing and monetization" will benefit its "performance over the long term", and that the acquisition will "substantially improve MTG's already strong cash flow generation".</p>

<p>If you're only familiar with&nbsp;<em>Raid: Shadow Legends&nbsp;</em>from interstitial ads and sponsorship deals, then you may not know just how big a deal it is, but suffice it to say that the game does pretty well for itself financially.</p>

<p>Back in July 2022, it was revealed that&nbsp;<em>Raid: Shadow Legends&nbsp;</em>had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/youtube-meme-raid-shadow-legends-passes-1-billion-milestone" rel="nofollow">passed $1 billion in overall revenue</a>, and while that doesn't quite put it on the level of a mega-hit like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tencent-has-worlds-first-10-billion-dollar-mobile-game" rel="nofollow">Tencent's&nbsp;<em>Honor of Kings</em></a>, those are certainly big-league numbers.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mech-arena-plarium-raid-shadow-legends-developer.jpg?itok=z3Ilrput 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mech-arena-plarium-raid-shadow-legends-developer.jpg?itok=aEgLwAog 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Raid: Shadow Legends&nbsp;</em>isn't Plarium's only game, believe it or not.</figcaption></figure><p>Although Plarium is mainly known for&nbsp;<em>Raid: Shadow Legends</em>, the company does have other games as well, including free-to-play PvP shooter&nbsp;<em>Mech Arena&nbsp;</em>and casual puzzler&nbsp;<em>Merge Gardens</em>, among others.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what MTG's acquisition of Plarium yields, but it's unlikely to change the latter's business practices in any meaningful way. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/antstream-net-yaroze-games</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/antstream-net-yaroze-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Retro arcade streaming platform Antstream has announced that it has added five games from the cult classic PlayStation-era&nbsp;Net Yaroze<em>&nbsp;</em>initiative to its game catalog.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;Net Yaroze, it was essentially an early way of allowing bedroom developers to create games for the original PlayStation without needing to utilize "expensive and complex development kits", as a press release notes.</p>

<p>Those who were interested in&nbsp;Net Yaroze<em>&nbsp;</em>would have to pay a fee in order to receive a special PlayStation console, alongside software designed to help them realize their game creation dreams. They'd also gain access to technical help from Sony and a community of fellow&nbsp;Net Yaroze<em>&nbsp;</em>developers.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/net-yaroze-antstream-announcement-arena.jpg?itok=UH5cPff5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/net-yaroze-antstream-announcement-arena.jpg?itok=UPFoQBQb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Net Yaroze allowed bedroom programmers to make their own games, such as the mech shooter&nbsp;<em>Arena</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>As an accompanying Antstream press release notes, these games weren't released commercially, and many of them are now considered to be lost since they haven't been made available in any shape or form since the late 90s.</p>

<p>Now, however, the streaming service has added five Net Yaroze games to its library, and Antstream CEO Steve Cottam says the service will "continue working with these fantastic creators and developers to continue to bring new titles to the Antstream platform", so more may well be on the way.</p>

<p>Here are the five Net Yaroze games that have been made available on Antstream.</p>

<ul><li><em>Time Slip&nbsp;</em>(puzzle-platformer in which you must manipulate time to clear stages)</li>
	<li><i>Pushy IIb&nbsp;</i>(block-pushing puzzler)</li>
	<li><em>Bouncer 2&nbsp;</em>(brick-breaking arcade-style game with "difficult physics-based challenges")</li>
	<li><em>Adventure Game&nbsp;</em>(exploration-heavy action RPG with dungeons, puzzles, and monsters to fight)</li>
	<li><em>Arena&nbsp;</em>(fast-paced mech shooter with a focus on multiplayer)</li>
</ul>


<p>The Net Yaroze initiative is far from the only element of old-school gaming to be threatened by the march of time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In recent years, enthusiastic fans have intervened to preserve the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/viva-pinata-pocket-paradise-prototype-preserved-by-forest-of-illusion" rel="nofollow">a prototype of DS game&nbsp;<em>Viva Pinata: Pocket Paradise</em></a>, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/toontown-online-preserved-in-massive-preservation-effort" rel="nofollow">Disney MMO&nbsp;<em>Toowntown Online</em></a>, and even <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/free-wordle-launched-to-preserve-wordle-if-paywall-goes-up" rel="nofollow">the word game&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/free-wordle-launched-to-preserve-wordle-if-paywall-goes-up" rel="nofollow">Wordle</a>&nbsp;</em>(following on from its purchase by the New York Times).</p>
