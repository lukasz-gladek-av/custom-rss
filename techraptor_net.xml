            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Digital gaming storefront and preservation platform GOG is being acquired by original co-founder Michał Kiciński, who's also one of the original founders of what is now GOG's former parent company CD Projekt.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.gog.com/blog/gog-is-getting-acquired-by-its-original-co-founder-what-it-means-for-you/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">blog post</a> on the GOG website, the GOG team confirm that the platform is being purchased by Kiciński, but they say that the acquisition is about "doubling down" on the platform's vision of games that "truly belong to [players], forever".</p><p>According to the GOG team, "DRM-free [gaming] is more central to GOG than ever", and the platform's relationship with ex-parent CD Projekt isn't changing either; games by development wing CD Projekt Red will continue to be released on GOG, but the company will no longer own the storefront.</p><figure role="group">

<p>In an accompanying FAQ, the GOG team says Kiciński wants to "preserve and grow the original philosophy behind GOG", namely to "preserve the classics of the past, celebrate standout games of today, and help shape the classics of tomorrow".</p><p>The team says that nothing about your GOG account or library will change, and that games released on the platform will remain free of DRM. Not only that, but your tips and GOG Patron contributions won't be shared with Kiciński or "any other party".</p><p>Contrary to what you might think this means, GOG says it isn't "financially unstable"; quite the contrary, in fact. The team says it's "had a really encouraging year" and that gamers have shown "more enthusiasm" towards its preservation mission than ever before.</p><p>In short, then, it sounds like nothing about the material GOG experience will change for you, but that ownership has shifted from <em>Cyberpunk </em>and <em>The Witcher </em>parent company CD Projekt to a single individual.</p>
<p>This news comes just over a year after the launch of GOG's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gog-preservation-program" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="49bcc6ab-0733-4268-b4a1-fbca131f31d8" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Preservation Program</a>, which aims to keep games included within the program supported forever, regardless of whether their publishers offer official support or not.</p><p>Thus far, the program has welcomed the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dino-crisis-1-2-gog-rerelease" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9a82244a-daae-4a5c-94f2-821248b6e6ac" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Dino Crisis</em></a>, a number of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gog-preservation-program-star-wars" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b9582af4-89df-40af-a357-77086a6b5d38" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">classic <em>Star Wars </em>titles</a>, and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fear-gog-preservation-program-monolith" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4a9834ae-5242-49af-aab8-734dc54bff46" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">horror shooter <em>F.E.A.R.</em></a>, which was added to the Preservation Program following the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monolith-productions-and-more-reportedly-closed-by-wb-games" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2740ba12-58e7-403b-9c62-fdf3360d20e2" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">unexpected closure of developer Monolith</a> earlier this year.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <guid>1393738</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publishers MangaGamer and Kagura Games have announced that they've teamed up with developer AliceSoft to bring the legendary eroge series <em>Rance </em>to Steam.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.kaguragames.com/rance-is-finally-coming-to-steam/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">news post</a> on the Kagura Games website, the studio confirms that it'll be releasing a number of <em>Rance </em>games on Steam, although there seems to be a bit of a question mark hanging over exactly which <em>Rance </em>titles will be available on Valve's platform.</p><p>Kagura says it's bringing the following <em>Rance </em>games to Steam: <em>Rance 01 + 02 </em>(as a package), <em>Rance 03</em>, <em>Rance IX</em>, <em>Rance X</em>, <em>Rance Quest Magnum</em>, <em>Rance IV</em>, and <em>Sengoku Rance</em>. The presence of <em>Rance IV </em>on this list is a little strange, however, given that the game doesn't appear to be available anywhere else in an official English translation.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>The <em>Rance </em>games are coming to Steam.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It's possible that <em>Rance IV</em>'s inclusion is a typo; after all, a quick <em>Rance </em><a href="https://www.kaguragames.com/?s=rance+&amp;post_type=product" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">search</a> on the official Kagura Games website turns up a listing for <em>Rance VI + 5D</em>, and MangaGamer's <a href="https://www.mangagamer.com/r18/product_list.php?opt=search&amp;page=1&amp;goods_type=1&amp;keyword=Rance" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">site</a> also lists <em>VI + 5D </em>for sale. What's more, the new trailer advertising the series' Steam release shows clips from <em>Rance VI + 5D</em> rather than <em>IV</em>.</p><p>However, the head of the AliceSoft Discord channel insists that the listing isn't a typo, so it's also possible that <em>Rance IV </em>will be getting its first official localization as part of this swathe of re-releases. Either way, <em>Rance </em>fans are eating pretty well right now, it seems.</p><p>Given Valve's eagerness to remove adult-oriented content from Steam, even when said content's themes seemingly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/horses-steam-ban-indie-horror" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a4a11cd5-8771-4a5c-86ba-ff196e272f59" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">directly explore adult subjects</a> in an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vile-exhumed-steam-removed-sexual-content" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3d619c44-1572-4d4c-9fdf-64af4c3b37db" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">artistic rather than exploitative way</a>, it seems strange that the <em>Rance </em>series' re-release has made it through the company's approval process.</p><p>In the past, however, Kagura has released other AliceSoft eroge titles with a patch to remove censorship available through the publisher's official website, so it's possible that this is how the <em>Rance </em>series will work as well.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see exactly what Kagura and MangaGamer have in store for <em>Rance</em>. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

<p>News of <em>Fantasy Life i</em>'s new sales milestone comes just a few days after Level-5 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-update-roguelike-snoozaland" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="716e5f4e-dad0-4c92-b64f-d4ec891904fa" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">released a brand new update for the game</a>, allowing you to explore a huge roguelike area complete with intimidating bosses and enemies to face.</p><p><em>Fantasy Life i </em>also isn't Level-5's only major success this year; soccer RPG <em>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</em>, which has been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/inazuma-eleven-heroes-great-road-delayed-until-2021" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="291efc63-1f35-4892-bcb7-01502230543a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">a long time</a> in the making, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-sales-500k" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="60aad754-fdd9-4d60-bb74-1251bf703db7" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">passed 500,000 sales</a> within its first week of release, so it seems that Level-5's star is once again in ascendancy.</p><p>If you're unfamiliar with <em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</em>, it's the followup to the 2012 3DS action RPG <em>Fantasy Life</em>, and it builds on many of the ideas in that game, including the Life system, which allows you to experience your adventure across a variety of gathering, crafting, and combat jobs.</p><p><em>Fantasy Life i </em>is technically a sequel, but it can be enjoyed wholly independently of the first game; short of some references you might not understand, you won't miss anything if you don't check out the original first.</p>
