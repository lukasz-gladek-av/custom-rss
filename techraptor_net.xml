            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-the-veilguard-character-creator-free<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA and BioWare have announced how they're planning to celebrate&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>Day, and the celebrations include a free version of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>'s character creator, plus more.</p>

<p>Over on the official&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.ea.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/da-day-2024" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">blog</a>, EA and BioWare say they're commemorating&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>Day, which falls on December 4th each year, with "several activities", starting with a fourth patch for&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>.</p>

<p>We don't know what's in that patch yet; at time of writing, the <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/patch-4-release-notes" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">link in the blog to the patch notes</a> is dead. Still, hopefully, said patch notes will be updated later in the day, so you'll be able to see what's coming to&nbsp;<em>The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>then.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-character-creator-free-archer.jpg?itok=DeAMRTWx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-character-creator-free-archer.jpg?itok=KovWiz9Z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>'s character creator is being released for free.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as Patch 4, you're also getting&nbsp;<em>The Veilguard</em>'s character creator for free. That's right; starting today, you'll apparently be able to download and try out the full character creator before buying the game.</p>

<p>It's not available at time of writing, but like Patch 4, I'm expecting it'll be made available as the day goes on. You'll be able to try it out on all platforms on which&nbsp;<em>The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>is available.</p>

<p>EA and BioWare say there's no time limit on the Character Creator, either; you can try it out for as long as you like so that you can get the perfect Rook ahead of starting your adventure.</p>

<p>Lastly, BioWare is also gifting every <i>The Veilguard&nbsp;</i>owner with a special set of armor and cosmetics reminiscent of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age 2</em>'s protagonist Hawke. You'll need to download Patch 4 and complete "The Singing Blade" to grab your cosmetics.</p>




<p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>is the latest game in EA and BioWare's&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>series. It sees protagonist Rook attempting to stop two elven gods from conquering the world while also dealing with the machinations of elven trickster Solas.</p>

<p>The game represents <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-gameplay-trailer" rel="nofollow">something of a departure</a> from&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age</em>'s traditional RPG leanings; it's arguably more of an action-adventure game with RPG elements, so if you're a <em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>fan, bear that in mind before you pick it up.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Bleach: Rebirth of Souls Release Date Revealed for March]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bleach-rebirth-of-souls-release-date-revealed-for-march.1051698/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bleach-rebirth-of-souls-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has revealed the release date for upcoming anime fighting game&nbsp;<em>Bleach: Rebirth of Souls</em>, which promises to offer the chance to engage in battles just like the ones you've seen in the manga and anime.</p>

<p>Per a new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Bleach: Rebirth of Souls&nbsp;</em>will arrive on March 21st. It's heading to PC and consoles, but like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gamescom-onl-2024-switch" rel="nofollow">many games launching in the next year or so</a>, it seems to be skipping the Switch.</p>

<p>Many characters from&nbsp;<em>Bleach&nbsp;</em>are set to make an appearance in&nbsp;<em>Rebirth of Souls</em>, including Ichigo, Kenpachi Zaraki, and Renji Abarai, among others. If you're a&nbsp;<em>Bleach&nbsp;</em>fan, then it's likely your favorite fighter will make the cut.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bleach-rebirth-of-souls-release-date-ichigo-renji.jpg?itok=95Ar6YLL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bleach-rebirth-of-souls-release-date-ichigo-renji.jpg?itok=Kkf9mIWh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Bleach: Rebirth of Souls&nbsp;</em>promises to be the definitive&nbsp;<em>Bleach&nbsp;</em>arena fighter.</figcaption></figure><p>Each character in&nbsp;<em>Bleach: Rebirth of Souls&nbsp;</em>will have access to unique sword abilities to help them turn the tide of combat, just as you'd expect.</p>

<p>Bandai Namco is also promising that&nbsp;<em>Rebirth of Souls&nbsp;</em>will allow you to use a single strike to "spell defeat for your opponent", so it sounds like you'll need to have your wits about you to avoid getting put down before the fight has even begun.</p>

<p>Additionally, as battles progress, you'll "unlock new forms and new blades" to help you snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. In short, it sounds like the game is aiming to mimic the desperate last-gasp shonen fights for which&nbsp;<em>Bleach&nbsp;</em>became so well-known.</p>

<p>You can check out the new release date trailer for&nbsp;<em>Bleach: Rebirth of Souls&nbsp;</em>right here.</p>




<p>This isn't&nbsp;<em>Bleach</em>'s first foray into the world of video games, although it's arguably the first major 3D arena fighter to be based on the property (if, that is, you <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-jump-force-trailer-shows-off-bleach-characters-pretty-visuals" rel="nofollow">don't count&nbsp;<em>Jump Force</em></a>, which I'm assuming a lot of folks would rather not do).</p>

<p><em>Bleach: Rebirth of Souls&nbsp;</em>is set to launch for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1689620/BLEACH_Rebirth_of_Souls/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10001710" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/bleach-rebirth-of-souls-pre-order/9MW2PF98HPNG/0017/9VHRG4FW3X1N" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on March 21st.</p>
