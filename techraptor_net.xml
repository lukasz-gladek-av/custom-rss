            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/silent-hill-2-remake-revives-classic<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I recently got through my first playthrough of the <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake and greatly enjoyed it. I was concerned about Bloober Team helming this project given their body of work as well as Konami's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/konami-bloober-team-horror-game" rel="noopener" target="_blank">patchy publishing history</a>. Consider this me happily eating crow as promised.</p>

<p>This 2024 re-imagining of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/best-gaming-sequel-silent-hill-2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">survival horror masterpiece</a> is undeniably a topic of discussion. With an 86 Metacritic score and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-1m" rel="noopener" target="_blank">over 1 million copies</a> sold, this remake pulls off an impeccable job retaining the spirit of the original work and adding embellishments to its core. In doing so, they have helped breathe new life into the iconic haunted town.</p>

<p><strong><em>Note: This article will contain both gameplay and story spoilers for Silent Hill 2. Read at your own discretion.</em></strong></p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/silent-hill-2-remake-angela-.jpg?itok=hTjfmA7E 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/silent-hill-2-remake-angela-.jpg?itok=f2-lT-Z8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Her story still has a sad place in my heart.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Narrative and Character Changes in the <em>Silent Hill 2</em> Remake</h2>

<p>After two decades of distance, the fact <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/silent-hill-2" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Silent Hill 2</em></a> remains one of the most haunting and impactful games ever is a testament to its quality. It has been analyzed and dissected&nbsp;fervently since its release thanks to its Lynchian tone, surreal dreamlike atmosphere, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/why-silent-hill-soundtrack-deserves-much-more-credit" rel="noopener" target="_blank">masterful musical score</a>, complex characters, grotesquely symbolic creature designs, and a darkly mature story involving terminal illness, trauma, and guilt.</p>

<p>James Sunderland's descent into Silent Hill this time is enhanced by modern graphics technology and higher production values. While it does remove the endearingly stilted awkwardness of the original, it does allow this remake opportunities to reframe elements of the original.</p>

<p>One character left mostly unchanged by these modern touches is Angela Orosco. Given the dumb <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/silent-hill-2-angela-redesign-not-supposed-to-be-hot/">culture war nonsense</a> kicked up around her character design and deeply unsettling themes at play regarding domestic abuse and assault, that's a good thing.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/silent-hill-2-remake-eddie-with-gun.jpg?itok=4WmoDDbv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/silent-hill-2-remake-eddie-with-gun.jpg?itok=D6MFVx8a 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A lot of his dialogue has been reworked, but his story is still tragic.</figcaption></figure><p>Eddie Dombrowski is greatly enhanced by the more sophisticated performance capture on display. In every scene he's in, Eddie's breath is visible, like he is somewhere cold. But he never remarks on or reacts to the cold. This is illustrated in a scene in an abandoned movie theater where Eddie is eating a tub of ice cream barehanded.</p>

<p>It's a touch that confirms a fan theory, that Eddie is experiencing a different version of Silent Hill, possibly a frozen industrial landscape similar to the meat locker where his boss fight takes place. On balance, it's the most light of narrative changes.</p>

<p>But Bloober Team takes several major swings in the <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake with Maria. Maria is one of the most fascinating characters in the series. She's a deceptively complex blend of damsel and antagonistic force, cruel temptress and obsessive possessive.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/silent-hill-2-remake-james-and-maria-in-garden.jpg?itok=5gx95ilm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/silent-hill-2-remake-james-and-maria-in-garden.jpg?itok=WyQDkcoA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This could have easily felt so forced. But it didn't.</figcaption></figure><p>In the <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake, Maria is given a bit more character. This is done through smaller elements peppered throughout the game, but the most substantive scene happens in the garden.</p>

<p>Maria tells James of a local legend: a tale of a woman exiled for being a witch who is visited by a man in secret. The man dies one day during a planned rendezvous, but the woman continues to hold a vigil for him.</p>

<p>For first-timers, it can be seen as an on-the-nose parallel to James' journey through Silent Hill, framing it as a tale of eternal love. For those familiar with James' tale, it's a narrative red herring, a pleasant lie meant to hide the messier, more human end to that story.</p>

<p>From Maria's perspective, the story can be seen as a tragic story of someone holding desperately onto a happy ending that will never come. It not only foreshadows the game's final battle, it frames Maria as a more tragic figure.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/silent-hill-2-remake-james-with-maria-in-labyrinth.jpg?itok=qEwrfgcc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/silent-hill-2-remake-james-with-maria-in-labyrinth.jpg?itok=n3Rbm5TZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>We see his face now. The pained contemplation of listening to Maria.</figcaption></figure><p>Then there's James himself. Luke Roberts gives a quiet, deeply broken performance in the lead role, which is put to great effect in the <em>Silent Hill 2 </em>remake thanks to advanced performance-capture technology and high-fidelity assets fitting a modern AAA production.</p>

<p>It's a performance put to great effect in the remake's two new endings. The first one, the Bliss ending, is a mix of fan service and commentary on nostalgia. Before watching the tape that reveals the truth behind his wife's fate, James drinks a vial of White Claudia, a potion from earlier <em>Silent Hill</em> games. When the tape turns on, James is transported into the world of the tape, trapped forever in a nostalgic memory of halcyon days.</p>

<p>Given the passionate reverence of the <em>Silent Hill</em> fandom towards its earliest titles, it's an ending with more bite on closer inspection—literally drinking in the past to the point that there is no future.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/silent-hill-2-remake-stillness-ending.jpg?itok=u9Qs7plC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/silent-hill-2-remake-stillness-ending.jpg?itok=l197sx3k 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Grief can take many forms.</figcaption></figure><p>The second new ending, Stillness, might be the most depressing one. James is essentially broken by his guilt. He doesn't read Mary's final letter to him and begins to cry in his car as rain falls, all while Mary appears in the backseat, whispering comfort. It ends ambiguously with the screen cutting to black followed by the sound of the car revving, followed by a crash.</p>

<p>It's an ending that seems to confirm another long-held fan theory—that Mary's body was in James' car the whole time—as well as shows an ending for James that stands alongside the others' resolutions of emotional catharsis, self-destruction, toxic codependence, and gonzo absurdity.</p>

<p>Taken as a whole, these narrative changes and embellishments show a refined maturity to <em>Silent Hill's</em> storytelling, one that doesn't shy away from the messy humanity of its characters without falling into melodrama or nihilistic pitch darkness.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/silent-hill-2-remake-enemy-in-front-of-tv.jpg?itok=7xgWlLzn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/silent-hill-2-remake-enemy-in-front-of-tv.jpg?itok=Ad1L9f_M 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I don't want to waste ammo, but I don't want to get closer.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Gameplay Changes in the <em>Silent Hill 2</em> Remake</h2>

<p>The core gameplay of the <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake is where Bloober Team's greatest challenges lie. After all, the narrative of the original is beloved; the gameplay not so much.</p>

<p>The remake's core gameplay follows the AAA prestige game trend. It is characterized by a third-person camera with over-the-shoulder shooting broken up with light puzzle-solving and action set pieces.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/silent-hill-2-remake-locked-box.jpg?itok=7j-qbX-b 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/silent-hill-2-remake-locked-box.jpg?itok=Pj7X6VXQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>At least James writes down keys and number combinations now. Otherwise, this would be annoying.</figcaption></figure><p>Generally, it's a change that has made the game more accessible but may have sanded down some of the original's eccentric edges.</p>

<p>There is a greater emphasis on combat. James doesn't just fire guns, he frantically dodges and strikes with melee weapons. These desperate struggles are mostly intense bouts of flailing and screaming, but certain enemy encounters can be too frequent.</p>

<p>This action shift can greatly exhaust the player near the end and greatly dilute the monster designs' intended unsettling visual impact. Getting jumped by one mannequin is scary. Getting jumped by 20? Less so.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/silent-hill-2-remake-combat.jpg?itok=5o-TjfW1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/silent-hill-2-remake-combat.jpg?itok=k-MPEUtn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Swing, swing, dodge, chug health potion, stomp til dead.</figcaption></figure><p>As for puzzles, the original's notoriously esoteric key-hunting sections are either streamlined or removed in the <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake. A few of them are even referenced in easter eggs. This is good for mitigating player frustration but does make the experience less surreal.</p>

<p>Thankfully, the level design picks up the slack. Taking advantage of modern hardware, the Otherworld sections can expand into unsettling liminal hellscapes in mere seconds, making you question your surroundings with the logic of a nightmare. The absolute standout is the revamped prison section in the game's second half.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/silent-hill-2-remake-pyramid-head.jpg?itok=enYetv0Q 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/silent-hill-2-remake-pyramid-head.jpg?itok=QE3HsG43 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Stop shooting and run!</figcaption></figure><p>Lastly, each major boss fight in the game is a multi-phase gauntlet, complete with escalating dangers and evolving combat arenas, making them bombastic compared to the original's quick and unpleasant fights.</p>

<p>But despite these changes, the <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake still feels unique. There are even some areas where the spectacle adds to the horror. A personal highlight is the revamped Abstract Daddy boss fight, an arena that starts in claustrophobic corridors before exploding into a twisted labyrinth of industrial metal and flesh.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/silent-hill-2-remake-james-and-pit.jpg?itok=TwzrOoP3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/silent-hill-2-remake-james-and-pit.jpg?itok=iQPpUGZP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>How much further can we descend? Let's find out.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Future of <em>Silent Hill</em></h2>

<p>While Konami's recent attempts to revive the series have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genvid-entertainment-announce-silent-hill-ascension-interactive-streaming-series" rel="noopener" target="_blank">been tepid</a>, Bloober Team managed something downright impossible with the <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake. There is a new generation of players interested in this series again, ones that can have measured and meaningful conversations with older players who were around for the original release.</p>

<p>With that interest may come a chance for new tales in this haunted town with new creative voices—the kind of nightmares that, if handled with the same care as this remake, will be ones worth revisiting again and again.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft's Year of Turmoil Continues With Weird NFT Game Launch]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-nft-game</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisofts-year-of-turmoil-continues-with-weird-nft-game-launch.1023111/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-nft-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has quietly released an NFT game by the unfortunate name of&nbsp;<em>Champions Tactics: Grimoria Chronicles</em>. Yes, you read that right, and no, you haven't blacked out and woken up in the year 2022.</p>

<p>The tactical RPG was released last week as a free-to-play PC game, but you'd be forgiven for missing its launch completely, because Ubisoft doesn't seem like it's particularly eager to market the game.</p>

<p>There's no mention of its launch on the studio's <a href="https://x.com/Ubisoft" rel="noopener" target="_blank">X (formerly Twitter) feed</a> from around launch day, nor does it appear on Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Ubisoft/videos" rel="noopener" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>, despite the fact that this is a game that was developed in-house by Ubisoft and not farmed out to a third party.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/champions-tactics-grimoria-chronicles-ubisoft.jpg?itok=t44WejQS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/champions-tactics-grimoria-chronicles-ubisoft.jpg?itok=nohDDi8D 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Champions Tactics: Grimoria Chronicles&nbsp;</em>is an NFT-based tactical RPG battler, and yes, it has launched this year.</figcaption></figure><p>As noted <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-just-quietly-launched-a-full-blown-nft-game" rel="noopener" target="_blank">by IGN</a>,&nbsp;<em>Champions Tactics</em>' NFT system comes in the form of buyable figurines, which you can technically also craft using in-game currency. This being an NFT game, though, I'm assuming its in-game economy will incentivize you to buy NFTs.</p>

<p>According to IGN, figurines (i.e. characters) in&nbsp;<em>Champions Tactics</em>' NFT marketplace range from around $7 to an eye-watering $63,000, although whether the seller actually expects players to pay that much is another matter.</p>

<p>You haven't turned over two pages at once here, either; this is absolutely a full-blown, honest-to-goodness NFT game launching in the year of our lord 2024.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, Ubisoft isn't the only company that's still got some skin in the NFT game. In August, Sony <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-launching-its-own-blockchain-for-nfts-and-play-to-earn-games">launched its own blockchain</a> for NFT and play-to-earn games, and last year, Sega <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/immensely-popular-classic-sega-franchise-will-become-nft-game">declared its intention</a> to create an NFT Web3 game based on an "immensely popular" franchise.</p>




<p>Still, NFTs don't exactly feel like the place Ubisoft needs to be in right now, especially given that the company is having a pretty rough year so far thanks to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-strike-investor-letter">investor threats</a>, major <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-february">game delays</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-lawsuit-data-policy">a lawsuit</a>, among other things.</p>

<p>That's not to mention the very public failure of&nbsp;<em>Skull &amp; Bones</em>, the long-awaited pirate MMO that limped out of the gate back in February to a lukewarm reception, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/skull-and-bones-review-dead-and-buried-already">not least from us</a>.</p>

<p>Whether or not&nbsp;<em>Champions Tactics: Grimoria Chronicles&nbsp;</em>(and don't blame yourself if you immediately forget that name after you close this article) goes anywhere remains to be seen, but if you want to, you can <a href="https://championstactics.ubisoft.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">check it out here</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Spooky Palworld Halloween Skins Arrive in Latest Update]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/spooky-palworld-halloween-skins</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/spooky-palworld-halloween-skins-arrive-in-latest-update.1023069/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/spooky-palworld-halloween-skins<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Pocketpair has released a set of seriously spooky&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>Halloween skins, with four of the game's Pals getting terrifying new looks just in time for tomorrow's scarefest.</p>

<p>The update sees Cattiva, Croajiro, Katress, and Pengullet getting different Halloween-themed looks, although in the case of Pengullet, the new skin might be stretching the definition of Halloween a touch.</p>

<p>Cattiva gets a new pumpkin-themed skin, while Croajiro gets an adorable-looking witch outfit. Katress gets some fetching spectacles to complement its already-Halloweeny look, and Pengullet gets a pirate costume. I guess pirates are sort of scary!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-halloween-croajiro-skin.jpg?itok=MitaJDNW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-halloween-croajiro-skin.jpg?itok=uyDM25Fe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Just look at this little guy. Aww.</figcaption></figure><p>All four of these skins are completely free of charge, and you should receive them the next time you boot up&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>, although naturally, you will need to have at least one of the Pals the skins are for in order to reap the benefits.</p>

<p>It's not just the Halloween skins that are coming as part of this update, either. The multiplayer text chat character limit has been "significantly relaxed", so you can now type longer messages to your friends.</p>

<p>Bug fixes, including memory leak patches and a fix for a strange PS5-specific issue wherein a tree would respawn inside a structure that's built over it, have also been implemented. The update is free to download now, so make sure you check it out.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>, it's an open-world survival game with a focus on creature-collecting and base-building.</p>

<p>Developed by Japanese studio Pocketpair, the game was released earlier this year to massive success, passing <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-25-million-players-matching-pokemon-scarlet-violet">the 25 million player mark</a> just a month or so after its release (although a day-one Game Pass release certainly didn't hurt those numbers).</p>

<p>The game has been remarked upon for its creatures' apparent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-palworld-trailers-show-more-pokemon-like-mayhem-how-you-cook-them">resemblance to Nintendo's&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>franchise</a>, and Nintendo itself has also apparently been taking notice; the gaming giant <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-palworld-pocketpair-lawsuit">is suing Pocketpair</a>&nbsp;for "patent infringement".</p>

<p><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/palworld-game-preview/9NKV34XDW014" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10011027" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and you can play it as part of Xbox Game Pass if you're a subscriber. A <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-mobile-version-krafton">mobile version is also apparently in development</a> at&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>publisher Krafton.</p>
