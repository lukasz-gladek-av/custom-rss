            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> boxed set has been announced. In collaboration with Netflix, Wizards of the Coast is producing <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Welcome to the Hellfire Club</em>, a box packed with adventures taken straight from the world of their hit series, <em>Stranger Things</em>.</p>



<p>In an official press release, Wizards of the Coast's Managing Game Director, Justice Arman, explained that <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Welcome to the Hellfire Club</em> is not unlike <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-dungeons-dragons-heroes-of-borderlands-starter-set-is-biggest-yet" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">other starter sets</a> available. It contains five pregenerated characters, four prewritten adventures, multiple monster and character tokens, and reference cards for different monsters, spells, and magic items.</p>

The adventures, monsters, and game pieces are all pulled straight from the Netflix series, Stranger Things. Specifically, the material is based on the character Eddie Munson from Season 4, the rock-music-loving head of the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> group, the Hellfire Club.</p>

<p><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Welcome to the Hellfire Club</em> is packed with inside references to the Netflix series. Every piece in the set is drawn in a distinct artstyle invoking the 1980s. The adventures will include creatures from the show like the Demobat and the Demodogs as well as a new creature from the Upside Down. In addition, each adventure is loosely based on <em>Stranger Things'</em> four seasons.</p>

<p>The set even includes a double-sided map of Greyhawkins, a fantasy world created by Munson. The name is a portmanteau of the iconic <em>D&amp;D</em> setting Greyhawk and Hawkins, the small town where <em>Stranger Things</em> is set.</p>

<p><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> has been a key part of <em>Stranger Things</em> since its debut in 2016. The main cast aren't just avid players, but promote the fantasy TTRPG's core values of communication and teamwork to confront larger-than-life threats. Several of the series' major antagonists even share names with certain <em>D&amp;D</em> baddies, like Demogorgon, Mind Flayers, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interview/liches-vecna-and-stranger-things-our-time-with-chris-perkins" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">and Vecna</a>.</p>

<p><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Welcome to the Hellfire Club</em> well release on October 7 at an MSRP of $49.99. The set will also be available digitally on D&amp;D Beyond. The release coincides with the premiere of Stranger Things' fifth and final season on November 26.</p>
