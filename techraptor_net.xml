            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Back at Summer Game Fest in June,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/crimson-desert-preview-jaw-droppingly-detailed-gameplay-depth" rel="nofollow">I played some <em>Crimson Desert</em></a> and my mind was blown with just how dense its systems were. At PAX West, I had the chance to play a near identical demo on a new build but with a different focus and learned so much more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Check out my previous preview linked above for information on the combat, as that is the same as what I experienced here. Suffice to say, it is complicated, dense, interconnected, and surprising.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>For The Sake of Immersion&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Interestingly, I was told they had four different people demoing the game at Summer Game Fest, each of them focusing on different aspects of the game to see how various previews would be written. Plus, they knew they would see some of us again at PAX West and other events, so they wanted to show us what wasn’t shown before.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So where I had been hyper focused on combat before, I now got to see a lot more of the little details in the world and focus on immersion in <em>Crimson Desert.</em> Like with the combat, how you interact with the world was given the same attention to detail.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The best way I can convey that is by just giving you a bunch of examples of what I saw and was shown.&nbsp;</p>

<p>First, one thing the team wanted to boast about was that they have the largest mocap studio in Asia, and they put it to use on every animation in the game. From the idle stuff in the background to the insane wrestling moves in combat, everything started in the mocap studio.</p>



<p>That has led to a lot of deliberate movements that really sell what you see on screen. Two soldiers reacting excitedly to seeing your character, Kliff, a famous mercenary, comes across as genuine and real. Kneeling down to repair a wheel on a cart, kicking it on just looks right.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is one of those things that sounds so boring to write out and talk about, but it’s one of those subtle things that you don’t notice but can have a big effect. There’s a big difference between clicking a button and suddenly the cart is repaired to seeing it put back together. In the latter, it feels like a real world and not a video game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That is the world the<em> Crimson Desert</em> team has put a lot of work into making. We spent a decent amount of time talking about that immersion and the small, seemingly insignificant details that all add up to sell the world to players.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Things like voices muffling and echoing when wearing a helmet that covers a character's face. That the skybox rotates during the day to change as the time of day changes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In one funny example, I was told that in another demo someone wanted to see if they could pick up the chickens that are running around. You sure can, and they learned the white chickens were picked up and held by their feet while you the lucky brown chickens are cradled in Kliff's arms. Something not even the demoer knew you could do.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>You Can Change the World Around You</h2>

<p>The most interesting thing I saw was in how ways you interact with the world logically affect the properties of certain things. For example, I caught a large wooden gate on fire and while it was still catching fire, I tried to smash through it with a big hit. The gate was too strong and withstood the attack.</p>

<p>It was explained to me that inanimate objects have a sort of damage threshold that needs to be hit first before any damage can be done to them, sort of like in <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After some time, the gate burned up completely and looked very different, all black and charred. I then tried to smash through the gate again with a big attack, and this time I broke on through.</p>

<p>The fire had not just changed what the gate looked like visually, it had weakened the material just like what would happen in real life.</p>



<p>It’s that sort of logical detail that is littered throughout<em> Crimson Deser</em>t that I think it will delight people for a long time. A lot of moments of “I can’t believe the game can do that” will happen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There’s so much granular detail that has been given a ton of attention and so many systems that all work together in a logical and intuitive way that the possibilities to do cool stuff are everywhere.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Being surprised by what is there is a big part of what they are going for with<em> Crimson Desert.</em>&nbsp;I saw that born out in this demo and my previous hands-on, as not only am I surprised at what the game could do so were the developers showing it off.</p>

<p>Part of keeping that surprise a big part of the game comes down to player choice. You have a ton of options in combat, how to move around the world, and just how to interact with all of the objects in it. I haven't seen much on the story or player choices that come into play there, but I can't wait to hear more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[IO Interactive Might Be Done with Third-Party Publishing After MindsEye]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/io-interactive-mindseye-third-party-publishing</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/io-interactive-might-be-done-with-third-party-publishing-after-mindseye.1288623/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>publisher IO Interactive has suggested that the game's disastrous launch may have made the studio think twice about taking on third-party publishing contracts in the future.</p>

<p>Speaking <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/that-was-definitely-tough-right-ceo-of-mindseye-publisher-ioi-responds-to-disastrous-launch" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">to IGN</a>, IO Interactive CEO Hakan Abrak said that while his studio will continue to publish its own games, whether or not the IOI Partners label publishes any more third-party games "remains to be seen".</p>

<p>Just in case you need a reminder,&nbsp;<em>MindsEye</em>, which is the debut project from the "multinational" studio Build a Rocket Boy, was IO Interactive's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/io-interactive-publishing-ex-rockstar-thriller" rel="nofollow">first external publishing effort</a>, and it's safe to say the game's launch didn't exactly go as either studio had hoped it would.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mindseye-io-interactive-publishing-shooting.jpg?itok=JY2N_wf- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mindseye-io-interactive-publishing-shooting.jpg?itok=t0Om158X 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>IO Interactive may think twice about third-party publishing after&nbsp;<em>MindsEye</em>.</figcaption></figure><p><em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>was released earlier this year to a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mindseye-launch-messy" rel="nofollow">roundly negative reception</a>, with its messy launch encountering widely-reported technical issues, leading to developer Build a Rocket Boy severing a planned sponsorship with streamer CohhCarnage, as well as PlayStation issuing rare refunds to players.</p>

<p>The launch of the game went so poorly that Build a Rocket Boy announced later that month that it would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mindseye-build-a-rocket-boy-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">lay off over 100 employees</a>, which, according to an IGN report, constituted around a third of the studio's headcount at the time.</p>

<p>IO Interactive CEO Abrak described&nbsp;<em>MindsEye</em>'s launch as "definitely tough"; he said the release "wasn't what [Build a Rocket Boy] hoped for, and also what we didn't hope for at IOI Partners".</p>

<p>Despite that, Abrak says that Build a Rocket Boy is "working hard on turning that around to regain the trust" of disgruntled players, and that&nbsp;<em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>has "tons of potential and content" in the pipeline. We'll have to wait and see if any of that comes to fruition.</p>




<p>IO Interactive's third-party publishing efforts may be on hold for the moment, but the studio is powering ahead with publishing its own releases, the next of which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/007-first-light-release-date" rel="nofollow">March's&nbsp;<em>007 First Light</em></a>. Here's hoping that launch goes better than&nbsp;<em>MindsEye</em>'s.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-season-4</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>NetEase has revealed the start date for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>Season 4, as well as the two heroes that will be joining the hero shooter's roster during this season.</p>

<p>The game's fourth season, which (naturally) follows on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-season-3" rel="nofollow">its third back in July</a>, will begin on September 12th. As usual, it's bringing two new heroes with it, one of which may be a little more obscure than the other.</p>

<p><em>Marvel Rivals</em>' first new hero for Season 4 is none other than Matt Murdock, also known as Daredevil, who's sporting a characteristically flamboyant new design in keeping with many of the game's other characters. We don't know what role Daredevil will play in the game yet.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-rivals-season-4-daredevil-angela.jpg?itok=Y44658sb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-rivals-season-4-daredevil-angela.jpg?itok=bbgKeXvI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Daredevil and Angela will be joining&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' roster this season.</figcaption></figure><p>The second new hero (although she's actually the first to join&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' roster for this season) is Angela, who began life as an Image Comics character appearing in the&nbsp;<em>Spawn&nbsp;</em>series before debuting in Marvel's&nbsp;<em>Age of Ultron&nbsp;</em>run in 2013.</p>

<p>Angela is a Vanguard (that's&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' tank class) whose Ichors can transform into various weapons, including a shield, so she can either block damage or open up "opportunities for her team", according to NetEase. She can also take to the skies to search for new angles of attack.</p>

<p>Of course, the new&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>season will also bring with it a range of new game modes, changes to various game mechanics, and a brand new Team-Up attack as well, so make sure you check out the patch notes when they're released.</p>

<p>In the meantime, you can watch this rather wonderfully-animated trailer for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>Season 4, which depicts an epic clash between Angela and Daredevil.</p>




<p>The Season 4 trailer also confirmed a PS4 release for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>, which will presumably arrive alongside the fourth season next week. Whether or not the console can handle some of NetEase's game's busier moments remains to be seen.</p>

<p>For now, however, you can check out&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2767030/Marvel_Rivals/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/marvel-rivals/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/marvel-rivals/9n8pmw7qmd3d" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazon-tomb-raider-lara-croft</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazons-tomb-raider-series-casts-its-lara-croft-production-start-date-confirmed.1288560/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Amazon has revealed who's going to be taking the role of Lara Croft in its upcoming live-action&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>series, as well as when the show is expected to begin production.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/tomb-raider-live-action-series-filming-2026-sophie-turner-1236506192/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Variety</a>,&nbsp;<em>Game of Thrones&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>X-Men: Dark Phoenix&nbsp;</em>star Sophie Turner will be playing Lara in the show, which is set to start production on January 19th next year. It's not yet known whether the series will adapt an existing game or tell a new, original story.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>live-action series was first announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tomb-raider-live-action-series" rel="nofollow">back in May last year</a>.&nbsp;<em>Fleabag&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>James Bond&nbsp;</em>writer and star Phoebe Waller-Bridge is attached to the project as one of its showrunners and executive producers, alongside Chad Hodge, whose credits include the likes of Fox's&nbsp;<em>Wayward Pines&nbsp;</em>and TNT's&nbsp;<em>Good Behavior</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tomb-raider-amazon-lara-croft-actress.jpg?itok=tRi3RJnC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tomb-raider-amazon-lara-croft-actress.jpg?itok=XuWqwAij 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Amazon's&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>series has found its Lara Croft.</figcaption></figure><p>Turner's involvement with the show was first mooted back in November last year, but this is the first time Amazon - and Waller-Bridge herself - has confirmed her casting as Lara Croft in an official capacity.</p>

<p>The live-action&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>series also isn't the only Lara Croft-starring show currently on the scene; it joins Netflix's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-releases-first-look-at-tomb-raider-and-devil-may-cry-animated-series" rel="nofollow">animated series&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft</em></a>, which is set in the same timeline as Crystal Dynamics' rebooted games.</p>

<p>As for the games, the latest release in the franchise is&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered</em>, which, as the name suggests, collects <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tomb-raider-4-6-remastered-announced" rel="nofollow">remastered versions of the final three games</a> in the original Core Design series of&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>titles.</p>

<p>Another&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>game is also apparently in the works, and according to developer Crystal Dynamics, the project <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crystal-dynamics-layoffs" rel="nofollow">wasn't affected by a recent round of layoffs</a> that hit the studio following the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">cancellation of The Initiative's&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</em>reboot</a>, on which Crystal Dynamics was serving as a co-development outfit.</p>




<p>Amazon's&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>series will begin production in January, but we don't have an air date for it yet. Stay tuned for more on this one and on all things&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider</em>-related.</p>
