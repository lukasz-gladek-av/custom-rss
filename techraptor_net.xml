            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/towa-and-guardians-of-sacred-tree-preview-mystical-japanese-hadeslike<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree </em>was revealed at Summer Game Fest, and I had a chance to get my hands on the game. It has beautiful art, and the gameplay is a close sibling to <em>Hades </em>with its own twists.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Towa </em>is set in a mystical realm inspired by Japanese mythology and folklore. That is where we get one of the heroes being a human/koi fish hybrid. Someone more versed in the mythology will likely see references in many of the heroes and enemies.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Towa Shares a lot of DNA with Hades</h2>

<p>It’s impossible not to bring up <em>Hades</em>, as so much of the framework of <em>Towa </em>is so heavily inspired by it. It’s a roguelite where you make runs to clear out rooms of enemies, make a selection based on a series of rewards you can get, then rinse and repeat.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like selecting a powerup from a certain god you may want in <em>Hades</em>, Towa similarly has themed upgrade paths based around certain abilities or effects. You can try to build around that one set or go for a more varied approach.</p>



<p>You dash around the battlefield quickly, avoiding the many hazards enemies will throw your way by dodging and unleashing powerful abilities of your own. They are shown with the circles, arrows, and other indicators on where exactly to avoid.</p>

<p>Towa has a couple of big combat differences from something like <em>Hades</em>, however.&nbsp;</p>

<p>First, no matter which guardian you choose to fight with (there are eight total), you’ll have a set of two swords to use in a run. You’ll be forced to constantly swap between the two as the more you use one, the more worn it gets and must be resharpened. Wear one down with some combos, swap, and repeat.</p>



<p>A lot of the upgrades are specific to one sword or another, so you can change the effects and abilities of any sword quite a bit. Moreover, it's something to make sure you keep an eye on, as it would be pretty easy to have one sword be the only effective one and the other needing some help as no upgrades have done anything to it.</p>

<p>You can also bring another guardian with you on a run. They are a little more passive and just follow you around, but have their own abilities that you can use on a cooldown to help out as well.</p>

<h2>Towa Follows the Guardians Over a Long Time</h2>

<p><em>Towa </em>takes place over a vast period of time, centered around Shinju Village. Over that course of time, as the guardians come back again and again to defend it, the village will evlove and the stories of those that live there will change.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The village serves as your central hub where you’ll upgrade swords, abilities, and unlock new things over the course of time. It's where you'll learn more about the guardians, too.</p>

<p><em>Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree</em> is a competent roguelite that will certainly charm people into giving it a try with its great style. I’m also not going to complain about another excellent roguelite taking its cues from <em>Hades</em>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/silent-hill-remake-confirmed-by-konami-and-bloober-team.1216656/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/konami-bloober-team-new-silent-hill<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>publisher Konami has announced that it's officially working with&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake developer Bloober Team on a remake of the very first game in the franchise.</p>

<p>The two studios were revealed to be working together on the&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>remake during today's Konami Press Start livestream, where we also got some more info on upcoming games&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f</em>, both of which are <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-release-date-leak-playstation" rel="nofollow">launching</a> in the next few months.</p>

<p>While it wasn't officially revealed that the project would be a remake during the livestream, that news was subsequently confirmed by the official Japanese&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em><a href="https://x.com/silenthill_jp/status/1933156514614988898" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">X account</a>. The video was also accompanied by music from the original&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill</em>.</p>

<p>Creating a remake of the original&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>makes perfect sense; it's no longer possible to play the first game on modern hardware. It is technically still available via the PlayStation 3 or PS Vita stores, but you can't play it on PC or modern consoles (without resorting to illegal methods, of course).</p>

<p>The announcement of the original&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>remake means that the horror franchise is officially back in full swing, having been on an extended hiatus prior to the release of&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>back in October last year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cronos-the-new-dawn-bloober-team-silent-hill.jpg?itok=TI1l-VE5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cronos-the-new-dawn-bloober-team-silent-hill.jpg?itok=x7wHqu24 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bloober Team is currently gearing up to release&nbsp;<em>Cronos: The New Dawn&nbsp;</em>sometime this year.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill</em>, Bloober Team is currently working on its own original horror game by the name of&nbsp;<em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em>, a sci-fi spookfest that's due to launch sometime later this year.</p>

<p>If you're wondering why Konami would pick Bloober Team to work on the&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill </em>remake, sales of the studio's&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">topped two million back in January</a>, so that might give you some indication as to why Konami considers Bloober a safe pair of hands.</p>

It’s a cozy slice of life game where you deliver artificial pets. There’s also a mystery to be solved.</p>

<h2 lang="EN-US" paraeid="{280475d0-d510-4868-87d2-14c667b4b7b0}{184}" paraid="278375488" xml:lang="EN-US">Petal Runner's Game Boy Visuals</h2>

<p paraeid="{c3d7e0ce-d02a-4e0b-bcc1-34ba4197aaac}{18}" paraid="447900538" xml:lang="EN-US">My first impressions of <em>Petal Runner</em> were that it looked just like the <em>Pokemon </em>games of my childhood. That is absolutely true and by design, as I was told by Creative Director Brandon Greer, who said he always loved the look of <em>Pokemon Red </em>and wanted to do something inspired by it.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{8730c49a-d8b5-4c50-96b8-acddb7a531f4}{236}" paraid="538743245" xml:lang="EN-US">Greer told me that he was always interested in pixel art and got into learning how to make it as a hobby. That turned into something more, which led to creating the art in <em>Petal Runner</em>. He even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BJGpixel" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">runs a YouTube channel</a> with tutorials if you want to learn as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p paraeid="{4f21161a-8587-48e8-8bdb-14384b1328d0}{137}" paraid="191828718" xml:lang="EN-US">There’s no battling, but there’s also no shortage of Hanapets to befriend along the way. Delivering and calibrating, sometimes coming to repair them by recalibrating, is the name of the game as you play <em>Petal Runner</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{06b0ace7-5ed8-4943-9078-cc6c547b84be}{14}" paraid="1637422151" xml:lang="EN-US">HanaPets come in all shapes and sizes, with their own unique personalities as well. There’s your HanaPet Kira, who is quite cat-like and has a lot to say, and I saw one that was a shark swimming through the air. &nbsp;</p>



<p paraeid="{fe7086e1-21c3-4f2d-bdee-e599a2edc5dd}{106}" paraid="1797208579" xml:lang="EN-US">Instead of battles, you’ll calibrate HanaPets for people as you deliver them. Those come in the form of a series of minigames that are very reminiscent of <em>WarioWare</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{c4991f8b-ccd0-46c2-9c70-beea2366bfe4}{105}" paraid="239729365" xml:lang="EN-US">Each one only lasts a few seconds at most. For example, in one you have to land your parachute guy in the correct area. In another, you use a brush to clean up a dog quickly.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{e7148687-3ba1-4081-a847-abe8dd14ea3e}{71}" paraid="764631281" xml:lang="EN-US">Each neighborhood will have its own sort of color palette and distinct design, too. It's not just one big sprawling city that is sort of samey, but each neighborhood will have its own personality and look to it.</p>

<p paraeid="{e7148687-3ba1-4081-a847-abe8dd14ea3e}{71}" paraid="764631281" xml:lang="EN-US">You'll have plenty of reason to travel in making deliveries, too, as there are a lot of secrets, sidequests, and side characters to befriend. Exploration is encouraged and rewarded, as just soaking in the world is the biggest appeal of these sort of games.</p>



<p paraeid="{e7148687-3ba1-4081-a847-abe8dd14ea3e}{188}" paraid="73521114" xml:lang="EN-US">I was only given access to a small portion of one neighborhood in my demo, but it had so much for me to see and do. People were boundless, shops and buildings all over, and little paths that are slightly hidden were everywhere Greer said it was a blast to design the world and fill its spaces with a lot of fun interactable characters and items.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{846fb01a-19d7-42b3-8579-091e419aa9e3}{25}" paraid="1917473999" xml:lang="EN-US">One of the areas I had access to was a mall, full of stores I could walk into and interact with customers and shopkeepers. There were shops for music, HanaPets, accessories, and more.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{3d2877fa-b57c-4e2f-b241-0260da76da1b}{132}" paraid="1218408175" xml:lang="EN-US">It was a great nostalgic trip to the Game Boy years of something like <em>Pokemon</em>, with an elevated pixel art that they can get away with on today's technology. A lot of charm was packed into not a lot of pixels.</p>

<h2 paraeid="{3d2877fa-b57c-4e2f-b241-0260da76da1b}{132}" paraid="1218408175" xml:lang="EN-US">Petal Runner Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>
