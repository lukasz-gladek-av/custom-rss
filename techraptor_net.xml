            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-chaos-vault-oishii-tokens-drop-brings-cute-food-to-magic-gathering<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has released another Secret Lair Chaos Vault drop for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Magic: The Gathering</a>. In keeping with the drops' erratic, inconsistent style of theme or reason, the Chaos Vault Oishii Tokens drop is about cute-looking Japanese food.</p>



<p>According to its official <a href="https://secretlair.wizards.com/us/en/product/1151225/oishii-tokens" rel="nofollow">store page</a>, the Chaos Vault Oishii Tokens drop was inspired by some "unthinkably cool food packaging" the artists saw on their last trip to Japan. For that reason alone, we are getting new food token cards based on those designs.</p>

There are four different food tokens in this drop. One features a large juicy hamburger stuffed with onions, pickles, lettuce, bacon, tomatoes, and cheese, complete with a large side of fries. The second one is an elaborate sushi platter, complete with chop sticks, a saucer of soy sauce, and a cup of hot green tea.</p>

<p>The most elaborate of these tokens is an elaborate lunch. Rice balls and tiny sausages given happy faces or turned into cute octopi. Broccoli stalks topped with tiny stars. A dollop of egg-fried rice fashioned in the shape of a tiny chick. All are complimented with energetic manga panels in the background.</p>

<p>Finally, what is a meal without dessert? The fourth food token is for those with a sweet tooth. Sliced fruit. Crunchy wafers. Sliced strawberries. Cherries and whip cream. A fizzling soda with a scoop of ice cream on the top. But at the center is a certain Japanese delicacy: a sweet Purin pudding.</p>

<p>The Chaos Vault Oishii Tokens drop is the fourth drop in Wizards of the Coast's more impetuous series of drops. So far, these drops have featured <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-announces-their-first-chaos-vault-drop-for-magic-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">elaborate signage</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/latest-secret-lair-chaos-vault-previews-psychedelic-land-cards" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">psychedelic land cards</a>, and a popularity contest between <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-chaos-vault-secret-lair-is-for-cats-and-dogs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">cats and dogs</a>.</p>

<p>The Chaos Vault Oishii Tokens drop is still available at time of writing in non-foil at an MSRP of $14.99.</p>
