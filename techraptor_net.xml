            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wreckfest-2-early-access-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>THQ Nordic and Bugbear have announced the Early Access release date for destruction derby racer&nbsp;<em>Wreckfest 2</em>, so get ready to engage in what the two studios describe as "absolute vehicular mayhem".</p>

<p><em>Wreckfest 2&nbsp;</em>officially arrives on PC via Steam Early Access on March 20th. The game will also eventually come to consoles, although it doesn't look like the Early Access release is making it onto PS5 or Xbox Series X|S, sadly.</p>

<p>When it launches,&nbsp;<em>Wreckfest 2&nbsp;</em>will pack in three gameplay modes: Racing, Derby, and Multiplayer. They're fairly self-explanatory, and as Early Access progresses, Bugbear says it'll also add "a completely revamped career mode that adapts to your individual playstyle".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wreckfest-2-early-access-release-date-crash.jpg?itok=Fej_bZWq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wreckfest-2-early-access-release-date-crash.jpg?itok=v8MCyrFL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Wreckfest 2&nbsp;</em>promises glorious destruction derby action in March.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as the career mode, Bugbear is also promising to add new tracks and vehicles throughout&nbsp;<em>Wreckfest 2</em>'s Early Access development, and new special challenges in which you race vehicles that "were definitely never supposed to end up on a racetrack" will be introduced.</p>

<p>Various other features, like tournaments and mod support, are also on the cards for Early Access. Rest assured that it does sound like&nbsp;<em>Wreckfest 2&nbsp;</em>has a solid core in place if you do decide to pick it up before these features have been implemented, though.</p>

<p>That experience involves what Bugbear and THQ Nordic describe as "full-contact racing action with no rules, just jaw-dropping moments of chaos and destruction". The sequel will sport an improved physics engine compared to <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/wreckfest" rel="nofollow">the original</a>, too.</p>

<p>You can check out the Early Access release date announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Wreckfest 2&nbsp;</em>right here. It should give you a good idea of what kind of destructive action to expect from the game.</p>




<p><em>Wreckfest 2&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1203190/Wreckfest_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on March 20th. There's no word yet on when the game is coming to consoles, although it has been slated for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S as well. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/helldivers-2-servants-of-freedom-warbond-to-bring-portable-hellbomb-and-more.1099782/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-servants-of-freedom-warbond<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and Arrowhead Game Studios have announced a new&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Warbond, and if you've ever wanted the destructive power of a Hellbomb strapped to your back, this is the Warbond for you.</p>

<p>Like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-truth-enforcers-warbond" rel="nofollow">previous</a>&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-chemical-agents-warbond" rel="nofollow">Warbonds</a>, Servants of Freedom brings a bunch of new gear for you to try out, foremost among which is the B-100 Portable Hellbomb Stratagem. Like the regular Hellbomb, make sure you're nowhere near this one when it goes off.</p>

<p>Of course, new weapons are also coming as part of this Warbond, including the LAS-17 Double-Edge Sickle, which powers up the regular Sickle and allows it to overheat, potentially damaging both you and "everything in its path".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-servants-of-freedom-warbond-hellbomb.jpg?itok=dpfGsSCh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-servants-of-freedom-warbond-hellbomb.jpg?itok=y7p1VvWv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Helldivers 2</em>'s new Warbond gives you your very own portable Hellbomb.</figcaption></figure><p>The secondary slot, meanwhile, gets a new GP-20 Ultimatum grenade pistol, which is "designed for closer-range use". That, given&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>'s penchant for randomly murdering you in hilarious ways, sounds like a recipe for disaster to me.</p>

<p>Servants of Freedom also brings a new throwable weapon in the G-50 Seeker, a drone that follows along behind you and explodes near enemies when it detects them. It can also target enemies you ping.</p>

<p>Two new armor sets have been added, both medium sets: the IE-3 Martyr and the IE-12 Righteous. Both sets come complete with rather terrifying masked helms that will make you look like Doctor Doom, but if he fought on the side of justice, truth, and democracy (ahem).</p>

<p>Naturally, the Warbond comes complete with new capes, a new player title, and a new cheer as well, all of which should help you express yourself when you're taking the fight to those dastardly Terminids (or bots, or Illuminate, of course).</p>




<p>Elsewhere in&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>news, chief creative officer Johan Pilestedt announced last week that he's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-johan-pilestedt-sabbatical" rel="nofollow">intending to take a sabbatical from work</a>, and that when he returns, he'll begin work on a new Arrowhead game. Exciting!</p>

<p><em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/helldivers-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and the Servants of Freedom Warbond arrives on February 6th.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-sales-5m</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-sales-break-the-5m-barrier.1099737/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-sales-5m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has announced that&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>sales have hit another big milestone, further cementing the latest&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball&nbsp;</em>fighter's popularity and success.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/dragonballgames/status/1886686193535848650" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, the studio reveals that&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>has hit five million sales, a figure it's managed to reach in around four months.</p>

<p>We already knew the game was successful; it launched to the&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball&nbsp;</em>series' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-series-best-steam-debut" rel="nofollow">best Steam debut ever</a>&nbsp;and went on to top three million sales in its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-sales-3m" rel="nofollow">first day on release</a>, meaning that it's picked up another two million for itself in the intervening months.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-sales-dlc.jpg?itok=f9xMvhw5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-sales-dlc.jpg?itok=d6-c2rLE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>has hit another big sales milestone just a few months after its release.</figcaption></figure><p>That figure almost certainly includes both physical shipments and digital sales, and it'll take into account all three platforms on which the game is available as well. Still, five million since October is no mean feat!</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>is, it's a fighting game that lets you do battle as one of over 180&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball&nbsp;</em>characters, including fan favorites like Goku, Vegeta, and Trunks (and variations thereof).</p>

<p>The game features characters from media like&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball Z</em>,&nbsp;<em>GT</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Super</em>, as well as "selected&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball&nbsp;</em>movies", and it'll also let you relive some of the series' most iconic moments "from the perspectives of eight characters".</p>

<p>After its release,&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>received updates adding features like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-update-splitscreen" rel="nofollow">splitscreen play across all of its stages</a>, a new <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-update-limited-time-mode" rel="nofollow">limited-time game mode</a>, and plenty of gameplay tweaks and improvements.</p>




<p>Last month, the Hero of Justice DLC pack was released, bringing an additional eleven playable fighters to&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</em>, as well as a new costume and three bonus battles.</p>

<p>The DLC has not, however, met with a particularly positive reception, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3310650/DRAGON_BALL_Sparking_ZERO_HERO_OF_JUSTICE_Pack/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">at least on Steam</a>, where fans are complaining about the lack of variety between playable characters and the price of the pack.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1790600/DRAGON_BALL_Sparking_ZERO/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/dragon-ball-sparking-zero/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/dragon-ball-sparking-zero/9n7xmjjhnfc3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.
