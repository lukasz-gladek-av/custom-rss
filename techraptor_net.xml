      <div><p>Monte Cook Games has launched its crowdfunding campaign for <em>Cypher: Third Edition</em>. The newest edition, originally announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/monte-cook-games-has-announced-new-edition-of-their-cypher-rpg-system" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">in July</a>, promotes a streamlined version of the award-winning TTRPG system. The campaign was fully funded within&nbsp; hours of it going live.</p>

<h2>The <em>Cypher: Third Edition</em> Backerkit Campaign</h2>

<p>According to its Backerkit campaign page, <a href="https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/monte-cook-games/cypher-system-faster-easier-and-even-better#top" rel="nofollow"><em>Cypher: Third Edition</em></a> will remain the same TTRPG fans have enjoyed for years. Its underlying systems of fast-paced gameplay around a single d20 is still around. The campaign confirms that this new edition will be backwards compatible with any material released before. The system will encompass two books: A Character Rulebook and the GM Guide.</p>

The new edition will focus on making games easier to jump into. This includes premade character archetypes for Cypher's different premade settings. Instead of a pre-existing archetype (Warrior, Explorer, or Adept) and reworking it, the fantasy setting will have barbarian and druid characters ready to go.</p>

<p>A second key part of <em>Cypher: Third Edition</em> is the introduction of a Divination Deck. This GM tool can generate various ideas for stories, hooks or complications in a larger narrative. For those who prefer to play online, the campaign includes official VTT support for both Roll20 and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/alchemy-rpg-vtts-and-focus-on-roleplaying" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Alchemy RPG</a>. VTT access is available as an add-on priced at $75.</p>

<p>If you back the campaign at certain pledge levels, you will receive a fast library of previous Cypher system material at no extra cost. This includes eight standalone adventures, nine campaign settings like <em>Gunslinger Knights</em> and <em>Path of the Planebreaker</em>, and nine genre books bringing a Horror, Sci-Fi, or Fairy Tale twist to your game. All of these books will be provided in PDF format.</p>

<p>&nbsp;The different pledge levels for <em>Cypher: Third Edition</em> are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Character Rulebook Only for $49:</strong> A physical copy of the Cypher Character Rulebook</li>
	<li><strong>Cypher Corebook Set for $99: </strong>Physical copies of the Cypher GM Guide and Character Rulebook, and PDF copies of the Cypher Second Edition Core Rulebook and Cypher Adventures Library</li>

Character creation zines in both print and PDF, a Cypher deck, a Divination Deck, a Manifest Cypher deck, and the Cypher Adventures and Settings library in PDF,&nbsp;</li>

</ul><p>Lastly, Monte Cook Games states that the <em>Cypher: Third Edition</em> books and products will contain any artwork created by generative AI. Furthermore, they state that they have accounted for as many productions as they can regarding the ongoing trade tariffs.</p>
