<p>In the tabletop community, Manganiello's most high-profile appearance was in the actual play series, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-concludes-campaign-3-with-epic-8-hour-finale-new-godly-exu-announced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Critical Role</em></a>. Manganiello played the paladin, Arkhen the Cruel, who aided the adventuring party Vox Machina defeat Vecna in the climax of campaign one.
