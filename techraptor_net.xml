Joining similar crossovers with <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/mtg-x-fallout-mutant-menace-review-and-improvements" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Fallout</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/doctor-who-commander-decks-will-have-50-new-cards-each" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Doctor Who</em></a> are official <em>Final Fantasy</em> Commander decks, bringing iconic characters from the RPG series to the acclaimed card game.</p>

<h2>The <em>Final Fantasy</em> Commander Decks Announcement</h2>

<p>In an official report <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-commander-deck-reveal-spoilers" rel="nofollow">from IGN</a>, Wizards of the Coast have announced several <em>Final Fantasy</em> Commander decks coming to Magic: The Gathering. The release will include a draftable, Standard-legal set alongside four premade decks made of 100 cards. Those cards will include reprints of certain cards featuring Final Fantasy art as well as brand new Commander-format cards.</p>

<p>The first deck, Revival Trance (Red, White, Black), is based on <em>Final Fantasy VI</em> and showcases Terra, the herald of hope. The second, Limit Break (Red, Green, White), is <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>-themed featuring the iconic Cloud Strife. Deck number three, Counter Blitz (Green, White, Blue) is based on <em>Final Fantasy X</em> and the underwater football star, Tidus. The final deck, Scions &amp; Soulcraft (White, Blue, Black) revolves around <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> and Y'shtola from the Shadowbringers expansion.</p>

<p>The report includes an interview with Wizards of the Coast about how they chose to adapt the world of <em>Final Fantasy</em>. Each deck came with its own set of challenges.&nbsp;</p>

<p>How do you translate the expressive but minimal pixel art of <em>Final Fantasy VI</em> into the more expressive painterly style of <em>Magic</em>. When adapting <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>, do you prioritize the PS1 original or the retelling/reimagining/remixing of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/final-fantasy-vii-remake" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em></a>? What storyline or character do you focus on from the sprawling MMO world of <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>?</p>

<p>Principal Narrative Designer Dillon Deveney had some answers to these questions. For <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>, they ultimately decided to capture the spirit of the 1997 original release while taking some aesthetic inspiration from the Remake games. Alternatively, the artwork for <em>Final Fantasy VI</em>&nbsp; was a combination of Yoshitaka Amano's original character concept art and the original sprite artwork.</p>

<p>The <em>Final Fantasy</em> Commander decks will be available June 13.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-nightreign-preview-night-fever.1111680/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/elden-ring-nightreign-preview-night-fever<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>might be cursed with an unrepresentative name. Sure, it plays like&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>, looks like&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>, and even has tons of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s enemies and assets, but if there's one thing I've learned about&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>,&nbsp;it's that this ain't&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>.</p>

<p><em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>is very much its own beast. Rather than the careful, methodical exploration of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>- and, indeed, of previous FromSoftware titles (from which you'll <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-dark-souls-enemies-confirmed" rel="nofollow">also spot a few enemies and bosses</a> here) -&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>'s action is fast-paced and frenetic from the off.</p>

<p>I managed to get a few hours with&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>during its recent network test, and what I experienced was fascinating, if initially overwhelming. I'm confident this could become a real hit for Bandai Namco and FromSoftware, even if it might alienate some fans of the original.</p>

<h2>What the Heck Is&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, Anyway?</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-preview-explanation.jpg?itok=lUvGrMFS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-preview-explanation.jpg?itok=_xrLI839 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>isn't the easiest game to figure out to begin with.</figcaption></figure><p>At first glance - and, indeed, even after a few minutes spent running around like a headless chicken in Limveld - it's hard to know exactly what&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>is. In essence, it's&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>meets&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/fortnite" rel="nofollow"><em>Fortnite</em></a>, with a dash of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/risk-of-rain-2" rel="nofollow"><em>Risk of Rain 2</em></a>&nbsp;thrown in for good measure.</p>

<p>Don't worry, though; you won't be fighting any of your fellow players, and this isn't a battle royale game. Each round of&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>spans three days, although you'll only actually be exploring the map for two of those days. On the third, you'll fight the boss you selected as your hunt for this session.</p>

<p>In the case of the network test, that boss is Gladius, a three-headed dog you'll battle in an arena that resembles the one in which you fought Starscourge Radahn in an age past. I'm assuming the main game will come with many more beasties to wrangle.</p>

<p>Each session sees you and two other players (it is possible to play solo, but I couldn't do so during the network test) sprinting around Limveld, exploring key locations for loot while fighting whatever monsters and minibosses have taken up residence in those places.</p>

<p>The goal is to level up enough to stand a chance of taking on a bigger miniboss when night falls, and eventually to amass enough levels and gear that you can fight Gladius (or whichever boss you've elected to take on) when the three-day cycle ends.</p>

<p>As you explore, a circle will constantly shrink towards a point on the map, and being outside that circle will cause you to take constant damage, just like in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>. Once the circle has shrunk to its smallest size, the boss will appear at its epicenter.</p>

<p><em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>even has roguelike elements; runs, whether failed or successful, will net you trinkets you can use to add bonuses to your characters that persist between sessions.</p>

<h2><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>Feels Uncanny at First</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-preview-knight.jpg?itok=JSp8YHYB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-preview-knight.jpg?itok=hq4j1Lq5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You might be a little put off by&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>'s paucity of context, but stick with it.</figcaption></figure><p>My first impression of&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>'s gameplay loop was dizzying and confusing. Don't make the mistake of jumping in without checking out the tutorials available in the Roundtable Hold; if you're anything like me, you won't have the faintest idea what's going on, especially if your fellow players insist on sprinting ahead without waiting for you (which they probably will!).</p>

<p>Eventually, you'll get a handle on&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>'s zippy core loop. Get any thoughts of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>out of your head; there is no room for careful, slow exploration here.&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>is all about killing as many enemies and looting as much as you can, all while watching that ever-present&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>-esque circle drawing in.</p>

<p>Rather than creating your own character, you'll have access to one of eight archetypes, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.</p>

<p>I spent the most time with Wylder during the network test, simply because his grappling hook allowed me to close distances and zip around the map that much quicker. There should be archetypes for all play styles, though; the Guardian is a slower-paced tank, for instance, while the Recluse slings spells from a distance.</p>

<p>I won't lie: at first, I really thought I was going to hate&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>. I'm a massive fan of the original (as well as FromSoftware's other games), and&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>feels eerie and uncanny to begin with.</p>

<p>It feels like being parachuted into a particularly well-made mod; seeing Limgrave's inhabitants plopped into this space, devoid of context, felt instinctively wrong. When Margit, the Fell Omen himself appeared, I felt despair, not joy; how could this proud, stoic warrior be stripped of his backstory and forced to fight in this narrative-free arena?</p>

<p>Eventually, though, I grasped what&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>is trying to do and found myself sinking into it. This isn't meant to replace FromSoftware's lore-heavy action RPG excursions; it's an accompaniment, a side dish, a little extra to tide you over while Hidetaka Miyazaki cooks.</p>

<h2>Gameplay Is King in&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-preview-spider_0.jpg?itok=rNZq4b6g 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-preview-spider_0.jpg?itok=0J27cDEL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>is a gameplay-first experience, and that gameplay is... pretty fun, actually.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>is all about its frantic gameplay, or at least that's the impression I got in the network test. Very little care seems to have been taken to explain what&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls</em>' Centipede Demon is doing in Limveld; instead, it's all about how you and your team are going to take him down.</p>

<p>Once you've gotten rid of that pesky voice asking why this isn't just more&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>, you can start to settle into what&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>is, and it turns out that&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>is a tremendous amount of fun.</p>

<p>Speeding through Limveld dispatching enemies and grabbing loot without worrying about whether it'll suit your meticulously crafted build feels like cracking&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>wide open and discovering the power fantasy within.</p>

<p>Margit gave me no end of trouble in the base game, but here, my team and I took him down inside a few minutes, despite the crafty extra moves FromSoftware have outfitted him with.</p>

<p>Don't get me wrong; this is still a very challenging experience, but the challenge comes from how much you were able to do inside the time limit you were given rather than from careful observation and mistake punishment.</p>

<p><em>Elden Ring</em>'s core combat remains intact, too. This is still a Soulslike, so if you're an&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>veteran, the basic ideas of the gameplay will be familiar to you, even if the crushing pace of the experience might be overwhelming at first.</p>

<p>The one brand new boss in the network test, the aforementioned Gladius, feels like he could stand toe-to-toe with some of <i>Elden Ring</i>'s better bosses, too. There's even a rather enjoyable moment where FromSoftware nods to the fact that it's specifically designed&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>around three-player excursions.</p>

<h2>I Want to Play More&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-preview-gladius.jpg?itok=UQ_dChOJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-preview-gladius.jpg?itok=vEHCu30J 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I want to play more&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>A full&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>excursion, if done right, will probably take you less than two hours, and while I felt like the end couldn't come soon enough when I first started, I was desperate for more by the end.</p>

<p>In many ways, this is one of the most interesting moves FromSoftware could have taken. This is a company known for savvy asset reuse, after all, and&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>is arguably the savviest. It's not just reusing visual assets; it's recontextualizing gameplay concepts as well.</p>

<p>I'm very excited to find out what other creations FromSoftware has cooked up for the full game, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nighreign-release-date" rel="nofollow">arrives on May 30th</a>. In the meantime, I'm just sore I can't head back into Limveld for one more fight against Gladius.</p>
