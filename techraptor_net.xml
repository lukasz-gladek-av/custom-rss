            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-40m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>NetEase has revealed that&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>has hit another major player count milestone, just a couple of days after the company closed the Seattle studio responsible for developing the hero shooter.</p>

<p>In its latest financial <a href="https://ir.netease.com/news-releases/news-release-details/netease-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2024-unaudited" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a> (which covers both the fourth quarter of 2024 and the fiscal year as a whole), NetEase confirms that <em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>has amassed "over 40 million players to date".</p>

<p>The game, which launched in early December, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-10m" rel="nofollow">amassed 10 million players</a> within its first 72 hours on release, going on to hit 20 million players in less than two weeks. It's worth stressing, however, that these aren't necessarily active players, just "registered users".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-rivals-40m-players-venom.jpg?itok=M_PowDQp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-rivals-40m-players-venom.jpg?itok=qVzOyGKX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>has hit 40 million players, but that didn't stop NetEase closing its development studio.</figcaption></figure><p>Still, a quick look at&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' Steam numbers (per <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2767030/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>) shows that it's attracted 320,376 players over the last 24 hours, with 130,699 players enjoying the game at time of writing.</p>

<p>NetEase also says that the first season of&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>resulted in a new surge of interest in the game, causing the hero shooter to catapult to the top of Steam's top sellers and most-played charts when it arrived.</p>

<p>All of this, as well as what is clearly NetEase's continued faith in&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>, makes the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-studio-shockingly-closed-by-netease-laying-off-everyone" rel="nofollow">decision to lay off everyone at the Seattle-based studio</a> responsible for making the game even more baffling.</p>

<p>In a statement, NetEase said the decision was made "for organizational reasons" and in order to "optimize development efficiency", so in other words, it's all to do with corporate behind-the-scenes goings-on, which is pretty much <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown" rel="nofollow">exactly what you'd expect</a> in this <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-layoffs-january-2025" rel="nofollow">day and age</a>, I suppose.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-rivals-40m-players-iron-fist.jpg?itok=AoK2Gm_p 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-rivals-40m-players-iron-fist.jpg?itok=KPMVE0pW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>NetEase is pledging to support&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>for a long time to come.</figcaption></figure><p>As for NetEase's financials, they're not much to write home about. The company reported a very small revenue increase for the 2024 fiscal year, going from 2023's total of around $14.2 billion to about $14.4 billion in 2024.</p>

<p>Gross profit also increased slightly, as did net income. NetEase's fiscal year ended on December 31st, so these figures do probably include&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' numbers, but NetEase doesn't provide a full breakdown of exactly how much the shooter made for it last year.</p>

<p>With regards to the future, NetEase says it's got a pretty stacked slate of games to come, including mobile shooter&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/destiny-mobile-spinoff-destiny-rising" rel="nofollow"><em>Destiny: Rising</em></a>, hero FPS&nbsp;<em>FragPunk</em>, and tactical RPG&nbsp;<em>Marvel Mystic Mayhem</em>.</p>

<p>The studio is, however, also pulling funding or pausing projects for several of its other investments, including&nbsp;<em>Just Cause&nbsp;</em>creator Christofer Sundberg's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/liquid-swords-layoffs-just-cause-creator" rel="nofollow">Liquid Swords</a> and Mac Walters' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/worlds-untold-netease-pause-shutdown" rel="nofollow">Untold Worlds</a>, among others. We'll have to wait and see what all of this means for NetEase's bottom line in the months to come.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/el-paso-elsewhere-2-announced</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/el-paso-elsewhere-2-officially-announced-by-xalavier-nelson.1114248/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/el-paso-elsewhere-2-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Xalavier Nelson and his studio Strange Scaffold have announced&nbsp;<em>El Paso, Elsewhere 2</em>, a followup to the&nbsp;<em>Max Payne</em>-influenced 2023 shooter.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/writnelson.bsky.social/post/3lil6pnx6hk23" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on his Bluesky account, Nelson says that it's "early days" for the sequel, but shares a title page for what is presumably its script. The page is pretty barren; it simply gives the name of the game, i.e.&nbsp;<em>El Paso, Elsewhere 2</em>, and Nelson's name as a writing credit.</p>

<p>Amusingly, a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/glassbottommeg.bsky.social/post/3likzdm4gus24" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">couple of replies</a> give potential <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/garyjkings.bsky.social/post/3likzmdt7ok2x" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">names</a> for the game, including&nbsp;<em>El Paso, Everywhere&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>El Paso, Everywhere, All at Once</em>, referencing the popular 2022 comedy movie. Of course, the game will probably just end up being called&nbsp;<em>El Paso, Elsewhere 2</em>. Ho hum.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/el-paso-elsewhere-2-gameplay-first-game.jpg?itok=X5Pdwdqc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/el-paso-elsewhere-2-gameplay-first-game.jpg?itok=BepxPOEY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>El Paso, Elsewhere 2&nbsp;</em>is officially happening, Xalavier Nelson has announced.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with the original&nbsp;<em>El Paso, Elsewhere</em>, it's a "third-person love letter to classic shooters" developed by Xalavier Nelson and his studio Strange Scaffold.</p>

<p>The game revolves around James Savage, troubled protagonist and&nbsp;<em>Blade</em>-style enemy to vampires. Savage must descend into a motel that's suddenly gained a few extra floors thanks to a vampiric incursion.</p>

<p><em>El Paso, Elsewhere&nbsp;</em>features a fully original hip-hop soundtrack composed by Nelson himself, and presumably, the sequel will feature more of Nelson's musical talents. It's also got "hordes of destructible physics objects", a fully-voiced campaign, and plenty of&nbsp;<em>Max Payne</em>-style slow-motion dives.</p>

<p>Naturally, we're almost certainly too early on in the development of&nbsp;<em>El Paso, Elsewhere 2&nbsp;</em>to know what it'll play like, but if you want a refresher, you can check out the launch trailer for the original game here.</p>




<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Max Payne&nbsp;</em>itself, Remedy recently revealed that its upcoming&nbsp;<em>Max Payne&nbsp;</em>remakes, which are being developed in conjunction with Rockstar, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alan-wake-2-profitable-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">are "making steady progress"</a>.</p>

<p>Sadly, they don't yet have a release date, so if you want to remind yourself how much fun <i>Max Payne&nbsp;</i>and games inspired by it can be, you can check out&nbsp;<em>El Paso, Elsewhere&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1546310/El_Paso_Elsewhere/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010236" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/el-paso-elsewhere/9P1H1KJB032N" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nested Lands Preview - Plague Centered Survival Builder]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/nested-lands-preview</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nested-lands-preview-plague-centered-survival-builder.1114188/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/nested-lands-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="32d72e61-e11f-40d6-aadb-371cca8a505e" href="https://techraptor.net/games/nested-lands" rel="nofollow"><em>Nested Lands</em></a>&nbsp;is a new title from 1M Bits Horde that's heading to open alpha. Nested Lands is set during the medieval ages while a plague spreads across the world. As a survival game enthusiast, I was excited to try it out, especially with the focus on the plague adding a new challenge I've never had to face. After diving in, I can safely say that I'm going to be watching&nbsp;<em>Nested Lands</em>&nbsp;as it continues to develop and is one fans of the genre should keep an eye on.</p>

<p><em>Nested Lands</em> gameplay features a melding of village management and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9e2fac55-7c08-4df9-8cd3-a855c0dff7df" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/survival-games-why-we-keep-on-coming-back-for-more" rel="nofollow">survival</a> genres set in the aftermath of the Death Plague, though you can still contract the disease if you're not careful. You crash land on the small island of&nbsp;Norovellir and are aided by the only survivor of a small village. Your goal, the one your parents dreamed of, is to establish a thriving village in your homeland. Bandits are rife in the area, as are Plague Sites, making the safety and longevity of a village questionable.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nested-lands-villager-management.jpg?itok=VK4arLB3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nested-lands-villager-management.jpg?itok=garXjFcP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Thankfully, there are many wanderers to be found on the island that are willing to work in exchange for a place to live, food, and water. One house can hold a single villager, and they can be assigned to specific tasks or crafting stations. This is where my biggest issue with&nbsp;<em>Nested Lands</em>&nbsp;currently lies. The autonomy, which is being tested in the next alpha phase, is quite limited. While you can make a villager a blacksmith, they won't make ingots on their own. They will make nails once there are ingots, but won't make armor for you, even if all the materials are available. There's no way to ask them to craft specific items, so they often end up idle due to lack of materials, or only craft one type of item endlessly. Compared with titles like&nbsp;<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="8b2075a3-87f2-4c12-a3d9-5541d2d6d84b" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/aska-villager-guide-how-to-grow-your-population" rel="nofollow"><em>Aska</em></a>, the villagers need some work.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I enjoyed exploring the island and discovering pieces of history. The first of these comes at the beginning of the alpha when you're shown the cemetery. There's an odd tree growing there, with some sort of skull placed in front of it, almost ceremoniously. Some other locations I discovered while exploring were deep mines and plague sites that needed to be cleared out.&nbsp;Most contain letters pertaining to the general story, or personal notes that were left behind.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nested-lands-cemetery-tree.jpg?itok=sWhTVp0U 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nested-lands-cemetery-tree.jpg?itok=5z9wzwXk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Being an alpha test, the little tidbits of lore littered around the island give credence to the bigger story the team is developing. That's the part I'm most excited to watch get fleshed out. Who are the people that previously inhabited the area and what is their connection to the unusual trees you can stumble upon? What other secrets are hidden across the rest of&nbsp;Norovellir?</p>

<p>The available content is a little sparse, with only one residential house and under 10 crafting, wellness, and defense structures able to be built. However, you can build your village to its limits, adding as many of these buildings as you want. The alpha doesn't necessarily end when you reach the conclusion of the main questline. You can continue to explore, kill bandits, and avoid the plague for as long as you want.</p>

<p>More structures are going to be added in later stages of game development, as noted at the beginning of the game when you first load in. Specifically, a cookhouse is mentioned by one of the characters, though it's not shown as something you can construct. Official screenshots also show a medical building, different than the one you can build in game, so we can expect that to come in the future, as well.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nested-lands-official-screenshot-medical-building.jpg?itok=AL6Xq628 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nested-lands-official-screenshot-medical-building.jpg?itok=2ylMUyXM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Along with the village management aspects of&nbsp;<em>Nested Lands</em>, it has basic survival mechanics like needing to eat, drink water, stay warm, and sleep regularly. Additionally, you need to keep clean to help stave off the plague. Characters, including yours, will remark when you smell bad, even stating something smells like it's rotting. Swimming in any body of water or using the bathhouse are easy ways to remain bacteria free. This reduces the chance of you getting sick or your villagers spreading disease around.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The best thing about the experience is knowing that <i>Nested Lands</i>&nbsp;feedback is getting looked at, especially on how to improve crafting and skills. You can directly impact how the game advances, which skills need tweaking and what ones are good as is. The open alpha is specifically looking at autonomy of villagers and how expansive villages can become, so all feedback on how those work will be extremely important for this test. I know I already sent in my opinion on the village management aspect of the title.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The alpha phase of&nbsp;<em>Nested Lands</em>&nbsp;has intrigued me enough to keep an eye on its development and want to continue my journey in&nbsp;Norovellir when additions are introduced to the game. It has staple survival mechanics along with village building and management. The inclusion of the plague and specific actions necessary to keep it at bay add a unique twist without over complicating things. How does this plague further hinder your chances of survival as your village grows is something I can't wait to experience. I'm excited to see where 1M Bits Horde takes&nbsp;<em>Nested Lands&nbsp;</em>in the future.&nbsp;</p>
