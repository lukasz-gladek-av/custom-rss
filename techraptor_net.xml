            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/front-mission-3-remake-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Forever Entertainment has revealed that mech RPG&nbsp;<em>Front Mission 3: Remake&nbsp;</em>is launching next month, completing the set of remakes for the original PlayStation-era trilogy.</p>

<p>Following on from 2022's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/front-mission-1st-remake-release-date-revealed" rel="nofollow">remake-of-a-remake</a>&nbsp;<em>Front Mission 1st&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/front-mission-2-remake-for-nintendo-switch-delayed-to-q3-2023" rel="nofollow">the following year's</a>&nbsp;<em>Front Mission 2: Remake</em>, the latest entry in the series will be arriving on June 26th, per a brand new trailer.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, no Nintendo Switch 2 Edition version of the game has been announced, so it sounds like it won't be getting any Switch 2 enhancements at launch, at the very least. It's entirely possible that's coming in the future, however.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/front-mission-3-remake-release-date-battle.jpg?itok=Ai3I8Rkg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/front-mission-3-remake-release-date-battle.jpg?itok=3GiU7iWC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Front Mission 3: Remake&nbsp;</em>is set for release in June.</figcaption></figure><p>There's also no word yet on whether&nbsp;<em>Front Mission 3: Remake&nbsp;</em>will be coming to other platforms, although given that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/front-mission-1st-remake-steam" rel="nofollow">both of its predecessors</a> were eventually <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/front-mission-2-remake-pc-console-release-date" rel="nofollow">released outside of the Switch ecosystem</a>, it's a distinct possibility.</p>

<p>The original&nbsp;<em>Front Mission 3&nbsp;</em>was the first game in the series to make it outside of Japan, as well as the franchise's final numbered release on the original PlayStation (if we don't count&nbsp;remake&nbsp;<em>Front Mission 1st</em>, which also wasn't released in the West in its PS1 form).</p>

<p><em>Front Mission 3</em>'s plot revolves around pilots Kazuki Takemura and Ryogo Kusama, who are caught up in one of the&nbsp;<em>Front Mission&nbsp;</em>series' signature political conflicts. As tensions rise and military zones become more "volatile", Kazuki and Ryogo must pilot their "wanzer" mechs to survive.</p>

<p>Just as with previous&nbsp;<em>Front Mission&nbsp;</em>remakes, you can expect this one to come complete with a number of improvements, including sharper visuals, smoother performance, and gameplay tweaks.</p>




<p>We'll have to wait and see whether Forever Entertainment intends to continue remaking&nbsp;<em>Front Mission&nbsp;</em>games; if so, the next logical candidate in the string would be 2003's&nbsp;<em>Front Mission 4</em>, the first series entry on the PlayStation 2.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Front Mission 3: Remake&nbsp;</em>launches for Nintendo Switch on June 26th. It will likely also be playable on Switch 2 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-successor-will-be-backwards-compatible" rel="nofollow">thanks to backwards compatibility</a>.</p>

Let's jump right in.</p>

<h2>MTG Final Fantasy - Magic Pot</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/-techraptor-magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-magic-pot.jpg?itok=itbIBPqb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/-techraptor-magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-magic-pot.jpg?itok=MdkTo3Dq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>That's right! We're so lucky to share the exclusive premiere of everyone's favorite recurring enemy: Magic Pot! This 3 mana 1/4 isn't just a decent blocker - it's also a great way to deal with cards causing trouble in your opponents' yards! And the fact that it dies and leaves behind a treasure token is a nice little bonus.</p>

<p>Now let's move onto the big guy, the crystal hunter himself:</p>

<h2>MTG Final Fantasy - Golbez, Crystal Collector</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/techraptor-exclusive-magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-golbez.jpg?itok=IivZOyzj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/techraptor-exclusive-magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-golbez.jpg?itok=X_OVuNKG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>We're so excited to premiere exclusive to TechRaptor&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy IV</em>'s number 2 baddie, Golbez! Known as the mysterious Man in Black in the original&nbsp;<em>FFIV</em>&nbsp;game, he later becomes a playable character in&nbsp;FFIV: The After Years. Zealous in his pursuit of Crystals!</p>

<p>That's matched perfectly with the flavor of this card, as Golbez, Crystal Collector cares about being surrounded by Artifacts! I've got plans already brewing to put together a Commander deck around Golbez, Crystal Collector, filling up my board with treasure and food token generation via cards like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/pip/137/nuka-cola-vending-machine" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nuka-Cola Vending Machine</a>, <a href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=671622" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Academy Manufactor</a>, <a href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=598195" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Currency Converter</a>, and more! Add in discard outlets like big creatures with Cycling (which you can grab back), Golbez, Crystal Collector's own Surveil ability, and old classics like&nbsp;<a href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=5113" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bottomless Pit</a>, and we've got a nasty little engine here!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-nightreign-review-fort-night.1200531/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/elden-ring-nightreign-review-fort-night<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>is not&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>. I know&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>is right there in the title, but trust me when I say that if you approach this one like it's just another&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree" rel="nofollow"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a>-style expansion, you're going to be either baffled or disappointed.</p>

<p>If you want to have a good time with&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, it's best to think of it not as a Soulslike but as a multiplayer experiment in the genre. Happily, a good time is very much there to be had, although it's not without its caveats.</p>

<p>What begins as a slightly janky-feeling, strangely "off" version of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-30m" rel="nofollow">megahit base game</a> slowly opens up and reveals its addictive core concepts over time.&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>embarks on its own journey, and while it wears the (god)skin of its larger cousin, it's a unique, compelling beast in its own right.</p>

<h2>Just What the Heck Is&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>?</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-review-grafted-scion.jpg?itok=5VCJTeuL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-review-grafted-scion.jpg?itok=ViGgJkQU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>is a very different beast to its forebear.</figcaption></figure><p>In essence,&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>offers a hyper-condensed, frantic version of the standard&nbsp;<em>Souls&nbsp;</em>exploration-combat loop. Each run takes place over three days; on the first two, you'll be exploring as many locations as possible to scavenge for weapons and supplies, all while defeating some very familiar-looking minibosses.</p>

<p>The third day sees you and your buddies (or just you, if you're a masochist) taking on a Nightlord, one of the new bosses created solely for&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>. They're formidable foes that will require exactly the same careful approach and tactical understanding you'd expect from an&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>encounter.</p>

<p>It's a system that takes some getting used to. As a player who likes to take their time and explore every nook and cranny of FromSoftware's beautifully crafted locations,&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>'s breakneck speed alienated me at first. Over time, however, I managed to attune to its uptempo polyrhythms.</p>

<p>This is also very much a game designed around its co-op component. While&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>does support solo play, I wouldn't recommend it; the solo runs I tried were fairly miserable, and publisher Bandai Namco has also made it clear this is an experience intended for three players.</p>

<p>Assuming you can assemble a squad, then,&nbsp;<i>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</i>very much wants you to hit the ground running; quite literally, in fact. As soon as the spectral birds that are your carriers drop you in Limveld, it's up to you to decide where to go, what to do, and how best to spend your time.</p>

<p>Eventually, optimal routes will begin to reveal themselves, and it won't be long before you're creating complex routes in your mind, planning which locations should be visited and on what days. What starts as an intimidating, overwhelming core loop quickly becomes intoxicating.</p>

<h2><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>'s Combat Feels Great</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-review-arrow.jpg?itok=SMO_PXcn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-review-arrow.jpg?itok=a1OTCyJM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Archery, in particular, has had a lot of attention paid to it in&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>It helps that&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>'s combat is...well, it's&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s combat, and for my money, it's the sharpest, smoothest iteration of the series' trademark weighty action-RPG fighting we've seen so far.</p>

<p>While most weapons and moves feel largely the same as they do in&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>, a couple of key improvements have been made. Bows feel great now, having been given a similar treatment to magic's glow-up in&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>; you can now easily and quickly fire off arrows, making archer Ironeye feel like a true master of his craft.</p>

<p>Since&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>is a multiplayer game, customizable characters have been done away with in favor of character archetypes. There are six to start, plus two more you'll unlock in due course, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses.</p>

<p>Wylder, for instance, is a jack-of-all-trades greatsword wielder with a gap-closing hookshot, while the Recluse is a magic user whose unique skill must be used well in order to balance her insatiable hunger for mana. The aforementioned Ironeye is a mobile archer, while the Raider is a fearsome Viking type with a huge axe.</p>

<p>Each archetype feels distinct and enjoyable, and they slot into groups well. Trying out combinations of these characters is one of&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>'s great joys, as is finding synergies between their core skills. Lining up the perfect Ironeye arrow after the Recluse has marked an enemy for extra damage feels sublime.</p>

<p>Outside of the character archetype changes,&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>'s combat is largely untouched from the&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>salad days. If you loved the way&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>felt to play, then you're going to enjoy the core loop in&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>as well. If you didn't, there's nothing here to convert you.</p>

<h2>Limveld Gets Repetitive Quickly in&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-review-evergaol.jpg?itok=lsPn8CeM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-review-evergaol.jpg?itok=U4Bn4fGy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll be seeing a lot of the same stuff in&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>runs.</figcaption></figure><p>It's outside of that core combat, when it comes time to explore <i>Nightreign</i>'s map, that things start to feel a touch more wobbly. Limveld itself is procedurally generated, but its locations aren't; every castle, camp, and ruin has the same layout.</p>

<p>For that reason, it really doesn't take long for things to start feeling repetitive. The pool of locations in&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>is pretty small, and once you've seen one ruin, you've seen 'em all. It doesn't matter whether it's Albinauric archers or Beastmen of Farum Azula waiting for you there; they're still lurking in the same dilapidated old buildings.</p>

<p>Repetition sets in worryingly quickly in&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>. I think a few more locations, or perhaps even a few more layouts for existing locations, would work wonders. As it is, despite its procedural generation shaking up positioning, Limveld feels decidedly more staid and dull than its bigger cousin.</p>

<p>Not only that, but on a number of my runs, I encountered three camps that all had the same bosses lying in wait for me. One set of Redmane Knights on a run is acceptable, but two is pushing it, and three feels like a programming error. Simply put,&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>needs more variety in its map and enemy design.</p>

<p>Happily, however, there are some elements that break things up a little. Shifting Earth events add new geographical features to Limveld, like a swamp of Scarlet Rot, a frigid mountain to climb, or an honest-to-Marika entire city that you and your team can explore.</p>

<p>Engaging in these extra events can be hugely dangerous, but it can also result in some pretty tasty rewards for your squad. Of course, the layout of these Shifting Earth events doesn't change much from run to run either, so it's a temporary balm for the repetition, but it's nice nonetheless.</p>

<h2><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>'s Lore Sure Is There</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-review-nameless-king.jpg?itok=UCsZyPdn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-review-nameless-king.jpg?itok=m67X564v 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>What is the Nameless King doing here? That's anyone's guess.</figcaption></figure><p>I'm a lorehound when it comes to FromSoftware games, and I admit that the lore and storytelling in&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>just doesn't feel like it has the spark of the base game (or, indeed, of the original&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dark-souls" rel="nofollow"><em>Dark Souls</em></a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/bloodborne" rel="nofollow"><em>Bloodborne</em></a>).</p>

<p>This time around, storytelling is mostly achieved via text-based character stories called "remembrances". Each character has a backstory, and you can advance that story by collecting memory fragments from the world, some of which will trigger objectives you can tackle on your next run.</p>

<p>These objectives might, for instance, involve finding an item in a certain location, or beating a boss or a Nightlord in order to progress. Completing them rewards you with more backstory for the character in question, and you may also uncover relationships between characters, friendly or adversarial.</p>

<p>The thing is that&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>&nbsp;- and, indeed, the&nbsp;<em>Souls&nbsp;</em>series in general - is very often more focused on the world rather than those who live in it. I don't really find&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>'s characters particularly interesting, and since Limgrave's procedural generation makes it feel a little uncanny, I can't say the world is too compelling either.</p>

<p>Thankfully, the lore and story very much take a backseat to&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>'s gameplay, so if you just want to focus on slaying bosses and learning synergies, you can very much do that.</p>

<p>It is also worth noting that FromSoftware games often benefit from the tireless efforts of lore archaeologists to uncover every nook and cranny of their stories, and naturally, at the time of writing, they haven't had the time to do so.&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>may, in due course, benefit from a thorough excavation of its narrative.</p>

<h2>Bosses Are Where&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>Truly Shines</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-review-augur.jpg?itok=wl0dJj9A 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-review-augur.jpg?itok=19n6NZyB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>'s bosses are beautiful and brutal.</figcaption></figure><p>If you've played a FromSoftware game before, you'll know that boss encounters are arguably where the studio truly shines, and I'm very happy to report that&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>is no exception in this area.</p>

<p>To put it simply, <i>Nightreign</i>'s boss encounters are an exhilarating rush. Each of its eight Nightlords feels distinct, and while some of them are a touch more uninspired than others (there's yet another big ol' dragon in here), they all thrillingly demand their own tactical adaptation.</p>

<p>The first boss, for instance, is Gladius, a three-headed dog that swings a chain around and commands fire. Partway through the fight, Gladius suddenly splits into three separate dogs, and you'll need to keep an eye on all three before they recombine in order to win.</p>

<p>My personal favorite was the Augur, an Elden Beast-like being made of water that gracefully flits around the arena, splashing you with tidal waves and summoning explosive jellyfish to keep you on your toes. It may not have been the most mechanically challenging fight, but it shows FromSoftware's majestic grandeur is still very much in evidence.</p>

<p>I won't spoil&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>'s boss surprises, but suffice it to say I came away thoroughly satisfied with each of its Nightlords. There are only eight, too, as far as I'm aware; I'm sure FromSoftware will add more through paid DLC, but this isn't a live-service title, so don't expect monthly updates with more bosses.</p>

<p>You can, of course, continue to hunt down remembrances and play&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>after its final boss encounter has ended, but not every game needs to demand every waking hour of your time, and <i>Nightreign</i>'s determination to give you a way out if you want one at its conclusion is commendable.</p>

<h2><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>Review - Final Thoughts</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-review-tree-spirit.jpg?itok=u5GJgf1K 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-review-tree-spirit.jpg?itok=pCIMZP2G 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>has plenty of greatest-hits bosses for you to fight.</figcaption></figure><p>I was pleasantly surprised by&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>. What cautiously won me over in the network test became an addictive compulsion over the course of my time with FromSoftware's multiplayer experiment, and I have no trouble unreservedly recommending it to anyone who loves&nbsp;<em>Souls</em>&nbsp;games' core combat loop.</p>

<p>I only wish Limveld was a more lively, vibrant place. Its procedural generation feels particularly uninspired, and although that can help with route optimization, I'd rather be wrongfooted and have to adapt than see the same scenery over and over again.</p>

<p>Still, focusing on&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>'s excellent boss encounters and range of build synergies should keep combat-happy Nightfarers sated. Just don't look too closely at the arenas you're fighting the monsters in.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/apple-gaming-acquisition-rac7<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Apple has made its first ever gaming studio acquisition in the form of&nbsp;<em>Sneaky Sasquatch&nbsp;</em>developer RAC7, and a report has also suggested that a new gaming-focused app could be on the way.</p>

<p>In a statement given to <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/apple-acquires-rac7-sneaky-sasquatch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Digital Trends</a>, Apple says it's "excited" that RAC7 has joined it, and that it intends to "continue to deliver a great experience for Apple Arcade players", offering "hundreds of games from many of the best game developers in the world".</p>

<p>RAC7 consists of just two employees, namely artist Jason Ennis and programmer Jesse Ringrose. The studio's previous works include sound-based horror game&nbsp;<em>Dark Echo&nbsp;</em>and "free-form puzzle game"&nbsp;<em>Splitter Critters</em>.</p>

<p>In the report, Gurman, citing "people with knowledge of the matter", says that the Cupertino giant is planning to introduce a "dedicated app for video games" on iOS devices later this year.</p>

<p>Said app will apparently serve as a launcher for games on the platform, and it'll also feature leaderboards, achievements, and "editorial content...about new titles". It's apparently intended to replace the Game Center app.</p>

<p>Gurman's isn't the first report to claim that Apple is developing a new gaming-focused app, either; back in 2024, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/10/22/apple-new-app-store-like-app-games/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">9to5Mac's Filipe Espósito</a> said Apple was working on a "new App Store-like app dedicated to games", which, if Bloomberg's report is accurate, is almost certainly the same app.</p>

That's also when the next set of Apple iPhone devices are likely to be revealed.</p>

<p>The news comes shortly after a major blow was dealt to Apple last month in the form of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-apple-500-million-euro-fine" rel="nofollow">€500 million fine</a> issued by the European Commission over the company's refusal to allow developers to point customers to non-App Store-related payment systems and third-party app stores.</p>

<p>Epic's&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>was at the center of that row, and following a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-offline-worldwide-ios-apple-block" rel="nofollow">worldwide outage</a> that Epic says was caused by Apple blocking the game's release on iOS,&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-ios-app-store-returns" rel="nofollow">finally reappeared</a> on Apple's operating system last week.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-release-date-pokemon-presents<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has announced the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>release date, and we also now know when the next Pokemon Presents showcase is set to air.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://press.pokemon.com/en/releases/Release-Date-for-Pokemon-Legends-Z-A-Revealed-and-Pokemon-Presents-Vid" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a>,&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>, which had already been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-presents-february-2025-all-reveals-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">slated for a late 2025 launch</a>, will be arriving on October 16th. Pre-orders for the game will be opening on June 5th, which is the same <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">day of the Switch 2's launch</a>.</p>

<p>As a reminder,&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>will be available on both the Switch 2 and the original Switch, and if you buy it on the older machine, you'll be able to pay to upgrade your version to the Switch 2 Edition of the game.</p>

<p>There's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-presents-august-2023" rel="nofollow">often</a> a Pokemon Presents <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everything-from-pokemon-presents-about-arceus-and-gen-4-remakes" rel="nofollow">show</a> during the summer, and this year's is set to air on July 22nd, with The Pokemon Company promising to reveal "the latest news and updates from the world of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>".</p>

<p>I'd be very surprised indeed if we didn't get at least a hint about the next generation of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games, which will almost certainly be exclusive to the Nintendo Switch 2. Expect more info about&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>prior to its release as well.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>, it's the second game in the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends&nbsp;</em>sub-series, following on from 2022's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/pokemon-legends-arceus" rel="nofollow"><em>Pokemon Legends: Arceus</em></a>.</p>




<p>While&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Arceus&nbsp;</em>took place during the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>world's past,&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>will instead be set in the present day. It'll take place entirely inside Lumiose City, which is currently in the midst of an urban redevelopment plan.</p>

<p><em>Pokemon Legends: Arceus&nbsp;</em>is set to launch on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/pokemon-legends-z-a-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/Pokemon-Legends-Z-A-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2827849.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Switch 2</a> on October 16th. Stay tuned for more.</p>
