            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Niantic and The Pokemon Company have announced that later this year, the level cap for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Go&nbsp;</em>will be increased, which the developer says will lead to a "more fun and engaging" leveling experience.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://pokemongo.com/en/post/pgo-leveling-update-announce-2025" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a>, Niantic says that on October 15th, the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Go&nbsp;</em>level cap will increase from 50 to 80, which, according to Niantic, will lead to players "celebrating leveling milestones with new rewards, new cosmetics, and more".</p>

<p>According to Niantic, the new level cap means that some players "can expect to jump in level based on their total earned XP", but that nobody's level will decrease. As such, when the update arrives, if you suddenly find yourself at a higher level, that's why.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-go-level-cap-increasing-art.jpg?itok=eXrT9rau 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-go-level-cap-increasing-art.jpg?itok=GX_FWCQL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pokemon Go</em>'s level cap will be increasing in October.</figcaption></figure><p>Not only is the level cap itself increasing, but leveling between 1 and 80 will be rebalanced, according to Niantic. Naturally, Level-Up Research tasks for levels 41 through 50 will be replaced with tasks from levels 71 through 80.</p>

<p>You can also expect other goodies like a boosted chance of becoming Lucky Friends with other players when you hit level 70, as well as new rewards for progression, including increased storage capacity and new avatar items.</p>

<p>By the time October 14th (the day before the update is set to hit) arrives, you'll get a "special medal" commemorating the highest level you've achieved in&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Go</em>, and if you hit 50, you'll get a special jacket and avatar pose.</p>

<p>Between now and October 15th, you'll get double catch XP from Nice, Great, and Excellent throws, and you'll get an extra 3,000 XP for winning raids and Max Battles. Timed Research will also become available to those level 7 or over, giving you the chance to "earn over 7 million XP", Niantic says.</p>

<p>All of this follows the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/niantic-scopely-sale-games" rel="nofollow">sale of Niantic to the Saudi-backed firm Scopely</a> back in February, a move that Scopely was quick to reassure fans would not affect the day-to-day operations of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Go</em><em>.</em></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-review-warm-welcome-home</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-review-a-warm-welcome-home.1279728/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With every <em>Story of Seasons</em> release, developing studio Marvelous gets closer and closer to finding the best recipe for a farming/life simulator, and <em>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar</em> is its next remake that blends old-school farming sim mechanics with all of the quirks that made Zephyr Town a beloved location in the franchise.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar</em> is a remake of the original Grand Bazaar title, though it was called <em>Harvest Moon DS: Grand Bazaar</em> at the time. The game sends players to Zephyr Town, where they not only take the role of the local farmer but also open a booth at the local bazaar.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-farm-view.jpg?itok=VOXcfesh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-farm-view.jpg?itok=LctRgiJr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Certain areas around&nbsp;<em>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar&nbsp;</em>give special views of the surrounding areas that change through the seasons.</figcaption></figure><p>In the latest iteration of the game, players are asked to grow the bazaar after the previous farmer left town years prior. There’s a storyline that drives this bazaar growth, making <em>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar</em> more narrative-driven than ever before in the franchise (with the exception of perhaps <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="34bff8c7-b745-4cf9-b20f-236a7829b85f" href="https://techraptor.net/games/story-of-seasons-wonderful-life" rel="nofollow"><em>Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life</em></a>).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Every Saturday, players will sell anything they have at their own bazaar stall. The bazaar is also where players will buy most of their things, though there is a general store that carries seeds and animal food for emergencies.</p>

<p>That leaves the rest of the week for farming and general day-to-day activities, like talking to villagers and foraging for supplies.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><em>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar</em> Makes Every Area Shine</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-bazaar-day.jpg?itok=k8TWXc2R 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-bazaar-day.jpg?itok=2dXaos11 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Selling at your own stall in&nbsp;<em>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar&nbsp;</em>makes the stakes of farming feel even higher as you appeal to customers and try to boost your profits.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Whether it’s a busy bazaar Saturday or a leisurely Tuesday, <em>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar</em> makes every in-game day enjoyable. Between an impressive number of events around town and plenty to do, there’s a feeling that every day matters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, the bazaar days are constantly busy. Selling to customers involves getting their attention with a cowbell and placing items they like on display. Don’t be fooled, this is harder than it sounds – things get hectic easily, and it’s easy to lose the interest of some customers while you’re serving others.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-playing-with-pet.jpg?itok=MvE8fwZT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-playing-with-pet.jpg?itok=Ec5St1JC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The animals in&nbsp;<em>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar&nbsp;</em>are as full of life and love as the characters.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Events crop up around the map consistently as you get to know the characters, breathing life into an already-bustling town. Not only do these give each day meaning, they’re easy to find – a map with notifications when an event is happening and where leads you to where you need to be.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These events highlight all the villagers in Zephyr Town, and some of them are sweet glimpses into the lives of townspeople you’d otherwise know little about. These also do a great job at pushing the relationships of bachelors and bachelorettes and the main story.</p>

<p>All of this also helps push the idea that the player is welcome in a loving, full-of-life town. It also helps that, for the first time ever, the major events and story are completely voiced.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-windmill.jpg?itok=m2qEq-T5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-windmill.jpg?itok=9jG5vShL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The windmills in&nbsp;<em>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar&nbsp;</em>are the key to making high profits -- once you've restored them, of course.</figcaption></figure><p>Even without events, there are plenty of quests to focus on. Villagers will ask for help as your relationship with them builds. Additionally, you can endlessly gather materials and forage to donate to sprites. Not only does this give rewards, but it also increases various quality levels of the things you donate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Plus, crafting things is a major part of the game, and crafting takes time. As you get further into the game, you’ll be going through long, multiple-step crafting formulas using a variety of materials.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This isn’t something that’s really a big focus in newer games in the genre. It’s definitely something that adds complexity to a farming sim in a great way without being overbearing, and its presence in the remake is a welcome reminder of where the genre was nearly 20 years ago.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-mountain-view.jpg?itok=67jjSZMk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-mountain-view.jpg?itok=DlsgDy2r 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some of the views around&nbsp;<em>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar&nbsp;</em>give a hint at the world around Zephyr Town that some of the other characters frequently visit.</figcaption></figure><p>However, all of this does take a bit to set up.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It’s easy to feel like things are slow at the beginning, as unlocking every available thing to do and starting to build relationships takes time. This does make the first Spring feel a bit slow, particularly if you know your way around farming sims or have played the original <em>Grand Bazaar</em> title.</p>

<p>After the first Spring, things progress at a nice pace, and I found I always had something to do around town the entire rest of the first year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even Spring of Year 2, while a bit slower on festivals, still had plenty for me to focus on doing. As someone who’s an avid farming/life sim lover, this was something I’d never really experienced in other games in the genre.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Zephyr Town Has Never Been More Beautiful</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-sophie-and-june.jpg?itok=lzCR5pKN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-sophie-and-june.jpg?itok=KtrggFvO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The characters in&nbsp;<em>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar&nbsp;</em>make every day an adventure between events, new dialogue, and quests.</figcaption></figure><p>It’d be easy for everything already mentioned to make a great <em>Story of Seasons</em> game, but <em>Grand Bazaar</em> outdoes itself with the aesthetics of Zephyr Town.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Zephyr Town is arguably the best-looking town in <em>Story of Seasons</em> history, and it’s always been gorgeous. It strikes a great balance between the natural environment and a tiny, yet bustling, town, and the windmills and traversal mechanics have always been fun.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The wind and movement mechanics, including jumping around and gliding to other areas, feel intuitive and make running around entertaining.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-fishing-in-the-rain.jpg?itok=hWMoKTL9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-fishing-in-the-rain.jpg?itok=BzvJi6AM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The first time I heard the rainy day music in&nbsp;<em>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar</em>, I fished all day just to listen to it.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>And then, perhaps the most surprising part of <em>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar</em> for me was the music. Farming Sims aren’t known for their soundtracks, but <em>Grand Bazaar</em> had several gorgeous tracks that forced me to stop and appreciate them.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Overall, Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar Is One of The Best Yet</h2>

<p><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c66e36ec-389d-4125-b93f-0d46957d3097" href="https://techraptor.net/games/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar" rel="nofollow"><em>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar</em></a> is a home run for players who loved the original and an amazing introductory farming/life sim for newcomers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It’s cozy without being too simple, the characters and town are brimming with life, and it’s one of the prettiest <em>Story of Seasons</em> games. I had high hopes for the remake, and I’m glad to see that Marvelous did more than deliver – it awed.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It was during last year's The Game Awards that SEGA <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VHYLJR9pNg" rel="nofollow">announced</a> the revival of several classic IPs. Revivals included&nbsp;<em>Golden Axe, Jet Set Radio,</em>&nbsp;and more. The one that stood out to me the most, however, was&nbsp;<em>Shinobi</em>:&nbsp;<em>Art of Vengeance,&nbsp;</em>if anything, due to the excitement of this old-school series' fans.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Shinobi: Art of Vengeance&nbsp;</em>is a gorgeous, hand-drawn 2D platformer with <a href="https://techraptor.net/genre/metroidvania/games" rel="nofollow">Metroidvania </a>elements. It's my first foray into this longtime franchise, yet it serves as the perfect starting point for anyone interested in the adventures of Joe Musashi. Fluid combat with impeccable style makes this a triumphant return for the series.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shinobi-wide-shot.jpg?itok=lebbdFWh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shinobi-wide-shot.jpg?itok=fM7VlIR- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Aura farming: Part 1.</figcaption></figure><h2>Return of the Legendary Joe Musashi</h2>

<p>Legendary shinobi Joe Musashi is living a peaceful life in his ninja village, but suddenly his world is uprooted as everything he loves is burned to the ground. His pregnant wife is in danger, and only a few survivors remain from the aftermath wrought by the wretched ENE Corp and its leader, Ruse.</p>

<p>Thus begins your adventure. Through the flames, Joe Musashi furiously slashes through the invading ninjas. This introductory sequence makes for a strong prologue and immediately sets the tone for&nbsp;<em>Shinobi: Art of Vengeance</em>: A relentless, challenging, and exhilarating adventure on your quest for revenge.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shinobi-art-of-vengeance-fireworks.jpg?itok=UXbvmCdA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shinobi-art-of-vengeance-fireworks.jpg?itok=W23VRNe9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Aura farming: Part 2.</figcaption></figure><p>Joe Musashi is a&nbsp;<em>very</em>&nbsp;capable ninja; in fact, I see him in the same light as the deadly and efficient Ryu Hayabusa from&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden</em>. Joe's a relentless force to be reckoned with, and&nbsp;<em>Shinobi: Art of Vengeance</em>'s combat captures that feeling of power and expertise in the shinobi arts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You're equipped with a myriad of abilities, and as you progress through a great variety of Metroidvania-like levels, you'll gain new abilities to help you combat stronger foes, as well as traverse new obstacles.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shinobi-art-of-vengeance-combat.jpg?itok=HxdiBQyx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shinobi-art-of-vengeance-combat.jpg?itok=HcNJxYs_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Even when you're outnumbered, it's an unfair fight... for the enemy.</figcaption></figure><h2>Combat Flows Like Water</h2>

<p>It's been a good while since I've played a 2D game with combat this fluid. Joe moves like water as he weaves between foes. Dodging while in between attacks allows you to flow back and forth, continually attacking while also avoiding enemy moves.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As you gain more abilities and unlock additional moves, your ability to combo enemies expands greatly. Almost like a fighting game, or perhaps more appropriately a beat 'em up (the developer, Lizardcube, is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/streets-of-rage-4-review" rel="nofollow">no stranger</a> to that genre), you can juggle enemies to increase your combo count.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shinobi-art-of-vengeance-parry.jpg?itok=nbdiv15d 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shinobi-art-of-vengeance-parry.jpg?itok=B5ycLATw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Just another day at the market.</figcaption></figure><p>You're incentivized to keep up your combo and not get hit. Combo amulets are items that grant you various bonuses if you reach a certain combo count. Keeping that combo alive isn't necessary to succeed, but it's always a blast to see how high it can go while also being rewarded for your efforts.</p>

<p>There are also passive amulets that enhance your abilities; chiefly, your Ninpo and Ninjutsu. The former are spells that are mostly damage-based. These include fire breath, which is an easy-to-master damage ability. Some are more complex, like Water Ninpo, which is essentially a parry that retaliates with strong damage.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shinobi-art-of-vengeance-nijutsu.jpg?itok=Z25XE73l 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shinobi-art-of-vengeance-nijutsu.jpg?itok=MRAsN3St 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Aura farming: Part 3</figcaption></figure><p>With eight Ninpo total, you have a good variety to choose from. Now, combine those with Ninjutsu, and you're a true force to be reckoned with. Ninjutsu takes longer to charge up and has devastatingly good effects: Karyu brings forth hellfire that consumes the entire screen, dealing huge damage to enemies and bosses.</p>

<p>Joe's toolkit also comes with Ningi. These include claws to traverse rocky walls and ceilings, a glider to float in the air, and a hook that latches onto anchors. With seven total, most of these are your typical Metroidvania upgrades; essentially, tools that help you get to previously unreachable areas.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shinobi-art-of-vengeance-glider.jpg?itok=XFAfg1yl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shinobi-art-of-vengeance-glider.jpg?itok=cNYSfBRD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Everyone loves a good glider.</figcaption></figure><h2>Is&nbsp;<em>Shinobi: The Art of Vengeance&nbsp;</em>a True Metroidvania?</h2>

<p>While I use the term Metroidvania, in truth, it's more that it borrows elements from this genre. <em>Shinobi: Art of Vegeance&nbsp;</em>doesn't take place within one huge area. Rather, it's level-based, so it'll take you from level-to-level with a boss at the end of each.</p>

<p>There will be areas you can't access immediately, and that's where Ningi comes in.&nbsp;<em>Shinobi: Art of Vengeance</em>&nbsp;is chock full of collectibles and items that'll aid you in your adventure, so going back to these areas with your new tools is advantageous.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A lot of these previously unreachable areas feature some of&nbsp;<em>Shinobi</em>:&nbsp;<em>Art of Vengeance</em>'s most challenging platforming segments. Hazards are aplenty here, with sharpened spikes, fire, and other dangers lurking around every corner.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shinobi-art-of-vengeance-challenge-area.jpg?itok=NrAXqJhA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shinobi-art-of-vengeance-challenge-area.jpg?itok=0yexuwQp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Quite the fall!</figcaption></figure><p>Platforming is pretty fluid, but I found myself frustrated with hitboxes. Platforming segments are well-designed, but many of my deaths felt like they weren't my fault.</p>

<p>Deceptive hit boxes on certain hazards felt frequent in some platforming-oriented challenge areas, so it was a true situation of trial and error. A lot of these segments use Joe's claws that latch onto ceilings and other objects, but the way he moves with these claws felt a tad too unrefined and led to my death.</p>

<p>This is all exacerbated by the deadly nature of hazards. They instantly kill you, or rather, they respawn Joe with a bit less health. But the checkpoints involving these can be inconsistent and lead to further frustration. When you're in the middle of combat with powerful foes and you die from a spike, it all ruins the flow a bit.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shinobi-art-of-vengeance-fire-ninjutsu.jpg?itok=weJDlN83 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shinobi-art-of-vengeance-fire-ninjutsu.jpg?itok=o0CfiDg1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sometimes you just need to hit the panic button to survive.</figcaption></figure><h2>Bosses and Other Dangerous Foes</h2>

<p>Even if some areas can be a tad annoying, <em>Shinobi: Art of Vengeance</em>&nbsp;does a good job of intermingling enemy encounters with creative placement of hazards.</p>

<p>As always,<em>&nbsp;</em>a proper shinobi takes advantage of all of his tools and skills. Some enemies have armor, so your abilities might be more focused on dealing damage to armor as opposed to health. It's up to you to learn these moves and use them when appropriate, and it's gratifying to absolutely dominate a wave of enemies, hardly stopping, as you traverse these levels.&nbsp;</p>

Using your attacks gradually builds up this bar, and you can then execute them for additional rewards. Shuriken deal extra damage to the gauge, so I enjoyed throwing those in between attacks to further my combo and execute enemies.</p>

<p>I mentioned bosses, and yes, you'll face plenty of them here. In games with similar elements, these bosses can be hit-or-miss. I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of&nbsp;<em>Shinobi: Art of Vengeance</em>'s bosses. They have a nice diversity in attacks, and most of them feel distinct from one another.</p>

Learn a boss' move and utilize your full kit, and you'll be running circles around these guys. That's not to say they're without challenge -- they do have measures in place to counter Joe in some ways -- but once you get a grasp on&nbsp;the mechanics of combat, you have the potential to dominate these challenges.</p>

<p>Beat&nbsp;<em>Shinobi: Art of Vengeance</em>, and you'll gain access to the Boss Rush and Arcade modes. Boss Rush is an uncompromising tour through all of the game's bosses. There are no safeguards here. Die, and you'll have to redo the whole gauntlet. Those looking for a greater challenge will definitely enjoy this mode.</p>

<p>Likewise, Arcade is a more traditional take on the genre. The level layouts remain the same, but you're aiming for a high score. As this is more old-school, you're not able to quickly travel across levels by choosing a checkpoint. Again, this is another good way to challenge players, though something like a global rankings for scores would be nice to see.</p>

<p>I mentioned this before, but&nbsp;<em>Shinobi: Art of Vengeance&nbsp;</em>is breathtakingly beautiful. The hand-drawn visuals are expertly animated and complement the sort of traditional Japanese aesthetic perfectly. Of course, Joe Musashi is a ninja of the modern era, so you'll find plenty of different locales outside of the classic Japanese countryside.</p>

<p>That includes neon-soaked cities, underground laboratories, arid deserts, and much more. These levels all have a distinct feel from one another, and art design plays a huge part in that. The backgrounds of these stages are beautifully drawn and packed with a ton of detail, so it truly is a feast for the eyes.</p>

Every attack has weight and flair. Ninjutsu are the highlight here, though. Whether it's that fire move Karyu I mentioned, or Shisui, a water-based healing move, the whole screen is consumed with some of the finest animation and art in gaming.</p>

<p>Besides its visuals,&nbsp;<em>Shinobi: Art of Vengeance&nbsp;</em>is accompanied by a wonderful soundtrack by Tee Lopes.&nbsp;For this game, he infuses traditional Japanese instruments with more contemporary electronic instruments.&nbsp;The intermingling of Japanese instruments with modern rock-and-roll and electronic music is a similar approach to the recent&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-review-razor-sharp-retro-platformer" rel="nofollow"><em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em></a>, though I'd say&nbsp;<em>Shinobi: Art of Vengeance&nbsp;</em>is going for something more modern.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A lot of fellow writers in my field have been gassing up&nbsp;<em>Shinobi: Art of Vengeance&nbsp;</em>since Summer Game Fest Play Days last June, so I was excited to see what all the hubbub was about. I see it now. It's fast. Exhilarating. Deadly. Cutting edge. Fans of ninjas, platformers, or games with plenty of combo potential will certainly love&nbsp;<em>Shinobi: Art of Vengeance.</em></p>
