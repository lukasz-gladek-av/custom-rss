            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/to-a-t-release-date-katamari-creator<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Keita Takahashi, the creator of games like&nbsp;<em>Katamari Damacy&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Wattam</em>, has revealed the release date for his latest game&nbsp;<em>To a T</em>. It's scheduled to hit Xbox and PC later this year.</p>

<p>Per a new trailer,&nbsp;<em>To a T&nbsp;</em>will launch across Xbox Series X|S and PC on May 28th. It sounds as though the Xbox One version, which was apparently revealed back when the game was <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2023/06/annapurna-interactive-uvula-and-keita-takahashi-announce-to-a-t-for-xbox-series-xbox-one-and-pc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">unveiled in 2023</a>, is no longer happening.</p>

<p>Takahashi and his team describe&nbsp;<em>To a T&nbsp;</em>as "a narrative adventure game...with a strong focus on character, interaction, story, and exploration". You will play the role of Teen, a teenager permanently stuck in a T-pose trying to live a normal life. Hey, at least nobody will challenge Teen's dominance.</p>

<p>As well as helping Teen with their everyday life, you'll also be able to explore the town in which they live, meeting its inhabitants and collecting coins scattered around the streets. <em>To a T</em> will offer a "free mode" that will allow you to explore at your leisure.</p>

<p>Not only that, but you'll also be able to customize Teen in whatever style you like, purchasing clothing from stores you'll find around town. Don't worry, though; I'm pretty sure you won't need to buy those clothes with real currency.</p>

<p>You can check out the (frankly adorable) release date trailer for&nbsp;<em>To a T&nbsp;</em>right here. It features an original song, "Giraffe Song", sung by none other than&nbsp;<em>Steven Universe</em>'s Rebecca Sugar, as well as exactly the kind of visual style you'd expect from the creator of&nbsp;<em>Katamari&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/wattam" rel="nofollow"><em>Wattam</em></a>.</p>




<p><em>To a T&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1875320/to_a_T/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/to-a-t/9NM6NMBJ7ZK4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on May 28th. It'll also be available as part of Xbox Game Pass on day one, although you'll <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-price-hike-new-tier" rel="nofollow">need to be subscribed</a> to either PC Game Pass or Game Pass Ultimate to play it.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortal-kombat-1-t-1000-dlc-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mortal-kombat-1-t-1000-dlc-release-date-revealed.1117041/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortal-kombat-1-t-1000-dlc-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Warner Bros and NetherRealm Studios have revealed the release date for&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>'s upcoming T-1000 DLC, and it won't be long before you get to slice your opponents apart as Robert Patrick's intimidating automaton.</p>

<p>Per a new trailer showing off the T-1000's moves, the character, who is the latest crossover fighter to appear as part of the game's&nbsp;<em>Khaos Reigns&nbsp;</em>expansion, will be released for owners of that expansion on March 18th and for everyone else on March 25th.</p>

<p>The T-1000 wears his (its?) iconic police officer uniform from&nbsp;<em>Terminator 2: Judgment Day</em>, and since the newer model is a shapeshifter, it can be seen transforming its arms into weapons like blades and Kabal-esque hookswords.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/t-1000-johnny-cage-mortal-kombat-1.jpg?itok=JBwFNUZO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/t-1000-johnny-cage-mortal-kombat-1.jpg?itok=1Xpp0kqp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The T-1000 will fit into&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>'s violent world perfectly.</figcaption></figure><p>During the closing moments of the DLC fighter's teaser trailer, after he's beaten Johnny Cage to a pulp, we see him using his Fatality, in which he uses&nbsp;<em>Terminator 2</em>'s infamous truck to pulverize his opponent before hopping out of the driver's seat and finishing the job with a submachine gun.</p>

<p>It's not just the T-1000, either. The trailer also teases a little of new Kameo fighter Madam Bo, who appears in&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>'s main story mode as the owner of the Fengjian Teahouse and a friend to Raiden and Kung Lao.</p>

<p>In the trailer, she can be seen leapfrogging over the T-1000 to deliver some pretty impressive martial arts moves of her own, so it looks like she'll be a formidable ally.</p>

<p>You can check out the release date trailer for the T-1000 right here, with&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat&nbsp;</em>head honcho Ed Boon <a href="https://x.com/noobde/status/1893814056609263619" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">promising</a> that a longer trailer will be on the way "soon".</p>




<p>The T-1000 is just the latest crossover fighter to appear in&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>. He's preceded by the likes of&nbsp;<em>The Boys</em>' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortal-kombat-1-homelander-first-look" rel="nofollow">Homelander</a>, DC antihero&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortal-kombat-1-peacemaker-gameplay" rel="nofollow">Peacemaker</a>, and&nbsp;<em>Invincible</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-mortal-kombat-1-dlc-omni-man-gets-gameplay-reveal-november-release-window" rel="nofollow">Omni-Man</a> (are you sensing a pattern emerging here?).</p>

<p>The game's roster has also been expanded with fighters from previous&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat&nbsp;</em>games, including telekinetic ninja <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortal-kombat-1-ermac-release-date" rel="nofollow">Ermac</a> and Netherrealm sorcerer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/john-cena-will-voice-peacemaker-in-mortal-kombat-1-while-quan-chi-gets-release-date" rel="nofollow">Quan Chi</a>.</p>

<p>Patrick's single-minded automaton, as well as the upcoming Conan the Barbarian DLC, won't be the only crossover in&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat</em>'s future, either; Lin Kuei ninja Sub-Zero recently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-lawless-update-chapter-6-season-2" rel="nofollow">found his way into&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em></a>, and it's been rumored that his rival Scorpion will be appearing later in the game's newest season as well.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1971870/Mortal_Kombat_1/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/mortal-kombat-1/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/mortal-kombat-1/9N7271QN4SGB" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/mortal-kombat-1-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>. The game's T-1000 DLC launches on March 25th for general players and March 18th for&nbsp;<em>Khaos Reigns&nbsp;</em>owners.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bossa-studios-layoffs-restructuring</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bossa-studios-layoffs-restructuring<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Surgeon Simulator&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>I Am Bread&nbsp;</em>developer Bossa Studios has announced it will lay off an undisclosed number of employees, and that it will restructure its operations to focus on smaller projects.</p>

<p>In a LinkedIn <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bossa-games_activity-7298367748902912001-h4lt/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/surgeon-simulator-developer-bossa-games-confirms-layoffs-amid-industry-turmoil-" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Game Developer</a>), Bossa co-CEO Henrique Olifiers says that the "disruption" brought to the games industry in the past couple of years has seen "treasured studios, teams, and games being <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-shuts-down-saints-row-developer-volition" rel="nofollow">shut down</a> or significantly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sumo-group-layoffs-refocus" rel="nofollow">scaled back</a>".</p>

<p>Olifiers calls this a "fundamental transformation" of the industry and says that Bossa isn't immune to it; his studio has made the "painful decision" to scale itself back, which means "saying very difficult goodbyes to extremely talented and treasured colleagues", although he doesn't say how many or in which areas of the studio.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/surgeon-simulator-2-bossa-studios-layoffs.jpg?itok=PYbTtKDg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/surgeon-simulator-2-bossa-studios-layoffs.jpg?itok=o6vevPkx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bossa Studios is to lay off an undisclosed number of employees.</figcaption></figure><p>Olifiers goes on to say that Bossa will be focusing on the upcoming launch of open-world survival-crafter&nbsp;<em>Lost Skies</em>, which is currently in "late-stage production". The game does not yet have a release date.</p>

<p>He says that once&nbsp;<em>Lost Skies&nbsp;</em>is out and "enjoying live operations", Bossa will "reshape into small teams working independently on novel game ideas", with a view to releasing those games "as early as possible".</p>

<p>In closing, Olifiers says he and his team wish they had "found a way of navigating [industry] turmoil without resorting to the decision of scaling back [their] teams", but that they "failed" to do so.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time in the last year or so that Bossa has laid off employees. Back in January, the studio said that it had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bossa-studios-and-archiact-hit-by-layoffs" rel="nofollow">laid off around a third of its workforce</a>, with Olifiers putting those layoffs down to increasing costs, delayed funding, and the troubles faced by smaller games in the market.</p>

In recent weeks, we've seen the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/oxenfree-night-school-layoffs" rel="nofollow"><em>Oxenfree&nbsp;</em>studio Night School</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Killer Instinct&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rumbleverse-and-killer-instct-studio-iron-galaxy-suffers-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Iron Galaxy</a> reducing staff.</p>

<p>It's not just smaller studios, either; NetEase recently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-studio-shockingly-closed-by-netease-laying-off-everyone" rel="nofollow">laid off the entire team</a> responsible for developing&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>in Seattle, despite the fact that the game had 40 million (admittedly not necessarily active) players <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-40m" rel="nofollow">at last count</a>.</p>
