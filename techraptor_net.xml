            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-update-crossovers-cyberpunk<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Indie poker roguelike&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>has received a brand new update, and it's bringing crossover card skins based on popular franchises like&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Binding of Isaac</em>, and more.</p>

<p>This update constitutes the second part of the "Friends of Jimbo" event, which was first revealed during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-august-2024-recap">August's Nintendo Direct presentation</a>&nbsp;and which has already seen the likes of&nbsp;<em>The Witcher</em>,&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver&nbsp;</em>joining&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>(with the latter even <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/big-dave-diver-collaboration-update-balatro">returning the favor recently</a>).</p>

<p>The latest Friends of Jimbo update brings four new franchises into the&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>fold:&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Binding of Isaac</em>,&nbsp;<em>Slay the Spire</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley</em>, each of which gets a number of cards based on "fan-favorite characters".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/balatro-update-crossover-cards-stardew-valley.jpg?itok=49QhJLB8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/balatro-update-crossover-cards-stardew-valley.jpg?itok=LrJL_O6B 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>has some new crossover cards for you to enjoy.</figcaption></figure><p>Just like the first Friends of Jimbo update, this&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>crossover content is entirely free, and it's up for grabs across all platforms on which&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>is currently available as well, including <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-mobile-release-date">mobile devices</a>.</p>

<p>It's also worth noting that this isn't the big&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>update that developer LocalThunk <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-reach-2-million-as-devs-promise-first-major-update-soon">promised back in August</a>. That one is set to bring "new ideas and strategies" to&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>, and it's set to launch sometime next year.</p>

<p>If you've somehow managed to avoid the&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>hype, it's a poker-based roguelike created by Canadian developer LocalThunk, and it's based around creating big combos and game-breaking strategies to reach higher and higher score multipliers.</p>

<p>While the game is based on poker, it's more about creating synergy across the cards in your deck so that you can keep meeting a series of rising point antes over the course of a run.</p>




<p>Shortly after being released,&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-half-million">crossed 500,000 sales</a>, hitting the million mark <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-one-million">within a month of its initial launch</a>. At last count, the game had reached two million sales, and that number is only likely to increase as time goes on.</p>

<p><em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379780/Balatro/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/balatro/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/balatro/9PK087LNGJC5" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/balatro-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/factorio-space-age-dlc-sales-400k</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/factorio-space-age-dlc-sales-reach-400k-in-less-than-a-week.1019340/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/factorio-space-age-dlc-sales-400k<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Factorio: Space Age&nbsp;</em>has reached a pretty impressive sales milestone despite being on release for less than a week, developer Wube Software has revealed.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-434" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Friday Facts</a>&nbsp;<em>Factorio&nbsp;</em>blog post, Wube says that&nbsp;<em>Space Age&nbsp;</em>sales have passed the 400,000 mark. Earlier this week,&nbsp;<em>Factorio&nbsp;</em>enjoyed its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/factorio-player-count-space-age-20-update">highest ever concurrent player count</a>&nbsp;thanks to the launch of said DLC, as well as the base game's 2.0 update.</p>

<p>By way of one "last little surprise" for&nbsp;<em>Space Age</em>, Wube also announced a new feature called the Galaxy of Fame. Essentially, when you finish&nbsp;<em>Space Age</em>'s campaign, you'll be able to upload a snapshot of your game, which will then add your game's info and stats to a collective gallery.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/factorio-space-age-dlc-sales-galaxy-of-fame.jpg?itok=i9XKn2Cu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/factorio-space-age-dlc-sales-galaxy-of-fame.jpg?itok=M6KBCYkA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Galaxy of Fame allows&nbsp;<em>Factorio: Space Age&nbsp;</em>players to immortalize their achievements.</figcaption></figure><p>While you're looking at the Galaxy of Fame, you can browse other player' factories and get a glimpse into their inner workings. Wube says it isn't banning "saves that use cheats/commands/editor" yet, although more "filtering options" will soon be added.</p>

<p>The studio also provides an update on&nbsp;<em>Factorio: Space Age&nbsp;</em>and the 2.0 update for Nintendo Switch. Sadly, if you were hoping for the DLC to hit Nintendo's console, there's some bad news: the Switch isn't getting&nbsp;<em>Space Age</em>.</p>

<p>Wube says that there's "simply not enough RAM" in the Switch to fit&nbsp;<em>Space Age</em>'s new factories, nor is there enough CPU to run the DLC at 60fps thanks to the expanded systems. New sprites also won't fit in the Switch's VRAM, apparently.</p>

<p>However, the 2.0 update will be making its way to the Switch. Wube says it should arrive in "1-2 months", although the studio is reluctant to commit to a release date "since the release process on consoles takes a long time".</p>




<p><em>Factorio: Space Age&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/645390/Factorio_Space_Age/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, and the base game is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/427520/Factorio/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">also available on Steam</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/factorio-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Zenless Zone Zero Version 1.3 Set to Launch Next Month]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-version-13-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/zenless-zone-zero-version-1-3-set-to-launch-next-month.1019295/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-version-13-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has announced the release date for&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 1.3, and it'll bring two new S-level characters to add to your team, plus new areas to explore and more.</p>

<p>Version 1.3 arrives on November 6th, and just like in&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-version-12-release-date">previous</a>&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>updates, you can look forward to an expansion of the game's main story. This time around, you'll be working alongside the Hollow Investigative Association to respond to a new threat.</p>

<p>Two major S-level characters will be added to the game in this update as well. The first, Yanagi, is an Electric-Anomaly fighter who can boost Disorder damage for the team and "rapidly deal massive amounts of damage to enemies" with her Ex Special Attack.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zenless-zone-zero-version-1.3-lighter.jpg?itok=_HtZT77y 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zenless-zone-zero-version-1.3-lighter.jpg?itok=HiD-Oqne 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Lighter is one of two fighters being added to&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>in Version 1.3.</figcaption></figure><p>Your other fighter this update is Lighter, a Fire-Stun agent who can buff himself by building up his Morale as well as lowering enemies' resistances to the Ice and Fire elements. Two new A-level Bangboos, Baddieboo and Knightboo, are also coming in Version 1.3.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to two brand new gameplay modes. The first, The Mystery of Arpeggio Fault, is a roguelike mode that offers the chance to battle through "random environments with random Resonia and resources".</p>

<p>The Simulated Battle Trial, meanwhile, is pretty much what you think it is based on the name; it lets you practise your combat skills as you hack through increasingly tough enemies, and you can earn Polychromes and Badges by reaching certain levels in said trial.</p>




<p>In case you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>is, it's the latest action RPG from&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/honkai-star-rail">Honkai: Star Rail</a>&nbsp;</em>studio HoYoverse. Unlike those games,&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>takes place in an urban fantasy world that's not a million miles away from the likes of&nbsp;<em>Persona</em>.</p>

<p>Gameplay-wise, however,&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>takes its cues from games like&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry</em>; it revolves around dealing quick damage, dodging enemy attacks, and racking up combos, although it does still feature HoYoverse's signature gacha mechanics.</p>

<p><em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>is available to play right now for free on <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Microsoft CEO Scores Eye-Watering Payrise Despite Huge Layoffs]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-ceo-payrise-layoffs</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-ceo-scores-eye-watering-payrise-despite-huge-layoffs.1019259/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-ceo-payrise-layoffs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella will see his salary increase by an eye-watering amount this fiscal year, despite the fact that Microsoft has laid off thousands of employees over the past twelve months or so.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://microsoft.gcs-web.com/node/33151/html#toc858775_24" rel="noopener" target="_blank">regulatory filing</a> by Microsoft, Nadella's pay will increase to $79.1 million this year, which is a 63% increase on his 2023 pay.</p>

<p>Most of that amount will be awarded in shares, but some of it is also a cash incentive, although Nadella <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-gets-791-mln-pay-2024-63" rel="noopener" target="_blank">did request a reduction</a> in said cash incentive in order to "reflect his personal accountability for the focus and speed required for the changes that today’s cybersecurity threat landscape showed were necessary".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/satya-nadella-microsoft-ceo-payrise.jpg?itok=kUVxtx2p 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/satya-nadella-microsoft-ceo-payrise.jpg?itok=r6EV8KSF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella will earn a staggering amount of money this fiscal year.</figcaption></figure><p>News of Nadella's payrise was accompanied by the release of Microsoft's <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/investor/reports/ar24/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">2024 annual fiscal report</a>, which revealed that Xbox revenue is up 50%, "driven by 44 points of net impact from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-activision-blizzard-merger-finalized">Activision Blizzard acquisition</a>".</p>

<p>The report states that this increase mainly reflects "the change of Activision Blizzard content from third-party to first-party", so it's essentially Microsoft incorporating Activision Blizzard's revenue into its own figures.</p>

<p>Additionally, the figure includes not only sales, but also Game Pass subscriptions, Cloud Gaming, and advertising, as well as other miscellaneous services.</p>

<p>Nadella's payrise and Microsoft's relative success this fiscal year come after thousands of layoffs at the company. Back in January, Microsoft <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-report">let almost 2,000 employees go</a> from its gaming divisions, and those layoffs were followed by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-gaming-layoffs-september">hundreds more back in September</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/microsoft-ceo-payrise-world-of-warcraft.jpg?itok=dSDc10yx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/microsoft-ceo-payrise-world-of-warcraft.jpg?itok=TrnrPxIi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Microsoft is now incorporating Activision Blizzard's revenue into its own figures.</figcaption></figure><p>This year also saw Xbox <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown">closing down three of its studios</a>:&nbsp;<em>Mighty Doom&nbsp;</em>developer Alpha Dog,&nbsp;<em>Redfall&nbsp;</em>outfit Arkane Austin, and&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush&nbsp;</em>studio Tango Gameworks, although the latter was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-acquires-tango-gameworks-and-hi-fi-rush-ip-with-plans-for-future-expansion">subsequently snapped up by&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>publisher Krafton</a>, along with the&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush&nbsp;</em>IP.</p>

<p>Nadella isn't the only corporate CEO thriving amidst a very <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-june-14th">uncertain time for the gaming industry</a>. In June, it was revealed that EA CEO Andrew Wilson <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-ceo-25-million-income-layoffs">made over $25 million last year</a> despite that company also suffering <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/electronic-arts-to-lay-off-5-of-its-workforce-amid-refocus-on-owned-ip-and-sports-games">hundreds of layoffs</a>.</p>
