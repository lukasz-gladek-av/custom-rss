            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Team17 and developer Sassy Chap Games have announced that their dating sim<i>&nbsp;Date Everything!&nbsp;</i>has managed to hit a major sales milestone in the weeks since its release.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-date-everything-release-date-summer" rel="nofollow">finally released back in June</a>, has sold 500,000 copies across all the platforms on which it's currently available. The game isn't playable as part of any major subscription services, either, so this figure does refer exclusively to sales and not just "players".</p>

<p>As part of celebrations for reaching this sales milestone, Team17 and Sassy Chap Games are giving away a washing machine (yes, you read that right), because, well, as the studios say, "people need washing machines [and] some people clearly like dating washing machines". Can't argue with that.</p>

You can read more about how to enter <a href="https://www.team17.com/competition/date-everything-washing-machine-competition" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>is, well, it's a dating sim that allows you to date...okay, not quite everything, but certainly a lot of things you can't date anywhere else. That includes your washing machine, but also a candelabra, a piano, and even the concept of existential dread.</p>

<p>Originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/date-everything-dating-sim" rel="nofollow">announced in July last year</a>, it was due for release in 2024, but was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/date-everything-delayed-valentines-day" rel="nofollow">delayed to Valentine's Day this year</a>, which would have been the best possible release date for it. Unfortunately, it was then <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/date-everything-delayed-again" rel="nofollow">pushed back again</a>, eventually finding its permanent launch day in June.</p>




<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2201320/Date_Everything/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10010892" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/date-everything/9n0ccpmbljq8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/date-everything-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> (and therefore also Nintendo Switch 2 via backwards compatibility).</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New PUBG Anti-Cheat System Coming in Next Update]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-pubg-anti-cheat-system</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-pubg-anti-cheat-system-coming-in-next-update.1267140/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Krafton has announced that a new anti-cheat system will be making its way to&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>in the popular battle royale game's next major update.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://pubg.com/en/news/9001" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a>&nbsp;on the official&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>website, Krafton says the new system is designed to "directly detect abnormal behavior at the deepest layer of the operating system". The game already had kernel-level anti-cheat measures in place, but the new tool will offer "even more precise and effective protection", the studio says.</p>

<p>Essentially, it works as you'd expect kernel-level anti-cheat to work; once you boot up the game, the tool scans for abnormal code, and if it detects any illegal software being used, it'll boot the player using it from the game and ban them.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/new-pubg-anti-cheat-system-shooting.jpg?itok=aVN89Dnb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/new-pubg-anti-cheat-system-shooting.jpg?itok=g8TWlfkl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>New anti-cheat tools are coming to&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>in the game's next update.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Krafton, the new anti-cheat tools will allow the studio to identify cheaters that were previously difficult to detect, and it'll also "proactively counter advanced cheats, reducing the damage caused by illegal software".</p>

<p>The studio also confirms that the new anti-cheat technology will only run while you're playing&nbsp;<em>PUBG</em>, and will immediately shut itself down once you exit the game. That feels like it should be fairly standard behavior for anti-cheat tools, but it's a nice reassurance all the same.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that you probably shouldn't use other anti-cheat solutions at the same time as this tool is running. Krafton says that doing so could cause "system conflicts or unexpected behavior", including "unexpected issues during launch or gameplay".</p>

<p>In future, Krafton says it intends to "advance [its] illegal software countermeasures by combining technological innovation with operational efficiency", so there's likely more anti-cheat stuff on the way, especially if this system proves to have flaws in day-to-day running.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/new-pubg-anti-cheat-system-motorbike.jpg?itok=dCIb2-YD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/new-pubg-anti-cheat-system-motorbike.jpg?itok=2NlK6hxJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>isn't slowing its anti-cheat implementation any time soon.</figcaption></figure><p>Back in March, Krafton <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pubg-roadmap-2025" rel="nofollow">shared its 2025 roadmap</a> for&nbsp;<em>PUBG</em>, promising big updates to the game's world, more destructible terrain, and plenty of other improvements. The studio also reported <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-record-breaking-financials-2024" rel="nofollow">record-breaking sales and profits</a> for its 2024-25 fiscal year back in February.</p>

<p>In terms of&nbsp;<em>PUBG</em>'s future, the game isn't just getting the aforementioned roadmap features; it'll also play host to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/payday-pubg-crossover-starbreeze-krafton" rel="nofollow">some kind of&nbsp;<em>Payday&nbsp;</em>crossover</a> courtesy of developer Starbreeze, and it'll also serve as a proving ground for Krafton's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-generative-ai-characters-pubg-inzoi" rel="nofollow">plans when it comes to generative AI</a>.</p>
