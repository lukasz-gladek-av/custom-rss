            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/raf-grassetti-naughty-dog<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>God of War Ragnarok&nbsp;</em>art director Raf Grassetti has joined up with&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Uncharted&nbsp;</em>developer Naughty Dog.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/rafagrassetti/status/1866135153497768034" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post on social media platform X</a>&nbsp;earlier today, Grassetti shared a picture of the Naughty Dog logo, together with the simple caption "new chapter" to announce that he'd signed up with the studio.</p>

<p>It's likely that Grassetti will be working on Naughty Dog's next project, which is almost certainly the same game Neil Druckmann <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1gr42v6/neil_druckmann_says_his_current_project_has_been/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">said has been in development since 2020</a> last month, although we don't know any more about the game than that yet, unfortunately.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/raf-grassetti-naughty-dog-sculpture.jpg?itok=zu-Y20et 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/raf-grassetti-naughty-dog-sculpture.jpg?itok=g657UAyy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Raf Grassetti is perhaps best known for his work on the two most recent&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>games.</figcaption></figure><p>As for Grassetti, he's probably best known as the art director on 2022's&nbsp;<em>God of War Ragnarok</em>, having served as an artist on the 2018 predecessor as well. If you loved the art direction of Kratos' latest adventure, you've got Grassetti to thank, at least in part.</p>

<p>Of course, that's not all the work Grassetti has done in the gaming industry. After <a href="https://x.com/rafagrassetti/status/1659618787036110848" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">leaving Sony in May 2023</a>, Grassetti joined up with Netflix to create "a brand-new studio and AAA multiplatform game", although it seems like he may have been one of the casualties when Netflix <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-team-blue-shut-down-report" rel="nofollow">shut down "Team Blue" in October</a>.</p>

<p>Prior to his time with Sony, Grassetti worked as a character artist on projects like BioWare's&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect 3</em>, Ubisoft's&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Origins</em>, and CD Projekt Red's&nbsp;<em>The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings</em>, among many others. Suffice it to say he's an old industry hand.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/god-of-war-ragnarok-raf-grassetti.jpg?itok=MCCxfEcq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/god-of-war-ragnarok-raf-grassetti.jpg?itok=g-X3sfu1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you loved&nbsp;<em>God of War Ragnarok</em>'s art direction, you have Raf Grassetti to thank.</figcaption></figure><p>Since Naughty Dog is a Sony subsidiary, Grassetti is effectively coming home to Sony, although he'll technically be working under different management in this new position.</p>

<p>As for Naughty Dog itself, it's currently working on at least one as-yet unannounced project.</p>

<p>Given that the studio moved towards <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/last-of-us-online-canceled-as-naughty-dog-works-on-more-than-one-ambitious-single" rel="nofollow">focusing exclusively on single-player games</a> back in December last year, it's likely the new game won't be a multiplayer live-service affair, which, given one of Sony's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-shuts-down-two-studios-including-concord-creator" rel="nofollow">more recent high-profile failures</a>, is probably for the best.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lego-fortnite-brick-festival-storm-chasers</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/epic-reveals-lego-fortnite-social-experience-brick-life-and-major-new-storm-chasers-update.1055844/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lego-fortnite-brick-festival-storm-chasers<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic has revealed big changes for&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>in the coming days, including a major new social roleplaying experience and an update to the core mode that adds lots of new content.</p>

<p>First up,&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite</em>'s new Brick Life mode is coming on December 12th. Described by Epic as an "all-new social roleplay experience in the&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>universe", the mode will allow you to "make new friends, explore the sights, land your dream job, and move into your new home", according to Epic's description.</p>

<p>Brick Life looks to be an experience that wants to compete with&nbsp;<em>The Sims&nbsp;</em>(and also <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>, perhaps), so of course, you'll also be able to build your dream home and furnish it with all kinds of fun accessories, by the looks of things.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lego-fortnite-brick-life-odyssey-update-phones.jpg?itok=bS3qgpjP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lego-fortnite-brick-life-odyssey-update-phones.jpg?itok=HaYo1H59 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Lego Fortnite</em>'s new Brick Life mode is a "social roleplaying experience" that has shades of&nbsp;<em>The Sims&nbsp;</em>about it.</figcaption></figure><p>In the trailer, we also see&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>characters riding on vehicles, working out at the gym, stealing diamonds from some kind of bank vault, and engaging in plenty of other activities, so it looks like there'll be lots to do in Brick Life.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for this new&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>mode right here.</p>




<p>The second major piece of&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>news released by Epic today is a name change and major update for&nbsp;the main&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite</em>&nbsp;mode. It's now called&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite Odyssey</em>, and it'll be part of a new bespoke&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>section within the main&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>game.</p>

<p>Tomorrow,&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite Odyssey&nbsp;</em>will get a brand new update by the name of Storm Chasers, and it's set to bring a new biome, new dungeons to explore, and new enemies to fight, plus "a formidable big bad" in the form of the titular Storm King. Here's the trailer!</p>




<p>In case you're not aware,&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>is a spinoff mode within massively popular battle royale game&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>.</p>

<p>Released in December last year, the mode debuted to a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lego-fortnite-debuts-with-over-23-million-concurrent-players-will-get-updates-in-early" rel="nofollow">staggering number of concurrent players</a>, with that number <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-festival-launches-with-over-600000-concurrent-players-as-lego-fortnite-passes" rel="nofollow">only increasing in the following days</a>.</p>

<p>Since then,&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>has received a number of updates, including new features, tweaks to existing mechanics, and even <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-fortnite-may-2024" rel="nofollow">a crossover with&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em></a>, among many other things.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>for free right now as part of&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>, which is available to play on PC, PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and mobile devices.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chained-echoes-dlc-ashes-of-elrant-q2-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/chained-echoes-dlc-ashes-of-elrant-brings-new-character-and-more-next-year.1055757/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chained-echoes-dlc-ashes-of-elrant-q2-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Deck13 and developer Umami Tiger have announced&nbsp;<em>Ashes of Elrant</em>, the first major story DLC for JRPG homage&nbsp;<em>Chained Echoes</em>. It's due to arrive sometime in the second quarter of next year.</p>

<p><em>Ashes of Elrant&nbsp;</em>will bring a brand new playable character in the form of the White Wolf (no, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-2077-sales-witcher-production" rel="nofollow">not that one</a>), an anthropomorphic wolfman character who looks to be a close combat melee specialist.</p>

<p>It's not just the White Wolf, though;&nbsp;<em>Ashes of Elrant&nbsp;</em>will also introduce new story segments to&nbsp;<em>Chained Echoes</em>, as well as new areas to explore, more than 40 new enemies and bosses to take on, and more equipment to collect, plus lots more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/chained-echoes-ashes-of-elrant-dlc-white-wolf.jpg?itok=qdSZ8wIM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/chained-echoes-ashes-of-elrant-dlc-white-wolf.jpg?itok=4g1diigx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Chained Echoes Ashes of Elrant&nbsp;</em>DLC will add a new playable character and more.</figcaption></figure><p>Story-wise, Umami Tiger (previously known simply as solo developer Matthias Linda) hasn't revealed too much about what you can expect, which is par for the course for a story-driven RPG.</p>

<p>However, we do know&nbsp;<em>Ashes of Elrant&nbsp;</em>will take place just before the finale of&nbsp;<em>Chained Echoes</em>, and that it'll involve a "new call for help" being sent to the Crimson Wings. Answering that call will lead to uncovering "more about the origin of the Order of Leonar and Lenne's past".</p>

<p>Naturally, you'll have to play&nbsp;<em>Ashes of Elrant&nbsp;</em>in order to learn more. We don't have a release date for it yet, but the DLC is set to arrive sometime in Q2 next year, so you can likely expect it sometime around spring or summer.</p>




<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Chained Echoes</em>, it's a throwback JRPG created by German solo dev Matthias Linda. The game features deliberately retro-style pixel art visuals, as well as turn-based combat and a story that revolves around multiple characters.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Chained Echoes&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1229240/Chained_Echoes/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/chained-echoes/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/chained-echoes/9N1WWRPJ12FK" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/chained-echoes-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>, and its&nbsp;<em>Ashes of Elrant&nbsp;</em>DLC is set to launch in Q2 next year.

            <title><![CDATA[Infinity Nikki Downloads Hit 10 Million in Just a Few Days]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/infinity-nikki-downloads-10m</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/infinity-nikki-downloads-hit-10-million-in-just-a-few-days.1055721/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/infinity-nikki-downloads-10m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Infold Games has announced that&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>has reached a major download milestone just a few days after its release.</p>

<p>Speaking <a href="https://x.com/InfinityNikkiEN/status/1866060955567931529" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on X</a>, Infold says that <i>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</i>downloads have hit the 10 million mark. As a reminder, the game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/infinity-nikki-release-date" rel="nofollow">released on a free-to-play basis on Thursday</a>, so it's had just four days or so to rack up that download total.</p>

<p>In order to celebrate the milestone, Infold is giving away a nifty free in-game&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>bonus to all players, although you'll need to log in before the end of December if you want to claim yours.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/infinity-nikki-downloads-animals.jpg?itok=FFWpYJFi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/infinity-nikki-downloads-animals.jpg?itok=QEHtSwhX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>has piqued a lot of players' curiosity, if its download figures are anything to go by.</figcaption></figure><p>Logging in before December 31st and checking your in-game mailbox will net you 10 Resonite Crystal items, which will essentially grant you 10 free Banner draws for&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki</em>'s gacha system.</p>

<p>You'll need to have unlocked the Pear-Pal system before claiming your reward, though, because you won't be able to look at your mailbox until you do. Just progress a little through the game and you'll get there.</p>

<p>In case you're wondering what&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>is, it's a free-to-play open-world game that Infold describes as "the coziest open-world game" around.</p>

<p>The game de-emphasizes combat, focusing instead on 3D platforming challenges, minigames, and collecting outfits for Nikki to wear as she embarks on a quest to explore Miraland.</p>




<p>Certain outfits grant Nikki different abilities, so you'll need to make sure you collect a bunch of different ones in order to make the most of your time in Miraland.</p>

<p><em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>also uses a gacha system for its outfits and accessories, and you've got a choice between collecting in-game currency to spend on said gacha transactions or ponying up some of your own real-world cash.</p>

<p>Reaching 10 million downloads is a pretty impressive achievement, and it arguably shows there's a real audience for&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki</em>, although like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-10m" rel="nofollow">NetEase's&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em></a>, it's worth noting this 10 million figure doesn't refer to sales.</p>

<p>You can download and play&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>for free right now on <a href="https://infinitynikki.infoldgames.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices</a>. Check out our very own Brittany's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/infinity-nikki-preview-open-world-fun-meets-fashion" rel="nofollow">preview of the game</a> to find out what exploring Miraland is like.</p>
