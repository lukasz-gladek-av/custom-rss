            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In a shocking turn of events, this year's box office smash hit&nbsp;<em>A Minecraft Movie&nbsp;</em>is officially getting a sequel. I bet you couldn't possibly have seen that one coming.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/10/minecraft-2-release-date-1236574896/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Deadline report</a>,&nbsp;<em>A Minecraft Movie 2&nbsp;</em>(which probably won't be its final title, if only because&nbsp;<em>Another Minecraft Movie&nbsp;</em>is staring the filmmakers right in the face) is set for release on July 23rd, 2027.</p>

<p><em>A Minecraft Movie&nbsp;</em>director Jared Hess will once again helm the sequel, and the script is being written by Hess and Chris Galletta, the latter of whom was one of the five writers for the first&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>movie. Whether more writers will join the sequel in future remains to be seen.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/a-minecraft-movie-2-2027-jack-black-original.jpg?itok=CtajRS-4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/a-minecraft-movie-2-2027-jack-black-original.jpg?itok=lCUjvW2R 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>We don't know whether any cast members from&nbsp;<em>A Minecraft Movie&nbsp;</em>will return for the sequel.</figcaption></figure><p>Naturally, since the movie is well over a year and a half away from release, other details about the project are scarce right now, so we don't know whether actors like Jack Black and Jason Momoa will be reprising their roles in&nbsp;<em>A Minecraft Movie 2</em>.</p>

<p>Similarly, we don't know what kind of narrative direction the sequel will take, but Deadline says "the buzz" around the project is that "there were always other worlds to build out and characters in the&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>-verse", so there should be at least a few new faces in the movie.</p>

<p>If you missed the original&nbsp;<em>A Minecraft Movie</em>, it was released earlier this year, and while it hasn't broken $1 billion at the box office yet, it's easily the highest-grossing movie in the US domestically, as well as the second highest-grossing movie of the year around the world.</p>

<p>The movie is essentially an isekai story in which four misfits are dragged into a blocky world of creativity and must escape with the help of Jack Black's charismatic Steve. I <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-minecraft-movie-trailer" rel="nofollow">honestly was not a fan of the movie's first trailer</a>, but hey, $420 million is nothing to sniff at.</p>




<p>The&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>movie sequel joins a host of other video game-related film projects currently in the works, including adaptations of the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-movie" rel="nofollow"><em>Call of Duty</em></a>, Bloober Team's horror game&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-medium-movie-adaptation" rel="nofollow"><em>The Medium</em></a>, and&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda</em>, the latter of which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zelda-live-action-movie-link-zelda-cast" rel="nofollow">also due for a 2027 release</a>.</p>
