This officially licensed miniature skirmish game started with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/modiphius-announces-fallout-factions-nuka-world" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nuka-World</a> Starter Set. The rulebook has expanded to other parts of the Wasteland, bringing more mayhem to the table.</p>

<h2>The <em>Fallout: Factions</em> Core Rulebook Release</h2>

<p>In an official press release, Modiphius explains the contents of the <em>Fallout: Factions</em> Core Rulebook. It expands on the factions found in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/fallout-factions-battle-for-nuka-world-starter-set-review-rolling-dice-for" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Battle for Nuka-World</em></a> starter set, which centered on the three gangs from the <em>Fallout 4 </em>DLC. While that starter set was set in a specific part of the world, this core rulebook will allow battles to take place anywhere in the Wasteland.</p>

The militaristic, power-armored warriors of the Brotherhood of Steel. The overwhelming juggernauts that are teh Super Mutants. The scrappy, resourceful Survivors. And the cutthroat and merciless Raiders. The rules include unique Weapons, Perks, and Legends of the Wasteland.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the biggest additions to the game are what happens off the battlefield. There is an in-depth scenario system that keeps set up for a game interesting, adding hazards and objectives to a battlefield. In addition, there is the Story Phase, which details growing your crew, obtaining perks, buying and upgrading weapons, etc.. All key areas to ensure your legend in the Wasteland.</p>

<p>At time of writing, additional miniatures and terrain for <em>Fallout: Factions</em> aren't out yet. But with the launch of this book, it is only a matter of time before the product line expands. There is also the promise of new legends coming to the game through Prime Video's Fallout TV series which has already been renewed for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-season-3-confirmed-season-2-december" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a third season</a>. After all, Season 1's characters already <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/fallout-tv-show-miniatures-announced-by-modiphius-entertainment" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">have miniatures</a>.</p>
