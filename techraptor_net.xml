            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bleach-rebirth-of-souls-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has revealed the release date for upcoming anime fighting game&nbsp;<em>Bleach: Rebirth of Souls</em>, which promises to offer the chance to engage in battles just like the ones you've seen in the manga and anime.</p>

<p>Per a new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Bleach: Rebirth of Souls&nbsp;</em>will arrive on March 21st. It's heading to PC and consoles, but like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gamescom-onl-2024-switch" rel="nofollow">many games launching in the next year or so</a>, it seems to be skipping the Switch.</p>

<p>Many characters from&nbsp;<em>Bleach&nbsp;</em>are set to make an appearance in&nbsp;<em>Rebirth of Souls</em>, including Ichigo, Kenpachi Zaraki, and Renji Abarai, among others. If you're a&nbsp;<em>Bleach&nbsp;</em>fan, then it's likely your favorite fighter will make the cut.</p>

<p>Bandai Namco is also promising that&nbsp;<em>Rebirth of Souls&nbsp;</em>will allow you to use a single strike to "spell defeat for your opponent", so it sounds like you'll need to have your wits about you to avoid getting put down before the fight has even begun.</p>

<p>Additionally, as battles progress, you'll "unlock new forms and new blades" to help you snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. In short, it sounds like the game is aiming to mimic the desperate last-gasp shonen fights for which&nbsp;<em>Bleach&nbsp;</em>became so well-known.</p>

<p>You can check out the new release date trailer for&nbsp;<em>Bleach: Rebirth of Souls&nbsp;</em>right here.</p>




<p>This isn't&nbsp;<em>Bleach</em>'s first foray into the world of video games, although it's arguably the first major 3D arena fighter to be based on the property (if, that is, you <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-jump-force-trailer-shows-off-bleach-characters-pretty-visuals" rel="nofollow">don't count&nbsp;<em>Jump Force</em></a>, which I'm assuming a lot of folks would rather not do).</p>

<p><em>Bleach: Rebirth of Souls&nbsp;</em>is set to launch for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1689620/BLEACH_Rebirth_of_Souls/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10001710" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/bleach-rebirth-of-souls-pre-order/9MW2PF98HPNG/0017/9VHRG4FW3X1N" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on March 21st.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/danganronpa-and-zero-escape-creators-srpg-the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy-launches-in-april.1051647/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Xseed has announced the release date for&nbsp;<em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</em>, a strategy JRPG from the creators of the&nbsp;<em>Danganronpa&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Zero Escape&nbsp;</em>franchises.</p>

<p>Per a new trailer, the game will launch for PC and Nintendo Switch on April 24th, so you'll only have a few more months to wait to get your hands on it. There's no word of a release for other major platforms yet, sadly.</p>

<p>It's good to know that&nbsp;<em>Danganronpa</em>'s Kazutaka Kodaka and&nbsp;<em>Zero Escape</em>'s Kotaro Uchikoshi have managed to get this one over the line. Back in June, Kodaka <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/danganronpa-creators-new-game-risking-lives" rel="nofollow">said that he and his team were "risking their lives"</a> to secure financing for the game and get it made.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy-release-date-darumi-dialogue.jpg?itok=4neohwCf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy-release-date-darumi-dialogue.jpg?itok=8r9kKKsP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy&nbsp;</em>boasts the involvement of&nbsp;<em>Danganronpa</em>'s creator. Can you tell?</figcaption></figure><p><em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy&nbsp;</em>will tell the story of Takumi Sumino, a "totally average teenager" who's whisked away to the titular Last Defense Academy following an attack on his hometown by monsters.</p>

<p>Sumino, along with 14 other students, must keep their school safe for 100 days as part of the Special Defense Unit, and as they fight, they'll learn how much they're "willing to sacrifice to take back their normal lives and save the world".</p>

<p>Appropriately enough, the premise feels rather like a marriage between&nbsp;<em>Danganronpa&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Zero Escape</em>, and since&nbsp;<em>The Hundred Line&nbsp;</em>is the brainchild of the creators of those franchises, that probably shouldn't come as a surprise.</p>

<p>You can check out the new "Extreme Despair Trailer" for&nbsp;<em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy&nbsp;</em>below. As you can probably surmise from that title, we're not exactly in for a laugh-a-minute comedy extravaganza with this one.</p>




<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy&nbsp;</em>when it launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3014080/The_Hundred_Line_Last_Defense_Academy/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, as well as Nintendo Switch, on April 24th. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>
