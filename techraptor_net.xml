            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA apparently turned down a&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>trilogy remaster pitched by BioWare, denying the series the same treatment that the publisher's original&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect&nbsp;</em>releases received a few years ago.</p>

<p>That's according to an interview between YouTuber MrMattyPlays and ex-BioWare producer Mark Darrah (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-trilogy-remaster-was-pitched-to-ea-but-they-basically-seem-to-be-against-free-money-says-series-veteran" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>), in which Darrah says that BioWare suggested remastered versions of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: Origins</em>,&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age II</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>, to be released as&nbsp;<em>The Champions Trilogy</em>.</p>

<p>According to Darrah, though, EA is "against remasters", and while he doesn't exactly know why, he wryly says it's because the publisher "basically seem[s] to be against free money". Given EA's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/buying-fifa-loot-boxes-is-fair-according-to-ea" rel="nofollow">championing of loot boxes</a> in the likes of&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC</em>, I'm not sure about that, but I see his point.</p>

That's another reason no trilogy remasters were made, Darrah says.</p>

<p>There's also the fact that while all three&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect&nbsp;</em>games were made in Unreal Engine 3, all three&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>games constituting the series' original trilogy were made with different engines, so remastering them would have been a more difficult task. Still, I'm sure there was a way to get that work done, so it's a shame EA decided not to.</p>

<p>While the next&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect&nbsp;</em>game remains in active development (<a href="https://fextralife.com/bioware-clarifies-the-status-of-mass-effect-4/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">as far as we know</a>),&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age</em>'s future as a franchise looks to be a little more in doubt.&nbsp;<em>Veilguard&nbsp;</em>underperformed for EA, and CEO Andrew Wilson seemingly&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-the-veilguard-shared-world-elements" rel="nofollow">insinuated back in February</a> that the game's failure could be put down to its lack of "shared world elements".</p>

<p>Whether that means we'll get another&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>game with a more live-service bent, as&nbsp;<em>Veilguard&nbsp;</em>was meant to be, remains to be seen. Perhaps BioWare will be able to convince EA to make another game in the series, or maybe it will be shelved for the time being. Only time will tell.</p>




<p>For now, you can content yourself with the fact that the original&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>trilogy is still on sale on PC via Steam, and&nbsp;<em>The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>is also available now, although you may well find it an acquired taste if you're a huge fan of the originals (particularly&nbsp;<em>Origins</em>).</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Far Cry TV Series Apparently In the Works]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>According to a hastily-deleted news post on the Ubisoft website, a&nbsp;<em>Far Cry&nbsp;</em>TV series is in development, and it sounds like it'll be taking a similar approach to the games in terms of focus.</p>

<p>The post, which is no longer available to view on the Ubisoft website, was caught before deletion by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/farcry/comments/1mlalqt/far_cry_series_adaptation_in_the_works_at_fx/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Redditor iwascuddles</a> (aww). As noted by fellow Redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/farcry/comments/1mlalqt/comment/n7p386g/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Kiribaku</a>, the show's description states that it will take the form of an anthology, with each season focusing on "a new world with a different cast of characters".</p>

<p>Beyond that, we don't know too much about how the show will work, including whether its seasons will adapt existing&nbsp;<em>Far Cry&nbsp;</em>games or whether entirely original stories will be produced for the series.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/far-cry-tv-show-far-cry-6.jpg?itok=aCoeyn7Q 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/far-cry-tv-show-far-cry-6.jpg?itok=bHGxSog7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A&nbsp;<em>Far Cry&nbsp;</em>TV series appears to be in the works.</figcaption></figure><p>If the post is accurate, however, then the&nbsp;<em>Far Cry&nbsp;</em>show will star&nbsp;<em>It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia</em>'s Rob Mac, formerly known as Rob McElhenney. He also serves as one of the show's co-creators, alongside&nbsp;<em>Fargo&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Alien: Earth&nbsp;</em>writer Noah Hawley, who will be&nbsp;<em>Far Cry</em>'s showrunner.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that this show technically hasn't officially been announced, so a lot of these details could be subject to change. Still, the announcement seems a little too comprehensive to be fake, so I'd imagine the <i>Far Cry&nbsp;</i>TV show will be officially unveiled sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>If the show does go ahead, it'll be the first major&nbsp;<em>Far Cry&nbsp;</em>project since 2023's&nbsp;<em>Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix</em>, which served as both a loose adaptation of 2013's&nbsp;<em>Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon&nbsp;</em>and an homage to Ubisoft's franchises in general.</p>

<p>The mainline series itself appears to have stalled somewhat; the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/far-cry-6" rel="nofollow">last major installment</a> was released back in 2021, and since then, no official&nbsp;<em>Far Cry 7&nbsp;</em>announcement has been made.</p>




<p>In any case, if the&nbsp;<em>Far Cry&nbsp;</em>TV show is real, it's probably going to be a while before we see any more of it, so for now, you'll have to content yourself with replaying the current games in the series. Stay tuned for more.</p>
