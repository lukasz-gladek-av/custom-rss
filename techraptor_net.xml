Cephalofair Games has announced a Gloomhaven Second Edition delay of several months to address production issues found with the <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/gloomhaven" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Gloomhaven Game Page">Gloomhaven</a> </em>advance copies they received.</p>

<h2>The <em>Gloomhaven Second Edition</em> Delay</h2>

<p>In an update post <a href="https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/cephalofair/gloomhaven/updates/16229#top" rel="nofollow">on Backerkit</a>, Cephalofair explained the <em>Gloomhaven Second Edition</em> delay. According to them, they had advanced copies of the game ready as part of their first round of shipping via ocean freight. These were copies meant for the design team, some content creators, and different partners.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gloomhaven-second-edition-production-issue-artwork.jpg?itok=zY1sjdSo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gloomhaven-second-edition-production-issue-artwork.jpg?itok=tc04vskV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>These early copies contained significant production errors. They mention warped map boards and scenario trackers alongside poorly injected and assembled miniatures. These issues were not present in samples or pre-preproduction copies received ahead of mass production. Given the price point of <em>Gloomhaven</em>, and how much it relies on a variety of parts, these constituted major issues with the game.</p>

<p>Cephalofair has confirmed that these errors affected a significant amount of product and are in conversation with the production facility to correct these issues. The producer has acknowledged these errors and has committed with providing replacements.</p>

<p>Those replacements will take some time since the workers won't be back until mid-February due to Lunar New Year having everyone off for a while at the production facility. Not to mention the root cause of the mass production issues will need to be identified and addressed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We aren’t sure exactly how long it will end up being, but be assured that we and our production facility are determined to solve this problem quickly and efficiently.</p>

<p>Making this decision was genuinely heartbreaking, but we firmly believe it was ultimately the best call.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Depending on how long <em>Gloomhaven Second Edition</em> is delayed, it may also face another challenge: the potential trade tariffs being proposed by US President Trump. As other developers <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/deep-regrets-developer-voices-potential-impact-of-imposing-us-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Deep Regrets Developer Voices Potential Impact of Imposed US Trade Tariffs">have expressed</a>, the vast majority of board production is done overseas in China, which can mean higher prices for all tabletop products in the United States if these tariffs are implemented. Previously Cephalofair had <a href="https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/cephalofair/gloomhaven/updates/13908#top" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Project Update: Tariffs and physical proofs of Gloomhaven ">expressed some concerns </a>about them, but were unable to say how it might impact them going forward.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/aetherdrift-commander-living-energy-review-and-upgrades<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Start your engines! The first tentpole release for <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/everything-coming-to-magic-gathering-in-2025" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Everything Coming to Magic: The Gathering in 2025"><em>Magic: The Gathering </em>in 2025 </a>is here with <em>Aetherdrift</em><em>, </em>and we're racing to take a look at one of the preconstructed decks. This <em>Living Energy </em>review will examine it and answer what is it, is it worth buying, and if you do buy itm what are some cards you can look to add to it.</p>

<h2>Living Energy Review</h2>

<p><em>Living Energy </em>is the third energy deck set to be released in less than a year, but it is the first of those in Temur (green/blue/red) colors. The deck is also meant to capture some of the mechanical identity of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/aetherdrift-brings-wacky-races-and-new-name-for-old-plane-to-magic-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Aetherdrift Brings Wacky Races and New Name for an Old Plane to Magic: The Gathering">Avishkar (the plane formerly known as Kaladesh</a>) that the main set wasn't able to due to its focus on the race across three planes.</p>

<p><em>Living Energy </em>showcases well known characters of Avishkar like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/drc/3/saheeli-radiant-creator" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Saheeli, Radiant Creator">Saheeli</a>, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/drc/2/pia-nalaar-chief-mechanic" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pia Nalaar, Chief Mechanic">Pia Nalaar</a>. While there is a primary focus on energy in <em>Living Energy</em> as the name implies there are also subthemes in the deck of artifacts, and thopters that fit that Avishkar mechanical identity role, while synergizing well with the rest of the deck.</p>

<p>As far as play goes, <em>Living Energy </em>plays very ramp heavy. With 15 different pieces of ramp or mana fetch, along with 38 lands and a few ways to cheat out spells, it’s built to ramp to high mana values and take over the game with big spells. It shows in the deck’s aspirational mana curve, and average mana value of 3.64. which is higher than you typically want to see.</p>

After that you have <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/drc/111/elder-gargaroth" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Elder Gargaroth">Elder Gargaroth </a>which is also over $10, while there’s a set of highly playable cards in the $5-$9 range including <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/drc/136/retrofitter-foundry" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Retrofitter Foundry">Retrofitter Foundry</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/drc/55/lightning-greaves" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Lightning Greaves">Lightning Greaves</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/drc/135/panharmonicon" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Panharmonicon">Panharmonicon</a>, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/drc/143/triplicate-titan" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Triplicate Titan">Triplicate Titan</a>. From a <em>Living Energy</em> review perspective, this is good, but not phenomenal value.</p>

<h3>Living Energy Commanders Review</h3>

<p><em>Living Energy</em> comes with two commander options, both of which are among the new cards for the deck. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/drc/3/saheeli-radiant-creator" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Saheeli, Radiant Creator">Saheeli, Radiant Creator</a> is the face commander, and is a 4 mana 4/4 with a pair of important abilities. Her first ability is that she gives energy whenever you play an artifict or artificer, similar to <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/pip/3/dr-madison-li" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Dr Madison Li">Dr. Madison Li </a>from the <em>Fallout</em> <em>Science!</em> deck. Setting her apart though is her second ability, where you spend three energy to make a 5/5 token copy of any permanent you control until end of turn.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/saheeli-and-pia-nalaar.jpg?itok=DmPMkYrX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/saheeli-and-pia-nalaar.jpg?itok=f07_1Ja0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The alternate commander is <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/drc/2/pia-nalaar-chief-mechanic" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pia Nalaar, Chief Mechanic">Pia Nalaar, Chief Mechanic</a>. A 3 mana 2/4, she gets down early, and generates 2 energy whenever artifact creatures deal combat damage to a player, encouraging an artifact creature heavy deck that is more aggressive. Like Saheeli she has a second ability, where at the end of turn you can spend any amount of energy, to make a vehicle token with power and toughness equal to the energy spent, and crew 2</p>

<p>While <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/drc/2/pia-nalaar-chief-mechanic" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pia Nalaar, Chief Mechanic">Pia Nalaar</a> has potential in more aggressive decks, she’s much narrower that <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/drc/3/saheeli-radiant-creator" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Saheeli, Radiant Creator">Saheeli</a>, and <em>Living Energy</em> is built to work with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/drc/3/saheeli-radiant-creator" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Saheeli, Radiant Creator">Saheeli </a>in charge. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/drc/2/pia-nalaar-chief-mechanic" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pia Nalaar, Chief Mechanic">Pia Nalaar</a> still works as an energy creator and sink in a <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/drc/3/saheeli-radiant-creator" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Saheeli, Radiant Creator">Saheeli </a>deck, so unlike some commander decks, the two options work together here.</p>

<h2>Cards To Upgrade Your MTG Living Energy Commander Deck</h2>

<p>If you purchase <em>Living Energy</em> it should be playable at casual tables, but there’s definite room for upgrades. Taming the deck’s manacurve, and focusing on making the most out of <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/drc/3/saheeli-radiant-creator" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Saheeli, Radiant Creator">Saheeli</a> are our major focuses here..</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/pip/62/the-motherlode-excavator" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="The Motherlode, Excavator"><strong>The Motherlode, Excavator</strong></a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-motherlode-excavator.jpg?itok=1Ph-CRDH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-motherlode-excavator.jpg?itok=8Rdq8sTn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>From the <em>Science!</em> commander deck, The Motherlode is an energy generator, solid sized creature, and has the ability to take care of disruptive non-basic lands. When it does that, it also removes makes that players non-flyers unable to block until end of turn, opening up that opponent for an alpha strike.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/clb/63/displacer-kitten" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Displacer Kitten"><strong>Displacer Kitten</strong></a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/displacer-kitten.jpg?itok=pWwK0Eu9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/displacer-kitten.jpg?itok=OuFICsEw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Providing some redundancy for our commander, Displacer Kitten takes advantage of all the enters the battlefield effects in the dec by blinking them in and out of existance. The Displacer Kitten can blink any non-land permanent you control, so there’s lot of flexibility in it’s use.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mh3/67/roil-cartographer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Roil Cartographer"><strong>Roil Cartographer</strong></a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/roil-cartographer.jpg?itok=8ggYPrEr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/roil-cartographer.jpg?itok=xdPkPVcr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>An odd omission from the deck, Roil Cartographer is from <em>Modern Horizons 3</em> and will join with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/drc/13/nissa-worldsoul-speaker" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Nissa, Worldsoul Speaker">Nissa, Worldsoul Speaker</a> to provide energy on each land drop. The cartographer can drop on turn 2, and later on it can trade in energy for cards.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mh3/142/unstable-amulet" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Unstable Amulet"><strong>Unstable Amulet</strong></a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/unstable-amulet.jpg?itok=VZAme-Vb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/unstable-amulet.jpg?itok=XUBpnsME 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Another area the deck is a bit light in is card advantage, so Unstable Amulet provides an early drop that can create some energy, do occasional chip damage, and essentially draw a card for two energy.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mh3/191/izzet-generatorium" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Izzet Generatorium Card"><strong>Izzet Generatorium</strong></a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/izzet-generatorium.jpg?itok=kO_JtW2T 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/izzet-generatorium.jpg?itok=tfhh5o-B 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Another two-drop option, Izzet Generatorium creates an additional energy anytime you make one, and lets you draw a card on any turn you’ve used at least 4 energy.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/pip/38/robobrain-war-mind" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Robobrain War Mind"><strong>Robobrain War Mind</strong></a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/robobrain-war-mind.jpg?itok=G9HKYWJW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/robobrain-war-mind.jpg?itok=p8b-kIMe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Also from the <em>Fallout Science!</em> deck, Robobrain War Mind generates you a bunch of energy, draws cards on attack, and gets bigger as you have more cards in hand.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/2xm/308/wurmcoil-engine" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Wurmcoil Engine"><strong>Wurmcoil Engine</strong></a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wurmcoil-engine.jpg?itok=KVSwIav2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wurmcoil-engine.jpg?itok=Hn3I5UCD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Instead of some of the pricer options in the deck, I would purpose Wurmcoil Engine is a very good option with being a 6/6 for 6 with useful abilities, who creates tokens when it dies. It’s a perfect target to copy with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/drc/3/saheeli-radiant-creator" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Saheeli, Radiant Creator">Saheeli</a>, swinging for 6, gaining 6 life, and leaving you two 3/3s behind.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/moc/373/scrap-trawler" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Scrap Trawler"><strong>Scrap Trawler</strong></a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/scrap-trawler.jpg?itok=VOKQtFkB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/scrap-trawler.jpg?itok=t_1zf7z4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Scrap Trawler leans into the artifact and sacrifice side of the deck, by turning all your deck artifacts into resurrection spells. Since <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/drc/3/saheeli-radiant-creator" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Saheeli, Radiant Creator">Saheeli</a>’s ability makes copies, those copies also have the originals mana value, meaning you can grab pricey artifacts from the graveyard, along with cheap ones.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/pip/104/electrosiphon" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Electrospiphon"><strong>Electrosiphon</strong></a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/electrosiphon.jpg?itok=rlw4MFP- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/electrosiphon.jpg?itok=DvfpgGDh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Let’s keep drawing on that <em>Fallout </em>precon, this time with the best energy counterspell. While 3 mana is more than ideally you spent on a counter, the ability to get a bunch of energy from it makes it worthwhile in Electrosiphon’s case.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/m3c/106/aether-refinery" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Aether Refinery"><strong>Aether Refinery</strong></a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aether-refinery.jpg?itok=s8dT4i5_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aether-refinery.jpg?itok=g9oacRhA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>You can put <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fdn/216/doubling-season" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Doubling Season">Doubling Season </a>in this spot too, but Aether Refinery is a lot cheaper moneywise, and does what you’re wanting, while providing an energy outlet for big tokens. Given the deck's energy hunger, adding some explosive energy generation seems useful.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>If you want to see what the deck might look like with those 10 cards added, I’ve put it up on Archidekt, with 10 potential cuts that you can <a href="https://archidekt.com/decks/11071535/living_energy" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Living Energy Upgraded">see here</a>.</p>

<p>Overall, our <em>Living Energy </em>review finds it is a slow, rampy deck with a lot of synergy and a number of different ways you can customize it. With <em>Modern Horizons 3 </em>energy theme, two other commander decks in slightly different colors that use energy in the past year, the cards for this archtype are as cheaply available as they’ll be right now.</p>
