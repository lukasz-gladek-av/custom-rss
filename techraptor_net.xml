            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has released its financial statement for the first half of the 2025-26 fiscal year, and sales and profits are down, driven largely by a fairly quiet six-month period with very few major releases.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/pdf/26q2release.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a> outlining its latest financial results, Square Enix reveals that sales are down by 15% when compared to the same six-month period last year, while operating income has fallen by 28.8%.</p>

<p>The company puts this disparity down to new games generating "lower sales than releases such as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-hearts-steam" rel="nofollow">three&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts&nbsp;</em>catalog titles on Steam</a>...the previous year". Despite that, Square Enix says its video games business "returned to profitability" this year, largely thanks to expense-related technicalities.</p>

It might <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-review-inconsistent-vacation" rel="nofollow">not have offered the game's best story</a>, but it sure did boost Square Enix's business.</p>

<p>In fairness to Square Enix, it has been a pretty quiet six months for the publisher. In the six-month period ending on September 30th, Square Enix's catalog consists entirely of ports, including&nbsp;a Switch 2 version of&nbsp;<em>Bravely Default&nbsp;</em>and the Xbox Series X|S release of&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>.</p>

<p>As we know,&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xvi-sales-3-5m" rel="nofollow">wasn't exactly a major money-spinner</a> for Square Enix the first time around, so its arrival on a console that's struggling to keep up with its peers probably wasn't going to set the publisher's coffers alight.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, however, things look a touch rosier for Square Enix.&nbsp;Remakes of the first two&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest&nbsp;</em>games arrived in late October, and that's a series that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/square-enix-financials-2024-25" rel="nofollow">tends to do pretty well</a> for the company. A remake of the seventh game in the series is also due to arrive in February.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[NetEase Shuts Down Ex-Ubisoft Producer's Bad Brain Studios]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bad-brain-game-studios-netease-shut-down</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/netease-shuts-down-ex-ubisoft-producers-bad-brain-studios.1345621/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>NetEase has closed down yet another of its studios before its first release, and this time, it's the turn of Bad Brain Game Studios, which was helmed by ex-Ubisoft producer Sean Crooks.</p>

<p>Announcing the shutdown on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bad-brain-game-studios_midnight-riders-sizzle-reel-activity-7391949948268834817-2Wyf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>, Bad Brain, which was first <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-netease-studio-bad-brain" rel="nofollow">established back in 2023</a>, says that its last day of operation will be November 17th, and that while the studio is trying to find a new partner for its debut project, it has not yet managed to do so.</p>

<p>Bad Brain says that its game and the associated IP are both "still available for acquisition or partnership", and that the studio, as well as parent NetEase, is "open to discussions with publishers or studios who see potential in continuing its development".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bad-brain-game-studios-netease-shutdown-project.jpg?itok=VAGB9xzb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bad-brain-game-studios-netease-shutdown-project.jpg?itok=k9ZNdMvt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bad Brain Game Studios was working on its debut project when it was shut down by NetEase.</figcaption></figure><p>To the end of helping former Bad Brain staffers find work, the studio also posted a sizzle reel of its in-development project alongside the LinkedIn post announcing its closure. The game, according to Bad Brain, was met with an "enthusiastic response" by peers and industry insiders.</p>

<p>From the looks of the sizzle reel,&nbsp;the untitled game would have been a third-person action-adventure game inspired by the likes of&nbsp;<em>Stranger Things&nbsp;</em>and Rockstar's&nbsp;<em>Bully</em>, juxtaposing ordinary 80s life with delving into spooky locations to do battle with creepy-crawlies.</p>

<p>Bad Brain is the latest in a string of NetEase-backed studios to lose their funding or close down in recent months. Others include <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rich-vogel-t-minus-zero-entertainment-netease-shut-down" rel="nofollow">T-Minus Zero Entertainment</a>, which was founded by ex-BioWare vet Rich Vogel, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/worlds-untold-netease-pause-shutdown" rel="nofollow">Worlds Untold</a>, another ex-BioWare staffer's studio.</p>

<p>It's not just studios that haven't released games, either. In February, NetEase <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-studio-shockingly-closed-by-netease-laying-off-everyone" rel="nofollow">closed down the development outfit</a> responsible for the hugely successful&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>, so it seems that nobody is safe.</p>




<p>These shutdowns are taking place against the backdrop of an industry riven with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/massive-entertainment-ubisoft-layoffs" rel="nofollow">layoffs</a>, project <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-world-development-ending-amazon-layoffs" rel="nofollow">cancellations</a>, and studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/avalanche-studios-layoffs-uk-closure" rel="nofollow">closures</a>, and there's no sign of the deluge ending anytime soon. Stay tuned for more.</p>
