This merging of two of the most popular virtual tabletop platforms has been highly anticipated since <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/roll20-demiplane-acquisition-officially-announced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Roll20 acquired Demiplane</a> in 2024. Now, users can enjoy the benefits.</p>

<h2>The Roll20 Demiplane Integration Beta Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, the Roll20 Demiplane integration beta is the result of months of active development and community feedback. The result are expanded key features integrated into both platforms as of today.</p>

If you own any titles on Roll20 or Demiplane, you can access that content on both platforms at no additional cost. This feature is added automatically if you have an account linked with Roll20 and Demiplane.</p>

<p>The cross-platform sync applies to all material from <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/pathfinder" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Pathfinder 2E</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/starfinder" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Starfinder 2E</em></a>, <em>Vampire: The Masquerade V5</em>, <em>Alien: The Roleplaying Game</em>, and <em>Marvel Multiverse RPG</em>. In addition, select elements from <em>Cyberpunk Red</em> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/fallout-rpg-starter-set-preview" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Fallout: The Roleplaying Game</em></a> will support this feature.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“We’re continuing to work closely with our incredible publishing partners to expand system support for Cross-Platform Sync,” said Jayme Boucher, Senior Marketing Manager at Roll20. “In today’s economy, we know that investing in your hobbies can feel like a luxury. That’s why we’re committed to giving players the most access and value possible for their hard-earned money. This is one way we can help stretch every dollar and make it easier for people to connect and support their mental well-being through play.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A second feature of the Roll20 Demiplane integration beta is a shared subscription. If you have an account linked to Roll20 and Demiplane and pay a premium subscription for one, you get the premium benefits of both platforms at no additional cost. This includes content sharing with up to 24 players and unlimited character creation on the Demiplane platform.</p>

<p>Lastly, users can use Demiplane character sheets in the Roll20 VTT. All player actions work as before within one interface. The Demiplane character sheets can be used on the following games in Roll20:</p>

<ul><li><em>Pathfinder 2E</em></li>
