            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-network-test-stats<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has revealed some fun statistics for the recent&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>network test, in which those lucky enough to be invited got a glimpse of what can be expected from the game's final release later this year.</p>

<p>Over <a href="https://x.com/BandaiNamcoUS/status/1905622167158432218" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on X</a>, Bandai Namco shared what it called its "Numbers from the Night", and it turns out that across the network test as a whole, players slaughtered the Gladius, Beast of Night boss 58,615 times. That's a lot of dead Nightlords.</p>

<p>Spectral Hawks, the ghostly birds used to ferry players across&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>'s map, were summoned 427,533 times across the network test, while 23.6 million recovery attacks were used to help downed players get back on their feet.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-network-test-stats-hawk.jpg?itok=7Iz2zJVv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-network-test-stats-hawk.jpg?itok=Iruk7NEt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hundreds of thousands of these little ghostly birbs were summoned during&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>'s network test.</figcaption></figure><p>When it comes to&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>'s minibosses, players killed almost 200,000 Golden Hippopotamuses (Hippopotami?), almost 165,000 Flame Chariots, and just over 150,000 Fire Monks.</p>

<p>Almost 150,000 Flying Dragons of the Hills were killed, and almost 100,000 Royal Knights met their ends at the hands of enterprising warriors. If you think you're going to struggle in&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, let these numbers give you some solace.</p>

<p>On the other hand, almost 38 billion (!) runes were lost by players cumulatively over the course of&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>'s network test. I like to imagine that 37 billion of those were just one very, very unlucky player.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, it's an upcoming action RPG spinoff of FromSoftware and Bandai Namco's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-25-million" rel="nofollow">hugely successful</a> open-world Soulslike&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>, and it represents the developer's first major spinoff for one of its properties.</p>




<p><em>Nightreign</em>'s core gameplay loop sees you and two other players (or just you, but not you and one other) descending onto a map in order to loot it, kill its bosses for XP, and grow strong enough to battle the Nightlord at the end of a three-day period.</p>

<p>The game will feature not only enemies from&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>, but also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-dark-souls-enemies-confirmed" rel="nofollow">foes featured in FromSoftware's&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls&nbsp;</em>series</a>, including the likes of the first game's Centipede Demon,&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls 2</em>'s The Duke's Dear Freja, and&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls 3</em>'s The Nameless King.</p>

<p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>launches <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nighreign-release-date" rel="nofollow">on May 30th</a> on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2622380/ELDEN_RING_NIGHTREIGN/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/elden-ring-nightreign/9PJ22QNVCZ3G" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-32-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has announced the&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.2 release date, with the new update set to bring two new 5-star characters, a perilous new foe to take down, and more in April.</p>

<p>Following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-31-release-date" rel="nofollow">February's Version 3.1</a>,&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.2, also known as "Through the Petals in the Land of Repose", is set to launch across all platforms on April 9th. HoYoverse is promising "trials of survival and political intrigue" as part of the update's main story.</p>

<p>You'll be traveling to the "forgotten city-state of Styxia" in this update, and while you're there, you'll take on Pollux, a leviathan who slumbers in the River of Souls. Pollux has some pretty nasty HP manipulation attacks, so you'll have to be on your A-game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/honkai-star-rail-version-3.2-release-date-styxia.jpg?itok=_-i4deVf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/honkai-star-rail-version-3.2-release-date-styxia.jpg?itok=So3A03E3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.2 brings the fallen city-state of Styxia and more next month.</figcaption></figure><p>Two 5-star characters are coming your way in&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.2. The first, Castorice, is a Remembrance-path character who can sync up with her Netherwing dragon for big damage, although the dragon sacrifices its own HP to use its ultimate attack.</p>

<p>Your second 5-star character in Version 3.2 is Anaxa, an Erudition character who can apply Weaknesses to enemies and boost his damage using his Qualitative Disclosure ability.</p>

<p>The first half of Version 3.2 will also see the return of Fugue, Jiaoqiu, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-acheron-raiden-shogun" rel="nofollow">Acheron</a> as rerun banners, while the second half will give you another chance to obtain the wonderfully-named <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-dr-ratio-trailer" rel="nofollow">Dr. Ratio</a> for your team.</p>

<p><em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.2 isn't all about gloomy city-states and frantic combat, though; you can also kick back and enjoy the new Seal Slammers minigame, which allows you to compete against your allies "in chaotic seal-based collisions". Finally.</p>




<p><em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>is available to play for free right now on <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC, PS5, and mobile devices</a>. Version 3.2, also known as "Through the Petals in the Land of Repose", arrives on April 9th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/live-action-zelda-movie-march-2027<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced the release date for the upcoming live-action&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda&nbsp;</em>movie, but don't get too excited; its release is a couple of years away yet.</p>

<p>Per an announcement on the new Nintendo Today! app, which was announced (and released) as part of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-march-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">yesterday's Nintendo Direct show</a>, the&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>movie will launch around the world on March 26th, 2027.</p>

<p>That date puts the movie's release in the same month as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-hedgehog-4-movie-march-2027" rel="nofollow">Paramount's&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog 4</em></a>; March is a pretty common month for blockbuster-style movies to be released in, so these two tentpole video game adaptations releasing then makes a lot of sense.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zelda-movie-release-date-link-horse.jpg?itok=2i6awzrx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zelda-movie-release-date-link-horse.jpg?itok=ETg0uIP1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The upcoming live-action&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>movie has an official release date.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, just because Nintendo has announced a date for the movie, that doesn't mean it won't be delayed or changed later down the line. Still, now you know when you should be clearing your schedule if you're eagerly awaiting the film.</p>

<p>While we don't have a cast or a story outline for the&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>movie yet, we do know that it'll be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-announces-live-action-legend-of-zelda-movie-distributed-and-co-financed-by" rel="nofollow">co-produced by Nintendo legend Shigeru Miyamoto</a>, alongside Hollywood blockbuster producer Avi Arad, whose name you'll find on movies like&nbsp;Sam Raimi's&nbsp;<em>Spider-Man&nbsp;</em>films.</p>

<p>Additionally, attached to direct the project is&nbsp;<em>The Maze Runner</em>'s Wes Ball, who also directed and produced 2024's&nbsp;<em>Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes</em>.</p>

<p>It's likely that we'll hear more about what's coming for the&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>movie in the months ahead, but Nintendo no doubt won't feel the need to rush; after all, it's got a major console launch to take care of in the next few months.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-zelda-movie.jpg?itok=WxqjCGIm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-zelda-movie.jpg?itok=D0J14GfS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nintendo will likely take care of the Switch 2's launch before more&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>movie details are revealed.</figcaption></figure><p>In case you're unaware, Nintendo is gearing up to release the Switch 2, which will probably be launching sometime in summer. A Nintendo Direct dedicated to the console is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">due to air next week</a>.</p>

<p>It's likely the company will be looking to focus on that launch before more&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>movie details are revealed, but it looks like if more info is released soon, it'll probably be via the Nintendo Today! app. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atelier-yumia-sales-300k-fastest-selling</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/atelier-yumia-sales-top-300-000-making-it-the-series-fastest-selling-game.1147785/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atelier-yumia-sales-300k-fastest-selling<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Koei Tecmo and Gust have revealed that JRPG&nbsp;<em>Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land&nbsp;</em>has hit a new sales milestone, as well as setting a new record for the series.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://x.com/gustatelierpr/status/1905531185713086693" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X (which is in Japanese, so we're using machine translation),&nbsp;<em>Atelier Yumia&nbsp;</em>has sold over 300,000 copies worldwide, which makes it the fastest-selling game in the franchise.</p>

<p>That's not bad given that the game has only been on sale for a week, and since it was released in Japan and around the world simultaneously, that figure doesn't include any long-tail Japanese sales either.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/atelier-yumia-sales-300k-combat.jpg?itok=hoCEiSGa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/atelier-yumia-sales-300k-combat.jpg?itok=TdqAE6aT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Atelier Yumia&nbsp;</em>has hit 300,000 sales since launching last week.</figcaption></figure><p>By way of comparison, it took&nbsp;<em>Atelier Ryza 3&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atelier-ryza-3-crosses-300k-sales-to-become-fastest-selling-secret-game" rel="nofollow">around a month</a> to achieve the same figure, and while that game is still the fastest-selling&nbsp;<em>Ryza&nbsp;</em>sub-series game, it can't lay claim to being the series' fastest-selling title.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Atelier Yumia</em>, it's the latest game in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Atelier&nbsp;</em>series of JRPGs, which also includes the likes of the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Atelier Ryza&nbsp;</em>sub-series, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atelier-resleriana-global-release-date" rel="nofollow">free-to-play RPG</a>&nbsp;<em>Atelier Resleriana&nbsp;</em>and its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atelier-resleriana-red-alchemist-and-white-guardian" rel="nofollow">upcoming sequel</a>.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, the games combine typical JRPG exploration and combat with a focus on item synthesis using ingredients gathered in the world, and&nbsp;<em>Atelier Yumia&nbsp;</em>is no different on that front.</p>

<p>Unlike previous games in the series, however,&nbsp;<em>Atelier Yumia&nbsp;</em>is fully open-world; rather than the open-zone environments of prior entries,&nbsp;<em>Yumia&nbsp;</em>allows you to fully and freely explore its map without any loading times to get in your way.</p>




<p><em>Yumia</em>'s success shows that there's still a significant audience out there eager for more&nbsp;<em>Atelier&nbsp;</em>games, so you can expect to see more from this series in the future.</p>

<p><em>Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3123410/Atelier_Yumia_The_Alchemist_of_Memories__the_Envisioned_Land/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012240" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/atelier-yumia-the-alchemist-of-memories-the-envisioned-land/9mzzjj7kgl7q" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/atelier-yumia-the-alchemist-of-memories-and-the-envisioned-land-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.
