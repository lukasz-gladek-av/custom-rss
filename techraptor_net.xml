It's a system favored by co-op adventures <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-friends-pass-crossplay" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="18aa71dd-1fab-4eaf-acb2-d391c4557f22" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">like <em>Split Fiction</em></a><em> </em>and <em>It Takes Two</em>, among others.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Reanimal </em>is getting hammered on Steam over its lack of a Friend Pass.</figcaption>

<p>The Friend Pass does appear to be available on PS5 and Switch 2, so it's PC (and Xbox Series X|S) players who are missing out here, even if they do want to play with their buddies on those platforms.</p><p>Players are <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199468943824/recommended/2129530/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">pointing</a> to the lack of a Friend Pass as a critical issue for them; <em>Reanimal </em>is, at least in part, being sold on its co-op nature, so the fact that such a crucial feature for co-op play is <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/yveris/recommended/2129530/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">missing</a> serves as a reason to <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/MooseSteakIsNeverAMistake/recommended/2129530/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">criticize the game</a> for many.</p><p>Rest assured, though, that if you're one of the people waiting for the Friend Pass, Tarsier Studios and THQ Nordic are working on it. In a Steam Community <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2129530/discussions/0/796709978759015686/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">post</a>, the publisher says the PC Friend Pass "will come later today" and that it's the team's "top priority".</p><p>If you're not familiar with <em>Reanimal</em>, it's the latest game from <em>Little Nightmares </em>creator Tarsier Studios, and like the developer's previous work, it pits helpless characters against untold horrors in an obscure world full of grotesque creatures.</p>
<p><em>Reanimal </em>is available now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2129530/REANIMAL/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/reanimal/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/reanimal/9n67dhnp2m0t" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/reanimal-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Switch 2</a>.
