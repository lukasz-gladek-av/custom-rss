<p>As well as a release date reveal, the Direct show also contained lots of other information about the upcoming <em>Tomodachi Life </em>sequel.</p><p>Let's get one thing out of the way now: yes, it's possible to date characters with the same sex or gender as your Mii, and you can also specify a romantic preference for nonbinary characters if you want to.</p><p>This course correction on Nintendo's behalf is part of an attempt to make <em>Living the Dream </em>a more inclusive experience, after criticism of the original <em>Tomodachi Life</em>'s <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/video-games/nintendo-apologizes-omitting-gay-marriage-tomodachi-life-n101861" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">omission</a> of gay romance.</p><p>Much like in <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em>, your island in <em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream </em>can be customized extensively, giving your Miis the opportunity to discover the village you've built for them and to create a life for themselves within.</p>
<p>If you don't have enough Miis to populate your island, don't worry; <em>Living the Dream </em>will let you create some from within the game itself as well as importing the ones that are already on your Switch.</p><p>Much like the original <em>Tomodachi Life</em>, the fun in this followup revolves around watching your Miis interact with one another and steering those interactions; it's essentially <em>The Sims</em>, but with Miis (and a heck of a lot more weirdness).</p><p><em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream </em>launches for <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Tomodachi-Life-Living-the-Dream-2786386.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch</a> on April 16th.

<p>What's more, if you pre-order <em>Icarus </em>on PS5 or Xbox Series X|S, you'll get access to the Pet Companions Pack DLC, which, as the name suggests, adds a number of adorable animals to pet and look after.</p><p>News of <em>Icarus</em>' console release date comes just a couple of weeks after Rocketwerkz and founder Dean Hall announced that the game had managed to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/icarus-sales-1m-steam-winter-sale" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c279503c-13a7-4443-b2c6-79704af33562" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">rack up almost a million sales for itself</a> during the most recent winter Steam Sale.</p><p>Hall also said that <em>Icarus </em>had managed to shift just shy of 250,000 "DLC units", although since the game has a number of smaller packs available in addition to its major expansion, that could just mean a whole bunch of what are effectively microtransaction purchases.</p><p>Just in case you're unfamiliar, <em>Icarus </em>is a survival game created by Dean Hall, one of the key players behind zombie sandbox <em>DayZ</em>. It's a PvE-focused affair that sees you (and, optionally, your squad) heading down to a planet on which terraforming has gone wrong and trying to survive its dangers.</p>
<p>You can check out <em>Icarus </em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1149460/ICARUS/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, and it's coming to <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10013354/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/icarus-console-edition/9P3H2PVZZPSD" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a> on February 26th.
