            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Nuggets Entertainment has revealed that its co-op driving adventure&nbsp;<em>RV There Yet?</em> has hit a very impressive sales milestone less than a week after its release.</p>

<p>On Friday, Nuggets <a href="https://x.com/RVThereYetGame/status/1982121374002168034" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">revealed</a> that the game had crossed a million sales with a rather endearingly lo-fi picture of a character pushing an RV up a hill, and over the weekend, sales reached almost 1.3 million (thanks, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cooperative-indie-darling-rv-there-yet-cruises-past-13-million-sales" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>).</p>

<p>In a video on the official Nuggets YouTube channel, "winch operator" Jace Varlet says that he and his team are aware that players have reported some bugs in&nbsp;<em>RV There Yet?</em>, and he says those bugs are being worked on by the development team.</p>

<p>According to Varlet, the reason these features aren't present in the game is that "it was a game jam game", with the kind of strict deadline that implies, and the team "had no expectation" that&nbsp;<em>RV There Yet?&nbsp;</em>would become as popular as it has.</p>

<p>As for why&nbsp;<em>RV There Yet?&nbsp;</em>didn't launch in Early Access, Varlet says the game "by and large is there", even if some features are missing, and that no other features were planned, thus making the Early Access label unsuitable for Nuggets' effort.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>RV There Yet?</em>, it's a co-op adventure game in which you and your friends must take an unconventional route home after a vacation. It's in a similar vein to games like indie hits&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/peak-2m-sales" rel="nofollow">Peak</a>&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chained-together-steam-surprise-hit" rel="nofollow"><em>Chained Together</em></a>.</p>
