            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Necromunda</em> is at war. The lines have been drawn, and everyone has to pick a side, or it will be picked for you. The next narrative campaign book for <em>Necromunda</em> has landed, and along with it, the golden-armoured Ozostium Aranthus himself. In this article, we take a look at <em>Necromunda</em>: The Aranthian Succession - Spire of Primus, Ozostium Aranthus, and the Palatine Jusicars.</p><p>We've covered <em>Necromunda</em> for a while on the site, and you can read our review of the most recent boxed set release, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/necromunda-hive-secundus-review" rel="nofollow">Hive Secundus</a>.</p><p><em>Necromunda</em> is a skirmish game set in Games Workshop's <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> universe. But rather than being about massive armies of capable warriors battling throughout the galaxy, <em>Necromunda</em> focuses on the inhabitants of the planet of Necromunda, most of whom are low-level gangers who inhabit the sprawling hive world.&nbsp;<em>Necromunda</em>&nbsp;is a campaign game, where each player creates a gang that gathers equipment and develops in skill as the campaign progresses.&nbsp;</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>The Aranthian Succession: Spire of Primus</h2><p>While the lower hives of Necromunda are filled with gangs and low-lifes, as you ascend the spires, a higher quality of inhabitant emerges, and with it, the conflict that always follows when there can only be one ruler.</p><p>One of the many fallen houses of Necromunda, defeated by House Helmawr, who have ruled Necromunda for centuries, was&nbsp;House Aranthus, thought all killed by a plague centuries ago. But now, emerging from an imprisonment in a casket,&nbsp;Ozostium Aranthus has risen, clad in a suit of golden armor and gathering supporters across Necromunda, throwing the planet into war.</p><p>Spire of Primus is the 4th book in the&nbsp;Aranthian Succession series of campaign books for <em>Necromunda</em>. It includes new background and lore for the ongoing narrative, and Part 4 of the Succession Campaign, which can be played with new gangs or continued from those in Part 3 of the&nbsp;Ruins of Jardlan book. Gangs in this campaign must choose between the Imperial House or House Aranthus, gaining benefits depending on which house they choose, and the chance for a major supporting character to fight for their gang in each battle.</p><p>Spire of Primus includes the rules and details for running the campaign, along with scenarios, which can be played normally or tweaked with directed force compositions to match the narrative in the book. The scenarios progress to a final multiplayer game, featuring all the gangs in the campaign, and includes all the major characters vying for power in a final standoff to decide the fate of Necromunda's ruling family. The book also contains rules for&nbsp;Ozostium Aranthus and the Palatine Justicars, which we discuss below, and the powerful Sthenian Spyre Hunter, Indentured Psykers, Hive Watchers, and Rogue Docs.</p><figure role="group">

</figure>
<h2>Ozostium Aranthus</h2><p>Ozostium Aranthus, the Divine Prince. This golden-armed figure stands above those who would oppose him. Ozostium won't just work for any gang, and only Aranthian-aligned gangs can roll on the petition table. His hire fee increases for those whose rep is too high, to the point where he thinks that you don't even need his help.</p><p>If Ozostium decides to help your gang, he arrives in all his splendor, with his Aranthian Beauty Plating that gives him a 4+ field armor save, and reflex enhancers to give him 2 actions per turn. He also has an Archaic Displacer, which can move him either 6, 12, or anywhere on the battlefield at the start of the turn on a random roll. His Bifurcated Blade is the length of a normal ganger, so long that it has a 2-inch range, along with -2 AP and damage 2. Ozostium is also an unsanctioned psyker and has the Divine Scorth Wyrd Power with a strength 2 template attack to keep the unwashed masses at bay.</p><p>Ozostium is always accompanied by a Caryatid-Servitor, a cherub mokery of a reanimated corpse that brings misfortune to those who target its master. Whenever Ozostium or the Caryatid are targeted by an attack, there's a chance the attacker's weapon will run out of ammo after the attack, and enemy fighters ending a move within 3 inches of have to take a nerve test.</p><p>Ozostium's miniature has a couple of build options, and you can leave off his mask and/or body plate to show the decaying corpse underneath.</p><figure role="group">

</figure>
<h2>Palanite Justicars</h2><p>The Palanite Justicar Delegation is a mobile judge, jury, and executioner team that hunts down renegade nobles. Loyal to the Imperial House, their use is directed by the campaign scenarios in the Spire of Primus book when using the force selection rules to match the narrative campaign or the alliance rules and choosing the Justicar Court.</p><p>The delegation is made up of a Magistrate, armed with a bolt pistol and Pronouncement gavel hammer, an Executioner, armed with an executioner's axe and stub gun, and 3 bailiffs, who can be armed with a shock pistol and heavy club, shotgun, or man-catcher. The box has 2 man-catchers, 2 shotguns, and 2 heavy clubs/shock pistols, so you can't arm all 3 the same, but you can double up on a weapon that suits your needs.</p><p>The Magistrate and Executioner have group activation 2 and 1, respectively. So you can activate the entire delegation with 2 actions. You can't chain these activations, using the Magistrate to activate the Executioner to then group activate a bailiff wouldn't work, but it's still super handy for overwhelming your opponent's force.</p><h2>Necromunda Spire of Primus Final Thoughts?</h2><p><em>Necromunda</em> Spire of Primus is a great narrative and works fantastically for the setup of the linked campaign, and a conclusion to this story arc that has been building up for a few years. The final multiplayer face-off between Ozostium and Lady Haera is the perfect way to end it. Ozostium is a fantastic miniature, and a beast on the tabletop, and the new Palanite Justicars ooze with incredible thematic details.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>The copies of</em> <strong>Necromunda Spire of Primus,&nbsp;Ozostium Aranthus, and the Palanite Justicars&nbsp;</strong><em>used to produce this review were provided by Games Workshop.</em></p></div><div><p><span><div>

In this article, we take a look at the new Bai Qian themed warband box and the new Imperial Court faction for <em>Bushido</em>.</p><p>We've been covering <em>Bushido&nbsp;</em>for years, so if you'd like to learn more about the game, check out <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/bushido-risen-sun-guide" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">our guide to <em>Bushido Risen Sun</em></a>, our <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bushido-two-player-starter-set-review" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">review of the <em>Bushido Risen Sun</em>&nbsp;2-player starter set</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/start-collecting-bushido-risen-sun-part-1-introduction-and-developer-interview" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">our "Start Collecting" guide to <em>Bushido</em></a>, which includes an interview with the game's developer.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Thematically Themed</h2><p>When selecting a warband in <em>Bushido</em>, you must first choose a faction from the now 14 available to select your fighters from. Each faction also has access to theme cards, which offer special abilities but restrict the units that can be included in the warband. The Imperial Court is a new faction for <em>Bushido</em>, and The Eternal Legion is a theme card that restricts you to Imperial and Ronin Imperial, and must include 1 Warden model for 1 or 2 Fangshi models, and 2 Wardens for 3 or more Fangshi models (we discuss why below), but gives them some incredible benefits that play into their theme.</p><p>Using the theme, Bai Qian, the stone warriors, gain Fear (5) and don't suffer the -1 in melee for taking the run action. Fangshi models who power the Bai Qian can focus to gain additional Ki for 1 activation counter rather than 2. In the first turn of the game, because of the Darkness special rule, models may only draw line of sight up to 4 inches (unless they're bakemono, soulless, or have sixth sense).</p><figure role="group">

</figure>
<p>There have been a few Imperial Ronin models and the Ronin Imperial March theme in <em>Bushido</em> for a while, but this is the first time they've had their own dedicated faction.</p><p>The Eternal Legion is an exciting theme, with the bulk of the force made up of Bai Qian stone warriors (based on the Terracotta Army), and the Fangshi handlers who have the power to animate them. Watching over them all are the Wardens, who are empowered to stop the Fangshi from falling into enemy hands and revealing their secrets, usually through permanent means.</p><figure role="group">

</figure>
<h2>Stoic Resilience</h2><p>The Bai Qian themed warband box, under the Eternal Legion theme, contains 9 models. These are:</p><ul><li>Chen Lu - The box's&nbsp;Warden, in charge of protecting the Fangshi. Lu is a great fighter and can switch the target to herself with her Intercept ki feat, preventing&nbsp;the enemy from charging her wards. She has to be within 3 inches of a friendly Fanghsi to generate ki. If she's within 6 inches of a friendly Fangshi model, who is in base-to-base contact with an enemy model during the end phase, she removes the Fangshi model, and you gain a scenario point, as she stops them from falling into enemy hands.</li><li>Zuo Ci - Ci is 1 of the 2 Fangshi models in the warband. Ci can&nbsp;channel ki into the Bai Qian, and is also quite adept at smashing enemies with his ruined earth sword, which is +3 damage and adds 3 to the final attack score when allocating dice to attack. Ci can also, once per game, return a removed Shibing or Rui Jin to the battlefield.&nbsp;If Ci channels into a Bai Qian, they allow that model to also use the ki feats on their own card.</li><li>Zi Xu - Xu is the second Fangshi in the warband, and where Ci smashes opponents, Xu instead&nbsp;has a +3 damage weapon, but with Dodge 3, which allows them to make their opponent reroll up to 3&nbsp;attack dice. Their Mirage ki feat also lets them move after being targeted by an attack, wasting your opponent's action. As with Ci, if Xu&nbsp;channels into a Bai Qian, they allow that model to also use the ki feats on their own card.</li><li>Bai Qian - both types of Bai Qian below have similar rules. They gain&nbsp;one activation each round and turn into a destructible terrain element when exhausted (destructible elements can't be attacked directly, but can be removed by a model in base-to-base contact and not in an enemy zone of control, by taking a wait action). All 3 models on each profile can also operate as a group, all moving or attacking in the same activation.<ul><li>3x Shibing - The Shibing are melee-based, and all armed with +2&nbsp;damage yari's with reach. Their group activation means that if you can get them into combat, they can easily overwhelm an enemy.</li><li>3x Rui Jin - The Rui Jin are the long-distance version of the Bai Qian, armed with a range 12, +1 damage repeating crossbow. Their group activation means they can level 3 shots on a single target, or spread their fire.</li></ul></li></ul><p>The Eternal Legion theme requires a lot of strategy to use. The positioning of your forces is key. Chen Lu only generates ki if she's nearby Fangshi models, but if a Fangshi model ends a turn in base-to-base contact with an enemy, Lu will remove the from play.</p><p>The Fangshi also need to be close to the Bai Qian. The Bai Qian don't generate ki themselves, and after taking their activation, are in a dangerous position that a wait action could remove them. They do have an instant ki feat that you can use as the active player at a 1 ki cost to give them an activation counter and stop them from being terrain. They can use that ki to generate an activation on their turn, but you have to manage it to make sure they have enough to protect them from being taken out by a wait action.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Like your Bai Qain thicc? Then upgrade to the&nbsp;Bu Dong.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Expanding The Empire</h2><p>While several Imperial Court Ronin models have been available for a while, the best addition to the Eternal Legion theme is currently the Bu Dong. These Bai Quin come in a pair, rather than a trio, have a lot more wounds, and come armed with a +2 strength Polearm with Pierce to help get through enemy armor.</p><p>They operate the same as the other Bai Qian, but have the option to gain the group trait during the starting phase. So if you want to smash into an opponent, you can choose to give them group, but if you want the additional separate activation, which is helpful sometimes to make sure you still get active player turns to stop your opponent taking out your Bai Qian terrain with a wait action, you can choose to activate them separately.</p><p>Their combined points are the same as the other 2 groups of Bai Qian, so they're a clean swap into a 100-rice warband out of the Bai Qian themed warband.</p><h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On The Bai Qian Themed Warband?</h2><p>The Bai Qian themed warband continues the recent trend of incredible design from GCT Studios. The recent wave of faction starter sets and themed warbands has been inspired, and this is no different. Perfectly capturing thematically and mechanically the nature of how you'd imagine a group of stone statue warriors go to war, this set offers a great challenge (for you and your opponent) and adds an entirely new element to an already great wargame filled with interesting factions and warband themes.</p><hr><p>The copy of&nbsp;<strong>Bushido Bai Qian</strong>&nbsp;<em>used to produce this review was provided by GCT Studios.</em></p></div><div><p><span><div>
