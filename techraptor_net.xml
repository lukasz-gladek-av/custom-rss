            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Paradox and&nbsp;<em>Vampire: The Masquerade&nbsp;</em>IP owner White Wolf&nbsp;have announced that&nbsp;<em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</em>'s Lasombra and Toreador clans will no longer be optional extra DLC for the game.</p>

<p>In the description of a new overview trailer, the two studios say that both clans "are confirmed for the base game at launch", and that this means all six playable clans will now be available for everyone rather than just those who pony up a little extra cash.</p>

<p><em>Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>executive producer and White Wolf executive VP Marco Behrmann says players' "frank feedback" has been heard, and that since that feedback made it clear Lasombra and Toreador should be included in the base game, "that is what we are doing".</p>

<p>Honestly, this feels like a great time to ask why it was so easy for Paradox and White Wolf to remove the paywall on both clans. It's almost as though it was arbitrarily added to make the studios a bit of extra money in the first place, but hey, what do I know?</p>

<p>Of course, if you are desperate to pay some extra money on top of the fee you're already coughing up for <i>Bloodlines 2</i>, there will still be some DLC you can grab at launch, namely two story packs that are included as part of the expansion pass every game must now have.</p>

<p>The Loose Cannon and The Flower &amp; The Flame story packs won't be released until next year, but you will get the Santa Monica Memories Cosmetic Pack on day one, so, well, there's that, I suppose.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</em>, it's the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-october-2025" rel="nofollow">long-awaited</a> (and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-yet-again" rel="nofollow">oft-delayed</a>) followup to the cult 2004 action RPG. The game was originally being worked on by Hardsuit Labs before a developer switch to&nbsp;<em>Dear Esther&nbsp;</em>studio The Chinese Room was announced&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-back-developed-by-chinese-room" rel="nofollow">in 2023</a>.</p>

<p><em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>is set to launch on October 21st for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/532790/Vampire_The_Masquerade__Bloodlines_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10007767/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/9pf9rkwb9b50" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.
