<p>As FRVR points out, <em>Where Winds Meet</em>, an MMO released in November and published by NetEase, has generative AI woven into its DNA; it's in everything from NPC conversations to face generation and more.</p><p>Niko Partners research director Daniel Ahmad <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/2019051793125093813" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">also confirmed</a> that NetEase is still in favor of generative AI, citing a statement in which the company declares that the situation Suda51 describes "did not occur" and that NetEase has "not published any related policies".</p><p>Generative AI remains a hot topic when it comes to game development.
