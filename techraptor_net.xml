The swashbuckling spin-off of their dark fantasy RPG line will be getting a new expansion, <em>Down Among the Dead</em>, as well as a new Starter Set and GM screen.</p><h2>The <em>Pirate Borg</em> RPG Expansion Announcement</h2><p>According to an official press release, the <em>Down Among the Dead</em> expansion contains an all-new journey for players to experience in Pirate Borg. This journey spans three new adventures, containing dangerous challenges and potentially new chests of plunder. Judging by the title and the cover art, there's a chance that treasure may be cursed. Or at least protected by skeletons.</p><picture>
