            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A streamer battling stage 4 cancer has been scammed to the tune of around $30,000 by a Steam game that concealed cryptodrain malware, and while the game has been removed, it remained online for around three weeks with the malware infecting its code.</p>

<p>As spotted by ResetEra user <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/streamer-rastaland-raising-money-for-his-stage-4-cancer-treatment-gets-30k-stolen-from-steam-game-containing-malware-while-streaming.1303938/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Atheerios</a>, streamer rastaland, who is suffering from a stage 4 sarcoma (which means the cancer has metastasized to other parts of his body), was tricked into downloading a Steam demo by the name of&nbsp;<em>BlockBlasters</em>, which&nbsp;contained a cryptodrainer.</p>

<p>If you're not sure what a cryptodrainer is, it's essentially a malicious piece of software that drains cryptocurrency from users' wallets (hence the name). As rastaland himself <a href="https://x.com/rastalandtv/status/1969629808788181258" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">says</a>, the malware drained him for "over $32,000" in creator fees earned through crypto platform pump.fun.</p>

Honestly, I'd recommend against watching it because it's completely heartbreaking, but if you'd like to get all your ducks in a row, it's there for you to watch.</p>

<p>As reported by cyber defense blog <a href="https://www.gdatasoftware.com/blog/2025/09/38265-steam-blockblasters-game-downloads-malware" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">G Data</a>,&nbsp;<em>BlockBlasters&nbsp;</em>seemingly didn't contain any malicious code until August 30th, when the cryptodrainer in question was added to the game. G Data's report also contains a great rundown of how exactly the drainer works and what you can watch out for to avoid being scammed yourself.</p>

<p>G Data points out that this isn't the first instance of malware being injected into Steam games; other examples include free-to-play survival sims&nbsp;<em>PirateFi&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Chemia</em>, both of which were compromised by malicious updates.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/chemia-scam-cryptodrainer-steam.jpg?itok=brvatRhM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/chemia-scam-cryptodrainer-steam.jpg?itok=0Lr34Rj7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Chemia&nbsp;</em>is another example of a Steam game injected with malware.</figcaption></figure><p>All three of the games I've mentioned in this article have now been removed from Steam, but according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3872350/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, two people are still playing&nbsp;<em>BlockBlasters&nbsp;</em>on Steam right now. If that's you and you're reading this, I'd strongly recommend backing out of the game and deleting it.</p>

<p>As for rastaland, he's apparently been <a href="https://x.com/rastalandTV/status/1969993892889027069" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">inundated</a> with support and kind words from his community, and it looks like crypto enthusiast Alex Becker <a href="https://x.com/ZssBecker/status/1969774353211695441" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sent</a> the streamer enough money to cover the loss, which is a lovely gesture.</p>

<p>This feels to me like a pretty sobering reminder to be extremely careful when getting involved with anything Web3-related, whatever <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/might-and-magic-fates-blockchain-mobile" rel="nofollow">certain major publishers</a>&nbsp;may <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/immensely-popular-classic-sega-franchise-will-become-nft-game" rel="nofollow">tell you</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[Fortnite Daft Punk Collab Confirmed, Launches Later This Week]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-daft-punk-collab</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite-daft-punk-collab-confirmed-launches-later-this-week.1304409/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic Games has announced the latest band to make its way into&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>as a crossover, and it's none other than legendary French house duo Daft Punk, who will feature in the game as an "experience" later this week.</p>

<p>As revealed in an <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/party-harder-better-faster-stronger-in-fortnite-with-the-daft-punk-experience?lang=en-US" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official blog post</a>,&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s Daft Punk Experience will begin on September 27th, and rather than just consisting of a few songs for&nbsp;<em>Fortnite Festival&nbsp;</em>or a couple of skins, it'll serve as a full-scale "sonic journey", according to Epic.</p>

<p>In the post, Epic says the experience will take players to a "transformative dancefloor destination" where they'll be able to "remix Daft Punk's music at Dream Chamber Studios" or "blast hordes of robots with a soundwave laser in the Robot Rock Arena".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fortnite-daft-punk-collab-skins.jpg?itok=5b-1BR1N 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fortnite-daft-punk-collab-skins.jpg?itok=wY2SvpAe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fortnite</em>'s new Daft Punk collab isn't just skins, but those are on offer too.</figcaption></figure><p>If that doesn't tickle your fancy, then perhaps you'd prefer to "make a Lego music video at Around the World" or "hit the Daft Club to dance til dawn". Furniture company Hervet Manufacturier, which has worked with Daft Punk in the past, will also have several virtual pieces displayed throughout the experience.</p>

<p>Epic is also promising an "afterparty" for the Daft Punk experience, but the studio is keeping the details close to its chest for now, promising to reveal more info about that "at a later date".</p>

<p>Of course, if you do want to pick up some Daft Punk skins for your&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>character, you can do so with a new bundle that launches this Thursday. It's got two new outfits and a bunch of accessories for you to spruce up your battle royale-ing with.</p>

<p>Daft Punk is far from the first artist to feature in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>. The duo follows on from the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-festival-hatsune-miku-crossover" rel="nofollow">Hatsune Miku</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-festival-reveals-first-glimpse-of-weeknd-gameplay" rel="nofollow">The Weeknd</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-the-big-bang-eminem" rel="nofollow">rap legend Eminem</a>, among many others.</p>

<p><em>Fortnite</em>'s Daft Punk collab lands on September 27th, and the "grand opening" for the event kicks off at 2pm Eastern that day, so make sure to be there if you want to see it all begin.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Xbox Makes "Largest Investment" in Game Pass to Date This Year]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-largest-investment-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-makes-largest-investment-in-game-pass-to-date-this-year.1304376/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Xbox has revealed that this year marks its "largest investment" in the Xbox Game Pass subscription service to date, so it's clear the company isn't too fazed by discussions around whether the service is good for developers or not.</p>

<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inside-xboxs-increasingly-vital-indie-publishing-operation" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>, Xbox indie boss Chris Charla confirms that 2025 has seen the biggest investment in Game Pass in the service's history, and he also reveals that Xbox has "signed deals with more than 150 partners to expand the catalog".</p>

<p>Charla says that "the majority" of studios whose games have been included as part of Game Pass "want to bring their future titles to the service", too, so the somewhat ambivalent buzz doesn't seem to be deterring developers who've got experience with the platform either.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-game-pass-largest-investment-there-are-no-ghosts-at-the-grand.jpg?itok=zEhnasiB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-game-pass-largest-investment-there-are-no-ghosts-at-the-grand.jpg?itok=AxI2P82x 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Xbox Game Pass is attracting indie titles like the upcoming&nbsp;<em>There Are No Ghosts at the Grand</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Xbox making its largest investment in Game Pass yet comes after a couple of high-profile industry figures expressed concern that the service might be doing more harm than good for developers, whether they be first-party or third-party studios.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, former Bethesda exec Pete Hines said subscription services were "worth jack shit" without companies making the effort to "figure out how to balance the needs of the service" with those who are "providing the content".</p>

<p>PlayStation boss Shawn Layden appeared to agree, linking Hines' comments on social media platform LinkedIn and asking whether subscription services were "healthy and helpful" for those who make games.</p>

<p>Layden's comments drew agreement <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-shannon-loftis-comments" rel="nofollow">from former Xbox VP Shannon Loftis</a>, who added that game adoption on Game Pass "comes at the expense of retail revenue" and that the service creates "weird inner tensions" among developers.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/human-fall-flat-xbox-game-pass_0.jpg?itok=xY9tfjwL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/human-fall-flat-xbox-game-pass_0.jpg?itok=wGw6bsPt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Game Pass hits like&nbsp;<em>Human: Fall Flat&nbsp;</em>haven't stopped some wondering whether the service is good for developers.</figcaption></figure><p>Whether or not Game Pass is actually good for developers is a question that's likely to continue to spark debate, but one thing's for sure: Xbox is still sure the service works. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things Game Pass-related.</p>
