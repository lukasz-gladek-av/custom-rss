            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>will soon break out of its console exclusivity prison, PlayStation and Xbox have announced, as the bug-slaying shooter is due to land on Xbox Series X|S later this summer.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/03/helldivers-2-xbox-release-date-pre-order/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the official Xbox Wire news platform,&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>will be released on Xbox Series X|S on August 26th. Coincidentally (or perhaps not), that's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-ps5-release-date-enhancements" rel="nofollow">the same date</a> on which<i>&nbsp;Senua's Saga: Hellblade II&nbsp;</i>lands on PS5.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, no specific enhancements or unique features will be introduced for the Xbox version of&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>, although you will net yourself some extra goodies if you pre-order either the standard version or the Super Citizen Edition of the game.</p>

The studio has also helped out with PC ports for the likes of&nbsp;<em>Marvel's Spider-Man</em>,&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Horizon Forbidden West</em>.</p>

<p>If you're somehow not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>, it's a co-op-focused third-person shooter in which players band together to slay enemies belonging to one of three factions: the insectoid Terminids, the robotic Automatons, and the alien Illuminate.</p>

<p>The game's theming is heavily satirical; while players are routinely encouraged to support Super Earth and its introduction of "managed democracy" to the galaxy, in truth, Super Earth's government is much closer to an autocratic regime.</p>

<p>Missions revolve around completing a series of objectives while fending off enemies from the three aforementioned factions, and with friendly fire not only present but constant, I'd recommend playing with those with whom your friendship is ironclad.</p>




<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>on <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/helldivers-2/9mx9wn9dfpgt" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> when it launches on Microsoft's hardware on August 26th. The game is also currently available on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/helldivers-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Perfect Dark Reboot Reportedly Canceled, Developer The Initiative Shut Down]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/perfect-dark-reboot-reportedly-canceled-developer-the-initiative-shut-down.1234959/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The ongoing Xbox layoff and cancellation wave continues, and this time, it's developer The Initiative and its long-awaited&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</em>reboot in the crosshairs, it seems.</p>

<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-is-closing-down-xbox-studio-the-initiative" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Windows Central</a>, an internal email sent to Xbox employees by studio head Matt Booty confirms the cancellation not only of&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark</em>, but also of Rare's&nbsp;<em>Everwild</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">reported yesterday</a>&nbsp;as part of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" rel="nofollow">massive wave of Microsoft layoffs</a>.</p>

<p>Booty's email also confirms the closure of The Initiative, which, along with the project cancellations, is intended to "reflect a broader effort to adjust priorities and focus resources to set up our teams for greater success within a changing industry landscape". Yep, it's that kind of phrasing again.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/perfect-dark-canceled-the-initiative-closed-sliding.jpg?itok=sDMS2Wbs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/perfect-dark-canceled-the-initiative-closed-sliding.jpg?itok=DuyfHD_e 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Perfect Dark</em>, along with its developer The Initiative, is no more.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Windows Central, "everything shown in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">recent Xbox showcase from June</a>" is safe from cancellation, including games like inXile's&nbsp;<em>Clockwork Revolution&nbsp;</em>and Double Fine's&nbsp;<em>Keeper</em>, among others.</p>

<p>However, it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/696676/microsoft-forza-motorsport-turn-10-studios-layoffs-xbox-cuts" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">does appear</a> that&nbsp;<em>Forza Motorsport&nbsp;</em>developer Turn 10 Studios was hit by this sweeping Microsoft layoff wave, with over 70 employees at the studio reportedly being let go.</p>

<p>As a reminder, Turn 10 is responsible for&nbsp;<em>Forza Motorsport</em>, but not for&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon</em>; that honor goes to Playground Games, which is, as far as we know, safe from these layoffs, as is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fable-reboot-delayed-2026" rel="nofollow">next year's&nbsp;<em>Fable&nbsp;</em>reboot</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, these things can change on a dime;&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</em>got itself a gameplay reveal during last year's summer showcase period, and a little over a year later, the project is no more. Let's hope&nbsp;<em>Fable&nbsp;</em>and other upcoming Xbox games, as well as their developers, can escape further cuts.</p>




<p><em>Perfect Dark</em>'s development appears to have been difficult, to say the least. Back in 2021, Crystal Dynamics joined the project as a co-developer, and the following March, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/report-indicates-perfect-dark-studio-initiative-hemorrhaging-staff" rel="nofollow">it was revealed</a> that The Initiative was hemorrhaging staff, with many blaming slow progress on the game and a lack of creative freedom for their departure.</p>

<p>However, thanks to the gameplay footage released last year, the reboot appeared to be back on track, which makes this decision's timing even more baffling.</p>

<p>Completely unrelatedly, back in April, Microsoft <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/fy-2025-q3/press-release-webcast" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> a 13% jump in Q3 revenue over the same period the previous year, with net income also up by 18%. Dire figures like that really show the necessity of laying off thousands of employees and closing studios, I'm sure you'll agree.</p>
