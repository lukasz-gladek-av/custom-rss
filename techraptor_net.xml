            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-mans-sky-relics-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hello Games has released another new&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>update, and this one's all about the past; you'll be unearthing bones, assembling fossils, and doing battle with giant stone guardians.</p>

<p>The Relics update follows on from previous updates like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-mans-sky-worlds-part-2-update" rel="nofollow">Worlds</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-mans-sky-orbital-update" rel="nofollow">Orbital</a>, and like those updates, this one's pretty substantial. Its main addition is the ability to "design and assemble complete skeletons from your collection of ancient bones".</p>

<p>According to Hello Games, you'll be able to "imagine how ancient alien creatures might have looked, and re-assemble their bodies from their fossilized remains". There will also be "millions of possibilities for unique species" that you can assemble.</p>

<p>A new Expedition will also see you signing up with the Galactic Paleology Society to "recreate ancient lifeforms and uncover secrets". If you've been waiting for a chance to discover the kind of creatures that inhabited&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky</em>'s countless planets in the past, this update is for you.</p>

<p>Once you've assembled fossil exhibits, you can then visit Fossil Collectors aboard Space Stations in order to sell your creations or trade bones for other fossils.</p>

<p>Of course, this being a&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>update, you will also find tons of other new features and things to look forward to. You can read the update's full patch notes, as well as a rundown of its more significant features, <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/relics-update/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>.</p>




<p>The Relics update continues Hello Games' quest to turn&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>into the most comprehensive space survival sim ever, and it's admirable just how focused on the game's ongoing development the studio still is all these years later.</p>

<p><em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/275850/No_Mans_Sky/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/no-mans-sky/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/no-mans-sky/BQVQTL3PCH05" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/no-mans-sky-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>. The Relics update is out now.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/switch-focused-nintendo-direct-show-revealed-for-tomorrow.1145265/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-march-2025-switch-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced a brand new Nintendo Direct presentation that's set to bring some more information about upcoming Switch titles tomorrow, but you should temper your expectations.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1904896350853960065" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">new post</a> on social media platform X, tomorrow's Nintendo Direct will take place at 7am Pacific (that's 10am Eastern and 2pm GMT), and will feature "around 30 minutes" of info about "upcoming games for Nintendo Switch".</p>

<p>However, Nintendo swiftly clarifies that there won't be any information about the Switch 2 during tomorrow's Direct. If you want that, you'll have to tune in to the Direct <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">that will air next Wednesday</a>&nbsp;at 6am Pacific (and thanks to time zone shenanigans, that will also be around 2pm GMT).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-direct-march-2025-announcement.jpg?itok=cLYZaWsX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-direct-march-2025-announcement.jpg?itok=AtGCiPhN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Will we get more&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime 4&nbsp;</em>info during tomorrow's Direct?</figcaption></figure><p>As for what games we're likely to see during tomorrow's Nintendo Direct, there's a decent chance we'll be learning more about&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metroid-prime-4-beyond-2025" rel="nofollow">unveiled in full</a> during Nintendo's summer gaming show last year.</p>

<p>We still don't have a specific release date beyond (no pun intended) 2025 for&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime 4</em>, so hopefully, we'll get to learn exactly when we can play Samus' latest adventure. Of course, there's also a chance we'll learn it's coming to Switch 2 as well during next week's show.</p>

<p>A release date for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>doesn't seem especially likely given <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-presents-february-2025-all-reveals-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">how recent its first gameplay reveal was</a>, but hey, I can't deny it's on my wishlist, so let's hope we get some more info about that one too.</p>

<p>Obviously, no gaming show, whether it's a Nintendo Direct, a State of Play, or an Xbox Developer Direct, is complete without a mention of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong" rel="nofollow"><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em></a>. Will we get a release date for that tomorrow? It's highly unlikely, but a man can dream.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/war-of-visions-final-fantasy-brave-exvius-shutting-down<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has announced that mobile tactical RPG&nbsp;<em>War of the Visions: Final Fantasy Brave Exvius&nbsp;</em>will shut down in May.</p>

<p>In August last year, it was revealed that&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy Brave Exvius&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-brave-exvius-shutting-down" rel="nofollow">would be ending service that October</a>, and now it's the turn of the&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>-inspired strategy RPG spinoff to do the same, according to a <a href="https://wotvffbe.com/notice/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">new announcement</a> on the game's official website.</p>

<p>According to Square Enix, while the studio attempted to "provide an enjoyable gaming experience" for&nbsp;<em>War of the Visions</em>' players, it's become "difficult to maintain a satisfactory app experience", hence the game's impending shutdown.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/war-of-the-visions-final-fantasy-brave-exvius-shutting-down-gameplay.jpg?itok=GHBnxXib 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/war-of-the-visions-final-fantasy-brave-exvius-shutting-down-gameplay.jpg?itok=eU648NzN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>War of the Visions: Final Fantasy Brave Exvius&nbsp;</em>will be shutting down in May.</figcaption></figure><p>As of today, it's no longer possible to purchase&nbsp;<em>War of the Visions: Final Fantasy Brave Exvius</em>' Visiore currency from the game's shop, nor can you make any more Special Shop purchases.</p>

<p>Service will fully shut down on May 29th at 11:59PM Pacific, so you'll have until then to do whatever you need to do in&nbsp;<em>War of the Visions&nbsp;</em>before the game disappears forever. It doesn't sound like you'll be able to play any kind of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-offline-december" rel="nofollow"><em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp</em>-style offline version</a>, either.</p>

<p>If you've got Google Play Points you want to exchange for items in&nbsp;<em>War of the Visions</em>, you'll be able to do so until April 30th, but any Visiore you've already got can be used right up until the game's service comes to an end.</p>

<p>Just in case you're not familiar,&nbsp;<em>War of the Visions: Final Fantasy Brave Exvius&nbsp;</em>is a tactical RPG spinoff of mobile RPG&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy Brave Exvius</em>. It combines the strategic gameplay of games like&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy Tactics&nbsp;</em>with&nbsp;<em>Brave Exvius</em>' gacha mechanics and general free-to-play mobile trappings.</p>




<p>During its operation, the game crossed over with several major&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>titles, including the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/war-of-visions-final-fantasy-brave-exvius-reveals-final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade" rel="nofollow"><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy X</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy V</em>.</p>

<p>You can still check out&nbsp;<em>War of the Visions: Final Fantasy Brave Exvius&nbsp;</em>for free right now on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.square_enix.android_googleplay.WOTVffbeww&amp;hl=en_GB" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/final-fantasy-be-wotv/id1484937345" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">iOS</a>. The game will be available until May 29th (or May 30th, depending on your time zone).</p>
