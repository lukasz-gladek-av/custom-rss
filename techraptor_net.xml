            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-financials-layoffs-possible<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has released its latest financial summary, which covers the 2024-25 fiscal year, and it's safe to say that things aren't exactly looking up for the studio right now.</p>

<p>In its presentation, Ubisoft reveals that both sales and profit are down compared to last year. The period in question technically also covers the launch of recent flagship game&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>, so although the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-circana-march-2025-sales" rel="nofollow">sales performance was strong</a>, it wasn't enough to save the studio from a tough year.</p>

<p>In an accompanying <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/75aGUbWM9kwnQj44Tr7d6H/ce4ca047ddadf45cf1e98cea8d1d7a78/Ubisoft_FY25_PR_English_vfinal.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a>, Ubisoft says it will refocus its efforts towards "more evergreen offering(s)" as part of a "product roadmap optimization", presumably meaning we can expect to see fewer one-off titles and more live-service-adjacent games from the company.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-financials-2024-25.jpg?itok=suJOpzQH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-financials-2024-25.jpg?itok=DpKAnvcB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>did well, but not well enough to save Ubisoft from a grim year.</figcaption></figure><p>Additionally, Ubisoft says it will continue its ongoing cost reduction program, as part of which the company hopes to slash "at least&nbsp;€200m" from its costs by the next financial year.</p>

<p>The studio says it's already achieved a reduction of "around&nbsp;€205 million" as of March 31st, but that a further&nbsp;€100m will need to be cut over the next two years, which means that we could see a repeat of the sweeping cuts that saw three Ubisoft <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing" rel="nofollow">studios</a> close their <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-layoffs-leamington-closure" rel="nofollow">doors</a> in the last six months or so.</p>

<p>Company CEO Yves Guillemot says the plan is to build "evergreen, billion-euro-brand ecosystems" based on Ubisoft's three most successful franchises:&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed</em>,&nbsp;<em>Rainbow Six</em>, and<i>&nbsp;Far Cry</i>.</p>

<p>That's the rationale behind the creation of a brand new corporate entity for the company's core IP, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft--report-new-gaming-entity-core-ip" rel="nofollow">first mooted back in March</a> before being made official later in the year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rainbow-six-siege-ubisoft.jpg?itok=8iuSFH_B 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rainbow-six-siege-ubisoft.jpg?itok=VrilsPYK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ubisoft is betting big on core franchises like&nbsp;<em>Rainbow Six Siege&nbsp;</em>for its future.</figcaption></figure><p>Guillemot goes on to say that as part of a "review" of Ubisoft's "pipeline", the studio has made the decision to "provide additional development time to some of [its] biggest productions".</p>

<p>He doesn't name those productions, but upcoming titles include mobile game&nbsp;<em>The Division Resurgence&nbsp;</em>and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sands-of-time-remake-another-studio" rel="nofollow">long-awaited&nbsp;<em>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake</em></a>, so it's entirely possible that both of these productions will be delayed even further.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-5-phantom-x-release-date-leaked<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The release date for upcoming mobile RPG&nbsp;<em>Persona 5: The Phantom X&nbsp;</em>appears to have been leaked ahead of an official reveal later today hat's likely to contain said information.</p>

<p>As spotted by&nbsp;<em>Persona&nbsp;</em>fan site&nbsp;<a href="https://personacentral.com/p5x-english-release-date/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Persona Central</a>, the game, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-5-phantom-x-western-release-atlus-tease" rel="nofollow">teased for a Western release earlier this week</a>, now has live listings across the Play Store, the App Store, and Steam. Apple's App Store is the one to give the game away, listing an expected release date of June 26th.</p>

<p>Of course, since neither the Steam page nor the Play Store listing have the same date, Apple's date could be a placeholder, but that seems unlikely given how oddly specific said date would be if it was just for demonstration purposes.</p>

You'll play as a new original character who's "thrust into a changed world drained of hope" following a "nightmare".</p>

<p>Before long, he meets an "eloquent owl named Lefaye" and "a long-nosed man" alongside a "beauty donned in blue", which presumably refers to Igor and his new assistant character. Evidently, twin youngsters Caroline and Justine will not be returning for&nbsp;<em>The Phantom X</em>.</p>

<p>Like the original&nbsp;<em>Persona 5</em>, you'll be switching between the Metaverse and the real world, exploring dungeons and balancing your adventuring life with socializing and building relationships.</p>

<p>Combat will follow the original&nbsp;<em>Persona 5</em>&nbsp;rather than either of its spinoffs; it'll be a strictly turn-based affair, so don't expect to be doing any <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/persona-5-strikers" rel="nofollow">real-time hack-and-slash-style fighting</a> or grid-based tactical strategizing here.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-patch-14<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GSC Game World has released&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>Patch 1.4, and it's bringing tons of improvements to the game's combat mechanics, plus more changes to the much-vaunted A-Life AI system and lots of other tweaks.</p>

<p>Much like the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-update-12" rel="nofollow">last few</a> major&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-update-1-1-a-life" rel="nofollow">updates</a>, there's no single star of the show here; it's all about the minor adjustments that all come together to create what will hopefully be a slightly less janky game.</p>

<p>Combat changes include mutants now being able to eat corpses using an animation if they're nearby, as well as entering an "alert" state if something happens near them. You'll have to be on your toes if you don't want to fall foul of mutants now.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stalker-2-patch-1.4-night.jpg?itok=4fE9uiJm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stalker-2-patch-1.4-night.jpg?itok=sbwKAwvR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>has received another big patch.</figcaption></figure><p>Humans are also much smarter now thanks to this update; they'll seek cover more often, "always try to hide before shooting", and won't rush forward if you don't need them. They'll also use trees as cover now, which is a nice addition.</p>

<p>Plenty of other big improvements have been made to the way humans do battle in&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>as well; they'll throw grenades only when flushing out targets (rather than on cooldown), flank more often, and use tougher close combat measures in Veteran and Stalker difficulty modes.</p>

<p><em>Stalker 2</em>'s A-Life system, which has been the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-a-life-20-gsc-game-world" rel="nofollow">subject of some controversy</a> in the past, has also received a few tweaks, although they're much less extensive than they have been in previous patches.</p>

<p>A-Life NPCs will now behave less erratically when attacking enemy lairs, and an issue involving A-Life NPCs not moving when "transitioning to offline" has also been fixed. It's not much, but it's useful nonetheless.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stalker-2-patch-1.4-poppies.jpg?itok=kDIGjJ94 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stalker-2-patch-1.4-poppies.jpg?itok=cKtXw-Sl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You should notice that&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>'s NPCs are a bit smarter now.</figcaption></figure><p>If you want to read the full list of&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>Patch 1.4 changes, you can do so via the <a href="https://www.stalker2.com/news/patch-1-4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">patch notes here</a>. Be aware that while it's not quite as long as previous updates, it's still a pretty long list.</p>

<p>This patch comes just a day after GSC Game World <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-legends-of-zone-enhanced-edition-release-date" rel="nofollow">announced the release date</a> for the upcoming Enhanced Edition upgrade for the&nbsp;<em>Stalker: Legends of the Zone</em>&nbsp;trilogy, which is bringing visual and gameplay improvements to the classic shooters next week.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/stalker-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and the game is also available as part of certain Game Pass tier subscriptions.
