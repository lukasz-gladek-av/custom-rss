            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher 2K and developer Gearbox have announced that the Switch 2 version of recently-released looter shooter&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>is being delayed indefinitely, and that pre-orders on the platform will be canceled.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://x.com/Borderlands/status/1970609156936868102" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on social media, the game is being delayed on Switch 2 in order to "deliver the best possible experience to [the two studios'] fans", and also to "better align [the Switch 2 release] with the addition of cross-saves".</p>

<p>2K and Gearbox didn't announce a new release date or window, but they did promise to reveal more once they've "fully adjusted" their plans for&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>on Switch 2.</p>

You can initiate the cancellation process yourself if you want, but it'll automatically begin on September 26th (that's this Friday). Naturally, if you have a physical pre-order in place, you should contact the retailer.</p>

<p>News of&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em>'s delay on Switch 2 comes after widespread criticism of the game's performance on PC (and consoles, but criticism seems primarily aimed at the PC version), prompting Gearbox's Randy Pitchford to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/randy-pitchford-borderlands-4-performance-comments" rel="nofollow">passionately leap to the game's defense</a>.</p>

<p>Despite Pitchford's assertions that&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em>'s PC performance is fine, 2K and Gearbox have pledged to continue improving&nbsp;the game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/borderlands-4-pc-performance-top-priority" rel="nofollow">calling PC performance their "top priority"</a>.</p>

<p>All of the talk around&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em>'s performance also doesn't seem to have hurt the game sales-wise, at least not in the initial surge; reports estimate that the game has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/borderlands-4-sales-revenue" rel="nofollow">managed to shift around 2.5 million copies</a>, with the majority of those sales being on PC.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Yakuza Kiwami 3 and Bonus Spinoff Dark Ties Revealed During RGG Summit]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties-announced</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-bonus-spinoff-dark-ties-revealed-during-rgg-summit.1306590/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio have officially revealed&nbsp;<em>Yakuza Kiwami 3</em>, confirming long-swirling rumors, but the game won't launch alone; it'll also come with a bonus prequel-slash-spinoff focusing on prominent character Yoshitaka Mine.</p>

<p>The game was announced during today's Ryu Ga Gotoku Summit, but its existence was actually all but confirmed earlier this month, when it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/yakuza-kiwami-3-apparently-leaked" rel="nofollow">accidentally leaked via the official RGG website</a>. Still, now it's official!</p>

<p>As you'd imagine from the&nbsp;<em>Kiwami&nbsp;</em>name, <i>Yakuza Kiwami 3&nbsp;</i>will serve as a full ground-up remake of 2009's&nbsp;<em>Yakuza 3</em>, complete with revamped visuals, improved gameplay, and extra scenes that promise to "deliver more depth and emotion" to the game's "beloved story".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/yakuza-kiwami-3-combat.jpg?itok=TrAi3anl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/yakuza-kiwami-3-combat.jpg?itok=OuqtjZc1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Having been leaked earlier this month,&nbsp;<em>Yakuza Kiwami 3&nbsp;</em>is now official.</figcaption></figure><p>Not only that, but you can also expect "new and enhanced side experiences", and if previous&nbsp;<em>Kiwami&nbsp;</em>remakes are anything to go by, that means we'll be getting new substories, as well as expanded versions of the game's existing side content.</p>

<p>As if all of this wasn't enough (and believe me, given the average length of <i>Yakuza</i>-slash-<em>Like a Dragon&nbsp;</em>experiences, it almost certainly will be), RGG has thrown in a new prequel-slash-spinoff as part of the experience as well.</p>

<p><em>Dark Ties&nbsp;</em>tells the story of&nbsp;<em>Yakuza 3&nbsp;</em>antagonist Yoshitaka Mine as he endeavors to find "true bonds" after leaping into the "dark world of the yakuza by choice after losing everything". The prequel will offer new side experiences and "exhilarating boxing-based combat", according to RGG.</p>

<p>You can check out an announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Yakuza Kiwami 3&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Dark Ties&nbsp;</em>right here. It should give you a good sense of some of the changes that have been made to the game.</p>




<p><em>Yakuza Kiwami 3&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Dark Ties&nbsp;</em>will launch on February 11th for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3937550/Yakuza_Kiwami_3__Dark_Ties/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10015219" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties/9N2370NCNW1M/0017" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and Nintendo Switch 2, and they'll come as a full package, so you won't need to buy&nbsp;<em>Dark Ties&nbsp;</em>separately.</p>
