            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/next-generation-zero-update-last<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Systemic Reaction has announced that the next major&nbsp;<em>Generation Zero&nbsp;</em>update will serve as the game's final major content drop.</p>

<p>The Showdown Update currently doesn't have a release date, but Systemic Reaction describes it as&nbsp;<em>Generation Zero</em>'s "last hurrah", promising that it will conclude the story arc that's been running throughout the game's "main missions and in-game lore".</p>

<p>The update will take you to "a new area that you haven't been to before", and Systemic Reaction is promising that while it's not quite as big as some of the game's other areas, it will give the studio "the space needed to tell the last part of our story".</p>

<p>As well as the story coming to a head, Systemic Reaction is also promising that the update will add new Experimental weapons, and it'll also remove the skill point cap, allowing you to "unlock all skill upgrades and complete the endgame experience".</p>

<p>New cosmetics are also on the way, as well as a host of quality-of-life improvements and bug fixes that are the bread and butter of any self-respecting game update.</p>

<p>Although you won't need&nbsp;<em>Generation Zero</em>'s&nbsp;<em>FNIX Rising&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Alpine Unrest&nbsp;</em>expansions to enjoy the Showdown Update, Systemic Reaction does recommend them for "more context".</p>

<p>The game launched in 2019 and received numerous updates over the course of its life, adding features like a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/open-world-shooter-generation-zero-is-getting-photo-mode-next-week">photo mode</a>, destructible <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/generation-zero-update-lets-you-storm-fully-destructible-bases">bases</a>, and even a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/generation-zero-companion-update">cute little robot friend</a> to keep you company on your travels.</p>

<p>You can pick up&nbsp;<em>Generation Zero&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/704270/Generation_Zero/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/generation-zero/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 4</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/generation-zero/C20WW4W29FQ1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox One</a>, and it's also playable on current-gen consoles through backwards compatibility. The game will remain online, so even though it won't be getting more updates, it'll still be playable.</p>
