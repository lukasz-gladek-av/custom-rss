            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-circana-march-2025-sales<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>US analysis firm Circana has released its gaming sales data for March, and it probably won't come as a surprise that Ubisoft's latest major release&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>is leading the pack for the month.</p>

<p>According to Circana's Mat Piscatella over on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lniaufpggs26" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>,&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>topped the all-format sales chart for March, with new sports release&nbsp;<em>MLB: The Show 25&nbsp;</em>coming in second. Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>is in third, which isn't surprising given its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-10m" rel="nofollow">incredibly strong sales performance</a>.</p>

<p><em>Shadows&nbsp;</em>is also Xbox's top-selling game for the month, although it's pipped to the post on PlayStation by the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>MLB: The Show 25</em>. Since neither game launched on Switch, the honor for Nintendo's console goes instead to&nbsp;<em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-announced" rel="nofollow">recent remaster</a>.</p>

<p>Just in case you're wondering,&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>' March performance wasn't enough to give it the top spot in the year-to-date sales chart; that still belongs to&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, although&nbsp;<em>Shadows&nbsp;</em>is in a very respectable second place.</p>

<p>Hardware spending fell by 25% over last March, representing the lowest March total since 2019. Sony's PS5 was once again the market leader for both dollar and unit sales, with Xbox Series X|S coming in second on both measures.</p>

<p>Switch sales dropped by 37% when compared to last March, although that's almost certainly due in large part to consumers waiting for the Switch 2, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">launching in June this year</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-is-up-to-its-old-web3-tricks-again-with-might-magic-fates.1171311/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/might-and-magic-fates-blockchain-mobile<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has announced&nbsp;<em>Might &amp; Magic Fates</em>, a new free-to-play trading card game created in conjunction with blockchain studio Immutable, and yes, that does mean the game will have Web3 elements.</p>

<p>In an announcement <a href="https://x.com/MightMagicFates/status/1915033605266456909" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Ubisoft says&nbsp;<em>Might &amp; Magic Fates&nbsp;</em>will give you the opportunity to "collect and trade iconic cards", and that the game will offer the chance to "play for free [and] dominate with skill".</p>

<p>According to an <a href="https://www.mightandmagicfates.com/faqs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">FAQ</a> on&nbsp;<em>Fates</em>' official website, the game is a "strategic card game where every decision matters", and it'll involve building "powerful decks by combining creatures, spells, artifacts, buildings, and heroes" from across the&nbsp;<em>Might &amp; Magic&nbsp;</em>world.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/might-magic-fates-free-to-play-blockchain-art.jpg?itok=rpyoZYSk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/might-magic-fates-free-to-play-blockchain-art.jpg?itok=B-fKlTqA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Might &amp; Magic Fates&nbsp;</em>is another Web3-infused offering from Ubisoft.</figcaption></figure><p>Naturally, you'll be able to play&nbsp;<em>Might &amp; Magic Fates&nbsp;</em>online against other players, and Ubisoft promises the chance to build your collection either through earning rewards by playing the game or through "opening booster packs filled with cards of varying rarities".</p>

<p>If you're wondering where the Web3 elements come in, Ubisoft says the blockchain stuff in&nbsp;<em>Might &amp; Magic Fates&nbsp;</em>will be "optional" and will "unlock digital ownership for players who want it".</p>

<p>According to Ubisoft, that means you can "enjoy the full experience, grow your collection, and compete at the highest level" without ever having to touch&nbsp;<em>Fates</em>' Web3 elements, but if you want to, you can "freely trade your cards using the Immutable blockchain".</p>

<p>This is, of course, far from Ubisoft's first dalliance with Web3 gaming. In October last year, the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-nft-game" rel="nofollow">released the rather generically-named</a>&nbsp;<em>Champions Tactics: Grimoria Chronicles</em>, an NFT game that features figurines you can buy with your real-life hard-earned cash.</p>




<p>I'm not entirely sure that&nbsp;<em>Might &amp; Magic Fates&nbsp;</em>is going to be the thing to turn Ubisoft's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-financials-cost-cutting-q3" rel="nofollow">flagging fortunes</a> around, but then again, given that it's a blockchain game, I don't think Ubisoft is banking on it doing so either.</p>

<p><em>Might &amp; Magic Fates&nbsp;</em>has no release date yet, but when it launches, it'll arrive for mobile devices "with potential expansion to PC". Watch this space for more.</p>
