            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Soccer governing body FIFA, together with New York-based development studio Enver, has announced&nbsp;<em>FIFA Heroes</em>, a new 5v5 arcade-style soccer (or "football", for the enlightened) game coming to consoles and mobile next year.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>FIFA Heroes&nbsp;</em>will be "an arcade fast 5-a-side" game with "fantasy flair", and it'll feature iconic FIFA mascots, "football's biggest icons, and your favorite fictional characters from iconic TV shows and films".</p>

<p>Enver and FIFA are promising "dynamic physics and pitch-shattering power moves", so it's pretty clear that this isn't an&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC</em>-style realistic simulation, as if the larger-than-life cast list outlined above didn't already give the (beautiful) game away.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fifa-heroes-announced-phone.jpg?itok=TYDfcYDP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fifa-heroes-announced-phone.jpg?itok=EhoOALGC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>We don't know much about&nbsp;<em>FIFA Heroes</em>&nbsp;yet.</figcaption></figure><p>The game will feature both PvE and PvP play modes; Enver and FIFA say you'll be able to "tackle PvE before going head to head with your mates" across "arcade fast matches and challenges", which will also help you "progress your club through PvE career milestones".</p>

<p>If you're a football aficionado, you'll know that the World Cup next year is being held across three host countries, and each of those countries' mascots is represented here: Maple for Canada, Clutch for the US, and Zayu for Mexico.</p>

<p>They're just three of the playable characters in&nbsp;<em>FIFA Heroes</em>, each of whom will have "their own super abilities and special moves", although it's not clear whether that's true of all of the playables or just the mascots.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>FIFA Heroes&nbsp;</em>right here, although it's worth saying that it's more of a concept piece, since there's no identifiable gameplay in the trailer.</p>




<p><em>FIFA Heroes&nbsp;</em>is the latest officially-licensed&nbsp;<em>FIFA&nbsp;</em>game to be announced since EA decided to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-fifa-games-to-be-replaced-with-ea-sports-fc-next-year" rel="nofollow">part ways with the organization</a> back in 2022, changing the name of its iconic&nbsp;<em>FIFA&nbsp;</em>franchise to&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC</em>.</p>

<p>In October last year, FIFA <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fifa-konami-esports-partner" rel="nofollow">chose Konami as its new esports partner</a> following the split, although the governing body still hasn't chosen a flagship developer alongside whom to move forward with any kind of <i>EA Sports FC&nbsp;</i>competitor.</p>

<p>That has not, however, stopped FIFA from pursuing experiments in other areas, including the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fifa-announces-4-world-cup-blockchain-games" rel="nofollow">unveiling of a range of Web3-related games</a> to coincide with the 2022 Qatar World Cup. Will the same thing happen for next year's tournament? We can only wait and see.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ZA/UM Workers Form UK's First Official Gaming Union]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/disco-elysium-zaum-union</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/za-um-workers-form-uks-first-official-gaming-union.1314640/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Workers at&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>studio ZA/UM have unionized in the form of the newly-created Workers' Alliance, becoming the first officially-recognized UK gaming union into the bargain.</p>

<p>As reported by the folks at <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/after-layoffs-cancellations-and-controversy-zaum-uk-staff-unionise-as-the-workers-alliance" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, the ZA/UM Workers' Alliance will legally represent only a portion of the studio's overall workforce, since it only applies to the UK arm of a company that also has offices in Portugal and Finland.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, marketing manager Poppy Ingham says the union was set up in order to give employees "a seat at the table in the big management meetings". She says ZA/UM workers "like being here" and "want to continue being here", and she wants the studio to be "a collaborative project between the workers and management".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disco-elysium-zaum-uk-union-cuno.jpg?itok=mXP00FAu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disco-elysium-zaum-uk-union-cuno.jpg?itok=pYHZ5Aoj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>ZA/UM's only game so far is anarchic RPG&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Although the new union only represents UK employees at the moment, Ingham says meetings are "completely open" to employees from other ZA/UM branches, and that those employees can "feed in" on the Workers' Alliance's activities.</p>

<p>According to Ingham, ZA/UM management has agreed to negotiate and consult with Workers' Alliance on issues that "ensure the general safety and care of employees", including pay rates, holiday time, and working hours.</p>

<p>The formation of the union at ZA/UM follows the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/disco-elysium-developer-zaum-confirms-game-cancellation-and-layoffs" rel="nofollow">cancellation of a project at the studio</a> back in early 2024, which was itself accompanied by a round of layoffs. Ingham says it's these layoffs, "unfortunate" though they were, that "spurred [the remaining workers] on" to create Workers' Alliance.</p>

<p>ZA/UM has been racked with controversy since key figures Robert Kurvitz and Aleksander Rostov <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ousted-disco-elysium-devs-claim-fraud-studio-says-they-were-fired-over-misconduct/1100-6509090/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">departed the studio</a> in 2022, with both claiming their departures were a result of being forced out by unscrupulous investors.</p>




<p>Since then, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/longdue-hopetown-kickstarter-disco-elysium" rel="nofollow">number</a> of key&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-disco-elysium-devs-new-studios-spiritual-successors" rel="nofollow">personnel</a> have announced their own spiritual successors to the critically-acclaimed RPG.</p>

<p>Additionally, ZA/UM itself has also unveiled&nbsp;<em>Zero Parades - For Dead Spies&nbsp;</em>(which was probably <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zaum-project-c4-disco-elysium" rel="nofollow">formerly known as <em>Project C4</em></a>), a game that looks very much to be in the same realm as&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>.</p>
