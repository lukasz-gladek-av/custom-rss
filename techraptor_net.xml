            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo's financial results for the nine-month period of March through September last year is here, and the Switch 2 is paying dividends for the Japanese gaming giant.</p><p>According to a <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2026/260203_3e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">new presentation</a>, Switch 2 sales have now reached 17.37 million, which means the console has picked up another 11 million sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-financials-q1-2026" target="_blank" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="0df1a582-9b9c-40ce-97e3-524ba446cf4f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">since August last year</a>. That's not bad going, and I'm sure Nintendo will be pleased with that result.</p><p>Of course, in December, a report revealed that the Switch 2 had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-sales-wii-u-vita-dreamcast" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="91ebec60-06fa-4b54-b925-a0fb963092d1" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">already surpassed the lifetime sales of the Wii U</a>, so the fact that it's going from strength to strength in terms of sales numbers probably shouldn't come as too much of a surprise.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>The Switch 2 is doing well, as is <em>Mario Kart World</em>.</figcaption>

<p>Not only is the Switch 2 selling well, but the system's flagship racer <em>Mario Kart World </em>is racking up numbers for itself, too. Nintendo says the racing game has sold 14.03 million units, although that figure presumably includes bundles that pack the game in with the console as well.</p><p>In general, Nintendo's sales have risen by almost 100% when compared to the same period last year, although you'd expect that given the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c11b67d9-d8b1-4556-871d-041c5101dcf0" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">released a major console</a> in the months between March and December.</p><p>All of Nintendo's profit figures have risen to varying degrees as well, so all told, it's been a pretty good period for the gaming giant, although once again, that's to be expected given the Switch 2's meteoric rise.</p><p>With regard to other releases, <em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A </em>has managed to sell over 12 million copies between the Switch 2 and the original Switch, so that's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-a-sales" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2d5d3818-49a2-4447-89bf-e19e298fa0df" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">another six million or so</a> since the game's initial launch window.</p><figure role="group">

<p>The future looks bright for Nintendo right now, but a lot will depend on what else the company has planned for the Switch 2 lineup. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
