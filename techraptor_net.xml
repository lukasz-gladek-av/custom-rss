      <div><p>This past weekend, the Kickstarter campaign for <em>Zamanora: Ballad of the Witch</em> concluded. The campaign for this fantasy TTRPG, based on Balkan and Slavic folklore, was funded within 20 minutes of going life and ended with more than 10 times its goal.</p>



<p>According to its official campaign page, Zamanora: Ballad of the Witch is a TTRPG supplement heavily inspired by grim tales from Balkan and Slavic folklore. It's a supplement compatible with the current edition of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> and Son of Oak's hotly anticipated <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/legend-in-mist-is-2025s-most-anticipated-tabletop-roleplaying-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Legend in the Mist</em></a> system.</p>

The material includes new character options, locals, eerie magic items, spells, and monsters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition, the books contained detailed information on the land of Zamanora as well as prewritten adventure. In keeping with the grim tone, the books include new rules for vampirism, lycanthropy, and debilitating curses.</p>

<p>This culture influence extends to unique gameplay mechanics. Players can abjure evil spirits as a Kuker or hunt down terrors of the knight as a Krsnic. Imbue poppets with magical power or perform communal ceremonies to cast powerful spells. There's even a system tracking the creeping influence of the Hidden World on the real world, an influence that affects mind and body.</p>

<p>The pledge tiers of <em>Zamanora: Ballad of the Witch</em> Kickstarter campaign are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Digital PDFs for $44:</strong> Digital PDFs of the Core Book and Monsters &amp; Fables</li>
	<li><strong>Core Book for $53:</strong> Digital and Physical copy of the Core Book</li>
	<li><strong>All Digital for $83:</strong> Digital PDFs of the Core Book and Monsters &amp; Fables, Digital Assets and Tokens for VTTs, full support for Foundry VTT, and an STL file for the Baba Yaga miniature</li>
	<li><strong>The Slipcase for $105</strong>: Digital and Physical copies of the Core Book and Monsters &amp; Fables, GM Screen, and physical art prints</li>
	<li><strong>Core Box for $181:</strong> Everything in The Slipcase tier, a set of miniature standees, Forest Warden dice, and The Adventure Deck</li>
	<li><strong>Deluxe Box for $324:</strong> Everything in the Core Box and All Digital tier, A deluxe Hardcover copy of the Core Book and Monsters &amp; Fables book, monster deck, magic item cards, and Wayfarer's Journal</li>
	<li><strong>Collector's Box for $658:</strong> Everything from the Deluxe Box tier, signed copies of both core books, a handmade crochet doll of Oh, The Forest Warden, and a master print of the Baba Yaga miniature</li>
</ul><p>It must be noted that the developers address potential import costs for Zamanora: Ballad of the Witch in light of recent US <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/game-manufacturers-association-opposes-new-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">trade tariffs</a>. According to the campaign, all orders made in the US, Canada, Europe, and the UK will be handled within fulfillment centers in said countries. Which means import taxes should be no problem. You will still need to pay for shipping.</p>

<p>The campaign has raised&nbsp;<span><span>$327,152, which is more than ten times their initial funding goal of $</span></span><span><span><span>$21,905. You can still back the project at any tier at time of writing.</span></span></span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/nintendos-ego-is-likely-why-switch-2-welcome-tour-isnt-free<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It goes without saying that the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">Switch 2 showcase</a> and its announcements will be the biggest news of the year, but it was soured somewhat by an egotistical and elitist decision by Nintendo. They decided to make the greedy decision to charge money for what is nothing more than an interactive manual.</p>

<p><em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour </em>is a neat idea for a game to showcase the unique features of the Switch 2. You move a character around a huge Switch 2 to learn in message prompts and tech demos how everything works. A simple idea that I think most people would happily at least check out. We'd rather play something to show us what's new on Switch 2 than read about it, right?</p>

<h2><em>Welcome Tour</em> Is Certainly Not An <em>Astro's Playroom</em></h2>

<p>I am very down to screw around with whatever little clever demos Nintendo will have to show off the weird features that their first-party games will likely be the only ones to use. Pay for the privilege of participating in what is essentially marketing material though? Nintendo, you’re out of your mind.</p>

<p>The natural comparison is <em>Astro’s Playroom</em>, the free game that comes with every PlayStation 5. It shows off all the cool features of the DualSense controller in a cleverly designed platformer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I would have no problem paying for <em>Astro’s Playroom</em> at all, as there’s still the meat of a game to sink into even if I don’t care about the neat PlayStation easter eggs or DualSense showcases.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-welcome-tour-slideshow.jpg?itok=V2GdkJx3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-welcome-tour-slideshow.jpg?itok=cECsYTmk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you love PowerPoint, <em>Welcome Tour</em> may just be for you.</figcaption></figure><p>While I haven’t had a chance to check out <em>Welcome Tour</em> myself, there are <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2025/04/04/a-premium-instruction-manual" rel="nofollow">plenty of previews</a>&nbsp;from outlets that did have an opportunity. All come to a similar conclusion: <em>Welcome Tour </em>is not a game and no one knows what audience exists, if any, that would happily pay for it.</p>

<p>What makes this all even more baffling is that Nintendo had what is inarguably the greatest sales multiplier ever packed in for free in a console with <em>Wii Sports</em>. The Wii’s motion controls were novel and everyone had an immediate showcase of why they were so awesome. I bet a ton of homes still have a Wii hooked up and in use from time to time just for bowling.</p>

<p>Obviously, <em>Welcome Tour </em>doesn’t seem set up in the least to fill the same role as something like <em>Wii Sports</em>, but Nintendo has seen what free launch games can do. If this is nothing more than some mere marketing material in a snazzy presentation, I can’t quite understand the rationale to get to the decision to charge for it.</p>

<p>Maybe they see <em>Welcome Tour</em> as a mere curiosity that most aren't interested in so they want at least some return, where the potential value of getting something like <em>Wii Sports</em> into people's hands right away is readily understood. I refuse to believe that they think the attach rate for <em>Welcome Tour</em> will be all that high, though who knows what a company that seems to spin gold thinks about anything they create.</p>

<h2><em>Wii Sports</em> Was Free, So Why Not <em>Welcome Tour</em>?</h2>

<p>Nintendo hardly ever gives us insight into their decision making, design process, etc, though, so we'll never get a straight answer. They are pretty happy to go at their own pace and do their own thing. Obviously, it works out for them the majority of the time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We did get some insight from a book by Reggie Fils-Aimé, the former President of Nintendo of America, however. You can find an outline of the relevant <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/05/reggie-had-to-fight-for-wii-sports-as-a-pack-in-and-miyamoto-wasnt-happy" rel="nofollow">excerpt here from Nintendo Life</a>.</p>

<p>As a quick summary, Reggie and others, particularly from Nintendo of America, were making the argument to include <em>Wii Sports </em>as a free pack-in with the Wii to then President of Nintendo, Satoru Iwata. Obviously, their arguments won out in the end, but there was strong disagreement from legendary designer Shigeru Miyamoto, creator of <em>Mario</em>, <em>Zelda</em>, <em>Kirby</em>, and more.</p>

<p>Miyamoto is quoted as saying, “We do not give away our software,” citing the difficulty that comes in creating games.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nitnendo-welcome-tour-golf-minigame.jpg?itok=eh4zfmEv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nitnendo-welcome-tour-golf-minigame.jpg?itok=6tePiPSB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Wii Sports</em> had golf, too, just a whole lot more of it.</figcaption></figure><p>In this context with <em>Wii Sports</em>, I am completely sympathetic to Miyamoto’s position here. Obviously, any game, particularly one trying to introduce a whole new way for players to interact with games, is incredibly hard to make well. I think Miyamoto and Nintendo’s track record overall speaks for itself in just how seriously they take making games and making them extremely well.</p>

<p>To toss in a game for free despite all of the hard work, sacrifice, and effort that it took to get it made in the first place? I can see why someone on the creative side like Miyamoto would be annoyed. It can easily come across as a devaluation of game designers’ work overall.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Getting back to <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour,</em> well, it’s no <em>Wii Sports</em>, <em>Astro’s Playroom</em>, or even <em>Nintendo Land</em> for that matter.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Welcome Tour</em> is a virtual tour that looks more like a museum exhibit with PowerPoint presentations and minigames (emphasis on the mini) scattered throughout. As a real-life exhibit to showcase anything from Nintendo, that sounds pretty rad. A game from the company that emphasizes fun in all aspects of their game design that amounts to pretty basic edutainment is certainly not comparable.</p>

<h2>Not Everything You Touch is Gold, Nintendo</h2>

<p>So, Miyamoto and Nintendo overall, I totally stand with you on the righteous side of properly valuing the hard work of creatives. <em>Welcome Tour</em> just isn’t that, though, is it?</p>

<p>That is not to discount the hard work that went into its creation, however. But this is not a piece of software you're selling, it's an interactive instruction manual that should be categorized as marketing more than anything. Consumers aren't scrambling to pay for obvious ads, though. People don’t pay a premium to have ads put back into their services, right?</p>

<p>While Miyamoto’s quote above wasn’t about <em>Welcome Tour</em>, it’s hard not to see its potential influence in such a weird decision here. The arrogance to believe that this is in the same realm as something like a new <em>Mario </em>game is ego gone too far—this is just souped-up marketing material if Nintendo is being honest with themselves.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I hope Nintendo reevaluates their position on this one, but it doesn’t seem like people will miss much if they don’t feel like shelling out for it anyway.</p>
