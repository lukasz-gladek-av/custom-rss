            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-ea-second-most-played-game-steam<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA and Hazelight Studios' latest release&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>has already climbed its way through the publisher's Steam charts, and the co-op action-adventure game is now the second most-played EA game on the platform.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2001120/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>,&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>'s 24-hour Steam player peak sits at 197,434, which is pretty impressive; it's more than double what predecessor&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two&nbsp;</em>achieved, and that game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hazelight-josef-fares-new-ip-it-takes-two-sales" rel="nofollow">phenomenally successful in sales terms</a>.</p>

<p>The figure puts&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>in second place, and while that's certainly an achievement Hazelight and Josef Fares can celebrate, I don't think&nbsp;the game has a hope of beating the first-place record holder given that it's battle royale FPS&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends</em>.</p>

<p>Still, the same is true of&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two</em>, so it's still a fair point of comparison in my books. It's fair to say that EA and Hazelight have a hit on their hands with&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>, and I wouldn't be surprised if the numbers climb even higher over the weekend.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>, it's the latest game from&nbsp;<em>A Way Out&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two&nbsp;</em>developer Hazelight Studios, headed up by industry iconoclast and noted Oscars hater Josef Fares.</p>

<p>The game sees you and a friend (it doesn't support single-player, much like the aforementioned games) playing as Mio and Zoe, two writers who find themselves sucked into the worlds they've created and looking for a way out.</p>




<p>Much like&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two</em>,&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>features a variety of co-op-focused activities, including platforming, combat, and various wacky setpieces. It's pretty much exactly what you'd expect from a Hazelight game, it seems to me.</p>

<p><em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>is available now for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/killing-floor-3-delayed-now-arriving-sometime-later-this-year.1128228/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/killing-floor-3-delayed-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Tripwire Interactive has announced that upcoming multiplayer-focused zombie shooter&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</em>has been delayed, and the game has no new specific release date.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1430190/view/499441143215293470" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message</a> on Steam, Tripwire says the decision to delay the game was made following feedback it received from&nbsp;a recent closed beta period. That feedback made Tripwire realize it had "missed the mark" with regards to&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3</em>.</p>

<p>According to Tripwire, the delay will afford the development team time to address some of the most pressing issues raised during the closed beta, including "performance/stability, UI/UX, lighting, and weapon feel". Those are some pretty fundamental issues.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/killing-floor-3-delayed-zeds.jpg?itok=ImxiDZCp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/killing-floor-3-delayed-zeds.jpg?itok=fDxNUMMj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</em>needs a little more time in the oven, Tripwire says.</figcaption></figure><p>Tripwire goes on to say that it has the "full support" of its parent company Embracer Group when it comes to addressing these issues, which will come as a relief given that the game was listed as one of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-2m-two-weeks" rel="nofollow">cornerstones of Embracer's 2025 lineup</a>.</p>

<p>The developer says it doesn't know which of these issues will be fixed by the time of&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3</em>'s launch, but that an update which will let you select your perk class and character independently "is planned for post-release".</p>

<p>The studio closes by saying that it intends to show "a more polished version of&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3</em>" later down the line, and that more information is coming "when [Tripwire is] ready to share more details".</p>

<p>This is where I'd normally trot out that misattributed Miyamoto quote about a rushed game being bad and a delayed game being good, but given that Tripwire doesn't seem to be able to promise all of the aforementioned issues will be fixed by launch, I'm not sure it's appropriate here.</p>




<p>In case you need a reminder,&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</em>is the third major installment in the&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor&nbsp;</em>series of zombie-slaying shooters.</p>

<p>The game was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/killing-floor-3-release-date" rel="nofollow">slated for release this month</a>, but it now seems we'll have to wait a while before we learn exactly when it's coming. When it eventually does arrive,&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</em>will launch for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1430190/Killing_Floor_3/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/killing-floor-3/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/killing-floor-3/9pfzlckhc1vm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.&nbsp;</p>
