            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has announced new sales milestones for&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>DLC, as well as the experimental multiplayer spinoff&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, and they're both doing very well indeed.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1948382858109698175" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on social media, the studio reveals that&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>has reached the 10 million sales mark, which means it's doubled its sales count in the year or so since it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-sales" rel="nofollow">hit five million in its first week</a>.</p>

<p>Since base&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>sales were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-30m" rel="nofollow">sitting at around 30 million</a> at last count, that means around a third of all&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>players have checked out&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, which is a pretty impressive adoption rate for DLC.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-nightreign-sales-scadutree.jpg?itok=R2fa6NYk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-nightreign-sales-scadutree.jpg?itok=ki7xoilj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>DLC has done very well for itself, as has spinoff&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, meanwhile, has hit the five million sales mark, so it's amassed another 1.5 million sales since passing the 3.5 million milestone <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-confirmed-sales" rel="nofollow">back in June</a>.</p>

<p>Sales of&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>may only be a fraction of its bigger brother's, but it's worth remembering that&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>isn't a mainline FromSoftware Soulslike; rather, it's an experimental spinoff that draws from roguelikes,&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>, and games like&nbsp;<em>Risk of Rain</em>, so these sales are still pretty impressive.</p>

<p>Indeed,&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>sold well enough to keep both Nintendo Switch 2 launch title&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>and Hideo Kojima trip&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach&nbsp;</em>from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/circana-june-2025-us-gaming-sales-data" rel="nofollow">all-format top spot in June</a>, so Bandai Namco has plenty of reason to feel smug.</p>

<p>The franchise's future is looking pretty rosy as well; back in May, a live-action movie helmed by&nbsp;<em>Ex Machina&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Annihilation&nbsp;</em>filmmaker Alex Garland <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-movie" rel="nofollow">was announced</a>, so there's even more&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>around the corner.</p>

The studio is currently hard at work on&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods</em>, a PvPvE game coming <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-duskbloods-fromsoftware-nintendo-switch-2" rel="nofollow">exclusively to Nintendo Switch 2</a> (yes, you read that right) next year.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-bandai-namco-stake</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-buys-2-5-stake-in-bandai-namco-for-anime-manga-and-more.1252167/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has announced that it has acquired a 2.5% stake in Bandai Namco, with a view to "expanding the fan community for IP such as anime and manga around the world".</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/News/Press/202507/25-0724E/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a>, Sony says the goal with regards to acquiring this stake in the&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Tekken&nbsp;</em>studio is "strengthening engagement, particularly in the anime field", an area in which Sony expects "rapid market growth".</p>

<p>Sony acknowledges its previous collaborations with Bandai Namco, but the company says it wants to expand these efforts beyond "games, anime, and music" into a "broader range of areas", including merchandising, "experiential entertainment", and more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-bandai-namco-sony.jpg?itok=QC0DJ8qA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-bandai-namco-sony.jpg?itok=TNjrlYyq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bandai Namco is perhaps best-known as the publisher of smash hit action RPG&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that this isn't specifically a gaming-related investment; this is the wider Sony corporation investing in Bandai Namco Holdings rather than Bandai Namco Entertainment, so it doesn't just pertain to the latter's video game output.</p>

<p>However, since Sony and Bandai Namco seem focused on the anime and manga part of this partnership, it's entirely possible we'll see some new anime or manga adaptations of Bandai Namco's best-known works.</p>

<p>One particularly obvious addition to that catalog would seem to be&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>, which is arguably crying out for an anime adaptation; I'm not a huge fan of the idea of any visual reimagining of FromSoftware's work, but it makes a lot more sense than the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-movie" rel="nofollow">recently-revealed live-action movie</a>.</p>

<p>Other Bandai Namco properties, like&nbsp;<em>Tekken</em>, the&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>series, and perhaps even&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares&nbsp;</em>could be prime candidates for anime and manga adaptation, but of course, we'll have to wait and see what comes of this partnership to find out whether any of those are on the cards.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/little-nightmares-3-bandai-namco-sony.jpg?itok=WPKotqZC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/little-nightmares-3-bandai-namco-sony.jpg?itok=E_2hJc_A 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Could a&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares&nbsp;</em>anime adaptation be on the cards?</figcaption></figure><p>This news comes just a couple of months after Bandai Namco <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bandai-namco-sales-2024-25" rel="nofollow">celebrated a strong year</a> in sales terms, with profits almost doubling on the previous year. That success likely comes as a result of the strong performance of 2024 releases like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-sales" rel="nofollow">Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-sales-5m" rel="nofollow"><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</em></a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has revealed&nbsp;<em>Wisdom of Sea and Sky</em>, the next major expansion for digital trading card game&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>, and it's coming to Android and iOS next week.</p>

<p>As revealed in a new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Wisdom of Sea and Sky&nbsp;</em>will arrive on July 29th. This looks to be a full expansion along the lines of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-celestial-guardians-set" rel="nofollow">Celestial Guardians</a>&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-update-new-expansion-release-date" rel="nofollow"><em>Space-Time Smackdown</em></a>, rather than a themed booster pack like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-extradimensional-crisis" rel="nofollow"><em>Extradimensional Crisis</em></a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-eevee-grove" rel="nofollow"><em>Eevee Grove</em></a>.</p>

<p>As you've probably guessed, the expansion is based around the Generation 2 legendaries Ho-Oh and Lugia, who will be making their debut in&nbsp;<em>Wisdom of Sea and Sky</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-wisdom-of-sea-and-sky-ho-oh-lugia.jpg?itok=euI8PCH9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-wisdom-of-sea-and-sky-ho-oh-lugia.jpg?itok=vWoWbzGZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ho-Oh and Lugia will make their debut in next week's&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>expansion&nbsp;<em>Wisdom of Sea and Sky</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>They'll be joined by the three Gen 2 starters Chikorita, Cyndaquil, and Totodile, who are all represented by frankly adorable artwork. If you're a fan of the Gen 2 starters and want to see Chikorita and Totodile ahead of their&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-release-date-pokemon-presents" rel="nofollow">appearance in October</a>, this one's for you (sorry, Cyndaquil fans).</p>

<p>You can also look forward to the likes of a full art Pichu card, as well as new cards for Gen 2 stalwarts like Cleffa, the infamous red Gyarados that plays a key role in Gen 2's storyline, and more.</p>

<p>Eeveelutions Umbreon and Espeon will be getting new ex cards, and, of course, new Trainer cards will be making an appearance, including Supporters Lyra and Silver, as well as the new Rescue Scarf and Elemental Switch items.</p>

<p>If you want to get a sense for <em>Wisdom of Sea and Sky</em>'s theming and check out some of its new card art, you can do so right here via the expansion's trailer. I'm warning you, though: those starters really are dangerously cute.</p>




<p><em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>is available to download and play for free right now on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.pokemon.pokemontcgp&amp;hl=en_GB" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pok%C3%A9mon-tcg-pocket/id6479970832" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">iOS</a>.&nbsp;<em>Wisdom of Sea and Sky&nbsp;</em>arrives across both systems on July 29th.</p>
