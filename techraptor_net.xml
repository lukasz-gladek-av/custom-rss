            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crash-team-racing-nitro-fueled-10m-sales<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Activision has announced that&nbsp;<em>Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled&nbsp;</em>has reached a brand new sales milestone, but unfortunately, it looks like there's still no PC port on the horizon.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/CrashBandicoot/status/1934657226846724255" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on social media, the publisher says that the game has sold ten million units around the world, which naturally includes both physical and digital shipments. It also accounts for all three platforms on which the game is available.</p>

<p>Sadly, it looks as though Activision's appreciation for the game starts and ends with its sales figures; there's no accompanying announcement of a PC version for the game, nor is there any word of whether performance improvements will be implemented for newer-gen consoles.</p>

<p>Revealed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/game-awards-2018-crash-team-racing-nitro-fueled-revealed-updated" rel="nofollow">during the 2018 Game Awards</a>,&nbsp;<em>Nitro-Fueled&nbsp;</em>is somewhere between a remake and a remaster; it includes a full visual overhaul for the game, as well as tweaks to its gameplay, but otherwise, it hews pretty faithfully to the original&nbsp;<em>CTR</em>.</p>

<p>As well as all of the tracks from the original game,&nbsp;<em>Nitro-Fueled&nbsp;</em>also includes extra tracks and characters from sequels&nbsp;<em>Crash Nitro Kart&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;Crash Tag Team Racing</i>. Of course, since we can't have all nice things all the time, it also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crash-team-racings-second-grand-prix-brings-microtransactions-despite-past-promises" rel="nofollow">came complete with microtransactions</a>.</p>

<p>Updates for&nbsp;<em>Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/there-wont-be-another-crash-team-racing-nitro-fueled-update-beenox-says" rel="nofollow">came to an end in late 2020</a>, meaning no new tracks or characters have been added since then. It seems that Activision is content to allow&nbsp;<em>Nitro-Fueled&nbsp;</em>to remain in its current state, and also for PC players to miss out on it entirely.</p>
