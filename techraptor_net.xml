I'm sure Valve will be thrilled.</p><p>As spotted by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/morwull.bsky.social/post/3mbm57ds7yk27" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Bluesky user Alejandro LL</a>, Steam has broken its concurrent user (CCU) count record again, managing to reach a whopping 41.816 million users online at the same time and leaping past <a href="https://www.kitguru.net/gaming/joao-silva/steam-smashes-concurrent-player-record-with-over-41-million-users-online/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">October's record high</a> into the bargain.</p><p>Not only that, but a new record of users concurrently in games on Steam has been set as well, with that figure reaching almost 13.4 million as compared to March's 13.2 million record. Admittedly, these numbers aren't huge jumps, but they're still the highest on record.</p><figure role="group">

<p>As for why the record has been smashed, Valve almost certainly owes that to the ongoing Steam Winter Sale, which ends today at 10am Pacific and which features huge discounts on a number of popular games (as well as smaller discounts on newer or more evergreen titles).</p><p>Since many of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steam-best-of-2025" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="506dd7fd-a10c-4745-bcb4-ef7cfe0636c8" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">2025's best-selling games</a> on Steam are live-service titles as well, it's not unreasonable to assume that players are flocking to those games over the holiday period, which is probably why the concurrent in-game player count record has been broken too.</p><p>This news comes after what has been a rather checkered year for Steam, with Valve facing challenges from the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/horses-steam-ban-indie-horror" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a4a11cd5-8771-4a5c-86ba-ff196e272f59" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Horses </em>developer Santa Ragione</a>, No More Robots' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-more-robots-review-flag-rejection-valve" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5b8f68ae-5137-4e39-9011-498f4b4b7c21" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Mike Rose</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vile-exhumed-steam-removed-sexual-content" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3d619c44-1572-4d4c-9fdf-64af4c3b37db" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Vile: Exhumed</em>'s Cara Cadaver</a> over what appear to be contradictory censorship policies that seem to ignore important context.</p><p>With that said, legendary <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rance-series-coming-to-steam" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7bdd01fa-043a-41f0-af9b-a0305684ffa0" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">eroge series <em>Rance</em></a><em> </em>is about to make its Steam debut, albeit in what will probably end up being a heavily censored form subsidized with a patch downloadable from its publisher's website.
