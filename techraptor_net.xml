            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-xbox-port-series-s<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>producer Feng Ji has stated that the reason the game's Xbox port has been such a long time coming has to do with the Xbox Series S' memory limitations.</p>

<p>In a post on <a href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5118097780121223" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Chinese social media platform Weibo</a> (for which we're using machine translation), Feng Ji says that the Series S' 10GB of shared memory would make a&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>port impossible without "several years of optimization experience".</p>

<p>That's despite Microsoft itself <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-xbox-delay-not-due-to-platform-limitations-microsoft-reiterates" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">stating back in September</a> that "platform limitations" were not the reason behind the game's Xbox delay, sparking rumors that the game was subject to an undisclosed exclusivity deal between Sony and developer GameScience.</p>

The producer and GameScience CEO is garnering something of a reputation for controversial statements.</p>

<p>Around the time of the Game Awards, Feng Ji <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/black-myth-wukong-game-science-ceo-the-game-awards-criticized-game-of-the-year-loss/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">criticized the ceremony</a> for not awarding&nbsp;<em>Wukong&nbsp;</em>the prestigious Game of the Year prize, which instead went to PlayStation platformer&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em>. He said he'd prepared his acceptance speech two years prior and seemingly wrote that he "came here for nothing".</p>

<p>This time around, Feng Ji could either be calling out the Series S for its memory limitations or describing his own team's lack of optimization experience, both of which seem to be contributing to the&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>Xbox port being so long in the making.</p>

<p>Either way, it looks like we're not going to be seeing&nbsp;<em>Wukong&nbsp;</em>gracing the Xbox anytime soon, unfortunately. Better make do with the PC or PS5 versions for now.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>, it's an action-adventure game with Soulslike elements developed by Chinese studio GameScience.</p>

<p>The game is heavily inspired by the classical Chinese novel&nbsp;<em>Journey to the West</em>, although it's not a direct retelling of that story. Instead, it tells the tale of the Destined One, a simian warrior who must ascend to claim the monkey king Wukong's mantle.</p>

<p><em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>proved massively popular on release, topping the Steam charts <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-24-hour-player-count" rel="nofollow">within a handful of hours</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-expansion-sales-18m" rel="nofollow">passing the 18 million sales milestone</a> just a few weeks after its initial release.</p>

<p>You can check the game out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2358720/Black_Myth_Wukong/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/black-myth-wukong/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>. Whether or not it eventually does land on Xbox seems to be a matter for debate at the moment, so while you wait, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/black-myth-wukong-review-serious-monkey-business" rel="nofollow">check out my review</a> to see what I thought of&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>.</p>
