            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/spectre-divide-mountaintop-studios-shutting-down<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mountaintop Studios has announced that its free-to-play first-person shooter&nbsp;<em>Spectre Divide&nbsp;</em>is to shut down soon, and that the studio itself will also be closing its doors.</p>

<p>Per a news <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2641470/view/544477779605849692" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Steam,&nbsp;<em>Spectre Divide&nbsp;</em>will cease service "within the next 30 days". Mountaintop will also be disabling any new in-game purchases and refunding any money players have spent since the launch of the game's first season a couple of weeks ago.</p>

<p>The studio says that this season's launch "hasn't achieved the level of success [it] needed to sustain the game and keep Mountaintop afloat", so not only will the game be stopping service, but the studio will be shutting down "at the end of this week".</p>

<p>However, the studio says it hasn't "seen enough active players and incoming revenue" to cover either the game's operation or the day-to-day running of the company, and that it's "stretched [its] remaining capital as far as [it] could".</p>

<p>The studio goes on to say that it's tried everything, from finding a new publisher through seeking additional investment and even "an acquisition", but that "in the end, we weren't able to make it work".</p>

<p><em>Spectre Divide</em>'s situation is sad, but it's far from unique. Just a week or two ago, Phoenix Labs announced its&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter</em>-style action RPG&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dauntless-shutting-down-in-may" rel="nofollow">will shut down in May</a>, and it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-shuts-down-two-studios-including-concord-creator" rel="nofollow">not just smaller studios either</a>.</p>




<p>Mountaintop's closure is also part of a wider industry wave that has seen studios like&nbsp;<em>Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monolith-productions-and-more-reportedly-closed-by-wb-games" rel="nofollow">Monolith</a>, the Seattle-based <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-40m" rel="nofollow"><i>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</i>division of NetEase</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing" rel="nofollow">multiple Ubisoft branches</a>&nbsp;affected.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XVI Sales Are Apparently Sitting at Around 3.5m]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xvi-sales-3-5m</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-xvi-sales-are-apparently-sitting-at-around-3-5m.1133301/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xvi-sales-3-5m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report has emerged which claims that&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI&nbsp;</em>sales are sitting at around 3.5 million, a figure that seemingly encapsulates the game's sales on both PC and PlayStation 5.</p>

<p>This figure comes via analyst <a href="https://kabutan.jp/news/marketnews/?b=n202503130535" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Hideki Yasuda</a> (note: article is in Japanese, so we're using machine translation), who cites recent comments by Square Enix head Takashi Kiryu during a financial results briefing call.</p>

<p>As a reminder, Square Enix said back in September that both&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-16-rebirth-profits-square-enix" rel="nofollow">had not met its "expectations"</a> with regards to sales, so it looks as though the company was expecting more than the 3.5 million figure quoted here.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-xvi-sales-3.5m-combat.jpg?itok=jEyBIo1l 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-xvi-sales-3.5m-combat.jpg?itok=tR3RIhS1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Final Fantasy XVI&nbsp;</em>sales are apparently sitting at around 3.5 million.</figcaption></figure><p>Yasuda also reiterates that&nbsp;the&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest 3&nbsp;</em>remake <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-outsold-expectations" rel="nofollow">outsold expectations</a>, calling the game a "huge hit" and pointing to its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">two million sales</a> (at last count; that figure may well have increased since then).</p>

<p>It's been almost two years since&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI&nbsp;</em>was released, and a few days after the game's initial launch in June 2023, Square Enix said it had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xvi-shipments" rel="nofollow">shipped three million copies</a>.</p>

<p>However, it's important to note that "shipments" and "sales" aren't necessarily the same thing; it is, after all, entirely possible that not all of those three million copies were sold to customers, at least initially.</p>

<p>Assuming all of those copies were indeed sold, that would mean&nbsp;<em>FFXVI&nbsp;</em>has picked up another half a million sales for itself since launch, which isn't particularly impressive given that it's a mainline&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>game with a (presumably) pretty hefty budget behind it.</p>




<p>If you're not up to speed with&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>, it's the latest mainline installment in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>series (although it's far from the sixteenth actual game in the franchise).</p>

<p>The game revolves around Clive Rosfield, a man who must navigate a world of political intrigue and strife while also coming to terms with a burgeoning power he shouldn't have.&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI&nbsp;</em>moves further away from the series' RPG roots; it's essentially a character action-style game rather than a JRPG.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI&nbsp;</em>right now on PC and PlayStation 5. If you want to know what our Andrew Stretch thought of the game, you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/final-fantasy-xvi-review" rel="nofollow">check out his review here</a>.</p>
