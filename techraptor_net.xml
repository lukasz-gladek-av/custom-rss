You'll be getting a refund either way; the two studios say "all players" who bought <em>King of Meat </em>will get their money back "in the coming weeks".</p><figure role="group">

</figure>
<p>As of yesterday, it's no longer possible to buy <em>King of Meat </em>on any storefront, and you can't buy in-game Stamps either, so if you don't own the game, you've missed your chance to check it out.</p><p>However, there's a silver lining if you did buy <em>King of Meat</em>; not only will you be entitled to a full refund for the game, but the Stamp packs you purchased will also be refunded. You can, of course, also continue to spend Stamps you do have on in-game content if you want.</p><p><em>King of Meat </em>represents the latest game to fall foul of Amazon Game Studios' chopping block. It follows the likes of MMO <em>New World</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazons-ill-fated-mmo-new-world-to-shut-down-next-year" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fa9fca01-ebe1-4d7d-9d03-0b8eab5c442a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">shutting down next year</a>, and ill-fated hero shooter <em>Crucible</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazon-takes-crucible-off-life-support-and-kills-it" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9b063179-6c1f-4568-bfca-bb65e787d1f1" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">shut down in the same year it was released</a>.</p><p>In general, it looks like Amazon is pivoting away from the kind of full-throated development represented by <em>King of Meat</em>, <em>Crucible</em>, and <em>New World</em>, and towards more casual experiences like its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazon-luna-rework-later-this-year" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a4199f9c-3f78-478b-b2f3-b566d7133e1b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">recently-redesigned Amazon Luna service</a>.</p>
<p>This is usually where I'd tell you where you can check out <em>King of Meat</em>, but, well, you can't anymore. If you did already buy it, though, the game will remain online until April 9th.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
