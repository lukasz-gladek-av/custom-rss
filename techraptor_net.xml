            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega and Monolith's classic survival horror game&nbsp;<em>Condemned: Criminal Origins&nbsp;</em>has been delisted from digital storefronts, and no reason has been given by the publisher as to why this has happened.</p>

<p>As spotted by Wario64 <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:knj5sw5al3sukl6vhkpi7637/post/3m4iwmggyjz2s" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">over on Bluesky</a>,&nbsp;<em>Condemned&nbsp;</em>was taken down from Steam and the Xbox storefront on Halloween. In case you're wondering, it's not available via GOG either, having not been added to that platform's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gog-preservation-program" rel="nofollow">excellent Preservation Program</a> yet.</p>

<p>Sega hasn't given any kind of official statement regarding the reason for the game's delisting, and since Monolith was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monolith-productions-and-more-reportedly-closed-by-wb-games" rel="nofollow">shuttered by parent company Warner Bros</a> back in February this year, the developer isn't available to comment on the situation either.</p>

<p>The game features a mix of tense action-horror combat and exploration, detective mechanics, and mild survival elements. It's a real classic, although I suppose we now have to describe it as a "lost" classic, since it's not available for purchase anymore.</p>

<p>It's possible, of course, that Sega is gearing up to announce a remaster of the game, perhaps alongside <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nightdive-the-thing-remaster-tease" rel="nofollow">remaster</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nightdive-shares-update-on-system-shock-remake-release" rel="nofollow">remake</a> connoisseurs Nightdive. That could just be wishful thinking on my part, though; it's equally possible that the game has disappeared for some arcane rights-related reason.</p>

<p><em>Condemned: Criminal Origins&nbsp;</em>was followed up by a sequel,&nbsp;<em>Condemned 2: Bloodshot</em>, which, unlike its predecessor, was ported to the PlayStation 3 as well as releasing for the Xbox 360. This one, however, never appeared on PC.</p>

<p>For the time being, sadly, it looks like you'll have to fall back on your physical copy of&nbsp;<em>Condemned: Criminal Origins&nbsp;</em>on Xbox 360 if you want to play it. Hopefully, a remaster or remake is announced soon.</p>
