            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report has emerged which claims that Ubisoft is currently working on a&nbsp;<em>Rayman&nbsp;</em>remake, that said remake is tentatively scheduled for next year, and that a fourth mainline&nbsp;<em>Rayman&nbsp;</em>game is also in development.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-future-of-rayman-games-ubisoft/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Insider Gaming's Tom Henderson</a>&nbsp;(who, as per, cites "those familiar with the game's development"), the&nbsp;<em>Rayman&nbsp;</em>remake is "tentatively targeting a late 2026 release date", and it's going "incredibly well".</p>

<p>That project is joined by&nbsp;<em>Rayman 4&nbsp;</em>(which almost certainly won't be its final name), which, according to Henderson, is currently in the preliminary planning stages. Henderson's sources apparently say that&nbsp;<em>Rayman 4</em>'s existence will depend on whether the&nbsp;<em>Rayman&nbsp;</em>remake does well.</p>

<p>Producer Loic Gounon says that fans shouldn't expect news from Ubisoft on what's in the works for&nbsp;<em>Rayman&nbsp;</em>"too soon", but reassures those hopeful for a new&nbsp;<em>Rayman&nbsp;</em>game by saying the franchise is "in good hands".</p>

<p>Of course, Gounon's comments don't confirm Henderson's report; for all we know, the&nbsp;<em>Rayman&nbsp;</em>remake could be canceled at a moment's notice, especially if recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/contraband-canceled-report-avalanche-studios" rel="nofollow">cancellations</a> elsewhere in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioshock-remake-canceled-bioshock-4-story-report" rel="nofollow">industry</a> are <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">anything to go by</a>.</p>

<p>Still, it's nice to know that&nbsp;<em>Rayman&nbsp;</em>remains in Ubisoft's thoughts. Let's just hope the studio chooses to revive him in a form marginally less offensive than his appearance in that one <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-nft-game-captain-laserhawk-rayman" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">really weird NFT game</a> from late last year.</p>

More at eleven.</figcaption></figure><p>As Gounon says, it's likely to be some time before we hear anything more about Ubisoft's plans for&nbsp;<em>Rayman</em>, so you'll have to stay tuned for that.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the series' latest mainline title,&nbsp;<em>Rayman Legends</em>, is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/242550/Rayman_Legends/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0001-CUSA00069_00-RAYMANLEGENDS001" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS4</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/rayman-legends/C26K4DVGR45B" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox One</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/rayman-legends-definitive-edition-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> (as well as all of those machines' successors thanks to backwards compatibility), and if you haven't played it yet, you really should.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom president Haruhiro Tsujimoto has blamed something he calls the "PS5 barrier" for slowing&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>sales, suggesting that the console and its ancillary purchases are at least partly responsible for the game's underperformance in recent months.</p>

<p>In an interview with <a href="https://xtrend.nikkei.com/atcl/contents/18/01186/00001/?wovn=en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nikkei</a> (as spotted by ResetEra user <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/capcom-president-regarding-building-upon-wilds-initial-sales-we-found-that-the-ps5-barrier-is-unexpectedly-large-ps5-the-main-platform-for-mhw.1285902/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">DriftingSpirit</a>; we're using machine translation for the interview), Tsujimoto says that&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' "main platform" is the PS5, but that the "barrier" for this platform is "unexpectedly large".</p>

<p>He says that the console costs around 80,000 yen in Japan (which works out at around $540), but that when adding "software and monthly subscriptions", that cost can reach about 100,000 yen (roughly $670). This, Tsujimoto says, is "not an amount that can be easily reached, especially for younger generations".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-ps5-barrier-capcom-eating.jpg?itok=VUUTLu7G 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-ps5-barrier-capcom-eating.jpg?itok=wDvpE_4i 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' slowing sales are at least partly down to the "PS5 barrier", according to Capcom.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Tsujimoto, this situation isn't unique to Japan, but is "similar overseas as well". Relatedly, Sony <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-5-price-hike-us" rel="nofollow">increased prices for the PS5</a> in the US back in August, with all three major models of the console affected by the price hike.</p>

<p>Tsujimoto says that "sales will begin in the future", presumably pointing to discounts for&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>on the horizon. He also says the Switch 2's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-financials-q1-2026" rel="nofollow">successful launch</a> at around 50,000 yen proves the "high level of cost-consciousness among ordinary consumers".</p>

<p>It's telling that Tsujimoto doesn't make reference to any of the other factors that might be causing&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>sales to slow down.</p>

<p>Players have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-optimizations-winter" rel="nofollow">complained</a>, for instance, about the game's lackluster PC performance and lack of endgame content, prompting Capcom to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-endgame-august" rel="nofollow">move its plans for the latter forward</a> to an earlier patch in August and to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-optimizations-winter" rel="nofollow">promise more PC optimizations this winter</a>.</p>




<p>It's entirely possible that word-of-mouth regarding these problems has put some players off buying the game, so perhaps when Capcom addresses these issues, sales might pick up. Of course, discounts in major storefront sales won't hurt, either.</p>
