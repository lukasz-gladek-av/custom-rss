            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>More Magic: The Gathering Spider-Man was shown off at PAX West, and we had the chance to attend a press briefing to learn more about the upcoming set launching next month.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Before we get to the cards, there is a new official draft called Pick-Two Draft. Instead of the normal eight players, you'll only need four. And instead of picking one card, you'll pick two. This makes the matches quicker, and you can play it officially at your local game store after Spider-Man's launch.</p>



<p>So far, most of the revealed cards for the Spider-Man set have been focused on the good guys, and now we’re getting an opportunity to check out a lot of the iconic Spider-Man villains.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This particular iteration of The Sinister Six on Beyond the Sinister Six! shown below&nbsp;features the original cast of villains when the group first formed in the comics. There's plenty of venom shenanigans and more too.</p>

<h2>Spider-Man Bonus Sheet Cards&nbsp;</h2>

<p>We also had a chance to see what the bonus sheet cards will be for the set. They feature some iconic comic moments from all over Spider-Man's history, often with art from artists who actually worked on the Spider-Man comics.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Along with some new art from some Marvel artists, there will be plenty of iconic images from comic panels and covers throughout the set. Expect to see plenty of Jack Kirby, Todd McFarlanae, John Romita Sr., and a whole lot more. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>See Some Iconic Spidey Suits&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Spectacular Spider-Man is one of the central cards in the set and the Magic team has taken the opportunity to show off some iconic and maybe some more obscure spidey suits.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All of them are the same card mechanically, but feature different art with new suits. The backgrounds are even in the same location, but the time of day or season may be different.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Some More Spider-Man Showcase Cards&nbsp;</h2>

<p>With Spider-Man, the Magic team has used the showcase cards to show not only just iconic moments in Spider-Man history but storylines as well. Sagas try to tell the arc of a story over the course of the card and will have comic panels to convey the mechnanics and story moving along.</p>

<h2>The Infinity Stones Enter Magic: The Gathering&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Well, Marvel is really getting into Magic: The Gathering now as our first Infinity Stone enters the universe: The Soul Stone. This will be the chase card of the set and will come in three different versions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Does that signal there will be more to come? They’re not saying but I think it’s a safe bet we’ll see more of the stones in future sets and some insane Infinity Gauntlet card at some point too. It’s a huge universe, and this is just the beginning.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The immersive attraction, <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: The Immersive Quest</em>, is coming to the US. The Toronto-based Vibrant Studios has announced it will be bringing its full immersive-theatre-meets-multimedia experience to fantasy fans this Fall.</p>



<p>According to its <a href="https://www.vibrantstudios.events/en/dndimmersive" rel="nofollow">official page</a>, <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: The Immersive Quest</em> is a fully immersive experience where you can act out the thrill of being on a heroic adventure in the world of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. You choose your class: Druid, Rogue, Fighter, or Wizard,&nbsp; embark on a quest from the famous Yawning Portal tavern, explore a dungeon, and face overcoming challenges.</p>

In addition to the interactive theatre of being an adventurer, the venue will include a marketplace, soundscapes, cinematic videos, <em>D&amp;D</em>-themed food and beverages, and more. There are even rooms where you can play at a <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> table.</p>

<p>The experience is open not just for singles, but for families, students, and can even accommodate school and group gatherings. The site states the event is suitable for general audiences, though it does state parents bringing children under the age of four must do so at their own discretion. Cosplay is permitted but must not promote hate speech or be deemed publicly inappropriate.</p>

<p><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: The Immersive Quest</em> isn't the first time the iconic fantasy setting has been brought to life in the US.

            <title><![CDATA[ToeJam and Earl Co-Creator Reveals Emotional Life Sim Dancing with Ghosts]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dancing-with-ghosts-toejam-and-earl-co-creator</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/toejam-and-earl-co-creator-reveals-emotional-life-sim-dancing-with-ghosts.1284420/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>ToeJam and Earl&nbsp;</em>co-creator Greg Johnson has announced his new game&nbsp;<em>Dancing with Ghosts</em>, which he and his company HumaNature Studios describe as a "life sim about finding joy from grief".</p>

<p>Set in a small Thai village,&nbsp;<em>Dancing with Ghosts&nbsp;</em>casts you as Mai, a young girl who loses both of her parents in an accident. When she meets Pim, a ghost who can't remember who she was in life or how she died, the two must set out on a journey to "process their identities".</p>

<p>Johnson got the idea for&nbsp;<em>Dancing with Ghosts&nbsp;</em>following the sad and untimely passing of his daughter at just 28 years old, as well as "his family's loss of everything in the 2023 <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Maui-wildfires-of-2023" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Lahaina fires</a>", according to a press release announcing the game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dancing-with-ghosts-toejam-and-earl-co-creator-mai-pim.jpg?itok=Ba8F-uLS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dancing-with-ghosts-toejam-and-earl-co-creator-mai-pim.jpg?itok=scITw7xM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dancing with Ghosts&nbsp;</em>is a life sim about grief from&nbsp;<em>ToeJam and Earl&nbsp;</em>co-creator Greg Johnson.</figcaption></figure><p>According to that same press release, Johnson wanted to "tell a story in another culture close to his heart"; he became fluent in Thai "to communicate with his beloved Thai and Muslim family", and he was inspired by Thai "cultures and customs around the departed".</p>

<p>To make&nbsp;<em>Dancing with Ghosts</em>, Johnson sought the aid of local artists Ferrai Duanghathai and Tanta Voratawankul, as well as the Thai Bit Egg animation studio and "long-time" Indonesian collaborator Ferry Halim, so it's got some serious authenticity behind it.</p>

<p>In gameplay terms, Johnson says you can expect the "chill, sim-type gameplay of a living village" in which you'll help villagers with their problems, earn karma, and play "cultural mini-games that are integrated into the themes of the story". It's got serious&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/spirirfarer-review" rel="nofollow">Spiritfarer</a>&nbsp;</em>vibes, so if you love that game, you may well like this one too.</p>

<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Dancing with Ghosts</em>, which gives a good sense of what the game will look like in motion, right here.</p>




<p><em>Dancing with Ghosts&nbsp;</em>debuts on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1352700/Dancing_with_Ghosts/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and Nintendo Switch sometime next year, and if you want to help support its development, there'll be a Kickstarter campaign to contribute to in October.</p>
