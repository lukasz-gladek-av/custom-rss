            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>According to a new report, a TV show based on id Software and Bethesda's legendary&nbsp;<em>Wolfenstein&nbsp;</em>franchise is currently in development, and it's set to air on Prime Video.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/wolfenstein-tv-series-amazon-kilter-patrick-somerville-1236469609/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Variety</a>, the show will be produced by&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>studio Kilter Films, with executive producer duties being handled by Keyframe Films' James Altman and MachineGames' Jerk Gustafsson, the latter of whom served as director on&nbsp;2014's&nbsp;<em>Wolfenstein: The New Order&nbsp;</em>and 2019's&nbsp;<em>Wolfenstein: Youngblood</em>.</p>

<p>We don't yet know what the story of the series will be, but as Variety points out, the logline for the series is simply this: "the story of killing Nazis is evergreen". It's hard to argue with that.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wolfenstein-tv-show-new-colossus.jpg?itok=JWPaEvZx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wolfenstein-tv-show-new-colossus.jpg?itok=p6g4rqpr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A&nbsp;<em>Wolfenstein&nbsp;</em>TV series is in development for Amazon.</figcaption></figure><p>Although story details are being kept under wraps, if it were me, I'd probably adapt the narrative of&nbsp;<em>The New Order</em>; it's almost certainly the strongest the series has to offer.</p>

<p>Casting also hasn't been revealed yet, but if you ask me,&nbsp;<em>Reacher</em>'s Alan Ritchson was essentially born to play swole hero B.J. Blazkowicz, so if he doesn't end up in the lead role, something's gone seriously wrong.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Station Eleven&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Maniac&nbsp;</em>creator Patrick Somerville will serve as the showrunner for&nbsp;<em>Wolfenstein</em>, so it'll essentially be up to him and Amazon what direction the show decides to take.</p>

<p>No third mainline game in MachineGames' rebooted&nbsp;<em>Wolfenstein&nbsp;</em>series has been revealed yet (I'm very much trying to ignore&nbsp;<em>Youngblood</em>); while&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/indiana-jones-and-great-circle" rel="nofollow">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>&nbsp;</em>had more than its fair share of Nazi-punching, this might be the closest you're going to get to more&nbsp;<em>Wolfenstein&nbsp;</em>for some time.</p>

Other successes on that front include <i><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/fallout-tv-show-proves-last-of-us-wasnt-fluke" rel="nofollow">Fallout</a>&nbsp;</i>(also made for Amazon), HBO's&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us</em>, and&nbsp;<em>League of Legends</em>' <i>Arcane</i>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/more-league-of-legends-shows-on-way" rel="nofollow">won't be the only&nbsp;<em>League&nbsp;</em>show soon enough</a>.</p>

<p>As well as these shows, plenty of as-yet-unadapted games are getting their own TV adaptations as well, including&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clash-of-clans-tv-show" rel="nofollow"><em>Clash of Clans</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/beyond-two-souls-tv-series" rel="nofollow"><em>Beyond: Two Souls</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-live-action-series-netflix-soon" rel="nofollow"><em>Assassin's Creed</em></a>.</p>
