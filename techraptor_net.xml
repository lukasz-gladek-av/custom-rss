            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/dosa-divas-preview-cooking-up-storm<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Welcome to our establishment. On today's menu, our special is <em>Dosa Divas</em>, an upcoming title from developer Outerloop Games and publisher Outersloth. It mixes elements from popular JRPGs into one delicious meal. Here's our thoughts from the time we had with it at Summer Game Fest 2025.</p>

<p>Let me preface by saying&nbsp;<em>Dosa Divas</em>&nbsp;seems to focus heavily on narrative, but due to the nature of the demo, I wasn't able to get a real feel for it. With a timer giving me just 30 minutes, I wanted to consume as much gameplay as I could.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Taking Inspiration From the Greats</h2>

<p>From what I could gather, though, the story involves two sisters and an "ancient spirit-mech," which you can also control as a party member (it is pretty freakin' cool). An evil fast food empire is the main enemy faction we'll contend with throughout the duration of&nbsp;<em>Dosa Divas</em>&nbsp;playtime.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I went into&nbsp;<em>Dosa Divas</em>&nbsp;fairly blind; I saw something that looking cool, so I decided I wanted to play it. Because of this, I was quite surprised to find how much&nbsp;<em>Dosa Divas</em>&nbsp;plays like some of my favorite JRPGs.</p>

<p>You have an overworld -- it's kind of this 3D, side-scrolling like area a la&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/series/paper-mario" rel="nofollow">Paper Mario</a> --&nbsp;</em>and combat is also inspired by the same game's timing mechanics. More recently, we can look at games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-french-revolution" rel="nofollow"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a>&nbsp;using this more interactive, turn-based JRPG combat style.</p>



<h2>Food Fighting in&nbsp;<em>Dosa Divas</em></h2>

<p>So when you engage in combat, you can pick your standard attacks, special attacks, and the like. There's a little visual indicator to showing players can press a button again, during combat animation, to get an extra attack. Timing seems pretty generous for this.</p>

<p>The timing for attacks will depend; for an example, attack has a boomerang effect that, if you keep timing it correctly, can bounce for quite a long time. Nothing I'm saying here is extraordinarily different from other JRPGs that have similar mechanics, but&nbsp;<em>Dosa Divas</em>&nbsp;has a few tricks up its sleeve.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There's a culinary theme throughout the entire game. Attacks are based on cooking utensils for the most part, so you have your spatulas, pot lids, punches from a spirit-mech... okay, maybe the last one isn't a cooking utensil, but man, I can't get over how cool this mech is!</p>

<p>As I went around defeating enemies in the overworld, I helped liberate a village from the fast-food empire, the reputation with the settlement would increase. This actually gave me skills for my characters, so it seems like character progression is tied to these villages to some large degree.</p>



<h2><em>Dosa Divas</em> Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Besides that, though, I love the way&nbsp;<em>Dosa Divas</em>&nbsp;handles items. You're not buying your standard health potion like a normal JRPG; instead, you cook it up yourself. There's a cooking aspect involved, and depending on what ingredients you use, you get a different result.</p>

<p>So while you might be able to buy certain ingredients, it seems like you'll have to make your own utility items. There are little mini-games that make this aspect more interactive, so cooking can be a grand 'ol time.</p>

<p>If anything,&nbsp;<em>Dosa Divas</em>&nbsp;seems like a neat little JRPG-inspired game. It doesn't necessarily do anything super new or wild, but it doesn't need to. It's an honest take on the genre that is legitimately fun, so I'm excited to see how this one pans out when it launches next year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atelier-resleriana-red-alchemist-white-guardian-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Koei Tecmo has announced the release date for upcoming RPG&nbsp;<em>Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian</em>.</p>

<p>The game, which was first announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atelier-resleriana-red-alchemist-and-white-guardian" rel="nofollow">all the way back in September last year</a>, will be launching across PS5, Switch, and PC on September 26th. It doesn't appear that a native Switch 2 port will be available at launch, at the very least.</p>

<p><em>The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian&nbsp;</em>will serve as a followup to&nbsp;the original&nbsp;<em>Atelier Resleriana</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atelier-resleriana-global-release-date" rel="nofollow">released last year as a free-to-play RPG</a>. Unlike its predecessor, however, this new game won't be an online-based gacha RPG, but instead a fully-fledged&nbsp;<em>Atelier&nbsp;</em>game.</p>

It'll stand in contrast to&nbsp;<em>Atelier Yumia</em>, which, as Koei Tecmo says, "aimed to create the next generation of&nbsp;<em>Atelier&nbsp;</em>games" (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atelier-yumia-sales-300k-fastest-selling" rel="nofollow">rather successfully, it should be noted</a>).</p>

<p>The new game takes place in the fallen town of Hallfein, which has been devastated by a "mysterious disaster" that "caused most of its residents to disappear". After some time, however, two former residents of Hallfein, Rias and Slade, return to the town to discover the truth of what really happened.</p>

<p>Much like&nbsp;<em>Atelier Resleriana</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian&nbsp;</em>will also feature characters from previous&nbsp;<em>Atelier&nbsp;</em>games. Sophie, Wilbell, Totori, and Raze will all be making an appearance as playable characters "in segments of the game".</p>

<p>Koei Tecmo says&nbsp;<em>Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian&nbsp;</em>will revolve around "the core&nbsp;<em>Atelier&nbsp;</em>series gameplay cycle of exploration, synthesis, and battles", but that you'll also be able to develop the town of Hallfein, operating your own shop and selling what you make.</p>




<p><em>Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3259600/Atelier_Resleriana_The_Red_Alchemist__the_White_Guardian/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, PlayStation 5, and Nintendo Switch on September 26th.</p>

It’s bigger in scope, addresses its faults, and digs into what made the first one work even more.</p>

<h2 paraeid="{868eba7a-2a19-4722-808a-2c748178409e}{11}" paraid="1549716025">A Story and Characters Full of Intrigue</h2>

<p paraeid="{868eba7a-2a19-4722-808a-2c748178409e}{25}" paraid="706658818"><em>Escape Academy 2</em> takes place after the first game, with you returning to school as the hero of the first game that everyone knows. Of course, that means you’re understood to be a master puzzler and will challenged as such.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{868eba7a-2a19-4722-808a-2c748178409e}{47}" paraid="441155158">Getting to know the academy, its professors, the founders, and the overarching lore of where the game is set will be important this time around, too. It’s not that you’ll need intimate knowledge of it all, but there will be puzzles that use that information.</p>

<p paraeid="{868eba7a-2a19-4722-808a-2c748178409e}{47}" paraid="441155158">There's hints at some sneaky business going on as well. I mean, they are professors of an insane academy to teach people how to escape elaborate puzzles. They have to be up to something.</p>



<p paraeid="{868eba7a-2a19-4722-808a-2c748178409e}{61}" paraid="516747078">Moreover, there will be more context given to any one puzzle. Why am I in this one particular reason beyond solving a puzzle? The developers want players to be engaged more beyond "hey solve this problem we’ve put in front of you." In other words, they're hoping for some investment beyond the nature of the puzzle itself.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{868eba7a-2a19-4722-808a-2c748178409e}{73}" paraid="1391258185">They’ve taken a different approach to the escape room aspect as well. The first game featured a lot of countdowns and timers to ratchet up the tension as you tried to solve the puzzle to any one room.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{868eba7a-2a19-4722-808a-2c748178409e}{81}" paraid="2137528575">While <em>Escape Academy 2</em> will still feature that sometimes, like in the introductory classroom you must escape, they are much fewer and far between. The developers told us that they received a lot of feedback that people wanted more time to just figure out puzzles. The stress a timer put on everything just wasn't something they were looking for.</p>

<h2 paraeid="{868eba7a-2a19-4722-808a-2c748178409e}{81}" paraid="2137528575">Escape Academy 2 Goes Open World Puzzling</h2>

<p paraeid="{868eba7a-2a19-4722-808a-2c748178409e}{87}" paraid="2061573449">To that end, there are two different sets of puzzles and problems to solve. Many will be the classic, here’s a thing to figure out in this specific room. All the information and objects you’ll need will be found there.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{868eba7a-2a19-4722-808a-2c748178409e}{109}" paraid="1363664629">The big change in <em>Escape Academy 2</em> is that there will be some “open world” puzzling to get involved with as well. You’ll have the Academy to explore, which is of course full of many secrets to uncover. In my brief time with the game, it was hard not to look at every little detail or furnishing and not assume it was relevant to some puzzle somewhere.</p>

<p paraeid="{868eba7a-2a19-4722-808a-2c748178409e}{109}" paraid="1363664629">Of course, progressing through the open world is gained by solving puzzles as well. That may be figuring out a certain puzzle in a hallway that then leads a nearby student to give you a key card as thanks, or something more. You'll need to gain access to new areas through solving things in the world.</p>



<p paraeid="{868eba7a-2a19-4722-808a-2c748178409e}{155}" paraid="2132570097">As for the puzzles themselves, what I saw in my short time with the demo was really cool. Nothing was frustrating, I never felt like the information I needed was too far away, nor was there any of the moon logic nonsense some people worry about.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{868eba7a-2a19-4722-808a-2c748178409e}{163}" paraid="1716671636">Solving puzzles was always satisfying, and the pacing was impeccable. I was always just around the corner on some sort of breakthrough while I was maybe collecting some more problems to solve. It felt like I was always making progress even with the conveyer belt of puzzles heading right for me.</p>

<h2 paraeid="{868eba7a-2a19-4722-808a-2c748178409e}{163}" paraid="1716671636">Awesome Visual Puzzle Design</h2>

<p paraeid="{868eba7a-2a19-4722-808a-2c748178409e}{173}" paraid="994646972">Also, so many of them were wonderfully designed visually. It’s hard to not give away too much without explaining, but I wanted to give one pretty cool example.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{868eba7a-2a19-4722-808a-2c748178409e}{183}" paraid="959658166">I had to solve a few different puzzles to open up a large set of bookcases, but those gave me access to a series of books I could pull out or leave in. The puzzle was to figure out which books to pull out to let a beam of light either travel through it or be reflected off a mirror. I could see the titles of the books and had found a scrap of paper that told me what kinds of books to pull out, like removing the books that rhyme with "rocks", for example.</p>



<p paraeid="{868eba7a-2a19-4722-808a-2c748178409e}{183}" paraid="959658166">While doing this, I wasn't quite sure what the beam of light would do or if it was just getting to some end goal. As I went further along, it became more apparent that the beam started to form giant numbers that I needed to input as a code to unlock something else in the room. It was a great reveal that I didn't see coming immediately but was so satisfying to see the finished product.</p>

<p paraeid="{868eba7a-2a19-4722-808a-2c748178409e}{199}" paraid="2104756473">The most impressive part to me, however, was just how screwing up the books I pulled out could cause the light beam to line up in such a way that it made a different number. It wasn't simply just a bunch of screwed up lines, though it could be that at times too.</p>

<p paraeid="{868eba7a-2a19-4722-808a-2c748178409e}{199}" paraid="2104756473">My short time with <em>Escape Academy 2: Back 2 School</em> was a wonderful time. I was engaged the whole time and the puzzles were so satisfying to solve. With a bit of a surge in puzzle games thanks to the likes of Blue Prince and others, I think people should keep an eye on this one.</p>
