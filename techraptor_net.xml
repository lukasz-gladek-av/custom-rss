This past weekend, players enjoyed the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/lorwyn-eclipsed-reveal-brings-cards-commanders-and-muppets" rel="nofollow"><em>Lorwyn Eclipsed</em></a> prerelease, but some players got a surprise. Instead of getting certain promo cards, they got cards from the announced <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em> Universes Beyond crossover set.</p><h2>The <em>Lorwyn Eclipsed</em> Prerelease TMNT Card Leak</h2><p>The <em>Lorwyn Eclipsed</em> Prerelease TMNT card leak happened gradually over the weekend. As players went to their local game shops and opened up prerelease packs for the latest <em>Magic</em> set, players noticed certain cards that were not part of the fairytale theme. No, some cards clearly featured aliens, mutants, ninja tools, dangerous green ooze, and certain heroes in a half shell.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>It wasn't long before various dedicated sites and the <em>Magic</em> Subreddit began to pool their findings. If you are curious about what was revealed and don't mind spoilers, <a href="https://articles.starcitygames.com/magic-the-gathering/most-mtg-tmnt-rares-mythic-rares-leaked-during-lorwyn-eclipsed-prerelease-events/" rel="nofollow">Star City Games</a> has photos of the 58 (so far) cards leaked during the event. Fair warning, the cards in this leak are mostly Rares and Mythic Rares, which may give you some insight into the set's relevance in the current competitive meta.</p><p>The <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em> set is part of the latest wave of crossovers in <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>. This past year alone has seen the iconic card game feature sets with Square Enix's iconic <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/final-fantasy-magic-gathering-crossover-brings-classic-art-and-new-mechanics" rel="nofollow"><em>Final Fantasy</em></a>, a Secret Lair showcasing Sega's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/official-magic-gathering-sonic-hedgehog-secret-lair-is-gonna-go-fast" rel="nofollow"><em>Sonic The Hedgehog</em></a>, the iconic martial arts fantasy series <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mtg-avatar-last-airbender-everything-you-need-to-know" rel="nofollow"><em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em></a>, and Marvel's own wall-crawling webslinger, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/mtg-spider-man-villains-bonus-sheet-and-infinity-stone-revealed" rel="nofollow"><em>Spider-Man</em></a>.</p><p>Wizards of the Coast was quick to address the <em>Lorwyn Eclipsed</em> Prerelease TMNT card leak. In a social media post on Bluesky Social and X (formerly Twitter), they stated the "incorrect cards" found in the prerelease kits were not intentional and that stores should replace these cards with appropriate promos from other Lorwyn Eclipsed prerelease kits. But, if that wasn't possible, players can play with these cards.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
