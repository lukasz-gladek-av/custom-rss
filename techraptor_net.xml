            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Toshiyuki Itahana, the man behind <em>Final Fantasy IX</em>'s iconic character designs, has departed Square Enix in order to become a freelance artist and illustrator.</p><p>In <a href="https://note.com/itahana/n/n277aa9cc7148" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">a post on Japanese platform Note</a> (which is in both Japanese and English and which was spotted by <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/toshiyuki-itahana-ffix-character-designer-has-left-square-enix.1397110/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">ResetEra user Xenosaga</a>), Itahana says he left Square Enix following a period of "thinking seriously about preparing [himself] to continue drawing for many years to come". His departure actually came at the end of 2025.</p><p>Itahana goes on to say that while he feels "deeply grateful" towards those who celebrated <em>Final Fantasy IX</em> for the JRPG's 25th anniversary last year, completing the "illustration work and supervision" for the occasion led him to "draw a line under this chapter and take on new challenges".</p><figure role="group">

<p>In conclusion to his post, Itahana says he's hoping to "continue creating a wide variety of new artwork" as a freelancer and expresses his "heartfelt gratitude" to former colleagues both at Square Enix and elsewhere.</p><p>As well as <em>Final Fantasy IX</em>, Itahana has worked on a number of other Square Enix projects, including the likes of <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>'s <em>Dawntrail </em>expansion, where he provided character concept art (but nothing beyond that, so I <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-review-inconsistent-vacation" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d75083ba-0c32-43b2-b2b6-430355d89eb0" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">won't blame <em>Dawntrail </em>on him</a>).</p><p>He's also worked on the <em>Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles </em>games, as well as projects like <em>Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition </em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/chocobo-gp" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="979e8964-98c5-46aa-9190-d7479f9d3832" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">2022 racer <em>Chocobo GP</em></a>. Hopefully, we'll get to see his art in many more games to come.</p><p>As for <em>Final Fantasy IX</em>, the RPG's anniversary has come and gone with nary a mention of the long-rumored remake. It is, of course, still possible that the project is on the way, but the 25th anniversary would have been the perfect time to reveal it if so. I wouldn't hold my breath, personally.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see what lies in Itahana's future, but whatever it is, it'll probably be outside of Square Enix's purview. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
