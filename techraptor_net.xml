            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/relax-on-beach-with-elizabeth-hargraves-newest-game-sanibel<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Elizabeth Hargrave is working on a new board game. The same creative mind behind the acclaimed <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/wingspan-review-pleasant-from-beak-to-tailfeather" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Wingspan</em></a> and the environmentally minded <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/undergrove-kickstarter-ends-campaign-over-6000-funded" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Undergrove</em></a> is working on a mild game about exploring a beach called <em>Sanibel</em>.</p>

<h2>The Sanibel Board Game Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, <em>Sanibel</em> is a laid-back tile placement board game inspired by summer days on the beach, hunting for shells. Players can explore the shore, putting seashells into a bag and earning points on how they are arranged in the bag. You can also earn points by observing the waves crashing into the shoreline and exploring a nearby lighthouse.</p>

Whoever has the most points by the end of their trek on the beach is considered the winner.</p>

<p><em>Sanibel</em> is a cozy, meditative game. One that offers a combination of strategy and and atmosphere for both board gamers, ocean-lovers, and everyone else between. It is similar to journey-focused board game experiences like <em>Tokaido</em> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/american-tabletop-awards-2025-winners-announced-showcasing-industry-variety" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">American Tabletop Awards 2025</a> Strategy Game winner, <em>Let's Go to Japan</em>.</p>

<p>Overall, <em>Sanibel</em> is a modest continuation of Elizabeth Hargrave's catalog of board games showcasing her love of nature. <em>Wingspan</em> was a game about managing a bird sanctuary, a premise so evocative it got two spin-offs: <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/embrace-your-inner-dracologist-with-wyrmspan" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Wyrmspan</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/finspan-wingspan-creators-january" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Finspan</em></a>. Hargrave's follow-up, <em>Undergrove</em>, was an insightful experience about mycorhizas, or symbiotic networks of seeds and fungi, in the American Pacific Northwest.</p>

<p>Another of Hargrave's games, <em>Tussie Mussie</em>, is a card game based on Victorian flower languages. It is an I-Split-You-Choose experience where you draw cards with flowers on them and combine them into appealing arrangements. Certain arrangements would earn points based on their composition, using real-world flowers like peonies and orchids.</p>

<p>The <em>Sanibel</em> board game is set to come out some time in early 2026 at an MSRP of $39.99.</p>
