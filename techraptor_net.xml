<p>When you clear Boss Rush stages, you'll return to how things were before you began, so you don't need to worry about any permanent changes; it's very much an additional mode that runs alongside your main adventures.</p><p>As announced on Bandai Namco's <a href="https://x.com/BandaiNamcoUS/status/2003133429727088664" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">official X account</a>, original <em>Patapon </em>designer Rolito is back on board, having provided new artwork specifically for the Boss Rush mode, so if you're a fan of the <em>Patapon </em>art style (and who isn't?), then you'll get a special kick out of this one too.</p><p>If you're unfamiliar with <em>Patapon 1+2 Replay</em>, it is, as the name suggests, a collection that includes remastered versions of the first two <em>Patapon </em>games, which were originally released on Sony's excellent PSP handheld.</p><p>The games are a sort of combination of rhythm-action and RPG in which you need to hit buttons in time with the (brilliant) music in order to advance your army and defeat a series of enemies. You can check out the Boss Rush update trailer, which shows off <em>Patapon</em>'s gorgeous art style, right here.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, the <em>Patapon </em>revival doesn't stop with this collection, either; a spiritual successor, <em>Ratatan</em>, was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ratatan-early-access-release-date-september" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3f2e2199-a7b4-4859-8f58-46cef0a83ab5" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">released this year</a>, and it's getting a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ratatan-update-christmas-day" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6860479b-517c-4243-b770-0b22c034f105" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">massive update on Christmas Day</a> as well, so you might want to check that out if you want more rhythm-action goodness.</p><p>You can check out <em>Patapon 1+2 Replay </em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2383200/PATAPON_12_REPLAY/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/patapon-1-2-replay/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/patapon-1-plus-2-replay-switch/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch</a>.
