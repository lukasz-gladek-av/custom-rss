            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>From the rush to find Merry and Pippin to Frodo and Sam’s trek through the Dead Marshes through the clash of forces at Helm’s Deep, <em>The Two Towers</em> goes pretty non-stop in <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>. Which is why I was <em>so</em> excited for this chapter of the story to get its “Trick Taking Game” treatment. But is it a worthy successor to the incredible <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/fellowship-of-ring-trick-taking-game-review-tricksy" rel="nofollow"><em>Fellowship of the Ring: Trick Taking Game</em></a>? Asmodee USA sent me a copy to find out, so follow my trail as I review the newly-released <em>The Two Towers: Trick Taking Game</em>.</p><p><em>The Two Towers: Trick Taking Game</em> is a sort of sequel to last year’s hit <em>Fellowship of the Ring: Trick Taking Game</em>, continuing on the story of the novel at Boromir’s fall. You do not need to own or have played the original game to play <em>The Two Towers: Trick Taking Game</em>, though having played the original will make this one a quick and easy teach.</p><p>A Trick Taking game enters on a series of hands, called tricks, with a player winning (or taking) the trick. The rules differ from game to game (and some famous games include Hearts, Spades, and Pinochle), but usually one player will lead the trick by playing a card, and other players have to follow that same card’s suit if possible. In <em>The Two Towers: Trick Taking Game</em>, players play cards value one to eight, in suits like Hills, Forest, Mountains, and Shadows.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2><strong>How Do You Play </strong><em><strong>The Two Towers: Trick Taking Game</strong></em><strong>?</strong></h2><p>In essence, this is a cooperative Trick Taking game ala <em>The Crew</em>, where you and your teammates will take on roles of different heroes and villains from <em>LOTR</em> in a series of chapters. Each chapter represents a moment from the story, and each offers its own unique difficulties and complexities.</p><p>In each chapter, you’ll need to fulfill the goals of your hero. If any hero doesn’t successfully fulfill their goal by the end of the hand, you lose the chapter and need to try again. Goals range from needing to win a set amount of tricks, needing to win the lowest amount of tricks (thanks a lot, Pippin), and other fun surprises I won’t spoil here.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>In the first chapter, you’ll play as Boromir, Aragorn, and your choice between Gimli and Legolas. As you progress through the chapters, you’ll open up more twists, turns, and new characters that come and go from the game. You <em>can</em> play these chapters in any order, but the rulebook suggests you play them in order, as do I!</p><h2><strong>How Is </strong><em><strong>The Two Towers: Trick Taking Game</strong></em><strong> different from </strong><em><strong>The Fellowship of the Ring: Trick Taking Game</strong></em><strong>?</strong></h2><p>The chief difference, along with an entirely new batch of chapters to work through, is the inclusion of new cards - namely The White Tower, Black Tower, and Orc cards.</p><p>Gone (at least in the beginning of the game) are the Ring suit, as the story focuses on the action happening away from Frodo and Sam (and their precious). Instead are the White and Black tower cards, which automatically win a trick if only <em>one</em> of the two towers is played.</p><p>The Orc cards are another nasty addition, they don’t have a value, and if you ever have to lead a trick with an Orc card… you lose the entire chapter! This created many a nasty, desperate moment in my play testing, where the optimal play had to be interrupted to make sure I wasn’t stuck with an Orc as my last card in hand.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2><strong>How Does It Feel To Play </strong><em><strong>The Two Towers: Trick Taking Game</strong></em><strong>?</strong></h2><p><em>The Two Towers: Trick Taking Game</em> feels very similar to playing the original game… which is a great accomplishment! As I wrote in my original review, “This is, by far, one of the best experiences I've had playing a trick-taking game.” Well… guess what? The same can be said for <em>The Two Towers: Trick Taking Game</em>.</p><p>The difficulty in this game ramps up right from the jump, assuming that many players would have already played through at least some of the original <em>Fellowship</em> game. Because of this, every single chapter, from first to last, is a satisfying head-scratcher, where you’ll balance hitting your goal with making sure every other player on the field is hitting theirs, as well.</p><p>The pressure of working through a trick is, as in the first game, augmented by the fact that each chapter can be played in about ten minutes, so failing a chapter is no biggie. Maybe you’ll want to switch up your heroes, or try to come to the challenge from a new angle.&nbsp;</p><picture>

  </picture><p>Maybe you’ll get a bit lucky the next time you try a chapter, or maybe your luck will be even worse! That’s the beauty of the game, with a simple set of guidelines to work around, each chapter is a Hobbit-sized meal of clever design.</p><h2><em>The Two Towers: Trick Taking Game </em>- Final Thoughts</h2><p><em>The Two Towers: Trick Taking Game</em> does exactly what I hoped it would as a sort of sequel. It expands upon the groundwork laid by the original game without requiring players to have completed that game, and it tweaks without completely overhauling the design of the original game.</p><p>The inclusion of the Orc cards add a fun new wrinkle to the game flow, and new heroes that come across your path will completely switch up how you approach the game. This is high-quality, thoughtful game design from top to bottom.</p><p>Whether you’re a fan of Tolkien’s world, or just love a good Trick Taking game, I cannot recommend <em>The Two Towers: Trick Taking Game</em> highly enough!

<p>Products <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/my-mario/products/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">shown off</a> on the My Mario website include the likes of toy playsets, <em>Mario</em>-themed pop-up books, and clothing, as well as other items themed around Mario and his friends.</p><p>You can also watch a new series of <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/my-mario/videos/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">stop-motion animation shorts</a> that feature some adorable and simplistic stories revolving around Mario, Yoshi, and other familiar elements from the franchise. They're pretty cute, even if you're not a parent or a young kid!</p><p>The new <em>Hello Mario </em>app also gives kids the opportunity to mess with Mario's face a la <em>Super Mario 64</em>, and it's got other games and features built into it as well. Again, it'll be available on mobile devices on February 19th.</p><p>Naturally, the app, as well as the videos, won't need you to visit Nintendo's store locations to check them out, but if you want any of the physical stuff, it sounds like you'll need to buy it from the shops, although it may end up on the online-based My Nintendo Store as well.</p>
<p>My Mario products and apps will become available in the West starting from February 19th. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things Nintendo.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
