      <div><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> Head Designer Mark Rosewater has shared a new sneak peek at the latest set. The Tarkir: Dragonstorm teaser contains a glimpse at creatures, text, and mechanics found in the upcoming set, allowing fans to speculate on potential combos and synergies.</p>



<p>As usual, the <em>Tarkir: Dragonstorm</em> teaser was dropped on Mark Rosewater's official <a href="https://markrosewater.tumblr.com/post/777738754267955200/maros-tarkir-dragonstorm-teaser" rel="nofollow">Tumblr page</a>. Like all prior teasers like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/unfinity-teaser-shared-by-mark-rosewater" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Unfinity</em></a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/mark-rosewater-shares-brothers-war-teaser" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>The Brothers' War</em></a>, Rosewater's teaser only provides small bits of information. No full explanations or names are given away here.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tarkir-dragonstorm-inevitable-defeat-card-artwork.jpg?itok=QyjxsQGw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tarkir-dragonstorm-inevitable-defeat-card-artwork.jpg?itok=wACl-Gxo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The first part of Rosewater's tease contains the following quotes:</p>

<ul><li>A cycle of Dragonstorm enchantments</li>
	<li>Two planeswalkers</li>
	<li>Some counters in the set: decayed, lifelink, and time</li>
	<li>A card that can tutor for one of two other cards</li>
	<li>A legendary enchantment</li>
	<li>A Hydra that uses a clan keyword</li>
	<li>A common archetype theme gets an ability word</li>
	<li>An instant the generates five effects</li>
	<li>Dragons get a new typal enchantment based on a popular Zombie one</li>
	<li>A new instant and sorcery subtype</li>
</ul><p>The first part of the Tarkir: Dragonstorm teaser has some intriguing tidbits. First, this set will be getting two new Planeswalkers. Usually, a new set only contains one. New instant and sorcery subtypes are rare additions, which is gripping.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition, the reintroduction of decayed tokens are fascinating since they're usually seen on zombies from the Innistrad set. Time was used in a similar context in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/doctor-who-commander-decks-will-have-50-new-cards-each" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Doctor Who</em> Commander</a> decks.</p>

<p>The second part of the <em>Tarkir: Dragonstorm</em> teaser are bits of rule text. They are as follows:</p>

<ul><li>“Whenever you cast a Turtle spell, untap this creature.”</li>
	<li>“As long as there are three or more different kinds of counters among creatures you control,”</li>
	<li>“You may cast it without paying its mana cost if that spell’s mana value is 8 or less.”</li>
	<li>“If you put +1/+1 counters on five Dragons this way, you win the game.”</li>
	<li>“Whenever a creature you control enters, if you cast it, destroy that creature”</li>
	<li>“At the beginning of combat on your turn, if you’ve case both a creature spell and a noncreature spell this turn,”</li>
	<li>“Then if creatures you control have total toughness 20 or greater,”</li>
	<li>“During your end step, Warrior tokens you control have ‘This token can’t be sacrificed.’”</li>
	<li>“Whenever this creature deals combat damage to a player, you may search your library for a card named &lt;CARDNAME&gt;, reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle.”</li>
	<li>“Spells you cast have delve.”</li>
</ul><p>&nbsp;The rules text holds a lot of gripping possibilities. First, there is the introduction of a new alternative win condition. Second is the return of the Delve mechanic, which allows you to reduce the cost of cards by exiling cards from your graveyard.</p>

They are as follows:</p>

<ul><li>Creature – Dog Monk</li>
	<li>Creature – Elephant Druid</li>
	<li>Creature – Yeti</li>
	<li>Creature – Djinn Cleric</li>
	<li>Creature – Zombie Advisor</li>
	<li>Creature – Kirin</li>
	<li>Creature – Snake Shapeshifter</li>
	<li>Artifact Creature – Chimera</li>
	<li>Artifact Creature – Ape Snake</li>
	<li>Legendary Creature – Zombie Snake Warlock</li>
	<li>All-Out Assault</li>
	<li>Cruel Truths</li>
	<li>Desperate Measures</li>
	<li>Dragonologist</li>
	<li>Hundred-Battle Veteran</li>
	<li>Lightfoot Technique</li>
	<li>Rescue Leopard</li>
	<li>Seize Opportunity</li>
	<li>Stillness in Motion</li>
	<li>War Effort</li>
</ul><p>&nbsp;This may be the lightest in terms of gameplay or lore implications, but the text is evocative and imaginative. Zombie Advisor and Zombie Snake Warlock stand out considerably. The name Dragonologist also makes sense given the new set's focus on dragons.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/secret-agent-wizard-boy-and-the-international-crime-syndicate-preview-harry-potter-on-drugs.1131555/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/secret-agent-wizard-boy-and-international-crime-syndicate-preview-harry-potter-on<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Don't you love it when a game title is straight and to the point? Take, for example, <em>Secret Agent Wizard Boy and the International Crime Syndicate</em>, a game about you playing as a secret agent wizard boy trying to take down a crime syndicate. Who would have guessed?</p>

<p><em>Secret Agent Wizard Boy</em> is a goofy, outrageous, and hilariously jank simulation/adventure Early Access game that takes place within totally not-Hogwarts. Co-developed by the Szymanski brothers (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/my-friendly-neighborhood-review-c-is-for-creepy" rel="nofollow">John and Evan</a>) and published by the third, <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/david-szymanski" rel="nofollow">David</a> of <em>Dusk</em> fame, you can expect a zany and unconventional game from these fellas.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/secret-agent-wizard-boy-chaos.jpg?itok=UlbKvPCF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/secret-agent-wizard-boy-chaos.jpg?itok=t2S0Nc6Y 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Go on, create chaos!</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Secret Agent Wizard Boy and the&nbsp;International Crime Syndicate </em>Brings Out the Child in Us</h2>

<p><em>Secret Agent Wizard Boy</em> is quite literally a sandbox. It's like a parent, dropping their kid in the box and telling them to "do stuff." In similar fashion, this game drops players smack dab in the middle of the school courtyard, and it's your job to figure things out from there.</p>

<p>Sure, there is an objective, and that is to investigate a mysterious door, but that's about it. The most important thing to note here is that <em>Secret Agent Wizard Boy </em>is very much an Early Access game. It takes roughly three or so hours to see everything it has to offer, and your one objective can be completed quite quickly.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/secret-agent-wizard-boy-and-the-international-crime-syndicate-spell-puzzle.jpg?itok=6pOH-qOi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/secret-agent-wizard-boy-and-the-international-crime-syndicate-spell-puzzle.jpg?itok=XrZU96ZL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hopefully we see more puzzles or secrets involving the use of your spells.</figcaption></figure><p>I was able to get access to this door and open it pretty fast, thereby "completing" all Early Access has to offer, and that's honestly fine- the main source of fun in <em>Secret Agent Wizard Boy</em> stems from its ridiculousness. It's a game that can be broken by the player with the flick of a hand, and it's intentionally and cleverly designed to be this way.</p>

<p>Physics are absolutely overturned, and you'll probably come across several ways to die without feeling like you did anything wrong. You just have to accept that <em>Secret Agent Wizard Boy</em> doesn't take itself seriously, and that's the key to letting loose and having fun.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/secret-agent-wizard-boy-castle.jpg?itok=NIiPfmeS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/secret-agent-wizard-boy-castle.jpg?itok=R1D9HyNf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The game goes for a lower poly style, and it looks wonderful and captures the atmosphere of a wizard school well!</figcaption></figure><h2>Exploring Not-Hogwarts in <em>Secret Agent Wizard Boy and the&nbsp;International Crime Syndicate </em></h2>

<p>The castle itself is inhabited by students, some of whom have their own quirky lines of dialogue. There are various objects to interact with, a plethora of rooms and areas to explore in the castle, and even new spells to discover.</p>

<p>Here's what I love about <em>Secret Agent Wizard Boy</em>: You can just be exploring the castle, and oh look, there's a small missile sitting in the teacher's office. It looked like a toy, so why <em>wouldn't</em> you throw it? And next thing you know, you explode, and your corpse just ragdolls all over the place.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/secret-agent-wizard-boy-dead.jpg?itok=5ZsRPWxo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/secret-agent-wizard-boy-dead.jpg?itok=NSsX6CP0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I probably shouldn't have stood on the obvious black button.</figcaption></figure><p>That's really the tip of the iceberg, though. There are various deathtraps waiting for you throughout this castle if you're the curious sort, as well as various secrets that make exploration enjoyable. Even though the game isn't all that serious, it captures the vibe of exploring a Hogwarts-like castle pretty damn well, actually.</p>

<p>After all, in the books and movies, Harry Potter and his friends would explore Hogwarts and get into all sorts of trouble. Hidden rooms, deathtraps, and making mischief? That's the <em>Harry Potter</em> books to a tee, and that's what you'll get here, too.</p>

<p>The castle itself isn't that big, yet. It'll get fleshed out during Early Access, as I understand it, so I'm very much looking forward to seeing new areas. There are courtyards, dungeons, a big ol' tower filled with explosives for some reason, and even student common rooms in its current state.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/secret-agent-wizard-boy-and-the-international-crime-syndicate-secret-2.jpg?itok=_opVd-H7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/secret-agent-wizard-boy-and-the-international-crime-syndicate-secret-2.jpg?itok=j1lOTq6L 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Oho, a secret passage!</figcaption></figure><p>Speaking of student common rooms, this reminds me of one funny moment. One area in the basement of the castle, clearly meant to be the "Slytherin" common area, has a student that blocks players off if they aren't wearing a green hat. I didn't have a green hat, nor did I know where to find one. What I did know is this: I can kill.</p>

<p>My sociopathic little wizard boy went to the potions classroom across the basement and concocted an exploding potion. From there, I grabbed it and threw it at the gate operator. Well, he died, of course. I went into his little booth through a vent and stole his hat, and the other green hats accepted me as their own. Genius, I tell you!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/secret-agent-wizard-boy-and-the-international-crime-syndicate-knight.jpg?itok=nZq5bvZI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/secret-agent-wizard-boy-and-the-international-crime-syndicate-knight.jpg?itok=QE3PS5zW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Yer a knight, Harry.</figcaption></figure>

<p>As I had previously mentioned, <em>Secret Agent Wizard Boy</em> has unlockable spells. You'll find spellbooks hidden throughout the castle, and those are how you learn new spells to use. Most of them feel useless at first, but we have to remember that this game is all about having fun and messing around.</p>

<p>So, I learned spells that could set things on fire, make things larger, or even allow me to swap bodies with another person. I learned that you can just swap bodies with a&nbsp;whole suit of armor and play as that. It didn't really give the player any benefit, but it's hilarious nonetheless.</p>

<p>The spell to enlarge things, called Biggify, is probably my favorite. You can make tons of objects gargantuan if you keep casting on it. I cast it on a student and made him become a behemoth and switched bodies with him, just because I could. I was so big, I couldn't leave the room I was in. Fantastic stuff.</p>

<p>If everything I've said so far sounds appealing to you, I've done my job. For a game that is as purposefully jank as it is, <em>Secret Agent Wizard Boy and the International Crime Syndicate</em> contains a good few hours of fun. It definitely needs to be fleshed out more, and that'll come in due time. For now, I'm just happy to find out how I can break this game in different ways.</p>

<hr><p><em><strong>Secret Agent Wizard Boy and the International Crime Syndicate </strong>was previewed over approximately 3 hours of gameplay with a key provided by the developer.&nbsp;All screenshots were taken during the preview process.</em></p>
