            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/more-gamestop-store-closures<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Several more GameStop stores appear to be closing down, although there's technically been no real official announcement from the company or its management regarding these closures (save for one small detail in an SEC filing).</p>

<p>Over on the GameStop subreddit, a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1hsbjt5/my_first_thought_when_i_heard_my_store_was_closing/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">number</a> of GameStop <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1hs3a1i/well_guys_its_been_nice/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">employees</a>&nbsp;are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1hs7n3n/my_store_has_been_culled/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">declaring</a> that their stores are being closed. Sorting posts by most recent on the subreddit shows tons of posts pertaining to store closures, although the posts don't name which stores are closing.</p>

<p>That might be owing to the policy outlined in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1hs5bok/to_our_concerned_guests_do_not_ask/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> by GameStop assistant store leader ArcherFawkes, who claims that if employees share information about a store's closure with customers, they'll be punished. As such, users are directed not to "ask for what stores are closing", as they "cannot tell you outright".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gamestop-closing-stores-reddit.jpg?itok=tW-laThn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gamestop-closing-stores-reddit.jpg?itok=sThjS2CD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The GameStop subreddit is currently full of posts declaring that stores are closing down.</figcaption></figure><p>The full scale of the store closures isn't currently known, and it is possible that some of these posts are by users who work at the same GameStop, but it seems that plenty of stores have been affected.</p>

<p>Technically speaking, GameStop management hasn't made an official public-facing announcement of these closures, although in an <a href="https://news.gamestop.com/static-files/2c1eac18-9f79-41b9-9e56-a8db8fe7aac4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SEC filing from mid-S</a><a href="https://gamestop.gcs-web.com/node/20696/html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">eptember</a>, company management said an ongoing review "may result in the closure of a larger number of stores than we have closed in the past few years".</p>

<p>These closures come after GameStop announced back in March <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gamestop-confirms-more-layoffs-share-price-tumbles-after-sales-slide/1100-6522189/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">that it had closed 287 stores</a> over the previous fiscal year, following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gamestop-closing-180-200-stores" rel="nofollow">hundreds</a> of other store closures in <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/10/investing/gamestop-store-closures/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">previous years</a>.</p>

<p>In its latest <a href="https://gamestop.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-discloses-third-quarter-2024-results" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">earnings release</a>, GameStop acknowledges that its net sales have dropped from $1.078 billion in last year's third quarter to just $860m in the same period this fiscal year, although net income for the third quarter was $17.5 million, up from a $3.1 million loss during the same period last year.</p>

<p>The situation eventually got so out of hand that it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/white-house-economic-team-monitoring-gamestop-stock-situation" rel="nofollow">attracted the US government's attention</a>. Eventually, author Ben Mezrich would write a book,&nbsp;<em>The Antisocial Network</em>, chronicling the debacle, with that book later becoming a major Hollywood motion picture by the name of&nbsp;<em>Dumb Money</em>.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what happens in the coming weeks with regards to GameStop store closures, but for now, if you're a company employee, it might be best to check with your management regarding what's going on with your store.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-sbmm-method-revealed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Enterprising&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>players have figured out a way to discover their SBMM (skill-based matchmaking) rating within the game, a value that's supposed to be hidden from players' view.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-players-are-getting-activision-to-send-them-their-personal-information-so-they-can-find-out-their-hidden-sbmm-rating" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">IGN</a>, this method comes via YouTuber TheXclusiveAce, and it works for every&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>multiplayer game you've played since 2021's&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Vanguard</em>. That's a heck of a lot of data.</p>

<p>As IGN points out, however, it's a method that takes a little while, and you'll have to put in a bit of effort to reap the rewards. You'll have to submit a personal information access request via the <a href="https://support.activision.com/privacy" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Activision privacy page</a>, and it can take a couple of days for the data to arrive, too.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-duty-sbmm-method-gunfight.jpg?itok=2Vil6up- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/call-of-duty-sbmm-method-gunfight.jpg?itok=u5uyfZJv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Want to find out your&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>SBMM rating? You can do so via a newly-discovered method.</figcaption></figure><p>Once you do get the info (for which you'll also need to log into an Activision account), you'll be granted access to a vast amount of data that, according to IGN and TheXclusiveAce, includes every Multiplayer match you've played on record.</p>

<p>You can see info like the modes and maps you've played with, as well as number of hits, damage numbers, and even the amount of time you've spent moving in each game. Activision really is collecting a staggering amount of player data from&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em>, it seems.</p>

<p>If you don't know what SBMM is, it's a rather hot topic within the multiplayer gaming world. SBMM, or skill-based matchmaking, refers to a method by which players are grouped together in multiplayer games according to their skill level.</p>

<p>Some players have decried SBMM, suggesting it makes games too hard to enjoy as "sweaty" players dominate higher-end lobbies. However, <a href="https://www.activision.com/cdn/research/CallofDuty_Matchmaking_Series_2.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">extensive experiments released by Activision last year</a> seem to contradict this, suggesting that players do appreciate SBMM when it's present, even if they don't realize it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-duty-sbmm-method-posing.jpg?itok=iNWu2iF7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/call-of-duty-sbmm-method-posing.jpg?itok=F7UF2pJy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Call of Duty</em>'s SBMM process is perhaps more popular than players would like to believe.</figcaption></figure><p>The data TheXclusiveAce uncovered isn't necessarily helpful in a vacuum, as it doesn't contain comparison to other players, nor does it show the skill rating of lobbies in which you participated in multiplayer&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>games.</p>

<p>However, if the&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>community comes together to compare data, then a more comprehensive picture of the way SBMM works within the games could be created.</p>

<p>It's well worth watching his video on the subject if you want to learn more about how to access your own data, as well as what it could tell you about your own&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>performance. You can see it here.</p>




<h2>What else is going on in the world of&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em>?</h2>

<p>Elsewhere in&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>land, the games'&nbsp;<em>Squid Game&nbsp;</em>collaboration, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-squid-game-crossover" rel="nofollow">first teased back in early December</a>, has now officially landed.</p>

<p>Per the&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>blog, the&nbsp;<em>Squid Game&nbsp;</em>crossover gives you the chance to earn goodies like a new Front Man Operator, as well as new Skins for existing Operators that sport the iconic green tracksuit from the show.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-duty-squid-game-crossover.jpg?itok=kr42B8YL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/call-of-duty-squid-game-crossover.jpg?itok=e798STID 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Squid Game&nbsp;</em>has officially come to the world of&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>The crossover also sees a number of limited-time events appearing in&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6</em>'s Multiplayer and Zombies modes, as well as&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em>.</p>

<p>Recently, it was revealed that the&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>series has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-series-sales-black-ops-6-launch" rel="nofollow">officially surpassed 500 million sales</a>, and that&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>enjoyed the series' biggest launch to date, no doubt buoyed by its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-will-be-on-game-pass-day-1" rel="nofollow">inclusion as part of Xbox Game Pass</a> on day one.</p>
