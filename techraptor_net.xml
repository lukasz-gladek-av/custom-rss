            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/casey-hudson-humanoid-origin-closed-down<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Humanoid Origin, the studio started by ex-BioWare staffer Casey Hudson, has closed down, citing "an unexpected shortfall of funding" that left the studio "unable to sustain operations".</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/humanoid-origin_earlier-today-we-informed-our-staff-that-activity-7266889657370447874-9uwE/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">LinkedIn post</a>, Humanoid Origin says that the closure happened despite its "efforts to shield the studio from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-june-14th" rel="nofollow">broader challenges in the industry</a>", and that the company is "heartbroken" it won't be able to complete its debut project.</p>

<p>The project in question was set to take place in a "new science-fiction universe", and while Hudson and Humanoid Origin never revealed what kind of game it would be, the studio's <a href="https://humanoidorigin.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official website</a>&nbsp;describes it as a "multi-platform AAA title focused on character-driven narrative". Sounds very familiar indeed.</p>

<p>The studio is right when it points to the current time as one of tumult and difficulty for the gaming industry (or certain sections of it, at the very least).</p>

<p>Major studios like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-ceo-payrise-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Sony</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-interactive-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Take-Two</a> have laid off hundreds of staff members in recent times, and some studios, like&nbsp;<em>Saints Row&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-shuts-down-saints-row-developer-volition" rel="nofollow">Volition</a> and&nbsp;<em>Gothic&nbsp;</em>outfit <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/piranha-bytes-shut-down-report" rel="nofollow">Piranha Bytes</a>, have been outright shut down.</p>

<p>Many game projects are being canceled as well; in recent months, we've seen the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-spinoff-project-t-canceled" rel="nofollow"><em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>spinoff Project T</a>, online action RPG&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/blue-protocol-canceled-west-japan-service-ending" rel="nofollow"><em>Blue Protocol</em></a>, and an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/electronic-arts-to-lay-off-5-of-its-workforce-amid-refocus-on-owned-ip-and-sports-games" rel="nofollow">unannounced&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>FPS</a> canceled (at least in the West, in <em>Blue Protocol</em>'s case), among others.</p>

We'll just have to wait and see, I suppose.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rift-of-necrodancer-pc-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Klei and developers Brace Yourself and Tic Toc have announced the&nbsp;<em>Rift of the NecroDancer&nbsp;</em>release date, although it's probably a little later than you might have expected or hoped for.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2073250/view/4489618994289967161" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post on Steam</a>,&nbsp;<em>Rift of the NecroDancer&nbsp;</em>will launch on PC on February 5th, but Brace Yourself says it's "decoupling" the Steam launch from the game's console release, which will now happen "at a later date" that's yet to be determined.</p>

<p>According to Brace Yourself, the delay is down to the team not wanting to cut any of&nbsp;<em>Rift of the NecroDancer</em>'s features to make a 2024 release, and the console delay is so that the team has "a little more time" to polish the game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rift-of-the-necrodancer-release-date-gameplay.jpg?itok=9jLY_Dyq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rift-of-the-necrodancer-release-date-gameplay.jpg?itok=QCN9ve0E 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Rift of the NecroDancer&nbsp;</em>will now be launching in 2025.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as announcing the new release date (and, by extension, the delay), Brace Yourself also reveals what it's been working on in the last year or so, with many of the features mentioned seemingly contributing to the game's delay.</p>

<p>These features include an extra "Impossible" difficulty level, as well as more Rhythm Rift beat maps, additional readability for monsters that land off the beat, and tools to implement custom music.</p>

<p>You'll also be able to enjoy a Remix Mode that "throws a fresh chart your way every playthrough", as well as better tutorials and practice mode gameplay, more animation clarity, and a revamp of the story mode. In short,&nbsp;<em>Rift of the NecroDancer</em>'s devs are using the extra time wisely, it seems.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Rift of the NecroDancer</em>, it's a&nbsp;rhythm spinoff of Brace Yourself's roguelike&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/crypt-of-necrodancer" rel="nofollow"><em>Crypt of the NecroDancer</em></a>. Though the game will feature many of the same characters as&nbsp;<em>Crypt</em>, it has its own gameplay style that's more indebted to games like Harmonix's&nbsp;<em>Frequency&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Amplitude</em>.</p>

<p>The game is set to launch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2073250/Rift_of_the_NecroDancer/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> on February 5th, with a console release to follow sometime after.</p>
