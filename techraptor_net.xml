            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced that its cozy life sim&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons&nbsp;</em>is getting a Switch 2 Edition upgrade in January, and it'll arrive alongside a free update that will add a new resort hotel and more.</p>

<p>In a new trailer, Nintendo reveals that the game, which passed its fifth anniversary back in March, will be getting enhanced visuals, Joy-Con 2 mouse control support, and "expanded online play" on January 15th. The pack will cost you $4.99 or your regional equivalent if you already own the game.</p>

<p>It's not just the Switch 2 Edition upgrade, though; a free update is also on the way for both platforms, and it brings a brand new resort hotel that you can help Kapp'n and his family to manage.</p>

<p>Those outfits may then be worn by villagers around your town, as well as people who come to visit your island via&nbsp;<em>New Horizons</em>' online play mode. Make sure you dress up those lobby mannequins nicely!</p>

<p>Everyone's favorite mole Mr. Resetti is making a reappearance in this update as well; he'll help you to reset parts of your island so that you can clean them up, and he'll get rid of things like flowers, custom designs, and objects you don't want lying around.</p>
