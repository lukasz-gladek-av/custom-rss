            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/outrun-movie-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report has emerged which claims that a movie based on the classic Sega racing property&nbsp;<em>OutRun&nbsp;</em>is in the works, and two major Hollywood figures are apparently attached to the project.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/sydney-sweeney-michael-bay-outrun-video-game-universal-1236373036/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Deadline</a>, the&nbsp;<em>OutRun&nbsp;</em>movie is in development at Universal, and attached to direct is none other than&nbsp;<em>Transformers&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&nbsp;</em>director Michael Bay.</p>

<p>Deadline says that Bay will also serve as a producer, and he'll take that role alongside&nbsp;<em>Madame Web&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Immaculate&nbsp;</em>star Sydney Sweeney, although it's not clear whether she'll be starring in the movie as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/outrun-movie-report-racing.jpg?itok=jZZt5Gh6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/outrun-movie-report-racing.jpg?itok=K5MdwUGM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>OutRun&nbsp;</em>is apparently getting a movie.</figcaption></figure><p>Currently attached to write the script for&nbsp;<em>OutRun&nbsp;</em>is Jayson Rothwell, who's penned the likes of the Mads Mikkelsen-starring&nbsp;<em>Polar&nbsp;</em>and the dark Santa Claus killer comedy&nbsp;<em>Silent Night&nbsp;</em>(the 2012 movie starring Malcolm McDowell, not the 2021 Keira Knightley movie).</p>

<p>It's likely that when it comes to developing <em>OutRun</em>, Universal has been buoyed by the phenomenal success of recent video game adaptations like A&nbsp;Minecraft Movie (the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-minecraft-movie-trailer" rel="nofollow">terrible first trailer</a> for which did nothing to dent its box office)&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/super-mario-bros-movie-stats" rel="nofollow"><em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em></a>.</p>

<p>There's also a success closer to home to which Universal can look, namely that of&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em>, the movie adaptations of which cumulatively&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-the-hedgehog-movies-1b-box-office" rel="nofollow">crossed $1 billion at the box office</a> back in January.</p>

<p>It's fair to say that video game movies are big business, but adapting&nbsp;<em>OutRun</em>, a franchise that has historically been very light indeed on story, might be a trickier prospect than doing the same for&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>or even&nbsp;<em>Mario</em>.</p>

<p>Still, if you just can't wait for more video game movies, there are plenty on the way. Nintendo's&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>movie is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/live-action-zelda-movie-march-2027" rel="nofollow">set for 2027</a>, and movies based on the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-movie-report" rel="nofollow"><em>Split Fiction</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shinobi-movie-announced" rel="nofollow"><em>Shinobi</em></a>, and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingmakers-movie-announced" rel="nofollow">Kingmakers</a>&nbsp;</em>are all apparently also in the works.</p>
