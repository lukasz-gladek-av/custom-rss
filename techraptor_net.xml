            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft Halifax, the studio responsible for developing <em>Assassin's Creed Rebellion </em>and working on games like <em>Rainbow Six Mobile</em>, has been shut down less than three weeks after it became Ubisoft's first North American location to unionize.</p><p>According to an internal staff email <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisoft-has-closed-its-halifax-studio-but-claims-decision-is-unrelated-to-recent-unionization/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">seen by VGC</a>, the decision to close the Halifax location was made as part of "company-wide cost-cutting and restructuring measures" (that's VGC's wording, not Ubisoft's), and not because of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-halifax-union" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="22333ad9-7422-4ae5-b9c7-e8c3a1c689d3" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">its recent unionization</a>.</p><p>In a statement given to VGC (which is full of the usual corporate fluff), Ubisoft said the closure was due to a company-wide push to "streamline operations, improve efficiency, and reduce costs", and that Halifax's 71 employees are being offered "comprehensive severance packages and additional career assistance".</p><figure role="group">

<p>Ubisoft Halifax's best-known export is probably the mobile game <em>Assassin's Creed Rebellion</em>, and Ubisoft will apparently be halting live operations for <em>Assassin's Creed Rebellion </em>following "a steady decline in the game's revenues", <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-shuttering-freshly-unionised-halifax-studio-71-jobs-affected" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">according to Gamesindustry.biz</a>.</p><p>As such, while the timing of Halifax's shutdown might seem a little suspicious, I'd be inclined to believe Ubisoft when it says the decision has been made for cost-cutting reasons, as callous as that might sound. After all, it's been a rough year for the publisher.</p><p>2025 saw Ubisoft making layoffs across a number of studios, including <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/massive-entertainment-ubisoft-layoffs" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="eb337fd6-aaaa-412a-8249-337dc274de4e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>The Division</em>'s Massive Entertainment</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-layoffs-redlynx-restructuring" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c40ca2ba-0c2c-453f-a503-eb81293d2704" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Trials</em>' RedLynx</a>, with longtime <em>Assassin's Creed </em>boss Marc-Alexis Côté apparently leaving the studio after two decades back in October.</p><p>Although <em>Assassin's Creed Rebellion </em>might be coming to an end, Ubisoft is still moving full steam ahead with the series; a <em>Black Flag </em>remake is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-pegi-rating" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="292d641e-bf40-464f-b78f-b4b27493ed71" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">probably about to be announced</a>, although <em>Assassin's Creed Shadows </em>will seemingly buck a recent trend by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-no-second-expansion" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b1580231-9303-463b-86b1-da6f728202d4" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">not getting a second big expansion</a>.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Senara: The Sacrament</em>'s setting of a derelict ship is pretty original.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In gameplay terms, Influsion says it's going back to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinion/what-makes-survival-horror-game" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bac7feef-be60-4457-85f4-9b44e7d6dac3" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">"classic survival horror design"</a> for <em>Senara: The Sacrament</em>, which means you can expect a "massive escape room" in which you'll need to solve puzzles and manage your resources carefully.</p><p>The game will very much feature combat, too, if its new trailer is anything to go by; you can expect to come across monsters wandering the Senara's corridors, and you'll need to choose whether to put them down or sneak past them to conserve ammo.</p><p>Narrative-wise, meanwhile, Influsion is promising a tale that's "open to interpretation", with "snippets of truth scattered across documents, objects, and conversations between characters" to discover. You'll need to piece the story together yourself based on what you find.</p><p>You can check out the new trailer for <em>Senara: The Sacrament</em>, which features a few tantalizing glimpses of gameplay, right here.</p>
<p>Influsion says it's used technology like LiDAR and photogrammetry to create a "scan of a real-life documentary-accuracy 6,000-ton ship" for <em>Senara: The Sacrament</em>, too, although I'm not sure the monsters can claim the same honor.</p><p><em>Senara: The Sacrament </em>doesn't have a release date yet, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3915120/SENARA_The_Sacrament/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">wishlist it right here on Steam</a>, and a demo is on its way in February as well.

            <guid>1399405</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Japanese company Hitachi has announced a new voice command software protocol for the Switch 2, and I, for one, am daring to hope it could be used to finally bring old DS games to the system.</p><p>As spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/hitachi-launches-multilingual-intuitive-voice-command-recognition-software-for-nintendo-switch-2-game-devs/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Automaton Media</a>, the Ruby Spotter software allows developers to incorporate voice command features beyond simply using the microphone for communication. It's actually already available in a number of other places, including "car navigation systems" and "industrial equipment", according to Automaton.</p><p>Hitachi's decision to bring the software to the Switch 2 is driven by a desire to create an environment for developers to include "highly flexible operations" for the microphone in their games, including menu selections and issuing in-game commands.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>New voice command options will soon be available to Nintendo Switch 2 developers.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The possibilities are endless; developers could use Hitachi's Ruby Spotter software to allow you to issue commands to troops in a strategy game, for instance, or to communicate with an in-game character, <em>Nintendogs</em>-style.</p><p>That might as well bring us onto what I really hope this software can be used for: porting DS games to the Switch 2. Since there's already a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-klonoa-mr-driller" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="201c59bf-eb51-4121-bbf8-ae2b52eff44c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">robust library</a> of Game Boy Advance <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-starfy-gba" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="40d7514b-1ab5-4518-bcb1-2874c7dd70bf" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">games</a> on the Switch Online service, I think the debut of DS titles is way past due.</p><p>Games like <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Phantom Hourglass </em>and the aforementioned <em>Nintendogs </em>used the Nintendo DS' microphone as part of their gameplay, and Hitachi's Ruby Spotter could allow Nintendo to bring those games (which are otherwise unavailable) to the Switch 2.</p><p>As it stands, there are tons of DS games, including the ones I've mentioned, that you'll need to turn to the second-hand market to enjoy, and so this would seem like the perfect opportunity to port them to modern systems. Come on, Nintendo. You know it makes sense.</p><figure role="group">
