            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new Critical Role actual play is coming at the end of this month. This new show, Draw Your Weapons, is in collaboration with Titmouse Animation, the studio behind many beloved and critically acclaimed mature animated shows and features.</p><p>According to an official press release, the <em>Draw Your Weapons</em> actual play will follow a group of adventurers as they venture across the city of Port Promise and beyond on increasingly unhinged quests. The game will be GM'd by <em>The Tonight Show's</em> Josh Knapp and feature players Rashawn Scott (<em>South Side</em>), Sean Glaze (<em>Regular Show</em>), Heather Mahler, and Jason Charles Miller.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The twist on this actual play comes from the "draw" in the title. As the game progresses, standup comedian Blaine Capatch and Titmouse CEO Chris Prynoski will provide play-by-play commentary, confessional cutaways and live drawing. These drawings will bring the group's worst ideas to life.</p><p>Anything that is drawn like this becomes something the world will have to deal with. This includes monsters, magic items. gadgets, idiotic plans, anything. The result is a show meant to channel "fast, loud DIY/Punk energy." The presser doesn't state what system the game will use, but given the chaotic nature of the premise, just about any system can fit.</p><p>Titmouse Animation has a storied history of making acclaimed animated shows aimed at older audiences. Their work includes the iconic <em>Venture Bros.</em>, the animated <em>Star Trek: Lower Decks</em>, the HBO series <em>Scavengers Reign</em>, and even adapting Critical Role's work with <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/legend-of-vox-machina-season-3-review-darker-season-of-dd-twists" rel="nofollow"><em>The Legend of Vox Machina</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/critical-role-mighty-nein-season-1-review-but-theres-only-eight-episodes-of-you" rel="nofollow"><em>The Mighty Nein</em></a><em>. </em>They've even started branching into their own <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/titmouses-heady-board-game-drunkards-druggies-delinquents-will-be-available-at-end-of" rel="nofollow">tabletop games</a>.</p><p><em>Draw Your Weapons</em> will debut exclusively on Critical Role's streaming platform Beacon on February 25, 2026 with new episodes released every Wednesday.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
