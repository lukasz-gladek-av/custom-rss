            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Kojima Productions has revealed the&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>release date, and the long-awaited sequel is on its way to PlayStation 5 in summer.</p>

<p>Per a new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach&nbsp;</em>launches on June 26th. Unlike <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-directors-cut-pc-release-coming-to-steam" rel="nofollow">the original</a>, this one's a PS5 exclusive, although it's worth noting that&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>originally launched exclusively for PS4 before receiving a PC release (and then an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-xbox-release-kojima-ip" rel="nofollow">Xbox release</a>) later on down the line.</p>

<p>As well as revealing the release date, Kojima Productions also announced that pre-orders for&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>will begin on March 17th at 10am local time, so make sure to add that to your calendar if you want to get in early.</p>

<p>Naturally, that includes more spectacular scenery, more labyrinthine conversations between extremely famous people, and lots more walking. I'm looking forward to it tremendously.</p>

<p>In the trailer, you can catch glimpses not only of returning characters like Norman Reedus' Sam Porter Bridges or&nbsp;Léa Seydoux's Fragile, but also new players like Luca Marinelli's Neil and Debra Wilson's Doctor, as well as&nbsp;<em>Mad Max: Fury Road&nbsp;</em>director George Miller as Tarman.</p>

<p>You can check out the release date announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>right here. It's worth setting aside ten minutes or so to watch the whole thing, as it's exactly the kind of bonkers excess we've come to expect from Hideo Kojima.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em>, it's the sequel to 2019's&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding</em>. Originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-confirmed-by-norman-reedus" rel="nofollow">leaked by lead actor Norman Reedus</a> in 2022, the game was subsequently officially revealed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-trailer-revealed-at-game-awards-2022" rel="nofollow">at that year's Game Awards</a>.</p>

<p>It's not the only project Kojima is currently working on, either; he's also currently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideo-kojima-announces-new-game-od-in-partnership-with-xbox-and-filmmaker-jordan-peele" rel="nofollow">working on the mysterious&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideo-kojima-announces-new-game-od-in-partnership-with-xbox-and-filmmaker-jordan-peele" rel="nofollow">OD</a>&nbsp;</em>alongside&nbsp;<em>Get Out&nbsp;</em>director Jordan Peele, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideo-kojima-announces-next-generation-espionage-action-game" rel="nofollow">"next-generation espionage action game"&nbsp;<em>Physint</em></a>.</p>

<p><em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>launches exclusively for <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a> on June 26th.</p>
