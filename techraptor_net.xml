            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>True believers, the official <em>Spider-Man Secret Lair</em> has been announced. Alongside its upcoming <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/exclusive-mtg-spider-man-spoilers-card-reveals" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>MTG Spider-Man</em></a> set, Wizards of the Coast have announced several drops of cards featuring the wisecracking wallcrawler.</p>

<h2>The <em>Spider-Man Secret Lair</em> Announcement</h2>

<p>In an official <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/feature/secret-lair-spider-man-superdrop" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a>, Wizards of the Coast announced the Spider-Man Secret Lair will be a Superdrop containing six drops of cards. These drops will feature classic Magic cards reimagined in the style of Marvel's iconic superhero.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/spider-man-secret-lair-daily-bugle-promo-artwork.jpg?itok=g4hRCsl8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/spider-man-secret-lair-daily-bugle-promo-artwork.jpg?itok=SXukhCeR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>But Wizards of the Coast are being secretive about the contents of these drops. The post contains an early scoop of one of those drops, titled <em>Secret Lair x Spider-Man: Daily Bugle Breaking News</em>. As for the other five drops, they are mum at this time.</p>

<p>Thankfully, the cards in the <em>Daily Bugle Breaking News</em> drop are visually striking. As the name implies, it reimagines the cards as front page stories from the Daily Bugle, complete with a front-page photo, headline, and mana cost where the newspaper cost should be. The artwork is striking, featuring Spidey and other iconic characters like Miles Morales, The Green Goblin, and the Rhino.</p>

<p>The <em>Daily Bugle Breaking News</em> drop will contain the following cards:</p>

<ul><li><em>Fact or Fiction</em></li>
	<li><em>Frantic Search</em></li>
	<li><em>Scheming Symmetry</em></li>
	<li><em>Blasphemous Act</em></li>
	<li><em>Impact Tremors</em></li>
</ul><p>This isn't the first time a Marvel character has arrived in <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a>. Earlier this year, the fourth-wall-breaking merc with a mouth, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/deadpool-secret-lair-brings-merc-with-mouth-to-magic-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Deadpool</a>, got the Secret Lair treatment.</p>

<p>As for how much mileage Wizards of the Coast can get out of Spider-Man, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/mtg-spider-man-villains-bonus-sheet-and-infinity-stone-revealed" rel="nofollow">the previews</a> of the upcoming Magic set have shown that nothing is off the table. <em>Spider-Man</em> villains like Venom and Prowler. <em>Spider-Man</em> supporting characters like Black Cat. Spider-Man memes. It's all free game. The question is how well will it be done.</p>

<p>The Spider-Man Secret Lair Superdrop will be available September 22. The <em>Daily Bugle Breaking News</em> drop will be available in non-foil (MSRP $29.99) and foil (MSRP $39.99)</p>

      <div><p>Beadle &amp; Grimm have launched a new crowdfunding success. Their new project is <em>Skullduggery</em>, an urban fantasy supplement for the latest edition of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>, and it reached its initial funding goal in just 17 minutes.</p>

<h2>The <em>Skullduggery</em> Kickstarter Campaign</h2>

<p>According to the campaign page, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/beadleandgrimms/skullduggery-urban-adventures-5e/description" rel="nofollow"><em>Skullduggery</em></a> is the newest project by Beadle &amp; Grimm's Pandemonium Warehouse. As mentioned above, the supplement contains new city-themed character options. These include new subclasses, backgrounds, species, feats, spells and equipment, all designed for the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> 2024 ruleset.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skullduggery-city-promo-artwork.jpg?itok=TK8wFl4p 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skullduggery-city-promo-artwork.jpg?itok=TmV8EEHC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Some of those subclasses reflect a grittier, darker tone from <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. The Path of Metamorphosis Barbarian amplifies their body with experimental alchemy. The Grim Reaper Patron Warlock lets casters make a literal deal with Death. The Circle of Vermin Druid provides one command of creatures that scurry in a city's cracks. The list goes on.</p>

<p>As for the new species, <em>Skullduggery</em> leans into the macabre and strange. The new Forsaken species is a mortal tainted by necrotic energies, existing in a state between life and death. Alternatively, there is the Mycelium, fungal plant creatures drawn to the city, searching for their wayward god.</p>

<p><em>Skullduggery</em> also contains tools for DMs. It includes city establishment, organization rules, and a swath of prewritten locations, characters, and groups. These are vital for DMs wanting to run a campaign set in city streets and dubious alleyways. intrigue, deadly poison, and duplicitous guilds. In addition, the book contains a prewritten adventure, <em>The Oppression of Blood</em>, which will take players from levels 1-9.</p>

<p>This volume of content is not unexpected for Beadle &amp; Grimm. The company has a reputation for creating bespoke, premium boxed versions of different fantasy campaigns like <em>Curse of Strahd</em> or <em>Pathfinder's</em> <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/absalom-city-of-omens-gold-edition-brings-premium-pathfinder-thrills" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Absalom, City of Omens</em></a>.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Burnt Haze for $25:</strong> A PDF copy of the main book and all stretch goals</li>
	<li><strong>VTT Bundle for $40:</strong> The adventure module, tokens, maps, Compendiums, and add-ons, all on Roll20</li>
