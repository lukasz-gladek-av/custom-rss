            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xvi-sales-3-5m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report has emerged which claims that&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI&nbsp;</em>sales are sitting at around 3.5 million, a figure that seemingly encapsulates the game's sales on both PC and PlayStation 5.</p>

<p>This figure comes via analyst <a href="https://kabutan.jp/news/marketnews/?b=n202503130535" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Hideki Yasuda</a> (note: article is in Japanese, so we're using machine translation), who cites recent comments by Square Enix head Takashi Kiryu during a financial results briefing call.</p>

<p>As a reminder, Square Enix said back in September that both&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-16-rebirth-profits-square-enix" rel="nofollow">had not met its "expectations"</a> with regards to sales, so it looks as though the company was expecting more than the 3.5 million figure quoted here.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-xvi-sales-3.5m-combat.jpg?itok=jEyBIo1l 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-xvi-sales-3.5m-combat.jpg?itok=tR3RIhS1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Final Fantasy XVI&nbsp;</em>sales are apparently sitting at around 3.5 million.</figcaption></figure><p>Yasuda also reiterates that&nbsp;the&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest 3&nbsp;</em>remake <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-outsold-expectations" rel="nofollow">outsold expectations</a>, calling the game a "huge hit" and pointing to its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">two million sales</a> (at last count; that figure may well have increased since then).</p>

<p>It's been almost two years since&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI&nbsp;</em>was released, and a few days after the game's initial launch in June 2023, Square Enix said it had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xvi-shipments" rel="nofollow">shipped three million copies</a>.</p>

<p>However, it's important to note that "shipments" and "sales" aren't necessarily the same thing; it is, after all, entirely possible that not all of those three million copies were sold to customers, at least initially.</p>

<p>Assuming all of those copies were indeed sold, that would mean&nbsp;<em>FFXVI&nbsp;</em>has picked up another half a million sales for itself since launch, which isn't particularly impressive given that it's a mainline&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>game with a (presumably) pretty hefty budget behind it.</p>




<p>If you're not up to speed with&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>, it's the latest mainline installment in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>series (although it's far from the sixteenth actual game in the franchise).</p>

<p>The game revolves around Clive Rosfield, a man who must navigate a world of political intrigue and strife while also coming to terms with a burgeoning power he shouldn't have.&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI&nbsp;</em>moves further away from the series' RPG roots; it's essentially a character action-style game rather than a JRPG.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI&nbsp;</em>right now on PC and PlayStation 5. If you want to know what our Andrew Stretch thought of the game, you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/final-fantasy-xvi-review" rel="nofollow">check out his review here</a>.</p>
