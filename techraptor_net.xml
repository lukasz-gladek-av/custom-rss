            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/fantasy-ttrpg-defy-gods-brings-duplicitous-deities-to-kickstarter<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new fantasy TTRPG campaign, <em>Defy The Gods</em>, created by Chris Sellers, has hit Kickstarter. Players can play as characters vying for power and romance and create the cast of gods conspiring against them.</p>

<h2>The <em>Defy The Gods</em> TTRPG Campaign</h2>

<p>According to the campaign page, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hecticelectron/defy-the-gods/description" rel="nofollow"><em>Defy The Gods</em></a>&nbsp; is a sword and sorcery Powered By The Apocalypse TTRPG packed with passionate romance, cursed power, and bold adventure. Its inspirations include <em>Conan</em>, <em>Clash of the Titans</em>, and <em>Princess Mononoke</em>.</p>

<p>In addition, Defy The Gods, is a game about queer love. It is a game of universal visceral attraction. A game where players can win anyone's romantic interest. Alternatively, you can use that attraction to your benefit, using that attraction to distract or thwart them. In this sense, it is similar to another story of queer love, <em>Thirsty Sword Lesbians</em>.</p>

<p>This queer theming is key to the intended experience of <em>Defy The Gods</em>. This world's pantheon of Gods hates you, and the rulers of the City wish to push your character to the margins. As impressive as your characters are, they will struggle against the forces conspiring against you. Simply living a free life in this context is defiance.</p>

In between adventures, players take on the role of World Forces. These can be City officials or even the gods themselves. In these scenes, players can get the Game Master's imagination rolling with where they want the story to go in these scenes.</p>
