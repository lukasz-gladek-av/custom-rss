<p>You'll play as someone who's just been awakened from 150 years of cryosleep, and you'll have to commit yourself to your new role of Alien Entry Examiner despite the fact that you're suffering from amnesia.</p><p>While examining aliens' applications, you can summon them to an interrogation room, and by summoning different combinations of aliens, you may learn more about their motivations for coming to Earth.</p><p>Additionally, you'll have to figure out whether prosperous aliens who can contribute to the planet via tourism or academia could also be dangerous individuals; getting this wrong could lead to "irreversible consequences", according to Arc.</p><p>Each day, you'll be greeted with a morning news bulletin that will reflect how well you did in screening aliens and allowing the right ones to join the Earth population. You can check out a trailer for <em>Donutal </em>here.</p>
<p><em>Donutal </em>is coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3971730/Donutal/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC via Steam</a> sometime this year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 </em>developer The Chinese Room has revealed that it's partnered up with <em>Valor Mortis </em>publisher Lyrical Games for its next project, so it looks like <em>Bloodlines 2</em>'s failure hasn't dissuaded the studio.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.thechineseroom.co.uk/games/unannounced-new-project" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">news post</a> on its official website, The Chinese Room says the "upcoming, unannounced" project will be published by Lyrical Games, but that the British developer will retain "creative autonomy and IP ownership".</p><p>Lyrical Games' duties will include "full financing, strategic production support, and collaborative go-to-market planning", which sounds about right for a publisher. The Chinese Room says the partnership with the publisher builds on Lyrical's "commitment to backing distinctive, high-craft projects".</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>The Chinese Room is moving on from <em>Bloodlines 2 </em>with the help of Lyrical Games.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The Chinese Room CEO Ed Daly says the partnership will give the studio the "confidence and support to push creatively" in order to "stand out in today's market", while Lyrical head Blake Rochkind says the developer's next game has a "strong vision" and that his company is aiming to "remove friction" from development.</p><p>Assuming this project is next in The Chinese Room's pipeline, it'll be the studio's first game since last year's poorly-received <em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-indefinitely" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="14f47468-9696-4619-adfe-4a904a94f05a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">spent a long time</a> in development hell before being <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-back-developed-by-chinese-room" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="424a86e4-db05-4ea2-9339-418c1fb748b3" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">"rescued" by the British developer</a>.</p><p>Reflecting on <em>Bloodlines 2</em>'s poor reception, former Chinese Room head Dan Pinchbeck <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloodlines-2-name-chinese-room" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ec744b99-1543-4387-b78c-dd265b6df66b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">suggested that the game shouldn't have been released</a> under the <em>Bloodlines </em>name, which created expectations the studio was unable to meet.</p><p>Whether Pinchbeck is right or not, <em>Bloodlines 2 </em>was released as <em>Bloodlines 2</em>, and it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paradox-financials-bloodlines-2-2025" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="cdaf779b-8a75-48a8-9d81-99d3be95566b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">resulted in a pretty dismal year</a> for publisher Paradox thanks to its failure. It's probably safe to say that whatever The Chinese Room's next game is, it's not <em>Bloodlines 3</em>.</p>
<p>The Chinese Room might have been the outfit behind <em>Bloodlines 2</em>, but the studio is usually better-known for its contemplative narrative games (which some might refer to as "walking simulators") like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chinese-room-still-wakes-the-deep-release-date" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c24b924e-d035-4ba1-a306-060800f9d7e1" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Still Wakes the Deep</em></a><em> </em>and <em>Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs</em>.</p><p>We'll have to wait and see whether this project is more like those games than <em>Bloodlines 2</em>, but for now, it looks like The Chinese Room has secured a publisher, at least. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

<p>As you might expect from a Switch 2 Edition release, <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X </em>will have enhanced resolution and increased frame rates on Switch 2; Nintendo promises "up to 4K" and "up to 60fps" from the Switch 2 version.</p><p>In case you need a reminder, <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition </em>was released for Switch <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-announced" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e9821622-ca34-49c3-84e7-5f3c82fe15ea" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">back in March last year</a>. It is, as the name suggests, a re-release of the 2015 RPG, which was previously exclusive to the Wii U.</p><p>The new version doesn't just give <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X </em>a new coat of paint; it's also got new story content for you to enjoy, as well as improvements to the game's UI (and, yes, graphical improvements and tweaks).</p><p>If you want to get a sense for how <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition </em>runs on Switch 2, you can check out the new trailer below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Bungie has revealed that <em>Destiny 2</em>'s Shadow and Order update will be delayed by quite a significant amount of time in order for the devs to implement "large revisions".</p><p>Speaking on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/destinythegame.bungie.net/post/3mf63bvtcms2g" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bluesky</a>, Bungie says the update, which was originally due to arrive in just a couple of weeks, will now be launching across all platforms on June 9th instead. The delay is being put into place so that Bungie can "include sizable quality-of-life updates".</p><p>Not only has the update been delayed, but it'll also be renamed now as well, so when it does arrive, make sure you're not looking for patch notes for Shadow and Order, because they won't exist.</p><figure role="group">

<p>Previously-announced features like weapon tier upgrading will still be included in whatever Shadow and Order ends up being called, but Bungie is also adding new features like tier 5 stats for Exotic armor sets, expanding Tiered Gear to raids and dungeons, and more.</p><p><em>Destiny 2 </em>isn't going to sleep between now and June, either; Bungie promises that the game will receive regular quality-of-life updates before then, as well as the Guardian Games event in March and "the return of a more frequent Iron Banner cadence" in April.</p><p>Don't expect too much more info about Shadow and Order anytime soon, though; Bungie says it'll reveal more about the update, as well as what's coming next for <em>Destiny 2</em>, "closer to launch", and doesn't provide a more specific date than that.</p><p>News of this <em>Destiny 2 </em>update delay comes as the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marathon-release-date-march-2026" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="06a260e7-cfea-4d2e-a2bf-946953eeac4f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">release date for extraction shooter <em>Marathon</em></a><em> </em>rapidly approaches. Bungie hasn't named the game as a reason for its <em>Destiny 2 </em>plans changing, but given past <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shocking-no-one-bungies-marathon-delayed" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b9bec301-96aa-432b-879e-d90acf44097c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">delays</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-marathon-art-stolen" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5bd258c2-70a9-4816-a5f2-9f981d275fcc" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">controversies</a>, <em>Marathon </em>is likely to require a lot of Bungie's attention at launch.</p>
<p><em>Destiny 2</em>'s Shadow and Order update, or whatever the studio changes its name to, will be arriving on June 9th.
