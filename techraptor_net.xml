            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Possessor(s)&nbsp;</em>is a new, rather awkwardly-titled Metroidvania from&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hyper-light-drifter" rel="nofollow">Hyper Light Drifter</a>&nbsp;</em>studio Heart Machine and indie powerhouse Devolver Digital, and it asks a very important question: what would happen if you found yourself sharing your brain with a demon?</p>

<p>Well, if this roughly 15-20-hour adventure is anything to go by, it turns out the answer is simple: you'd end up exploring a sprawling map, unlocking a suite of movement abilities, and fighting challenging bosses to progress a story about "codependency, loss, and survival", according to the devs.</p>

<p>I won't mince words at the outset:&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)</em>&nbsp;offers a pretty bog-standard example of its genre, at least in gameplay terms, and I'm not entirely sure its narrative explores the aforementioned themes with enough depth or complexity to make it worth recommending either.</p>

<h2><em>Possessor(s)&nbsp;</em>Is Metroidvania By the Numbers</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/possessors-review-exploration.jpg?itok=L83ybhHF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/possessors-review-exploration.jpg?itok=THqnYZPC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Possessor(s)&nbsp;</em>doesn't have much new to offer in structural terms.</figcaption></figure><p>Despite an initially enthralling and fascinating setting - that of a city wracked by an apocalyptic event and still shuddering with the aftereffects of demonic invasion -&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)&nbsp;</em>quickly settles into a rather rote Metroidvania rhythm.</p>

<p>If you've played the greats in the genre, like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hollow-knight" rel="nofollow">Hollow Knight</a>&nbsp;</em>(or, indeed, <i><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/castlevania-symphony-of-night" rel="nofollow">Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</a>&nbsp;</i>and <i>Super Metroid</i>), then you'll know what to expect here.</p>

<p>You'll gradually uncover a large, interconnected space full of themed areas, using newly-acquired traversal powers to reach hitherto-unavailable spaces, all while upgrading your combat abilities and survival capacity as you go.</p>

<p>It's not a particularly inspired take on the genre's typical gameplay conceits, and short of repurposing certain household objects as weapons - main character Luca will wield kitchen knives or a baseball bat rather than swords and spears - there's not much here that's pushing the envelope.</p>

<p>Of course, if you're looking for nothing more than a structurally unchallenging exploration-based platformer with some solid combat, that may not be a drawback for you, but if you're searching for any kind of innovation from your next Metroidvania hit, it's safe to look elsewhere.</p>

<p>Occasionally, the level design and art style will offer a diverting vista; you'll see a huge rupture in reality off in the background, for instance, or a series of floating office desks serving as platforms - but they're little more than set dressing for a very straightforward set of maps.</p>

<h2>Combat in&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)&nbsp;</em>Is Fun, but Repetitive</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/possessors-review-tygo.jpg?itok=dJdGrZyW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/possessors-review-tygo.jpg?itok=lZZhmk0Z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Boss fights in&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)&nbsp;</em>are a rare highlight.</figcaption></figure><p>Solid is very much the word to describe the combat in&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)</em>. Heart Machine says the combat here contains "elements of platform fighters" like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/super-smash-bros-ultimate" rel="nofollow"><em>Super Smash Bros</em>.</a></p>

<p>That's&nbsp;superficially true; you can juggle enemies and use a variety of different special attacks mapped to directional button-attack combos, and you can utilize an aerial dodge to keep yourself safe from nasty air attacks as well.</p>

<p>Honestly, though, I managed to make it through&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)&nbsp;</em>without using most of the purportedly&nbsp;<em>Smash Bros.</em>-inspired moves at Luca's disposal. Early on, you'll unlock a parry (another increasingly overused mechanic, I think), and that'll carry you through the majority of <em>Possessor(s)</em>.</p>

<p>For the most part, combat in&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)&nbsp;</em>works pretty well, even if it fails to realize its full&nbsp;platform fighter potential.</p>

<p>Attacks land with a fairly satisfying heft (provided you're using a heavier weapon like the baseball bat), and knocking enemies against walls once their&nbsp;<em>Sekiro</em>-style poise is broken can be cathartic as well.</p>

<p>Unfortunately,&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)&nbsp;</em>falls into a very common trap that's littered with the corpses of lesser Metroidvanias, and that's enemy variety. Put simply, you'll have seen every enemy on offer here within the first handful of hours, and the rest is essentially going through the motions.</p>

<p>As it progresses, Heart Machine's adventure will throw enemy variants at you, but they're little more than palette swaps with slightly more powerful attacks, so dodging or parrying them is a matter of dull course.</p>

<p>As is usually the case with games that struggle with enemy variety,&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)&nbsp;</em>quickly devolves into muscle memory and tedium. I was begging for just one or two surprises to be hurled at me, but those surprises never came, and fighting the same set of possessed objects and animals became insanely repetitive.</p>

<p>Bosses are a slightly different matter; while there aren't many of them (and&nbsp;the sidequests reuse them in a borderline unforgivable manner), they're fun to fight and surprising in terms of their movesets. It's just the parts in between that feel boring.</p>

<h2><em>Possessor(s)&nbsp;</em>Has an Okay, If Uninspired Story</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/possessors-review-story.jpg?itok=gDaMcKCY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/possessors-review-story.jpg?itok=Yzu-rYFG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Possessor(s)</em>' story isn't particularly new, but its characters are alright.</figcaption></figure><p>With combat and map exploration proving relatively unexciting, it's up to&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)</em>' story to pick up the slack, but I don't know if it's ready to bear that kind of weight.</p>

<p>The characters here are endearing enough. Luca is a guarded young girl who's suddenly having to share her head with a demon, Rhem; they both need each other to survive at the outset of&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)</em>, so their relationship is initially an uneasy one.</p>

<p>From that setup, however, I'm sure you can quickly guess how things are going to end up. Could it be that Luca and Rhem will find a grudging respect for one another as they both learn about their respective histories?</p>

<p>That's the core problem with&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)'&nbsp;</em>story in a nutshell; everything unfolds in an entirely obvious and predictable manner. A corporation called Agradyne, which manufactures batteries, is involved, and the fact that it's a corporation is literally all you need to know about its role in the narrative.</p>

<p>There are no twists or turns here, nothing that surprised or engaged me beyond the baseline level. At times,&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)&nbsp;</em>revealed information to me that I think it thought was surprising, but I just rolled my eyes and said "well, obviously".</p>

<p>With that said, Heart Machine must have been doing something at least vaguely right, because I did have a tiny little lump in my throat at&nbsp;the story's conclusion. I don't think it's a particularly memorable tale, but it serves its purpose while it's around.</p>

<h2><em>Possessor(s)&nbsp;</em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/possessors-review-whip.jpg?itok=Xi-wx6bG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/possessors-review-whip.jpg?itok=tNoGmtIe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>From downtown!</figcaption></figure><p>I enjoyed my time with&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)&nbsp;</em>exactly enough to play through it once and then never think about it again. Its well-worn story is played out and unengaging, but its characters are fun enough to be around for exactly the time they're on screen and no more.</p>

<p>If you're a fan of Metroidvanias, like me, you'll quickly settle into the familiar Sunday-afternoon rhythm of&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)</em>, but those who don't like the genre or who are still coming down from the high of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong" rel="nofollow">Silksong</a>&nbsp;</em>can safely wait before being possessed by this particular demon.</p>
