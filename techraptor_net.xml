            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvelous-story-of-seasons-leadership-change<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Marvelous, the studio behind franchises like&nbsp;<em>Story of Seasons&nbsp;</em>(formerly&nbsp;<em>Harvest Moon</em>) and&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory</em>, has announced a change in leadership owing to its poor financial performance over the last nine months.</p>

<p>Per an Automaton Media <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/rune-factory-developer-marvelous-announces-change-in-leadership-and-executive-pay-cuts-due-to-companys-recent-weak-performance/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, the studio recently published its financial results for the first three quarters of the 2024-25 fiscal year, and sales and net profit are both down (by 4.8% and 12.4% respectively) when compared to the same period last year.</p>

<p>As a result, current CEO Sato Suminobu will step down from his position in March, although he'll remain a director at the company. He'll be replaced as company CEO by Shinichi Terui, who's currently serving as an executive director at Marvelous.</p>

<p>As Automaton points out, Marvelous released two major projects in the nine-month period between April and December 2024, namely farming RPG&nbsp;<em>Farmagia&nbsp;</em>and a re-release of the remake of&nbsp;<em>Story of Seasons: Friends of Mineral Town</em>.</p>

<p>The latter, according to Marvelous, performed "steadily", but there's no indication as to how the former did. Given the change in leadership and&nbsp;<em>Farmagia</em>'s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2508770/Farmagia/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">terminally low Steam review count</a>, however, it's unlikely the game sold particularly well.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that a new&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory&nbsp;</em>game,&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em>, is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-release-date" rel="nofollow">coming in May</a>, but since Marvelous' financial year ends in March, the game won't be released in time for it to affect the studio's 2024-25 fiscals.</p>

Stay tuned for more on this and all other things Marvelous.</p>
