<p>Earth, our birthplace and cradle is lost, swallowed by millennia and cosmic vastness. Our ships cannot pass through the Limit, confining us to a hundred heliospheres. We see the greater universe but cannot touch it. Are we imprisoned or kept safe?</p>

<p>Zeotech brings us technological marvels. But no matter how far we travel, how far science advances, our shortcomings follow. One hundred suns and we yearn for more. Some must seek further, delve deeper, uncover secrets no matter the warnings that their curiosity will bring disaster. Others are never content with a fair share, needing to dominate and control. History’s lessons are ignored. Mistakes of the past hound us.</p>

<p>Humanity struggles to find meaning, ever at odds with itself, and now a whole star system has disappeared. Dread and paranoia threaten to tear us apart. Previously clandestine powers vie brazenly to control humanity’s future, undeterred by the growing crisis. Across more and more battlefields elite zeoform pilots lead their specialist support teams in swift, dynamic combat. Limited, covert raids give way to open conflict as we stumble towards all-out war.</p>

<p>Welcome to <em>Zeo Genesis</em>, an upcoming skirmish miniatures game from Best Hobby, featuring game and lore design from industry veterans Andy Chambers and Gav Thorpe. The sci-fi setting sees rival factions battling it out with Zeoforms, known as Zeos. The various factions that populate the worlds aren't at outright war, but that doesn't stop covert operations, small skirmishes, brawls, and grudges from being settled.</p>

<p><em>Zeo Genesis</em> currently has a preview page on <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/projects/best-hobby/zeo-genesis-scalable-smirmish-game" rel="nofollow">Gamefound</a>, and the playtest rules are also available for free on their webpage <a href="https://www.zeogenesis.com/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. We've been sent a 3D-printed demo set to preview here, and while the forces should reflect those included in the first 2-player starter set, the material the miniatures are made from will change. The rules may also develop between now and the games' publication.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zeo-genesis-5.jpg?itok=ds5koLgn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zeo-genesis-5.jpg?itok=CequzrXO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Mechanical Skirmish Mechanics</h2>

<p>I won't take you through all the rules for <em>Zeo Genesis</em>, as you can&nbsp;read them in full&nbsp;<a href="https://www.zeogenesis.com/" rel="nofollow">here</a>, but I will highlight some of the mechanics that make it stand out for me. The first is the turn sequence, which consists of players taking alternate actions until they run out of actions. This won't sound uncommon for wargames used to alternate action games, but what stands out is that <em>Zeo Genesis</em> only has a single game turn. Once players run out of actions, they take a regroup action, which refreshes all of the action points on their units but doesn't let you activate that turn, with play passing back to your opponent, meaning you will miss that activation.</p>

<p>The second mechanical element I like is the action/reaction system. Each unit has a number of action points available to it, and these can be used to enter an activation mode when it's your turn to activate or to react when one of your units is targeted. When you activate a unit, you pick an activation mode, which then allows your unit to complete a small series of actions, like the Melee activation mode, which gives you 2 move actions and a melee action, with additional melee actions for each unused move action. This allows you to either melee 3 times with a unit you're engaged with or any combination of move and fight actions as required. Or you could take the Charge action, allowing you to take a snapshot shoot action, followed by 2 move actions, and a melee action if you're able to get into base contact with an enemy.</p>

<p>It all combines to give&nbsp;<em>Zeo Genesis</em> a system that feels like a cross between <em>Infinity</em> and <em>Bushido</em> (2 of my favorite wargaming systems), with no slow down for turns as you just keep taking actions, tactically timing your regroup action. The Zeos are also pretty durable, so the action-reaction system works very well as your units won't just be deleted with one hit, and there's no slowdown, it just feels like one epic action phase.</p>

<p>At launch, and the demo pack we received, features 2 factions from the <em>Zeo Genesis</em> universe. The first, Pact, are a freeform gathering of explorers and thinkers, a group that pledged to aid each other. Their force in the demo set is led by the towering Amaroq Masterform Zeo, armed here with the Meson Canon, which increases its damage stat for each hit scored, and the Hivestream, which fires multiple rockets into a blast area, but it has several other weapon options depending on how you equip it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zeo-genesis-7.jpg?itok=3_mla_qy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zeo-genesis-7.jpg?itok=iF1PJUCp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Pact forces from our <em>Zeo Genesis</em> demo kit, led by the huge Amaroq Zeo.</figcaption></figure><p>Supporting the Amaroq is a Bokujin, a drone controller and 4 drones of 2 types that can capture objectives, draw enemy fire and disrupt attacks, and to provide heavier support, the Skerpskutter, armed with either the low attack, high damage AZ Lance, or the Beamer with 4 attack that increases damage with each hit.</p>

<p>The other faction are the Guardcorps, the police enforcers of a powerful private enterprise group. Rather than a single powerful Zeo, the Guardcorps are led by 2 Stormer Zeos that we had multiple weapon options for. We opted for 1 with a Gulo Assault Rifle and the other with a Claviger Battle Rifle. Both weapons have high damage for targeting the Amaroq and the option to fire smart rounds that don't need line of sight to fire.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zeo-genesis-6.jpg?itok=3a5iF4Q8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zeo-genesis-6.jpg?itok=711P7__a 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Guardcorps forces from our <em>Zeo Genesis</em> demo kit, led by 2 Stormer Zeos.</figcaption></figure><p>Backing up the Stormers are 3 Troopers, 2 of ours are armed with short-range, high-attack carbines, and the other with the longer range higher damage rifle. Further support is added with the Tech Ops unit, who can keep the Zeos in the fight, and Hyane Pursuit Drones, who are great at taking down enemy support units or can remain close to your Zeos and take damage for them.</p>

<p>I had an absolute blast with <em>Zeo Genesis</em>. The core rules and army lists are still in development, but I already love the flow of the system and how it feels with the big mechs, supported by the ancillary units. The armament options and the current variety of units gives a lot of flexibility in list construction, and I like how the system scales well as the points go up and the amount of Zeos you field increases. The printed miniatures we got aren't the final material, they'll be multipart hard plastic when the campaign delivers, but the sculpts are great, and the setting gives infinite flexibility in how you paint your team. There's a lot we haven't talked about in this preview, which we'll save for the full review, or you can discover for yourself by testing the playtest rules, but this is one to watch for sure, and its success at crowdfunding will only make it better and expand faster with more units and factions.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/sugardew-island-review-farming-on-budget<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In a world long abandoned by humans, you'll soon take on the role of restoring balance through the power of growing crops and selling produce. This&nbsp;<em>Sugardew Island</em>&nbsp;review will explore Rokaplay's latest entry into the Farming RPG genre — a game that also happens to have a dash of shop simulator gameplay mixed in.</p>

<p>In&nbsp;<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4f429af4-356a-4124-a879-487ced844db8" href="https://techraptor.net/games/sugardew-island" rel="nofollow"><em>Sugardew Island</em></a>, players take on the role of a human whose boat has crashed into the titular island. Fortunately, a merchant named Tomte rescues you and sets you up in a derelict (but serviceable) house. In a tale as old as time, you've been put in charge of bringing a dilapidated farm back to life.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sugardew-island-review-managing-the-shop-in-sugardew-island.jpg?itok=bhtTHyU0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sugardew-island-review-managing-the-shop-in-sugardew-island.jpg?itok=2n10yPgm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Running the shop takes time, but you'll make way more money than if you sold your produce directly to Tomte the merchant.</figcaption></figure><h2>Farm and Shop and Farm and Shop and...</h2>

<p>You won't be able to do much in your first few days on the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4c0e46e8-9724-4c77-bf91-ea772a990ad1" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/sugardew-island-farming" rel="nofollow">farm</a> — you don't have much in the way of money or energy. Still, you'll be able to get your journey started in earnest.</p>

<p><em>Sugardew Island</em>&nbsp;has a pretty simple gameplay loop: you plant crops, harvest them, and sell the resultant produce in a <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4929e4fc-9740-404b-9b1a-6a3d5992c143" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/sugardew-island-store" rel="nofollow">store</a>. Selling produce in a store earns you Sugardew (the game's currency) and Harmony, a sort of experience point that can be used to advance <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="8fec8a46-7c97-455a-b4b9-270ab0aed527" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/sugardew-island-quests" rel="nofollow">quests</a> at the Harmony Tree. Each completed quest unlocks new items on your farm.</p>

<p>This simpler style of gameplay makes Sugardew Island more appropriate for younger gamers.</p>

<p>As you progress further in the game, you'll be able to unlock <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="df0d3f4c-414f-49c5-8dd8-2d3306f531d8" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/sugardew-island-animals" rel="nofollow">animals</a> and pets. Pets are a cosmetic luxury that don't contribute to your earnings, but farm animals such as cows and chickens can put a little extra money in your pocket — as long as you remember to feed them.</p>

<p>One quickly falls into a routine: wake up, water and plant crops, sell items at the shop, complete a quest, and repeat. It's plenty of fun in its own right, but it feels like there's a missed opportunity to do more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sugardew-island-review-looking-at-grown-corn-crops-on-the-farm-in-sugardew-island.jpg?itok=HsdXFB3l 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sugardew-island-review-looking-at-grown-corn-crops-on-the-farm-in-sugardew-island.jpg?itok=Tj3wEGJ3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There is a lot of acreage available to you for farming, but you'll need to use less than half of it to complete the game in a reasonable timeframe.</figcaption></figure><h2>Farming, Distilled</h2>

<p><em>Sugardew Island</em>&nbsp;essentially has three core gameplay mechanics: growing crops, tending to your animals, and selling the items you get at the store to advance quests. It's a simple gameplay loop and it works, but other games in the Farming RPG genre have much more on offer.</p>

<p>For example, Farming RPGs traditionally will have cooking, fishing, and other side activities. In some cases, there are dungeons to explore, too.&nbsp;<em>Sugardew Island</em>&nbsp;has none of these things; it is laser-focused on its basic gameplay and nothing else.</p>

<p>The lack of a cooking system is particularly disappointing. There are 20 or so different crops that you can grow, but you can only make one energy-restoring item. This is a seriously missed opportunity to let players experiment with different ways of restoring energy or gaining short-term buffs. A robust cooking system often adds a welcome layer of complexity.</p>

<p>On the upside, this simpler style of gameplay makes&nbsp;<em>Sugardew Island</em>&nbsp;more appropriate for younger gamers. There's no risk of tears from dying in a dungeon or losing an animal to sickness. There's no stressing out about catching legendary fish, no list of cooking recipes to scroll through. There's a sort of zen comfort in the simplicity of your daily routine.</p>

<p>While&nbsp;<em>Sugardew Island</em>&nbsp;keeps things simple, it manages to do a solid job of performing its double act as a Farming RPG and a shop simulator. It may not be the best game in either genre, but it certainly works well enough for the price point.</p>

<p>Experienced fans of Farming RPGs probably won't find anything novel to enjoy here. Younger games and players new to the genre, however, could easily learn the basic mechanics of Farming RPGs through&nbsp;<em>Sugardew Island</em>&nbsp;without having to crack a wiki open to sort through hundreds of different crafting recipes.</p>

<p><em>Sugardew Island</em>&nbsp;is a great game for younger kids or people who want to simply farm crops and sell items without too much stress. If you don't fall into either of those categories, then you'd probably want to pass on&nbsp;<em>Sugardew Island</em>&nbsp;for now.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-battlefield-dev-diary-gunplay-movement</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-details-new-battlefields-gunplay-and-movement-in-first-dev-diary.1128033/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-battlefield-dev-diary-gunplay-movement<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has released the first in a new series of dev diaries aimed at detailing the development process behind the new&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>game, and this one's all about the game's gunplay and movement systems.</p>

<p>The movement and combat systems in the new&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>game (which has yet to be officially unveiled) are the first features EA is testing as part of its Battlefield Labs <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-labs-announced-ea" rel="nofollow">initiative</a>, which promises to involve the&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>community in active development through regular feedback and refinement.</p>

<p>According to EA, the goal with the new&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>is to ensure that "players of all skill levels can enjoy [the game's] gunplay and movement systems". Gameplay should reward veterans while also providing an "intuitive experience for new players to learn and enjoy".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-dev-diary-2042-ea.jpg?itok=BQuD7pKe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-dev-diary-2042-ea.jpg?itok=u3xC9NCQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The new&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>will prioritize accessibility in its movement systems and gunplay.</figcaption></figure><p>In terms of what's new, there's plenty of granular detail in this dev diary. EA has, for example, reduced the time between pressing fire and bullets appearing on the screen, and the studio has also revealed it's building the new&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>for a 60Hz tick rate, hopefully increasing precision.</p>

<p>Recoil has also been adjusted so that different weapon types feel unique, and each shot's recoil direction will now match its gameplay angle thanks to "enhancements to gunplay recoil, camera shakes, and firing settles".</p>

<p>As you can tell, EA really wants&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>fans to believe that it's moving on from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-2042-bugs-other-issues-plague-launch" rel="nofollow">disastrous launch</a> of&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 2042</em>, with the studio clearly hoping to win players' trust back after the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/60000-battlefield-2042-players-want-their-money-back" rel="nofollow">negative feedback it received</a> regarding that game.</p>

<p>Four studios are working to create the game: regular developer DICE,&nbsp;<em>Dead Space&nbsp;</em>outfit Motive,&nbsp;<em>Burnout&nbsp;</em>dev Criterion, and former DICE offshoot Ripple Effect. We'll have to wait and see whether it manages to get the series back on track as far as fans are concerned.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-picross-donkey-kong<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has added two more Game Boy classics to the Nintendo Switch Online library, and if you're a fan of classic puzzlers or old-school retro delights, then these games are very much for you.</p>

<p>As with all of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-donkey-kong-land" rel="nofollow">other</a> Game Boy <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-game-boy-launch" rel="nofollow">games</a> available on the Switch Online <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-zelda-july" rel="nofollow">service</a> (although not Game Boy Advance games, importantly), these two new games can be enjoyed if you've got a basic Switch Online membership. You won't need the Expansion Pack addon to play them.</p>

<p>First to be added today is&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong</em>, also known as&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong '94&nbsp;</em>after the year in which it was released. It's essentially an adaptation of the original&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong</em>, albeit with many, many more levels and some additional gameplay quirks to contend with.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-online-game-boy-march-2025-donkey-kong.jpg?itok=z4_NZHzQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-online-game-boy-march-2025-donkey-kong.jpg?itok=vwgm3CTD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Donkey Kong '94&nbsp;</em>is one of two games being added to Nintendo Switch Online today.</figcaption></figure><p>The game blends gameplay elements from several different Nintendo titles; it's got the item pickup mechanic from&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Bros. 2&nbsp;</em>(that's the weird one, not&nbsp;<em>Lost Levels</em>), as well as the rope-climbing from&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Jr.&nbsp;</em>and, of course, the basic structure of the original&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong</em>.</p>

<p>Your second Game Boy offering in today's haul is&nbsp;<em>Mario's Picross</em>. If you're familiar with nonogram-style puzzles, then this one probably doesn't need much introduction.</p>

<p>If you're not, though, nonograms are essentially puzzles where you must systematically eliminate squares on a grid in order to uncover a picture. You'll need to observe the numbers along the sides of the grid carefully to determine which squares need to be filled in and which should be left alone.</p>

<p>As you might expect,&nbsp;<em>Mario's Picross&nbsp;</em>has plenty of&nbsp;<em>Mario</em>-themed images for you to uncover, so if you're looking for a fun way to while away an hour or two, you could do a lot worse.</p>




<p>Both&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong '94&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Mario's Picross&nbsp;</em>are available to play right now on Nintendo Switch Online. You can sign up for a membership via your Switch console's eShop if you're not already subscribed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/robocop-rogue-city-unfinished-business-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nacon has announced&nbsp;<em>RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished Business</em>, a "standalone adventure" intended to serve as a followup (but not necessarily a full-blown sequel) to 2023's&nbsp;<em>RoboCop: Rogue City</em>.</p>

<p>Announced during yesterday's Nacon Connect showcase, <i>Unfinished Business&nbsp;</i>will once again put you in the (presumably extremely heavy) shoes of RoboCop as he prepares to take down a "group of highly trained mercenaries" in the massive housing complex known as OmniTower.</p>

<p>Essentially,&nbsp;<em>Unfinished Business&nbsp;</em>sounds rather like&nbsp;<em>RoboCop: Rogue City&nbsp;</em>meets&nbsp;<em>The Raid&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Die Hard</em>&nbsp;(or, indeed, 2012's&nbsp;<em>Dredd</em>). Nacon is promising new enemy types, deadly traps, and elite troops to take down.</p>

<p>What's more, you'll also get the chance to play as Alex Murphy, RoboCop's pre-transformation alter ego, and "discover a different side" of the iconic hero.</p>

<p><em>RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished Business&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527760/RoboCop_Rogue_City__Unfinished_Business/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10014077" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/robocop-rogue-city-unfinished-business/9NNNFB5F54C9" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> in summer.&nbsp;You can check out the announcement trailer for the game<em>&nbsp;</em>right here.</p>




<h2>What else was revealed during Nacon Connect 2025?</h2>

<p>Plenty of other Nacon games were revealed during the publisher's Connect showcase yesterday.</p>

<p>As well as <i>Unfinished Business</i>, Nacon also revealed a new game in the stealthy&nbsp;<em>Styx&nbsp;</em>series.&nbsp;<em>Styx: Blades of&nbsp;</em><em>Greed&nbsp;</em>is described as a "blend of stealth, action, and strategy", and it's coming to PC and current-gen machines in fall.</p>

That's set for next year on PC and current-gen consoles.</p>

<p>That's not the only eldritch horror game revealed during the show, either.&nbsp;<em>Zeno Clash&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Clash: Artifacts of Chaos&nbsp;</em>developer ACE Team revealed&nbsp;<em>The Mound: Omen of Cthulhu</em>, a first-person co-op horror game loosely based on Lovecraft's novel of the same name. That one's coming next year.</p>
