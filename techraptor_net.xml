            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/austin-suther-top-10-games-of-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last year, I made the brazen claim that "2023 will go down as one of the best years for game releases in a <em>long</em> time." I might have to eat my words after seeing what 2024 had to offer. I played the most JRPGs I ever have, and that's most definitely reflected in this list. I also had to cut a few things out of my list, which hurts, but I'd like to give honorable mentions to <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-review-id-explain-but-i-dont-think-i-can" rel="nofollow">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/stellar-blade-review-mother-sphere-knows-best" rel="nofollow">Stellar Blade</a></em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/lorns-lure-review-call-of-void" rel="nofollow"><em>Lorn's Lure</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/mullet-madjack-review-nostalgia-fueled-frenzy" rel="nofollow"><em>Mullet MadJack</em></a> to name just a few.</p>



<h2>10. <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em></h2>

<p>I feel like <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em> fell a bit under the radar. Admittedly, it released during a tumultuous time, with other blockbusters taking the limelight. I'm a glutton for HD-2D games, though, so I was all over this when it released.</p>

<p><em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D</em> is also my first time playing the series, and needless to say, I am eagerly awaiting 2025's HD-2D rendition of the first two games, as well.</p>



<h2>9. <em>Dragon's Dogma 2</em></h2>

<p><em>Dragon's Dogma 2</em> is an incredibly imperfect game, but I'd be lying if I said this wasn't one of the most fun games on the list. The long-awaited follow-up to the 2012 cult classic didn't disappoint me, at least, with its wildly immersive world and addicting combat.</p>

<p>Enemy variety is somewhat lacking, but tackling a new monster in <em>Dragon's Dogma 2</em> was always an exciting moment. Climbing on a cyclops' face to stab his eye is immensely satisfying. Unlocking all of the different vocations lead to myriad ways to tackle different monsters, which made experimenting with builds a rewarding experience.</p>



<h2>8. <em>Unicorn Overlord</em></h2>

<p>So, no <em>Fire Emblem</em> release this year? Fine, I'll find another strategy game to play. <em>Unicorn Overlord</em> might not be the same gameplay-wise, but it still scratches that tactical itch. Creating squads of powerful soldiers and fine-tuning their tactics is delightfully fun.</p>

<p>The story is also somewhat similar to that of <em>Fire Emblem</em> -- an ousted prince must reclaim his conquered kingdom. It's a familiar narrative, for sure, but conquering territories and gaining many allies along the way is a satisfying loop. The characters are diverse with its wonderful, undeniably Vanillaware art style. All things said, it is a fantastic package from start to finish.</p>



<h2>7. <em>Persona 3 Reload</em></h2>

<p>My Spotify playlist has a bunch of <em>Persona 3 Reload</em> songs. Every once in a while, the credits theme will play and I'll start feeling all depressed. <em>Persona 3</em> <em>Reload</em> hit me in the feels like few games do. An incredible cast of characters accompanies a darker story, making for a somewhat somber but nonetheless fantastic playthrough.</p>

<p>This was also my first time playing <em>Persona 3</em> in any form, so I was spared the arduous task of navigating pre-<em>Reload</em> Tartarus. I found the dungeon-crawling gameplay to be quite therapeutic, so climbing to the top was a breeze for me.</p>



<h2>6.&nbsp; <em>Zenless Zone Zero</em></h2>

<p>As you can probably tell by the number of JRPGs on this list, I've played some long games this year. Yet, if I had to guess what game had my highest number of hours played, it would probably be <em>Zenless Zone Zero</em>. Since it's launch, I've played it every single day. The power of gacha is strong in this one.</p>

<p><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em>'s hook isn't just the admittedly addicting gacha, though. It's the art style, a surprisingly compelling story and cast of characters, and its<em> </em>simplified <em>Devil May Cry-</em>style combat that keeps me coming back. With a steady stream of content every few weeks, I won't be dropping <em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> in the foreseeable future.</p>



<h2>5. <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em></h2>

<p>It seemed like the internet was out to get <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> -- like people wanted it to fail. Well, surprise, it's actually quite amazing. I had hope that MachineGames would knock it out of the park considering the studio's pedigree, and I was happy to see <em>Indiana Jones</em> get <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/indiana-jones-and-great-circle-review-perfect-adaptation-of-original-ip" rel="nofollow">critical acclaim</a> from critics.</p>

<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> captures the essence of what makes this franchise so beloved. The iconic music, quirky story, and supernatural elements come into play and create a game as good as any <em>Indiana Jones</em> movie.</p>

<p>I'd like to give props to the level design, as well. The Vatican is a full-blown immersive sim level, like a more grounded-in-reality version of <em>Dishonored</em>. With a DLC along the way -- presumably later this year -- I'm hoping the excellent level design carries over.</p>



<h2>4. <em>Astro Bot</em></h2>

<p>Praise be the DualSense, with its haptic feedback and a bunch of other bells and whistles. <em>Astro's Playroom</em> took full advantage of the controller's capabilities when it launched with the PS5, and <em>Astro Bot </em>takes it a step further. I truly believe the future of gaming is not in higher graphical fidelity, but in the way a controller can enhance gameplay.</p>

<p>So yes, <em>Astro Bot</em>'s utilization of the DualSense is mindbogglingly good, but the world design and platforming are even better. Many compared <em>Astro Bot</em> to <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em>, and they're definitely similar both in theme and in design. Team ASOBI found the secret formula that made <em>Super Mario</em> games so great, and made their own incredible platformer with it.</p>



<h2>3. <em>Tsukihime -A Piece of Blue Glass Moon-</em></h2>

<p>Soooo, technically this game came out several years ago, but only in Japanese. In 2024, we received an English translation for <em>Tsukihime. </em>It's my list, so I make the rules.</p>

<p>I already talked extensively about this absolutely fantastic visual novel. This was, in fact, my first true visual novel I've ever played/read, and I was gripped by its powerful storytelling and prose. If you want to read why <em>Tsukihime </em>turned me into a visual novel fan, look no further than this <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/tsukihimes-turned-me-into-visual-novel-fan" rel="nofollow">opinion piece</a> I wrote in July.</p>

<p>I'd like to give a quick shout-out to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2396980/Fatestay_night_REMASTERED/" rel="nofollow"><em>fate/stay night Remaster</em></a>. The <em>Fate</em> franchise is now a household name among weebs, and this is the first official translation for the visual novel that started it all. Check that one out too!</p>



<h2>2. <em>UFO 50</em></h2>

<p>Curse the word limit my tyrannical editors thrust upon me. Had I more words, I'd write a novel on why <em>UFO 50 </em>is so great. It's a collection of 50 separate games, many of which are quite lengthy. This isn't just some mini-game collection, it's like the equivalent of having 50 physical games on a shelf you can plop into your system at any time.</p>

<p>So yeah, while I could go on and on about <em>UFO 50, </em>I'll instead give a shout-out to some of my favorites in this retro-inspired collection: <em>Mooncat; Warptank; Elfazar's Hat; Pilot Quest;</em> and <em>Mini and Max</em>. In fact, <em>Mini and Max</em> is so good, it could be a game of the year contender by itself. To find out what I mean, you just need to play it for yourself.</p>



<h2>1. <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em></h2>

<p>If you didn't scroll down to this list right at the start of the article, then it's probably a pretty easy guess that <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio </em>is my Game of the Year. It's not just the best JRPG I've played this year, it's just the best game, flat out.</p>

<p>Unparalleled visual design (even if the graphics themselves are somewhat dated), compelling characters, a well-written story, and an addicting combat system coalesces into what I might consider a masterpiece.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Anson Chan's Top 5 Games of 2024]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/anson-chan-top-5-games-of-2024</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anson-chans-top-5-games-of-2024.1085412/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/anson-chan-top-5-games-of-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Looking back at all the games of 2024, it would be cliched to say that there were too many good games to decide which would be the best. It would be far more accurate to say that there were too many interesting-looking games to try instead.</p>

<p>Indeed, 2024 might have been the first year to make Xbox Game Pass feel like a trip to the buffet after already consuming a full dinner with dessert and appetizers. Thus, while it would be easy to say that the following games have made an impression, it is by no means a comprehensive list of games that everyone should sample.</p>

<h2><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zzz-lycaon.jpg?itok=uOLevf9b 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zzz-lycaon.jpg?itok=8kdc6Qr3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The classiest werewolf butler that you ever did see</figcaption></figure><p>While there were a lot of (or more accurately, too many) excellent games released in 2024, <em>Zenless Zone Zero </em>is probably the one that I am the most fond of. Unsurprisingly, <em>ZZZ's</em> combat mechanics are the star of the show. In a nutshell, it's a fighting game that doesn't require you to memorize dozens of combo attacks mixed with a hint of <em>Dark Souls</em> damage scaling. Throw in some flashy visuals and sound effects and you've got a winning gameplay recipe.</p>

<p>Of course, gameplay isn't the only thing that's important. Storytelling and style matters just as much, and while good storytelling is somewhat subjective, oh boy does <em>ZZZ </em>have style. Among Hoyoverse's existing games, it's hardly a controversial statement to say that <em>ZZZ </em>has the most interesting and unique roster of playable characters from a design perspective. There's robots, humans with animal characteristics, animals with human characteristics, and everything in between.</p>

<p>The thing that pushes <em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> to be my personal favorite of the year though is the Bangboo. It would've been easy to have these silly mascots do cute things in the background, but the developers went above that and integrated them into the gameplay in meaningful ways. Recent updates introduced a tower defense and platforming mode exclusive to the Bangboo, they are active participants in combat and the story, and they are varied enough to be consistently visually interesting.</p>

<h2><em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kunitsu-gami-demons.jpg?itok=Pl5Iv9iq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kunitsu-gami-demons.jpg?itok=frAQRzT0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>So maybe it would be a good idea to close that freaky face door in the back</figcaption></figure><p>Who could've guessed that one of the most emotional narratives of 2024 would come from a tower defense game where the story, which draws heavily from Japanese folklore, is told more or less entirely through interpretive dance. It sounds silly on paper yet it works for <em>Kunitsu-Gami</em>, a game that is greater than the sum of its parts.</p>

<p>Indeed, one would be hard pressed to recommend <em>Kunitsu-Gami's</em> based on any singular aspect of the gameplay. You need the game's creative enemy design, the interpretive dances, and the sound design to work together in unison to provide such an excellent product. If any of those aspects are lacking, then the game fundamentally changes, and likely for the worse.</p>

<p>That being said, it would be interesting if the developers decided to expand upon <em>Kunitsu-Gami, </em>whether it be through a spiritual successor or otherwise. After all, it's not often that you get to banish demons with power of dance (and extreme violence). Plus you could theoretically take the game's concept and apply it to other cultures.</p>

<h2><em>Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/eiyuden-chronicle-forest.jpg?itok=jJSH3Qy9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/eiyuden-chronicle-forest.jpg?itok=K7dNLayt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Would've preferred it if the characters from <em>Eiyuden Chronicle: Rising</em> had a larger role in the story, but the new main party is good too</figcaption></figure><p>While most RPGs prefer to limit your roster of playable heroes to dozen characters at most, presumably due to practical reasons, <em>Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes</em> does what the title says it will do by giving you over a hundred characters to interact with. The kicker is that the vast majority of these characters are playable and everyone has some meaningful screen time, brief as it may be.</p>

<p>In spite of the obvious limitations, having such a huge cast of characters does make <em>Eiyuden Chonicle's</em> story a little bit more grounded. Having legendary warriors and mages on your side means little when you don't have cooks, lumberjacks, farmers, and all the other logistical staff needed to keep the party fed and clothed. Thankfully the game does handwave the actual logistics in the interest of compelling gameplay, but it's a nice change of narrative pace.</p>

<p>The fact that the developers clearly put no small effort into the side quests associated with the supporting characters is a nice added touch. The cook's side quest is particularly memorable, as are the optional plays that you can perform at the theater. If anything, it is the focus on these traditionally minor characters that help <em>Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes </em>stand out from its turn-based JRPG peers.</p>

<h2><em>Botany Manor</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/botany-manor-plants.jpg?itok=1Qzb8eui 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/botany-manor-plants.jpg?itok=9HYOJup6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's like a Bob Ross painting!</figcaption></figure><p>Sometimes it's nice to take a break from games where you have to save the world or eliminate a million enemies in three minutes with a min-maxed character, and this is where a game like <em>Botany Manor</em> shines. The stakes aren't particularly high in the <em>Manor--</em>it's just you, some plants, and a fancy house. Frankly, the puzzles aren't exactly challenging either. In other words, the perfect game for escapism.</p>

<p>That's not to say that <em>Botany Manor </em>isn't a good puzzle game in its own right. Growing individual plants is the goal, and the solutions tend to involve collecting some clues and messing around with the environment. Fairly basic stuff compared to what other puzzle games might offer, and it admittedly makes the game somewhat short, yet it's competently and creatively executed each and every time.</p>

<p>As one would expect from such a game, the art direction and sound design are positively stunning. At the conclusion of each puzzle, the associated plant blooms to life in a spectacular display of color. Some of them affect the environment too, adding even more color to an already colorful world, more than enough proof that games are a form of art.</p>

<h2><em>Little Kitty, Big City</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/little-kitty-big-city-sit.jpg?itok=jWD9vhLL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/little-kitty-big-city-sit.jpg?itok=Uwek8akm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The kitty is plotting something, or about to take a nap, it's hard to tell which.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Little Kitty, Big City </em>is another relaxing game where you're just a cat who's trying to get home. There's platforming and puzzle elements involved, and an unexpected amount of dialogue between animals as well. While there's some narrative urgency to the game, you can go at your own pace and admire the adorable cat animations as much as you want.</p>

<p>Obviously, <em>Little Kitty, Big City </em>is more than just a game where you do cat things like knock over objects and climb into places where you probably shouldn't. Ultimately, it's a competently made sandbox game. Regardless of if the protagonist is a cat, a dog, or a tiny Mario and Luigi sprite, the scale of the world and the degree to which you can interact with it makes the game so amusing.</p>

<p>Again, <em>Little Kitty, Big City </em>is on the shorter side, and it's somewhat lacking in replayablility considering the genre, but in all honesty these kinds of shorter games are a perfect complement to the seemingly endless stream of current and upcoming games that will likely demand dozens of hours of playtime for a single playthrough.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/tyler-chancey-top-10-games-of-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Gaming in 2024 felt like the start of a shift in trends. The death of live services. The rise of nostalgic remasters and remakes. A time of big budget stagnation and indie innovation. It was also a year awash with layoffs and studio closures alongside a massive disruption of both the games industry and games press. As such, my top 10 of the year may be the most eclectic it's been in a while. The strange, the challenging, the exciting, and the profound all have a place here.</p>

<p>Here are my top 10 games of 2024.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/black-myth-wukong-boss-temple.jpg?itok=UbiCoZnG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/black-myth-wukong-boss-temple.jpg?itok=MBZjP0u0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>10. <em>Black Myth Wukong</em></h2>

<p>GameScience's debut title made a considerable splash this year. Its recursive narrative moves back and forth between adaptation, retelling, and sequel to <em>Journey to the West</em>. Combat hits a euphoric blend of challenging and satisfying, utilizing Sun Wukong's arsenal of clones, teleportation, heavenly transformations, and powerful quarterstaff strikes. Boss battles walk a fine line between monumental challenges and bombastic spectacle.</p>

<p>It is a game with such passion and dedication put into every polygon that it overshadows some undercooked level design and some questionable story presentation. <em>Black Myth Wukong</em> is one massive swing that gets a lot right on its first go, and It has made GameScience a studio to keep an eye on.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/destiny-2-witness-final-fight.jpg?itok=g6S_F2u8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/destiny-2-witness-final-fight.jpg?itok=w1sJn3KV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>9. <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em></h2>

<p>A lot can happen in 10 years. In the case of <em>Destiny</em>, three different console generations, the rise and fall of gaming trends, and countless sea changes and course corrections for its epic space opera shooter.</p>

<p>But this year, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/destiny-2-final-shape-end-to-light-and-darkness" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bungie did it</a>. <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em> delivered an epic conclusion to its decade-spanning story, packed with emotional setpieces, impeccable gunfights, and a wonderful 12-member finale event that lives rent-free in my head.</p>

<p>While <em>Destiny 2's</em> current climate has been meandering and anemic, I cannot deny the craftsmanship that went into telling the final chapter of The Traveler and The Witness. And it is a finale that I and some close friends will remember for a long time.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-king-darius-boss-fight.jpg?itok=ukibIoRb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-king-darius-boss-fight.jpg?itok=Pazg3mmg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>8. <em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</em></h2>

<p>It has been years since I've touched a major release from Ubisoft. Their in-house style, while enjoyable in small doses, can be an overwhelming exercise in excess. In the current gaming landscape, that can mean dozens or even hundreds of hours of precious time lost.</p>

<p>Which is why I absolutely loved <em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</em>, a scaled-down, straightforward action platforming adventure packed with polish, punch, and presentation by some of the industry's best designers.</p>

<p>It blends <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/prince-of-persia-lost-crown-review-its-about-time-and-space" rel="nofollow">the spectacle and style of shonen anime into its boss fights</a>, the creative and thoughtful level design of the best Metroidvanias on the market, and an escalating set of challenges tailor made for platforming purists and combat junkies alike.</p>

<p>It's an experience soured by the fact the studio that made it <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-disbands-prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-team" rel="nofollow">got laid off</a>. But, <em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</em> is the kind of game we need more of in this industry, and for that, it earns a spot on my list.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-seethe-attack.jpg?itok=wolhA6vx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-seethe-attack.jpg?itok=vIwjtpom 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>7. <em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em></h2>

<p><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/kunitsu-gami-path-of-goddess-review-tactical-demon-slaying" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em></a>, when described on paper, reads like an ad lib. A hack-and-slash, real-time strategy, tower-defense game about banishing an army of demons from a mountain set in ancient Japan. It represents design from an older time, a wild era of experimentation where developers could try anything without worrying too much about selling millions of copies. It's an attitude that is downright alien in this day and age.</p>

<p><em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em> is an infectiously rewarding game. It keeps all of its plates spinning with style and grace, a testament to Capcom letting their imaginations go wild.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/silent-hill-2-remake-foggy-street-corner.jpg?itok=qp_PIQC3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/silent-hill-2-remake-foggy-street-corner.jpg?itok=inuJ56JJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>6. <em>Silent Hill 2</em> (2024)</h2>

<p>What else can be said about the legacy of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/best-gaming-sequel-silent-hill-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Silent Hill 2</em></a>, one of the greatest horror game stories ever told? Not much. What can be said about the prospect of it getting remade by Bloober Team, a development studio with an uneven track record? <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/silent-hill-2-remake-revives-classic" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Quite a bit</a>.</p>

<p>It is a remake that doesn't just play the hits but explores different parts of the narrative left implied. This has led to more naturalistic dialogue, impressive subtle character performances, newfound depth in the supporting cast, as well as new theories about the nature of the town and James' fate within its foggy walls.</p>

<p>Is it that magical remake that perfectly captures the spirit and impact of the original release? Of course not. But it is a remake that understands why the original has endured for so long and admirably updates itself with overhauled combat and revised puzzles.</p>

<p>The <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake was one of 2024's pleasant surprises. A modern return to the iconic haunted town that has successfully entranced a new generation of players.</p>

<p>Atlus' developers continued to push the envelope this year with <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>, an original property helmed by former developers from the <em>Persona</em> series.</p>

<p>In strict game terms, it is an evolution of <em>Persona's</em> strengths: engaging and difficult turn-based combat juxtaposed with quiet social bonds and real-world time management.</p>

<p>But what makes <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> so compelling is its various artistic inspirations. It seamlessly blends Renaissance art motifs, medieval high fantasy architecture, contemporary fashion designs, and monsters that have leaped off the pages of Hieronymus Bosch.</p>

<p>Impressively, despite being set in a fantasy setting, <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> tells a timely tale. A big idea narrative around the underhanded corruption of elected officials and protecting the ideals of a just world. In a modern political climate where institutional trust is at an all-time low, it is a hopeful narrative worth telling.</p>

<p><em>Neva</em> is a visually magnificent game with its heart on its sleeve. A <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/neva-review-poetic-platforming-perfection" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">short but impactful</a> game about parenthood and environmental awareness.</p>

<p>It is both a game and an impressionist painting brought to life. A polished platformer and a serenely beautiful allegory for the enduring spirit of life and nature. A game where you can pet an adorable white wolf pup as much as you want. An experience forever burned into my memory thanks to its striking imagery and playful gameplay. A wonderful blend of audiovisual art and interactivity that leads to some transcendent setpieces.Truly unforgettable.</p>

<p><em>Mouthwashing</em> by Wrong Organ may be the most disturbing horror game I have played in a long time.</p>

<p>On the surface, it is about the doomed crew of a space cargo freighter. But this simple tale of entrapment degrades into a pitch-black tale of human misery. A tale packed with commentary on late-stage capitalism, unflinching depictions of operational incompetence, disturbing nightmare vignettes, and a descent into delirium, distrust, and despair.</p>

<p>In addition, it is deceptively grotesque. <em>Mouthwashing's</em> retro polygonal look hides horrifying setpieces with some gross body horror. This game has ruined cake for me.</p>

<p>But all of that cruelty and revulsion is not in the service of cheap shock. It earns a place on my list thanks to its fantastic script, three-dimensional characters, and its masterfully labyrinthine nonlinear narrative structure. A brand new interactive horror classic that stands head and shoulders above its peers this year. I hope this hurts.</p>

<p>Sunset Visitor has pulled off something phenomenal with <em>1000xRESIST</em>. A narrative-focused game with an explicit central message about societal injustice, civil dissent, and religious dogma. It is also a deeply personal narrative drawing from lived experiences involving immigration, cultural diaspora, trauma, and societal anxiety. On top of all of that, it tells an existential sci-fi story spanning hundreds of years, an alien invasion, and the collapse of two different civilizations.</p>

<p>It is the most gameplay-light experience on my list. Yet,<em> 1000xRESIST</em> is a wonderfully written tale with a lot to say about family, friendship, romance, and the power of endurance in the face of hardship and unjust leadership. All of which is expressed with no condescension or pretension.</p>

<p>It is because of that confident, measured, and precise storytelling that I will be thinking about this game for years to come. Heki Grace.</p>

<p><em>Pacific Drive</em> is a game I have not been able to put down. An '80s sci-fi game where you unravel the mysterious origins behind a radiation exclusion zone with the aid of a broken-down station wagon.</p>

<p>This is mostly thanks to its impeccable atmosphere and tone. Just driving from location to location, jamming out to indie rock as the mountainous Pacific Northwest degrades into surreal landscapes and alien life would have been enough to put it on this list. But Ironwood Studios also built deeply rewarding survival gameplay and genuinely challenging traversal missions into the main experience, making each drive compelling.</p>

<p>There were countless moments throughout my playthrough full of unique, emergent moments. Running out of gas during a key mission leading to me siphoning fuel from every wreck I could find. Barely escaping a radiation storm on three flat tires and all my armored plating stripped off. The list goes on.</p>

<p>All of this combined with a solid sci-fi story steeped in retro kitsch makes <em>Pacific Drive</em> one of my favorite games this year.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/joe-allen-top-6-games-of-2024</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/joe-allens-top-6-games-of-2024.1085367/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/joe-allen-top-6-games-of-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There are many ways in which 2024 has been, to put it mildly, a rough year, and our industry hasn't exactly been faring well.</p>

<p>Amid mass layoffs, C-suite executives pocketing embarrassing amounts of money, and studios shutting down left, right, and center, studios must have had an exponentially harder time releasing games worth talking about.</p>

<p>Thankfully, many of them managed to do just that. However harrowing a year it's been for the industry on a business level, the games happily speak for themselves, and while I don't think 2024 raised the bar like 2023 did, that bar's high enough that it can sit right where it is without feeling too bad.</p>

<p>Without further ado, then, here are my top 6 games from 2024!</p>

<h2>6.&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/black-myth-wukong-joe-allen-top-games-2024.jpg?itok=1PFY-PUS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/black-myth-wukong-joe-allen-top-games-2024.jpg?itok=vcW2dcNr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>made more than its fair share of contributions to the Soulslike genre this year.</figcaption></figure><p>The folks behind&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>might have made a couple of unsavory remarks surrounding the game's release, but that doesn't diminish the quality of what is thankfully an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/black-myth-wukong-review-serious-monkey-business" rel="nofollow">excellent Soulslike action RPG</a>.</p>

<p><em>Wukong</em>'s array of heavily Chinese mythology-inspired enemies and bosses is dizzying, and I've often said that Soulslikes live and die on their enemy variety, a brief developer GameScience seems to have understood very well indeed.</p>

<p>Couple that with satisfyingly complex levels that pack a plethora of optional paths to explore, and you've got yourself a Soulslike that deserves to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with some of the genre's greats. The story's a touch muddled, but when the combat's this fun, I'll let that slide.</p>

<h2>5.&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/persona-3-reload-joe-allen-top-games-2024.jpg?itok=6GHwOoKH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/persona-3-reload-joe-allen-top-games-2024.jpg?itok=-U0s4dwd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Persona 3 Reload&nbsp;</em>may have been lengthy, but the payoff was worth it.</figcaption></figure><p>Oh,&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload</em>, how you broke my heart. I never quite managed to click with previous versions of&nbsp;<em>Persona 3</em>; they always felt just a touch incomplete, like each one could do with some of the features another one had.</p>

<p>For the most part,&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload&nbsp;</em>feels like the holistic package I've been waiting for. It's another delightfully offbeat slice of&nbsp;<em>Persona&nbsp;</em>fun, complete with everything you could want from one of these games: relationship-building, great characterization, and music that won't leave your playlists for months.</p>

<p>Some of the improvements made by&nbsp;<em>Reload&nbsp;</em>easily elevate it above its forebears, too. Its improved visuals, extra story elements, and extensive quality-of-life changes make it a much more palatable and welcoming experience than the often-punishing original.</p>

<h2>4.&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/astro-bot-joe-allen-top-games-2024.jpg?itok=Qa_l2_4P 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/astro-bot-joe-allen-top-games-2024.jpg?itok=dGdKbO_e 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>For 3D platformer thrills of yesteryear, look no further than&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>I haven't been as much of a fan of Sony's more recent AAA output than many; games like&nbsp;<em>God of War Ragnarok&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us&nbsp;</em>lean a little too heavily on cinematic setpieces for me. What I want is a game that could only ever be a game, and&nbsp;happily, Sony provided this year with&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em>.</p>

<p>I'm about to praise it, so don't worry, but I've got a bit more of a bee in my bonnet about&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>than many of my peers seem to. Its celebration of properties Sony seems happy to leave buried troubles me, and I wish it wasn't quite so self-congratulatory.</p>

<p>Even so, I'd be a churl if I pretended Team Asobi's throwback 3D platformer was not, on a moment-to-moment basis, the most fun I've had with a video game this year. It's delightfully colorful, beautifully playable, and wonderfully childlike without ever feeling childish.</p>

<p>If you can sit in front of&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em>, DualSense clutched in your hands, and watch its expertly choreographed action unfold in front of your eyes without <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/astro-bot-review-90s-platformer-done-right" rel="nofollow">cracking a massive smile</a>, then I think your heart may have stopped beating.</p>

<h2>3.&nbsp;<em>Animal Well</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/animal-well-joe-allen-top-games-2024.jpg?itok=4aUtL7UU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/animal-well-joe-allen-top-games-2024.jpg?itok=-YG6mHTT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Animal Well&nbsp;</em>layered mysteries atop mysteries to great effect this year.</figcaption></figure><p>You can almost always rely on the indie circuit to go where AAA games fear to tread, and&nbsp;<em>Animal Well&nbsp;</em>certainly fulfilled that remit this year. Bigmode's inaugural title was a solo effort created by one-man outfit Shared Memory, and as opening salvos go, it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/animal-well-review-icebergs-worth-of-puzzles-deep-below-surface" rel="nofollow">hard to top this one</a>.</p>

<p>It's been a long time since I've seen a game world so absolutely stuffed to the brim with secrets. Pretty much every screen of&nbsp;<em>Animal Well&nbsp;</em>is hiding something, and you can choose on what level you want to engage with those puzzles, creating a deeply satisfying experience for players of all stripes.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is heretical to admit, but I was absolutely not bothered about the deeper, more ARG-adjacent layers of&nbsp;<em>Animal Well</em>. I was content to potter about its world, discovering its surface-level secrets and engaging with its expertly crafted platforming.</p>

<p>That's the beauty of Bigmode and Billy Basso's game, though; whether you're a dungeon-delving dilettante or a spelunker of secrets, you'll find something to love here.</p>

<h2>2.&nbsp;<em>Nine Sols</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nine-sols-joe-allen-top-games-2024.jpg?itok=YyKairIw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nine-sols-joe-allen-top-games-2024.jpg?itok=yfzMWdu0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Nine Sols&nbsp;</em>married satisfying combat and exploration with a surprisingly heartstring-tugging story.</figcaption></figure><p>It may be true that&nbsp;<em>Nine Sols</em>' Metroidvania world isn't quite as complex and multi-layered as some of its contemporaries, but that's more than made up for by one of the most affecting and well-realized stories I've seen in games for quite some time.</p>

<p>Unlike the general template for Metroidvania games,&nbsp;<em>Nine Sols</em>' protagonist, Yi, isn't a blank slate. He comes with his own personality, his own memories, and, perhaps most importantly for&nbsp;<em>Nine Sols</em>' narrative, his own baggage.</p>

<p>The story of how Yi slowly comes to terms with what his past contains and what it means for the world around him propels&nbsp;<em>Nine Sols&nbsp;</em>into the pantheon of the greatest Metroidvania games of all time, but its combat is nothing to be sniffed at either.</p>

<p>You'll need your wits about you to master&nbsp;<em>Nine Sols</em>' precise parry-based combat, which you'll use to take down an impressive variety of enemies and bosses.</p>

<h2>1.&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-joe-allen-top-games-2024.jpg?itok=uymB31V4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-joe-allen-top-games-2024.jpg?itok=Io98e6RI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>is a phenomenally generous, thrillingly layered expansion.</figcaption></figure><p>There was never really going to be anything else vying for my top spot in 2024.&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>is about as close to a masterpiece as a game's DLC expansion can get.</p>

<p>The Realm of Shadow is a beautifully complex and dense open-world environment to explore. Like many, I'm not really sure why director Hidetaka Miyazaki chose to claim that the DLC's explorable landmass would rival that of the base game's Limgrave when it's so much larger and more layered.</p>

<p>Some found&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>'s level of challenge too much to bear, but I welcomed it. Each of the DLC's bosses <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree" rel="nofollow">felt like a true test</a> of the skills I'd learned during my time with&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>, and to me, they all felt expertly designed and tuned.</p>

<p>Like the main game,&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>also comes complete with an incredible array of secrets to uncover. To share any of those secrets would be to spoil the surprise, so I'll just say that if you haven't played this one yet and you're an&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>fan, please try to set aside the time. It's worth it.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/11-bit-announces-soulslike-deckbuilder-death-howl-demo-coming-monday.1085331/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-howl-soulslike-deckbuilder-11-bit<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>publisher 11 bit studios has announced&nbsp;<em>Death Howl</em>, a "Soulslike deckbuilder" which marries a gloomy atmosphere with run-based gameplay and card crafting.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Death Howl&nbsp;</em>promises "grid-based, turn-driven battles" that will demand "tactical precision" from you. In addition, you'll be battling "formidable enemies and fearsome bosses" which you'll need to build tactically sound decks to surmount.</p>

<p>The game will offer the chance to explore a grim open world in which you'll find biomes like the "Meadows of Delusion" or the "Forest of Howling Shadows". It's safe to say this isn't the kind of game you should play if you're looking for a cozy atmosphere.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/death-howl-soulslike-deckbuilder-combat.jpg?itok=7q2w-dbK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/death-howl-soulslike-deckbuilder-combat.jpg?itok=kUPb82Jc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Death Howl&nbsp;</em>marries Soulslike atmosphere with deckbuilding gameplay.</figcaption></figure><p>As you explore each of&nbsp;<em>Death Howl</em>'s regions, you'll unlock new cards to craft, and you'll also be able to piece together elements of protagonist Ro's backstory, which the devs say is "steeped in themes of love and loss".</p>

<p>Each realm you visit will present you with different challenges, necessitating the construction of various different deck types in order to overcome those challenges. You'll also be given the chance to use "shamanic totems" to deepen&nbsp;<em>Death Howl</em>'s "strategic layer" in order to expand your options.</p>

<p><em>Death Howl&nbsp;</em>comes to us from&nbsp;<em>Mind Scanners&nbsp;</em>developer The Outer Zone, a three-person-strong studio based in Copenhagen. Director&nbsp;Malte Burup describes the game as a "fresh take" on deckbuilders, something I think will probably be needed given the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/breachway-release-date" rel="nofollow">crowded market</a> into which&nbsp;<em>Death Howl&nbsp;</em>is <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/slay-spire" rel="nofollow">hurling itself</a>.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Death Howl</em>, which gives a sense of the kind of hopeless atmosphere and turn-based deckbuilding gameplay the game is going for, right here.</p>




<p>I'm honestly not sure&nbsp;<em>Death Howl&nbsp;</em>is doing itself any favors by describing itself as a Soulslike; we are, after all, a million miles away from the kind of reflex-based stamina management-reliant combat for which the&nbsp;<em>Souls&nbsp;</em>games and their offshoots are known.</p>

<p>Still, you'll get the chance to find out whether I'm right or not on Monday, when a demo for the game will be made available via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2825880/Death_Howl/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>. The game will also be coming to <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/death_howl" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a>. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ace-combat-7-sales-6m</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ace-combat-7-sales-reach-6-million-as-6th-anniversary-approaches.1085292/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ace-combat-7-sales-6m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has announced that flight sim&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat 7&nbsp;</em>has reached a new sales milestone on the eve of the game's sixth anniversary.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/ace-combat/news/ace-combat-7-skies-unknown-reaches-6-million-units-sold-6th-anniversary" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">notice</a> on the game's official website,&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat 7&nbsp;</em>has officially reached the six million sales mark, which feels particularly appropriate given that the game is about to turn six years old. This latest figure was no doubt helped by&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat 7</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ace-combat-7-skies-unknown-deluxe-edition-announced-for-nintendo-switch" rel="nofollow">launch on Nintendo Switch last year</a>.</p>

<p>Back in November 2023, Bandai Namco revealed that the game had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ace-combat-7-skies-unknown-has-sold-5-million-copies" rel="nofollow">hit the five million sales milestone</a>, which means it's sold another million copies between then and now. It looks like&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat 7&nbsp;</em>is a nice and stable little earner for the studio.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ace-combat-7-sales-shooting.jpg?itok=NMZF7vtp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ace-combat-7-sales-shooting.jpg?itok=_lEw9UtD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Ace Combat 7&nbsp;</em>sales have topped six million.</figcaption></figure><p>Game producer Kazutoki Kono, who's well-known for his work on the&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat&nbsp;</em>franchise, said the milestone meant that his team had achieved its goal to "connect with as many people as possible" through the game. He also thanked everyone who bought&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat 7</em>, as well as those involved with its creation.</p>

<p>Also included in Bandai Namco's milestone announcement post are some digital wallpapers you can download if you want your love of&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat 7&nbsp;</em>to be reflected every time you're looking at your desktop. It's a pretty neat extra!</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat 7</em>, it's the latest major entry in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat&nbsp;</em>series, which began back in 1995 with the PlayStation flight sim&nbsp;<em>Air Combat&nbsp;</em>(released in Japan as&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat</em>).</p>




<p>After&nbsp;2014's&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat Infinity&nbsp;</em>took the series away from its fictional setting of Strangereal,&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat 7&nbsp;</em>returns to that world once again, telling the story of fighter pilot Trigger as he tries to clear his name of a murder he didn't commit.</p>
