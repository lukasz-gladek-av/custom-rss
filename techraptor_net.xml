            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>11 bit studios has announced a&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>modding competition, and the top prize is a hefty wad of cash, but even if you don't win that, there are other goodies up for grabs.</p>

<p>As revealed on the official&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1601580/view/498325386812199405" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">page</a>, the modding contest will see modders using the&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-2-modding-tool-at-launch" rel="nofollow">modding tools</a>&nbsp;in order to create something that will impress and delight the 11 bit judges. The top prize is a $10,000 cash payout, which ain't too shabby.</p>

<p>Even if you don't nab the top prize, though, there are several other areas you might win in. Other contest categories include Best City Mechanics, Best Frostland Mechanics, Best Graphics, and Best Politics, and the best mod in each of these areas will win a custom AMD Radeon RX 7700 graphics card.</p>

<p>Three mods will also be the recipients of the contest's Honorable Mentions, which will net those modders an 11-bit "goodie pack", although 11 bit doesn't say what will be contained within those packs.</p>

<p>In terms of rules, you must submit your&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>mod to mod.io, although you can also upload it to the Steam Workshop if you like. You'll need to use the #fp2modcontest hashtag, too. You can check out the full rules for the contest, as well as info on how to enter, <a href="https://mod.io/g/frostpunk2/r/fp2-mod-contest-terms-conditions" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>.</p>




<p>11 bit says it doesn't matter if you've already uploaded your mod; any mod is eligible, as long as it's uploaded to mod.io, it can run with the current version of&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2</em>, and it doesn't contain "harassment, sexual/erotic, or otherwise inappropriate content".</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the world of&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2</em>, 11 bit revealed back in February that the game will be coming to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-2-console-summer-roadmap" rel="nofollow">sometime this summer</a>, although we still don't have a release date for those versions yet, unfortunately.</p>

<p>For now,&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>is available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1601580/Frostpunk_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, and it's also part of PC Game Pass. The modding contest is open right now, and it runs until August 22nd, with the winners being announced by the start of September.
