            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-review-more-princesses-more-problems<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's now been a little over a year since I played <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="449834bb-ce3a-4a84-8de1-5fb9557c6eb0" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/queen-by-midnight-review-im-prettiest-princess">Darrington Press' <em>Queen By Midnight</em></a>. Taking part in a deckbuilding battle royale where the victor walks away the titular Queen By Midnight this game showed off unique mechanics and a gorgeous cardboard craft clock that serves not only as an impressive setpiece but manages core game mechanics. Now with the standalone expansion, Queen By Midnight Quarter Past, four new Princesses join the fray.</p>



<p>Contained within the box of <em>Queen By Midnight Quarter Past</em> you'll find complete instructions for how to play the game (including boxes that specify what's new in this edition), a flat clock for turn tracking, boards and tokens for each of the four Princesses, specific decks for each Princess, and a deck of Bazaar cards broken up into three time segments.</p>

Players each pick which of the Princesses they wish to play as, gathering up the relevant character board and deck. Then, the clock is laid out and set up with Bazaar cards. Once everyone is ready you roll the dice to see who goes first and begin playing your cards.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While in the original game the clock was a massive structure that doubled as a dice tower that you would build and place on a spinning platform the clock included in Quarter Past is a flat clock. While less intricate it does promote the idea of Quarter Past functioning as a 'travel' version of the game, while the larger box can stay at home.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>A quick gameplay overview</h2>

<p>Working to develop their decks players will use cards to increase their Clout, the primary currency in the game, and purchase new cards. Cards can be purchased from a Princesses specific Vault, which will contain abilities unique to the Princess, or they can be purchased from the Bazaar which offers a more generic, but useful nonetheless, variety of abilities.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Each newly purchased card is sent to the Archive, this game's equivalent of a graveyard, when it will be shuffled back into their deck to then be used against other Princesses.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-azil-game-board.jpg?itok=64-l8yI3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-azil-game-board.jpg?itok=kMf9E-a6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The game is a constant balance of spending and regaining Clout, as your deck grows in size you'll quickly learn you can't just be spending Clout freely as your ability to regain it will return less and less frequently. Alternatively, leaving too much Clout on your board does leave it in a place where it can get stolen by another's card effects.</p>

<p>The deckbuilding alone is a lot of fun but after each player has completed a turn the clock will increment by one. At certain key times, like 5 o'clock or 8 O'Clock important events can happen such as the Bazaar cards being swapped out for a deck filled with more powerful abilities, or the hand size limit is increased.</p>

<p>The game ultimately ends after the clock reaches 12, or if only one competing Princess remains. This does a good job to keep a cap on the events of the game and to limit just how much power creep can occur.</p>

<h2>Drawing At The Start Slows The Game Down</h2>

<p>One of the largest issues that I've found with <em>Queen By Midnight</em> is that as long as you have clout you can be activating cards, in most scenarios, especially in the early game you'll be spending down your entire hand before the end of your turn.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-vault.jpg?itok=QXDKF-Bm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-vault.jpg?itok=KrnB9LHl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Sitting at the table with nothing in your hand isn't anything I have an issue with, but not knowing what I'm going to draw next will mean I have no clue what any of my options are for next turn.</p>

<p>At the start of each player's turn momentum always slows. A fresh hand of cards are drawn, effects are read, Clout is increased, and the six purchasable cards may be reviewed.</p>

<p>This will mean that unless you're playing with a group that knows their Princesses' abilities inside and out that you are limited in how much time you can be strategizing, or you leave the table waiting on you for your move (while they too have no clue what they're going to do next).</p>

<h2>The new Princesses and their abilities</h2>

<p>As the name implies <em>Queen By Midnight Quarter Past</em> sees four new Princesses joining. This expansion includes Azil With-A-Z, Elise LaKraken, Kahurere Skyfisher, and Qasima Al-Basar. Each comes with their own unique mechanics and playstyle that let you mix and match against other players for strange situations.</p>

<p>Azil With-A-Z is a reference to Alice in Wonderland, with the ability to Shrink and Grow. By changing her size she also alters one of her Classes between Brawler and Schemer. Her abilities are incredibly strong, but as you can only perform certain abilities when a certain class you can also end up being stuck unable to deal damage.</p>

<p>I had a lot of fun playing with Azil, there's an important aspect of needing to plan your moves as far out as you can. If an ability would deal damage, but then cause you to shrink, what can you then do in that state? Do you have a way to grow again? It was very satisfying when everything fell into place.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-azil-mechanic.jpg?itok=RsOFrZ3q 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-azil-mechanic.jpg?itok=kEjbZ7hI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Elise LeKraken is a Schemer/Caster character whose core mechanic is to banish her own cards. This would all be a power play to then unleash ultimate abilities near the end of the game to flip the game in her favour.</p>

<p>It was interesting that LeKraken worked almost as a sleeper character, but knowing her mechanics and targeting her early could also be an easy downfall depending on the number of players and how dedicated they were to knocking competition out of the game.</p>

<p>Kahurere Skyfisher is a Brawler/Schemer whose mechanic is in traps. She has a variety of cards that can be placed in other players Archives. When activated those cards might gain a benefit to the Princess, such as getting to draw a card, but it will also provide a boon to Skyfisher.</p>

<p>Whether it be ways to steal Clout or also be able to draw a card there's a lot of good that can be done for Skyfisher on another player's turn, not to mention the inclusion of a card like this is their deck might mean it takes them longer to draw a card they're actually interested in getting.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-character-decks.jpg?itok=LXzowDwL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-character-decks.jpg?itok=hy1Clj8u 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Strangely the card we saw the most from the Skyfisher was to be able to steal 4 Clout. This is a large amount of Clout to be able to freely obtain, but when early turns comprise of gaining a lot of Clout and then spending it down to zero we most often ended up in situations where there wasn't any Clout to steal effectively rendering that card useless.</p>

<p>If Elise LeKraken is a sleeper the opposite of that is Qasima Al-Basar, the Brawler/Caster. This character doesn't start extremely strong but with some smart purchases will not only be dealing consistent damage, but will also grant themselves permanent damage boosts. A hit of three or four damage might not be much early on, but when the pace doesn't even stop but she's now hitting with eight damage you're going to be in trouble very quickly.</p>

<p>While Skyfisher seemed to have a narrower range of effectiveness the engine that is driving each of these decks is wildly different and a lot of fun. Further fleshing out the availability from the previously released Princesses the idea of "there's a playstyle for any kind of deckbuilding player" is even more true than before.</p>

<p>I think one of the best compliments I can give for the game is that it feels like getting to play Magic The Gathering, without the need to build a deck and strategy from the ground up. That being said there's still a lot of building as you weigh up purchasing cards from the Vault and Bazaar.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-clock.jpg?itok=MCDxU0T3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-clock.jpg?itok=fj-TT5O7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Is <em>Queen By Midnight Quarter Past </em>Standalone or an Expansion?</h2>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Everything included in the box allows you to play <em>Queen By Midnight</em> from start to finish with four players. As an expansion though all of the Princesses available in this box can be played with any of the six previously available Princesses.</p>

<p>While Skyfisher seemed to have issues when facing off against Azil, it might be that there's another Princess that she has a definite advantage against.</p>

<p>To add further to this being an expansion Errata Cards for the base game have also been included in this update. These cards should be swapped out with cards that appear in the base game to better balance the experience.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-errata-cards.jpg?itok=1eMfS_EL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-errata-cards.jpg?itok=ddiZcdNm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2><em>Queen By Midnight Quarter Past</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>I genuinely enjoyed the original game when I played it so I was excited to hear that there would be an expansion. The triple versatility allowing it to add more characters for fans of the base game, be a smaller entry point for new players, and even serve as a way to send updated cards allows it to achieve it's goal perfectly.</p>

<p>Of the four new Princesses I'm a little iffy on Skyfisher, but had a blast seeing what the other three were able to accomplish.</p>

<p>If you were a fan of the original game then this expansion is a no brainer, and if you don't know the original but are looking for a fun and deep deckbuilder where the game naturally scales as time goes on then I'd highly recommend checking this out.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-photo-puzzle-solved<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>An enterprising&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>player has solved a rather involved puzzle involving examining in-game photos, earning himself some praise from the game's director into the bargain.</p>

<p>Redditor Dale Robinson <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1gine5k/i_solved_the_sh2_remake_photos_secret/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">created a lengthy post yesterday</a> detailing all the steps he took to solve the puzzle. I don't wish to spoil the steps just in case you want to discover it for yourself, but suffice it to say that you'll need a healthy dose of lateral thinking if you do.</p>

<p>Robinson's efforts were <a href="https://x.com/Mateusz_Lenart_/status/1853189523745730675" rel="noopener" target="_blank">lauded on X (formerly Twitter)</a> by&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>director Mateusz Lenart, who said he "knew it wouldn't stay hidden for long" and congratulated Robinson for solving the brain-teaser, suggesting that the "timing couldn't be better". Again, that post contains puzzle spoilers, so click at your peril.</p>

<p>Just in case you're unaware, the&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake is, believe it or not, a reimagined version of the original 2002 survival horror classic. While the original game was created by Konami, this one's been developed by&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/medium">The Medium</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Layers of Fear&nbsp;</em>studio Bloober Team, with Konami serving as publisher.</p>

<p>The game hews fairly closely to the original&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2</em>'s story, but it features a new over-the-shoulder camera perspective, as well as extra story elements and quality-of-life gameplay tweaks.</p>




<p>The game proved popular with both critics and fans, selling <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-1m">a million copies within its first three days</a> on sale, although that didn't stop <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-wikipedia-page-locked">Wikipedia trolls from trying to edit the game's page</a> to suggest it had received much lower scores than it actually did.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-generative-ai-vp</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/netflix-goes-all-in-on-generative-ai-for-gaming-appoints-dedicated-vp.1026825/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-generative-ai-vp<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Netflix has appointed a VP (vice president) of generative AI within its gaming division, indicating that the tech giant is serious about the controversial technology when it comes to video games.</p>

<p>The VP in question is none other than Mike Verdu, who confirmed the news <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mike-verdu-2a6113_new-role-at-netflix-vp-genai-for-games-activity-7259029850827423744-YMg4/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">via his LinkedIn page</a>. Verdu says his new role at Netflix is to drive "a 'once in a generation' inflection point for game development and player experiences using generative AI".</p>

<p>Previously, Verdu worked as Netflix's overall games VP, but that role will now be filled by Alain Tascan, who Verdu says is "already in the process of taking Netflix Games in exciting new directions".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/netflix-games-generative-ai-vp-tiles.jpg?itok=pPu8zuXh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/netflix-games-generative-ai-vp-tiles.jpg?itok=cjQSaYPt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Netflix has appointed a VP to handle generative AI for its gaming division.</figcaption></figure><p>Verdu says that generative AI represents a return to "seemingly unlimited potential and the rapid pace of innvoation" in gaming, expressing excitement he says he hasn't felt "since the 90s".</p>

<p>He also exhorts readers to "pay no mind to the uninformed speculation in the media" about recent changes to Netflix Games, presumably referring to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-team-blue-shut-down-report">reported closure</a> of Netflix's in-house AAA development studio, codenamed Team Blue.</p>

<p>According to Verdu, everything that's happened within Netflix Games in the last several months "was actually a planned transition", suggesting that the closure of Team Blue wasn't a kneejerk response but a carefully-considered decision.</p>

<p>The vision for generative AI at Netflix, according to Verdu, is one that "puts creative talent at the center", uses AI as "a catalyst and an accelerant", and enables big development teams to "move much faster".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ubisoft-generative-ai.jpg?itok=hcGzR3dw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ubisoft-generative-ai.jpg?itok=IiC-FpfN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Other studios, like Ubisoft, are also leaning into generative AI.</figcaption></figure><p>The topic of generative AI is a controversial one in the gaming world (and, indeed, the rest of the world) right now.</p>

<p>Proponents like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hasbro-ceo-chris-cocks-expresses-support-of-ai-in-dungeons-dragons">Hasbro</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nihon-falcom-considering-ai-translation">Nihon Falcom</a>, and <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/5qXdxhshJBXoanFZApdG3L/how-ubisofts-new-generative-ai-prototype-changes-the-narrative-for-npcs" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ubisoft</a>&nbsp;tout the potential benefits of the technology and seem enthusiastic about the ways in which they believe it could change the gaming landscape, but there are certainly no shortage of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-generative-ai-no-plans">ambivalent</a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/kobold-press-ceo-says-no-to-generative-ai">skeptical voices</a> in the industry on this front.</p>

<p>In any case, we don't know exactly how Verdu and Netflix intend to use generative AI, so we'll likely have to wait until a major project from the company is announced in order to learn more. Stay tuned!</p>
