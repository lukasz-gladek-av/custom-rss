            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remedy Entertainment has revealed what's coming next to multiplayer-focused shooter&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>, and there's a major update incoming in September, plus more.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540/view/536607976683733002" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Steam, Remedy says its upcoming "cadence" for communication, as well as updates for&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>in general, will "slow down" as the studio focuses on work for a major update that's coming in September.</p>

<p>Remedy goes on to say that while it wants to tell players what's coming in the update, "the nature of game development is that things change frequently", and promising certain features only for them not to end up in the final update would "get [the studio] into trouble".</p>

<p>Gunplay is also being improved; Remedy says that while it doesn't want&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>to become a conventional shooter, it does recognize the need to improve the game's arsenal, so three new heavy guns will be added in September.</p>

<p>Generic upgrades for weapons will also be removed, and they'll be replaced by a mod system that will let you "tweak how you want your guns to work and the ways in which they become more powerful over time".</p>

<p>There's tons of other stuff coming to&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>in September as well, although as Remedy says, some of what's being worked on may not make it into this update, and you may well see other features that haven't been teased yet as well.</p>
