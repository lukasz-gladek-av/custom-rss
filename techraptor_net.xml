            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-royal-writ-permadeath-deckbuilder<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yogscast Games and developer Save Sloth Studios have announced&nbsp;<em>The Royal Writ</em>, a lane-based deckbuilder with an extra sting in its tail for those who like their difficulty a little higher.</p>

<p>The game sees you marching your troops across a series of procedurally-generated maps in order to defeat the final boss and emerge from your run victorious. So far, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-train-2-announced-demo-now" rel="nofollow">so deckbuilder</a>, but there's a twist to this one.</p>

<p>If your cards arrive at their destination and the enemy base still has health remaining, then those cards will be permanently deleted from your deck for that run, so you'll have to make clever decisions about which cards to send and which ones to reserve.</p>

<p>The studios say the point is either to "achieve victory through strategic planning or game-breaking synergies", or to "fail miserably because your soldier got stuck in a bog and you forgot he can't fly". We've all been there.</p>

<p>All of this is wrapped up in "cute picture-book visuals" that emphasize the "grotesque and absurd humor of a medieval world engulfed in constant war and deceit".</p>

<p>Development on&nbsp;<em>The Royal Writ&nbsp;</em>began as part of game jam competition Ludum Dare 55, and following "hugely positive feedback", the game moved into full development. You can check out&nbsp;<em>The Royal Writ</em>'s debut trailer here.</p>




<p>Unfortunately,&nbsp;<em>The Royal Writ&nbsp;</em>doesn't have a release date yet, but if you'd like to give the game a go, a playable demo will be available "soon", according to Yogscast and Save Sloth.</p>

<p><em>The Royal Writ&nbsp;</em>is set for release in 2025 for PC via Steam. There's no word on console ports for the game yet.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dont-nod-revenue-dips-in-2024-lost-records-sales-in-line-with-forecasts.1166664/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-nod-revenue-2024-lost-records<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage&nbsp;</em>developer Don't Nod has released its financial statement for the 2024-25 fiscal year, and things are looking a little gloomy for the French studio.</p>

<p>The statement shows that revenues are down significantly; operating revenues fell by 25% to&nbsp;€23.9 million, as compared to 2023's&nbsp;€32.1 million figure. CEO Oskar Guilbert says this year's performance reflects games that "fell short of our expectations" despite "a very positive critical reception".</p>

<p>Despite the revenue drop, Don't Nod says sales were up 14% on last year, largely driven by the studio's back catalog, as well as 2023's&nbsp;<em>Jusant&nbsp;</em>and early 2024's&nbsp;<em>Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden&nbsp;</em>(although <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-nod-financials-first-half-2024" rel="nofollow">both games underperformed by the studio's standards</a>).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden-dont-nod-financials-2024.jpg?itok=Xx9xNHlH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden-dont-nod-financials-2024.jpg?itok=Z8Arhvcd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Don't Nod's revenues were down in 2024, but sales were up.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Don't Nod, future sales for&nbsp;<em>Jusant&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Banishers&nbsp;</em>are "not expected to generate sufficient revenues to cover the full development costs", which essentially means both games have made a loss.</p>

<p>Additionally, the "temporary suspension" of the as-yet unannounced projects P12 and P13, as well as the full cancellation of projects P10 and P14 (these are all internal codenames, of course), led to further losses for Don't Nod.</p>

<p>With all of this said, you might be wondering how the studio's most recent release,&nbsp;<em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</em>, is performing. Don't Nod doesn't provide sales figures for the game, but it does say sales are "in line with forecasts in an increasingly selective market".</p>

<p>The studio also points to the "critical acclaim" for&nbsp;<em>Lost Records</em>, which is reflected by the game's Metacritic average and Steam review score. Our own Tyler was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/lost-records-bloom-rage-tape-1-review-rocking-in-90s" rel="nofollow">reasonably impressed</a> by&nbsp;<em>Lost Records&nbsp;</em>as well.</p>

That's scheduled for release in late 2025.</p>
