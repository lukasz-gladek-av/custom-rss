            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A streamer battling stage 4 cancer has been scammed to the tune of around $30,000 by a Steam game that concealed cryptodrain malware, and while the game has been removed, it remained online for around three weeks with the malware infecting its code.</p>

<p>As spotted by ResetEra user <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/streamer-rastaland-raising-money-for-his-stage-4-cancer-treatment-gets-30k-stolen-from-steam-game-containing-malware-while-streaming.1303938/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Atheerios</a>, streamer rastaland, who is suffering from a stage 4 sarcoma (which means the cancer has metastasized to other parts of his body), was tricked into downloading a Steam demo by the name of&nbsp;<em>BlockBlasters</em>, which&nbsp;contained a cryptodrainer.</p>

<p>If you're not sure what a cryptodrainer is, it's essentially a malicious piece of software that drains cryptocurrency from users' wallets (hence the name). As rastaland himself <a href="https://x.com/rastalandtv/status/1969629808788181258" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">says</a>, the malware drained him for "over $32,000" in creator fees earned through crypto platform pump.fun.</p>

Honestly, I'd recommend against watching it because it's completely heartbreaking, but if you'd like to get all your ducks in a row, it's there for you to watch.</p>

<p>As reported by cyber defense blog <a href="https://www.gdatasoftware.com/blog/2025/09/38265-steam-blockblasters-game-downloads-malware" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">G Data</a>,&nbsp;<em>BlockBlasters&nbsp;</em>seemingly didn't contain any malicious code until August 30th, when the cryptodrainer in question was added to the game. G Data's report also contains a great rundown of how exactly the drainer works and what you can watch out for to avoid being scammed yourself.</p>

<p>G Data points out that this isn't the first instance of malware being injected into Steam games; other examples include free-to-play survival sims&nbsp;<em>PirateFi&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Chemia</em>, both of which were compromised by malicious updates.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/chemia-scam-cryptodrainer-steam.jpg?itok=brvatRhM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/chemia-scam-cryptodrainer-steam.jpg?itok=0Lr34Rj7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Chemia&nbsp;</em>is another example of a Steam game injected with malware.</figcaption></figure><p>All three of the games I've mentioned in this article have now been removed from Steam, but according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3872350/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, two people are still playing&nbsp;<em>BlockBlasters&nbsp;</em>on Steam right now. If that's you and you're reading this, I'd strongly recommend backing out of the game and deleting it.</p>

<p>As for rastaland, he's apparently been <a href="https://x.com/rastalandTV/status/1969993892889027069" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">inundated</a> with support and kind words from his community, and it looks like crypto enthusiast Alex Becker <a href="https://x.com/ZssBecker/status/1969774353211695441" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sent</a> the streamer enough money to cover the loss, which is a lovely gesture.</p>

<p>This feels to me like a pretty sobering reminder to be extremely careful when getting involved with anything Web3-related, whatever <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/might-and-magic-fates-blockchain-mobile" rel="nofollow">certain major publishers</a>&nbsp;may <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/immensely-popular-classic-sega-franchise-will-become-nft-game" rel="nofollow">tell you</a>.
