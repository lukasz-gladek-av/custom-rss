            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Maestro Media has announced an official card game based on James Cameron's<em> Avatar</em>. The new game, <em>Avatar: Pandora's Power</em>, pits players in a fast-paced battle for control of the alien world of Pandora.</p><h2>The <em>Avatar: Pandora's Power</em> Card Game Announcement</h2><p>According to a report <a href="https://icv2.com/articles/news/view/61628/maestro-media-licenses-avatar-new-tabletop-game" rel="nofollow">by ICV2</a>, <em>Avatar: Pandora's Power</em> is an asymmetric card game designed for two players. Players take on the role of either the RDA or a faction of Na'Vi as they battle across various locations on Pandora. The core gameplay isn't a deckbuilding experience but lane-battling, similar to a MOBA. The first person to reach 30 points is declared the winner.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>Maestro Media's CEO Javon Frazier explained the more asymmetric elements of the card game.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>"The RDA and the Na’vi do not play the same game, and they should not. One side is focused, aggressive, and extractive. The other is adaptive, interconnected, and rooted in the land. The asymmetry is the experience. Every match becomes a tense, strategic story about control, resistance, and what it means to fight for a world worth protecting.”</p></blockquote><p><em>Avatar: Pandora's Power</em> is the latest Maestro Media project adapting popular and beloved media properties. Their past work includes the Kickstarter campaign for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/disney-afternoon-rewind-kickstarter-campaign-blows-up-with-millennial-nostalgia" rel="nofollow"><em>Disney Afternoon Rewind Collection</em></a>, a board game adaptation of the mobile title, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/maestro-media-announces-clash-of-clans-epic-raid-board-game-based-on-hit-mobile-game" rel="nofollow"><em>Clash of Clans</em></a>, a tabletop adaptation of the Stanley Kubrick film, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/2001-space-odyssey-board-game-tasks-you-with-outsmarting-hal-9000" rel="nofollow"><em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em></a>, and a board game based on <em>The Smurfs</em>.</p><p>Curiously, <em>Avatar: Pandora's Power</em> is one of few board game adaptations of James Cameron's blockbuster films. Despite spanning three feature films dating back to 2009, Avatar has very little multimedia presence outside of a few tie-in comics. The last board game release was <em>Avatar: The Board Game</em> released by Mega Games in 2010, which currently sits at 4.8/10 on Board Game Geek.</p><p>At the time of writing, there is no release date or MSRP for <em>Avatar: Pandora's Power</em>.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
