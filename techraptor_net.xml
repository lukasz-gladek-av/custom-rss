            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>NetEase has announced&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>Season 5's release date, and the two heroes who will be joining the game's roster are none other than iconic X-Men Gambit and Rogue.</p>

<p>As revealed in a brand new trailer, the Cajun card shark and the Mississippi power-sapper will be part of the hero shooter's fifth season, which will debut across all platforms on November 14th (so in just a couple of days!).</p>

<p>Usually, one of the two heroes arrives alongside the season's start, while the other will be added to the roster a few weeks into the cycle. We don't yet know which of the two will be the first to enter&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' arena, nor has it been officially revealed what class the two heroes will occupy.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-rivals-season-5-gambit-rogue.jpg?itok=LhtVKXPH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-rivals-season-5-gambit-rogue.jpg?itok=ZgQrsMoG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>Season 5 will add two fan-favorite X-Men to the roster.</figcaption></figure><p>The trailer for the two heroes, titled "Love Is a Battlefield", suggests that&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' fifth season will revolve around Gambit and Rogue's marriage, which is interrupted by "destiny". This prompts Gambit to set out on a journey to "win back the moment time itself stole from [him and Rogue]".</p>

<p><em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>Season 5 follows on from the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-season-4" rel="nofollow">fourth season back in September</a>, during which Daredevil and Angela were introduced. The former is a Duelist and the latter is a Vanguard, which might well suggest that Gambit will be another Duelist and Rogue will take the form of a Strategist.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>Season 5 right here. It doesn't give too much away about what you can expect from the season, but it does show off the designs for Gambit and Rogue, which are pretty nice.</p>




<p><em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>Season 5 will arrive on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2767030/Marvel_Rivals/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/marvel-rivals/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/marvel-rivals/9n8pmw7qmd3d" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on November 14th, and you can also check the game out for free right now across all of those platforms.</p>
