            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-plans-for-cyberpunk-2077-ps5-pro-patch<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>CD Projekt Red has confirmed that it currently doesn't have any plans to release a&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>PS5 Pro patch, so if you were hoping the game was about to get cyber-augmented for Sony's beefy new machine, you're out of luck, unfortunately.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1859151714747552122" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, CDPR crushes the dreams of anyone who was hoping for a PS5 Pro-enhanced version of&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>in just nine words (or ten if you consider "PS5" two words): "we currently have no plans for PS5 Pro patch".</p>

<p>Of course, CD Projekt Red is fully entitled to do whatever it likes with its games, but the lack of a PS5 Pro patch for&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>feels a touch disappointing given the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-2077-opencritic-page-will-warn-players-about-technical-issues" rel="nofollow">history of technical issues</a> (although those issues admittedly weren't anywhere near as bad in the PS5 version).</p>

<p>It's likely that production on the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-team-relocating-to-boston" rel="nofollow">sequel</a> is taking precedence over further major changes to the original game. Last we heard, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-sold-43-million-copies-as-dev-team-for-sequel-is-being" rel="nofollow">development team for said sequel was being assembled</a>, although naturally, we don't know what the game will be called or when it will launch yet.</p>

<p>Although&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>won't be enhanced for the PS5 Pro, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/full-ps5-pro-enhanced-list-launch" rel="nofollow">host of other games</a> do have enhancements for Sony's new console. Titles like&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls</em>,&nbsp;<em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</em>, and the recently-released&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>all have extra visual or performance features on Sony's new console.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Shiren the Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island PC Release Confirmed]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shiren-wanderer-mystery-dungeon-of-serpentcoil-island-pc</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/shiren-the-wanderer-the-mystery-dungeon-of-serpentcoil-island-pc-release-confirmed.1040721/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shiren-wanderer-mystery-dungeon-of-serpentcoil-island-pc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Spike Chunsoft has announced that roguelike RPG&nbsp;<em>Shiren the Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island</em>, which proved pretty popular on Switch, is officially heading to PC via Steam.</p>

<p>In a press release, the company reveals that&nbsp;<em>The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island&nbsp;</em>is the fastest-selling game in the&nbsp;<em>Shiren the Wanderer&nbsp;</em>series, having surpassed 200,000 copies shipped in Japan "quickly" following its launch in January.</p>

<p>That sales performance is probably why Spike Chunsoft has decided to release this one on Steam as well, although we don't know when the game is arriving on the platform, unfortunately; the Steam page simply reads "coming soon" under the release date heading.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shiren-the-wanderer-the-mystery-dungeon-of-serpentcoil-island-steam-combat.jpg?itok=8g0-XUCD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shiren-the-wanderer-the-mystery-dungeon-of-serpentcoil-island-steam-combat.jpg?itok=FMrBh5EE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Shiren the Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island&nbsp;</em>is officially coming to Steam.</figcaption></figure><p>As the press release points out,&nbsp;<em>The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island&nbsp;</em>is the first&nbsp;<em>Shiren the Wanderer&nbsp;</em>game to make its way to the West since 2016's <i>The Tower of Fortune and the Dice of Fate</i>, which also came to Switch in 2020.</p>

<p>In fact, that game itself was originally released in 2010 for the DS before getting a PlayStation Vita port in 2015, which was subsequently released in the West the following year.</p>

<p>In the years between 2010 and this year, only one&nbsp;<em>Shiren the Wanderer&nbsp;</em>game was released: 2013's&nbsp;<em>Princess Suzune and the Tower of Slumber</em>, which was...a pachinko game. Hardly counts as a&nbsp;<em>Shiren the Wanderer&nbsp;</em>release, if you ask me.</p>

<p>That means that technically,&nbsp;<em>Shiren the Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island&nbsp;</em>is the first full game in the series for a staggering 14 years.</p>




<p><em>The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island&nbsp;</em>introduces some new elements to&nbsp;<em>Shiren the Wanderer</em>, including 3D visuals, creating "a fresh and exciting adventure", as Spike Chunsoft puts it.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with the basic structure of the game, it's a roguelike RPG in which you must explore a series of dungeons filled with monsters, traps, and items to collect. Dying during exploration will mean losing everything you've collected, so this is very much not one for the faint of heart.</p>

<p><em>Shiren the Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island&nbsp;</em>is available <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/shiren-the-wanderer-the-mystery-dungeon-of-serpentcoil-island-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right now on Switch</a> and is launching for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2178480/Shiren_the_Wanderer_The_Mystery_Dungeon_of_Serpentcoil_Island/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> sometime in the future. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-review-bomb</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-review-bombed-on-steam-due-to-server-issues.1040679/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-review-bomb<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024&nbsp;</em>is being hit with extremely negative reviews on Steam after seemingly launching with extensive server issues, with users pointing to server loops, excessive loading times, and login queues as major issues, as well as problems with the game's cloud asset infrastructure.</p>

<p>Just yesterday, Microsoft and developer Asobo Studio released the latest iteration of the&nbsp;<em>Microsoft Flight Simulator&nbsp;</em>franchise, but it's already run into major issues, accruing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2537590/Microsoft_Flight_Simulator_2024/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an Overwhelmingly Negative rating on Steam</a> across 2,955 reviews (at time of writing).</p>

<p>One of the biggest issues users seem to be pointing out has to do with how&nbsp;<em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024&nbsp;</em>loads its assets. Much of the game's asset loading, including for aircraft, liveries, and more, is tied to cloud streaming, and since servers are struggling, that seems to be leading to problems.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-review-bomb-klm-flight.jpg?itok=m2O1_FPO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-review-bomb-klm-flight.jpg?itok=xUBK3pyC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024&nbsp;</em>players are not happy with how the game has been released.</figcaption></figure><p>One player says they were <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199244305024/recommended/2537590/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">stuck on a loading screen "for 65 minutes"</a>, with the screen freezing up at 97% and seemingly refusing to load any further than that.</p>

<p>Another <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198192847703/recommended/2537590/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">points out some of the aforementioned issues</a>&nbsp;and says&nbsp;<em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024&nbsp;</em>"feels like an alpha build", concluding that it "looks pretty and has potential but needs a lot of work". That's particularly damning for a game with a hefty asking price of $69.99.</p>

<p>The game's developers have said they are aware of the issue, dedicating a developer livestream to the problem earlier today.&nbsp;<em>Microsoft Flight Simulator&nbsp;</em>head Jorg Neumann said the team had "completely underestimated how high" pre-release excitement had been for the game.</p>

<p>Asobo Studio CEO Sebastian Wloch offers a technical explanation for the issues; players are asking&nbsp;<em>Flight Simulator 2024</em>'s servers for data, which is then cached in a database, but said cache is "currently getting saturated".</p>




<p>Wloch says the team stress-tested&nbsp;<em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</em>'s servers during the game's tech alpha, with the team performing load tests "simulating 200,000 users", but he concedes that the game has been "completely overwhelmed".</p>

<p>Community manager Jayne, also known as Jummivana, pledges to keep players updated via social media, and Neumann concludes the stream by apologizing to affected players, acknowledging that many are "frustrated" with the game's issues.</p>

<p>He says that although he knows the development team "had some problems today", the devs are "on it" and attempting to fix&nbsp;<em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</em>'s issues. Unfortunately, though, for now, if you're stuck, it looks like there's no fix yet.</p>

<p>If you want to try your luck, you can grab&nbsp;<em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024&nbsp;</em>right now on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2537590/Microsoft_Flight_Simulator_2024/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a> or the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Microsoft Store</a>, as well as Xbox Series X|S. The game is also part of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/all-confirmed-xbox-game-pass-november-2024-games" rel="nofollow">November's Xbox Game Pass lineup</a>&nbsp;for PC Game Pass or Ultimate members.</p>
