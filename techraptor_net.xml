            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/invincible-ttrpg-by-free-league-brings-superhero-action-to-gaming-tables<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Free League and Skybound Interactive are working on an official <em>Invincible</em> TTRPG. Several industry veterans will design this tabletop adaptation of the superhero property created by Robert Kirkman, including a producer on <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>.</p>

<h2>The <em>Invincible</em> TTRPG Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, the <em>Invincible</em> TTRPG will be coming to Kickstarter later this year. The game's initial release will include a Core Rulebook containing everything needed to play and a beginner-friendly Starter Set. Both books will be illustrated by original comic artists Cory Walker and Ryan Ottley with graphic design by Johan Nohr.</p>

The lead designers include Adam Bradford, the founder of the virtual tabletop platform D&amp;D Beyond. Bradford has also produced for <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, <em>Cortex Prime</em>, and <em>Marvel</em>. The second designer is Free League co-founder Tomas Harenstam, whose design credits include the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-alien-tabletop-rpg-hits-shelves-this-december" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Alien RPG</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/free-league-announces-year-zero-engine-ogl" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Mutant Year Zero</em></a>, and <em>Dragonbane</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“One of my very first tabletop roleplaying games was the old Marvel Superheroes by TSR, and making a superhero RPG has been a lifelong dream. I think the genre, and Invincible’s more grounded and visceral take on it, is a great fit for the Year Zero Engine game mechanics,” says Tomas Härenstam.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Notably, the press release doesn't state what RPG system the <em>Invincible TTRPG</em> will use. Given Free League's history, there's a chance it will use a modified version of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/free-league-announces-year-zero-engine-ogl" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Year Zero Engine</a>, the same one used for <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/coriolis-great-dark-fully-funded-in-7-minutes-on-kickstarter" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Coriolis</em></a> and<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/walking-dead-ttrpg-shambles-to-tables-fall-2023" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em> The Walking Dead RPG</em></a>. Given the system's versatility, it is not out of the realm of possibility.</p>

<p>Invincible was a comic series created by Robert Kirkman in 2003. It heralded the end of the Dark Age of comic books thanks to its well-written and complex characters, mature but heroic storylines, and a complex superhero world unburdened by decades of history or the messy storytelling baggage of retcons told over 144 issues.</p>

<p>The series has recently been adapted into an animated series on Prime Video. This series recently aired its third season.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monolith-productions-and-more-reportedly-closed-by-wb-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Video games layoffs continue as it appears to be hitting Warner Bros owned studios. A new <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:2mkgbhbhqvappkkorf2bzyrp/post/3lizk5skwps2d?ref_src=embed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Jason Schrier on BlueSky">report from Jason Schreier</a>, shared that the latest studios to be cut are: Monolith Productions, Player First Games, and WB San Diego.</p>

<p>As part of the closure of Monolith Productions, the Wonder Woman game that they were working on is also being cancelled. The game was expected to make use of their signature Nemesis System that premiered back in <em>Middle-Earth: Shadows of Mordor</em>. As of last known count, over 170 people worked at Monolith Productions.</p>

<p>This follows the stepping down of WB Games head <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warner-bros-games-david-haddad-stepping-down" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Warner Bros. Games Head David Haddad to Step Down After 12 Years">David Haddad last month</a> after 12 years on the job. It marks a decrease in WB Games' lineup following the failure of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/suicide-squad-kill-justice-league" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League"><em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em></a>, <em>Harry Potter Quidd itch Champions</em>, and struggles with <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/multiversus" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Multiversus"><em>Multiversus</em> </a>(which was worked on by Player First Games and WB San Diego). Additionally, last year <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rocksteady-layoffs-suicide-squad" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Suicide Squad Developer Rocksteady Hit by Layoffs">Rocksteady was hit by a pair </a><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rocksteady-layoffs-end-of-2024" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Suicide Squad Studio Rocksteady Reportedly Hit by More Layoffs">of layoffs</a>.</p>

<p>The remaining studios that are part of WB Games are:</p>

<ul><li>Rocksteady (who worked on<em> Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em>, and previously made the <em>Arkham</em> games).</li>
	<li>WB Montreal (<em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>),</li>
	<li>TT Games (Lego games),</li>
	<li>NetherRealm (<em>Mortal Kombat</em> and <em>Injustice</em>),</li>
	<li>WB Games offices in New York, San Francisco, and Boston.</li>
</ul><p>Earlier today we shared the announcement that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/striking-distance-layoffs-callisto-protocol" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" The Callisto Protocol Developer Striking Distance Lays Off &quot;Most&quot; Developers">Striking Distance laid off</a> most of its employees as 2025 continues to be full of layoffs for the video game industry. This is also part of WB Discovery's pattern of massive cuts under CEO <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/warner-bros-discovery-lays-off-1000-employees-finance-max-1236074169/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Warner Bros.

The TV executive has said that these cuts took "courage" to make.</p>

<p>For now we're left pondering the works that came in the past, such as the masterful <em>Shadows of Mordor</em> from Monolith Productions, or the missed potential of <em>Multiversus</em>.</p>
