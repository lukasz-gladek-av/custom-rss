            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It looks as though Bandai Namco may have just inadvertently confirmed a&nbsp;<em>Tales of Xillia&nbsp;</em>remaster, if a thumbnail for an upcoming YouTube premiere is anything to go by.</p>

<p>As spotted by X user <a href="https://x.com/lowedeltaa/status/1955925606274658555" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Lowedelta</a> (via ResetEra user <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/bandai-namco-seemingly-accidentally-confirms-tales-of-xillia-remaster-announcement-expected-august-18th.1269954/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Shona</a>), the YouTube thumbnail for an impending news video about the&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>series shows a screenshot from&nbsp;<em>Tales of Xillia</em>, depicting several of the game's characters having a conversation in one of its skits.</p>

<p>This, as Shona points out, may well be an error on Bandai Namco's part; rather than choosing a custom thumbnail for the livestream, the studio may instead have opted to allow YouTube to choose one, and the one it picked is from partway through the video.</p>

<p>Either way, the video premieres on August 18th, so we won't have to wait too long to find out. It's a premiere, too, rather than a livestream, so you shouldn't have to wade through too much pre-announcement banter.</p>

<p>If a&nbsp;<em>Tales of Xillia&nbsp;</em>remaster is indeed on the cards, it would be consistent with Bandai Namco's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-series-remasters-regular" rel="nofollow">assertion back in December</a>&nbsp;that&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>series remasters would be coming "fairly consistently". Producer Yusuke Tomizawa said at the time that the studio intends to continue remastering games from the series "as much as possible".</p>

<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Tales of Xillia&nbsp;</em>itself, it's an ideal candidate for the remaster treatment; it was originally released on PS3 back in 2013, and it's never been released on any subsequent system, so it's currently impossible to play the game unless you already own it.</p>




<p>We'll have to wait and see what Bandai Namco has in store for the&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>series when its next news video premieres on Monday. Stay tuned.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ratatan-early-access-release-date-september</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/patapon-creators-ratatan-launches-in-early-access-next-month.1270035/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Ratatan</em>, the rhythm-action game created by several ex-<em>Patapon&nbsp;</em>developers, will launch on PC via Steam Early Access next month, developer Ratata Arts has announced.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Ratatan&nbsp;</em>will arrive on September 19th, having been <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2949320/view/520843384949050989" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">delayed</a> from its originally-intended launch date of July 25th. That delay, Ratata Arts said at the time, was put into effect in order to implement various pieces of player feedback from the game's Steam Next Fest demo.</p>

<p>Now, the developer says&nbsp;<em>Ratatan&nbsp;</em>"has evolved substantially" since that demo was released, and it looks like the&nbsp;<em>Patapon&nbsp;</em>spiritual successor is finally ready to launch (in Early Access, of course).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ratatan-early-access-release-date-beach.jpg?itok=lNzUIJdc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ratatan-early-access-release-date-beach.jpg?itok=xrrZnqYg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Patapon&nbsp;</em>spiritual successor&nbsp;<em>Ratatan&nbsp;</em>is launching in September.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Ratatan&nbsp;</em>was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/patapon-developers-reveal-spiritual-successor-ratatan-kickstarter-campaign-coming" rel="nofollow">revealed back in July 2023</a>, at which point the developers also promised that the game would get a Kickstarter campaign.</p>

<p>That campaign was subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/patapon-spiritual-successor-ratatan-fully-funded-on-kickstarter-in-48-minutes" rel="nofollow">fully funded in under an hour</a>, allowing Ratata Arts to fulfil stretch goals like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/patapon-spiritual-successor-ratatan-recruits-more-sony-japan-studio-veterans-with-final" rel="nofollow">hiring more ex-Japan Studio staff</a>, adding <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/patapon-spiritual-successor-ratatan-reveals-super-catchy-music-clears-multiplayer" rel="nofollow">multiplayer modes</a>, and bringing&nbsp;<em>Ratatan&nbsp;</em>to consoles (although it won't launch on other systems at the same time as PC).</p>

<p>The game eventually closed its crowdfunding campaign at a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/patapon-spiritual-successor-ratatan-successfully-ends-kickstarter-campaign-at-15" rel="nofollow">whopping $1.5 million raised</a>, so it's clear there's an appetite for a&nbsp;<em>Patapon&nbsp;</em>spiritual successor. That's likely also why Ratata Arts has taken such care to improve the game since its initial demo.</p>

<p>As for what you can expect from&nbsp;<em>Ratatan</em>, the devs describe it as a "rhythm roguelike action game that combines rhythm games and side-scrolling action", complete with a "toe-tapping soundtrack". You can check out a trailer for&nbsp;<em>Ratatan&nbsp;</em>(albeit one with a now-incorrect release date) right here.</p>




<p><em>Ratatan&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2949320/Ratatan/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on September 19th. There's no word yet about when the game will be coming to consoles, but it might be a case of waiting until the 1.0 release. Stay tuned for more.</p>
