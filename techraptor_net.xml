            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A PEGI rating has appeared for <em>Splatoon 3 </em>on Nintendo Switch 2, suggesting that a full Switch 2 Edition version of the game could be on the way soon.</p><p>The <a href="https://pegi.info/search-pegi?q=Splatoon+3" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">rating</a> (which was first spotted by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/splatoon-3-rated-for-switch-2-in-europe" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Gematsu</a>) lists the release date as December 31st, although that's almost certainly a placeholder, unless Nintendo intends to release the game in the next few hours. It's unlikely, but it's not impossible!</p><p>If a Switch 2 Edition of <em>Splatoon 3 </em>is planned, it'll be a different prospect to the free update released for the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splatoon-raiders-splatoon-3-switch-2" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="838585b0-e552-447b-bbf4-87e2329e177e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">a few months ago</a>, which was announced alongside a brand new <em>Splatoon </em>spinoff game. Nintendo hasn't revealed any new info about that project yet, but we'll probably learn more about <em>Splatoon Raiders </em>in the new year.</p><figure role="group">

<p>Naturally, the game bears the same PEGI rating as its Switch version, which is to say a PEGI 7. The rating warns those buying <em>Splatoon 3 </em>about its "violence" and "in-game purchases", so if you're planning to pick it up on Switch 2, you have been warned.</p><p>The <em>Splatoon 3 </em>Switch 2 listing follows the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splatoon-3-updates-ending" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="606f040c-e9d7-4046-8557-17a8d3ce9a10" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">cessation of updates for the game</a> back in 2024, but don't worry if you haven't played for a while; the servers are very much still operational, so you can still enjoy games of <em>Splatoon 3 </em>whenever you like.</p><p>If you're unfamiliar with <em>Splatoon 3</em>, it is, as you might expect, the third installment of the <em>Splatoon </em>series, and like its predecessors, the game revolves around quick shootouts in which the goal is to ink the most territory for your team (although other modes are available as well).</p><p>The game also features a single-player campaign that's a little more fleshed out than those of its predecessors, as well as a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splatoon-3-fresh-season-2024-side-order-gameplay" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5c071dd8-431c-4f24-a396-4cd2494ff2fe" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">roguelike-focused DLC</a> expansion that was released back in 2024.</p>
<p>You can check out <em>Splatoon 3 </em>right now on Switch, and if this listing is to be believed, it'll be launching on Switch 2 soon as well. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Riot may not have officially announced the release date for <em>League of Legends </em>fighter <em>2XKO</em>, but thanks to what appears to be an inadvertent trailer upload, we may know when the game is hitting console anyway.</p><p>As spotted by Bluesky user <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:cgt2lythmuvfw4736f2qakfx/post/3mb7zsgthss2p" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Nabil Mehari</a>, <em>2XKO </em>will apparently be hitting PS5 and Xbox Series X|S on January 20th, information which was included in a trailer that Riot has since taken down.&nbsp;</p><p>Mehari has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/neoxon.bsky.social/post/3mbadtzumd22n" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">also posted the trailer</a> if you'd like to see it, although it's likely that Riot will reupload the video in the coming days, so it probably won't be too long before you can see it through official channels.</p><figure role="group">

</figure>
<p>If you're not familiar with <em>2XKO</em>, it's a <em>League of Legends</em>-themed fighting game that includes characters from the celebrated MOBA.</p><p>Announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/league-of-legends-fighting-game-officially-named-2xko-as-spectacular-new-gameplay-is" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f3ec28b2-9e16-4ae6-a24a-11a8af39db67" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">back in 2024</a> (well, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-project-l-gameplay-details-revealed-by-riot" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6b4d1a85-12a2-46e6-82af-d985715a9e5d" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">officially, at any rate</a>), the game features characters like Illaoi, Yasuo, and Teemo, and new characters are being added over time, so if your favorite isn't in the game yet, they may well be introduced soon.</p><p>After being in development for some years, <em>2XKO </em>launched in Early Access <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/2xko-early-access-release-date" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f9a82e6e-d1fa-4755-bf89-d3f786e17e74" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">in October last year</a>. It's free-to-play, so you can check it out without paying a penny if you want to, and presumably, the console releases will follow the same model.</p><p>The next champion to arrive in <em>2XKO </em>will be the sniper Caitlyn, and presumably, she'll be launching at the same time as the game does on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. That hasn't technically been announced yet, but we can probably expect a reveal when the trailer is officially launched.</p>
<p><em>2XKO </em>is available to <a href="https://2xko.riotgames.com/en-gb/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">play right now for free on PC</a>, and it'll presumably be hitting PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S on January 20th. We'll have to wait and see whether that turns out to be the case or not. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
