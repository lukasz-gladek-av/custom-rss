            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-force-of-law-warbond<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Arrowhead and Sony have revealed a brand new&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Warbond, and it's packed with new gear and emotes to make your next battle for Super Earth all the more stylish.</p>

<p>Following on from last month's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-masters-of-ceremony-warbond" rel="nofollow">Masters of Ceremony</a> and March's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-borderline-justice-warbond" rel="nofollow">Borderline Justice</a>, the Force of Law Warbond will launch on June 12th. It'll bring new weapons, armor, and patterns, as well as new emotes to communicate with your squad.</p>

<p>Your first new weapon is the AR-32 Pacifier, a high-capacity assault rifle that promises to be an excellent crowd-clearing machine. It's joined by the G-109 Urchin stun grenade, which can attach to enemies and dispense periodic electrical pulses to knock them out.</p>

Like other Guard Dog weapons, it's capable of friendly fire, so don't stand in its way.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to a new support weapon in the form of the GL-52 De-Escalator, an appropriately-named grenade launcher that fires arc grenades. You can probably sense a theme emerging here, right?</p>

<p>As with previous&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Warbonds, new armor will also be added in Force of Law. The BP-20 Correct Officer medium set has "protective padding and roomy pouches", while the BP-32 Jackboot set is a lighter outfit with "an official-looking tailored jacket and sturdy pauldrons".</p>

<p>Both sets will grant you the Ballistic Padding passive, which will reduce chest damage, as well as explosive and bleed damage. No longer will you suddenly bleed out without realizing exactly how you've died (guilty as charged!).</p>




<p>This Warbond comes just a couple of weeks after two major&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>updates; the first <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-update-illuminate-weapon-customization" rel="nofollow">introduced new enemies</a> and weapon customization systems, while the second <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-heart-of-democracy-update" rel="nofollow">sent you and your squad to Super Earth</a> to defend it from the Illuminate faction.</p>

<p><em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>is available now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/helldivers-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>. The Force of Law Warbond launches on June 12th.</p>
