            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gog-preservation-program-pledges-updates-for-delisted-games-as-warcraft-1-and-2-delisted.1049571/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gog-preservation-program-warcraft-delisting<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GOG has announced that&nbsp;<em>Warcraft&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Warcraft 2&nbsp;</em>are to be delisted from its storefront, but don't worry; the recently-announced Preservation Program has had its terms updated to account for occasions like this.</p>

<p>In a press release, GOG confirms that the two real-time strategy games will be removed from its store on December 13th, probably in light of the&nbsp;<em>Warcraft&nbsp;</em>remasters that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warcraft-2-remaster-leaked-rumor" rel="nofollow">leaked ahead of</a>, and were then confirmed during, the franchise's recent 30th-anniversary showcase.</p>

<p>However, in that same press release, GOG also announces a new feature for its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gog-preservation-program" rel="nofollow">recently-revealed Preservation Program</a>, an initiative that pledges to keep games updated for modern systems whether or not their developers are still supporting said games.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warcraft-gog-preservation-program-delisting.jpg?itok=ggjhTDv1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warcraft-gog-preservation-program-delisting.jpg?itok=_eOnWInZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Warcraft&nbsp;</em>may be getting delisted from GOG, but you're in luck if you did happen to buy it via GOG's store.</figcaption></figure><p>GOG says that from now on, if a game joins the Preservation Program, it will be supported with updates and compatibility patches "even if it gets delisted from [GOG]".</p>

<p>Thankfully, since "from now on" begins today, that new feature will cover the two original&nbsp;<em>Warcraft&nbsp;</em>games, so if you did happen to buy them via GOG, you don't need to worry about them suddenly losing compatibility or support.</p>

<p>In fact, if you've yet to pick up the original&nbsp;<em>Warcraft&nbsp;</em>titles <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/warcraft_bundle" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on GOG</a>, then you can currently do so using the discount code MakeWarcraftLiveForever, which knocks "2 USD, 2 EUR, 1.5 GBP, or 8 PLN off" your order.</p>

<p>It'll only work with those currencies, but as GOG points out, you can simply change your currency at the bottom of the store page if you're not currently working within one of the supported currencies.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warcraft-gog-preservation-program-snow.jpg?itok=2bzo0wgv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warcraft-gog-preservation-program-snow.jpg?itok=S0dA5ZlS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You could be entitled to a discount right now if you pick up the first two&nbsp;<em>Warcraft&nbsp;</em>games on GOG.</figcaption></figure><p>That code's only available to be used once for each user, though, so once it's gone, it's gone. Bear that in mind before you pick up the bundle.</p>

<p>Given that Activision Blizzard doesn't seem to be making the same promise of eternal compatibility and support for its own remastered&nbsp;<em>Warcraft&nbsp;</em>titles, you may want to grab these games via GOG if you're looking for peace of mind. We'll bring you more on this, and all other things GOG, as we get it.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/visions-of-mana-director-quits-ouka-joins-square-enix</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/visions-of-mana-director-quits-ouka-joins-square-enix<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Visions of Mana&nbsp;</em>director Ryosuke Yoshida has quit NetEase's Ouka Studios in order to join Square Enix following reports of extensive layoffs at the former.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/YoshidaBeer/status/1863418476637118944" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a message on social media platform X</a>, Yoshida said that he quit Ouka Studios on October 31st, but that he's "grateful to the development team and NetEase for their support" in creating and releasing&nbsp;<em>Visions of Mana</em>.</p>

<p>Describing the process of making the game as "a very good experience", Yoshida then says he "joined Square Enix in December", pledging to "do [his] best to make a game that many people can enjoy".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/visions-of-mana-director-square-enix-combat.jpg?itok=qtg12jgr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/visions-of-mana-director-square-enix-combat.jpg?itok=y0G5Rvvi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Visions of Mana</em>'s director has jumped ship to Square Enix.</figcaption></figure><p>The&nbsp;<em>Visions of Mana&nbsp;</em>director's&nbsp;message drew responses from the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/Bucky_cm/status/1863423587774025919" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>community manager John "Bucky" Buckley</a>, who said he's "looking forward to seeing what [Yoshida does] next", as well as <a href="https://x.com/nhamaguc/status/1863419145943208328" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Square Enix's Naoki Hamaguchi</a>, who welcomed Yoshida to the company.</p>

<p>Yoshida's decision comes a few months after a report claiming that Ouka Studio, the developer of&nbsp;<em>Visions of Mana</em>, was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/visions-of-mana-layoffs-netease-report" rel="nofollow">hit by huge layoffs</a> on the day of the game's release.</p>

<p>According to that report, "all but a handful" of developers at Ouka were laid off, and parent company NetEase was planning to close down the studio. Of course, Yoshida doesn't confirm or deny this report, but the timing of his departure seems appropriate if it's true.</p>

<p>Ouka's apparent shutdown may also be coming from the same place as NetEase's recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/worlds-untold-netease-pause-shutdown" rel="nofollow">decision to pull funding</a> from ex-BioWare writer Mac Walters' studio Worlds Untold, leading said studio to "pause operations" while it seeks an alternative source of funding.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/visions-of-mana-director-square-enix-val.jpg?itok=BEuHYcP6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/visions-of-mana-director-square-enix-val.jpg?itok=GihojmDB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Yoshida's decision to leave&nbsp;<em>Visions of Mana</em>'s development team appears to have come at the right time.</figcaption></figure><p>It's also possible that Square Enix's willingness to hire Yoshida speaks to a desire for the studio to make a followup to&nbsp;<em>Visions of Mana</em>, so this might not be the last we hear of the franchise.</p>

<p>Of course, Square Enix itself hasn't been having the best year. Back in September, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-16-rebirth-profits-square-enix" rel="nofollow">the studio admitted</a> that both&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth&nbsp;</em>"did not meet [its] expectations", and in April, it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/square-enix-140m-loss-shakeup" rel="nofollow">declared a $140m loss</a> amid a major internal project shakeup.</p>

<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Visions of Mana&nbsp;</em>itself, the game is currently available for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2490990/Visions_of_Mana/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/visions-of-mana/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/visions-of-mana" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.
