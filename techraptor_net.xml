            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Marvel has revealed a new expansion for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/marvel-to-launch-official-ttrpg-marvel-multiverse-next-year" rel="nofollow"><em>Marvel Multiverse RPG</em></a>. The <em>Marvel Multiverse RPG Secret Wars</em> expansion introduces new rules for the more cosmic parts of the comic book universe, including how to deal with entities of near-infinite power.</p><h2>The <em>Marvel Multiverse RPG Secret Wars</em> Expansion Announcement</h2><p>The announcement of the <em>Marvel Multiverse RPG Secret Wars</em> expansion happened via an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1302969366?" rel="nofollow">Amazon store</a> listing. The store listing is sparse, but it does contain some pertinent information.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The new expansion is 256 pages and lists the authors as Matt Forbeck, Alex Irvine, and Marty Forbeck. Both Forbecks have also written the&nbsp;<em> Marvel Multiverse RPG</em> Core Rulebook and the <em>X-Men</em> and <em>Spider-Verse</em> expansions, and all three have worked together on the game's Avengers expansion.</p><p>As the name implies, the <em>Marvel Multiverse RPG Secret Wars</em> expansion focuses on the cosmic, interdimensional antics of the Secret Wars comic event. This 2015 comic event saw the collapse of the Marvel multiverse into a single pocket universe called Battleworld, all presided over by God Emperor Doom.&nbsp;</p><p>It was the Marvel comic event that, among other things, introduced fan-favorite Spider-Man Miles Morales into the main Marvel universe.</p><p>This highlights two selling points in the book's store listing. The book will include an adventuring framework for players to fight their way through Battleworld and save the Marvel Multiverse. In addition, it will include rules on how to "handle Rank X characters of unbelievable might." The latter can easily refer to God Emperor Doom as well as other cosmic-level threats like Galactus.</p><p>Notably, the store listing for the <em>Marvel Multiverse RPG Secret Wars</em> expansion will contain material for other parts of cosmic Marvel lore. This includes material on the Fantastic Four, the Negative Zone, the Guardians of the Galaxy, and more.</p><p>The book is currently available for pre-order at an MSRP of $49.99 and is set to release on August 18, 2026.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
