            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Light Brick Studio and publisher Annapurna Interactive have announced the release date for upcoming cute co-op adventure&nbsp;<em>Lego Voyagers</em>, and it's not too far off at all.</p>

<p>Per a new trailer, you can expect to play <i>Lego Voyagers&nbsp;</i>on September 15th, and it'll be releasing across most current platforms (with the exception of the Xbox One and the Nintendo Switch 2, but you can play the Switch version on the Switch 2 via backwards compatibility).</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Lego Voyagers</em>, it's a co-op adventure game that was revealed during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/summer-game-fest-2025-recap" rel="nofollow">this year's Summer Game Fest</a>. The game is intended for two players, as indicated by its rather adorable little stud characters and emphasis on co-op puzzling.</p>

<p>The two studios are promising a "poetic, non-verbal narrative, set in beautiful brick-built environments" complete with an "atmospheric soundtrack". You'll also find "many challenges" to complete, and you can either play in local co-op or online as well, although it doesn't seem that the game will support single-player.</p>

<p>Much like EA's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-sales-4m-battlefield-skate" rel="nofollow">smash hit&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Lego Voyagers&nbsp;</em>will also come <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-friends-pass-crossplay" rel="nofollow">complete with a Friend's Pass</a>, which means that if you've got a friend who wants to play it alongside you, they'll be able to do so at no extra cost. It's not entirely clear whether this pass will be cross-platform in the same way that&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>'s pass is, however.</p>

<p>Whether or not there's going to be a Switch 2 version appears to be a little up in the air; in the <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/aboutus/news/2025/june/lego-voyagers" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">original announcement</a>, the Switch 2 isn't mentioned, but the new trailer's description points to "Nintendo Switch platforms", so perhaps a native Switch 2 release is on the cards. Stay tuned for more.</p>
