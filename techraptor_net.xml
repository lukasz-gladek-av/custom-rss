            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ready-or-not-ps5-xbox-summer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher VOID Interactive has announced that tactical FPS&nbsp;<em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em>is coming to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S later this year, and it'll be accompanied by two brand new levels for everyone to try out.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em>will land on current-gen consoles in the summer, although it doesn't have a release date yet. The game will also be made available on the Epic Games Store and the Microsoft Store at the same time.</p>

<p>Along with the console release,&nbsp;<em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em>will also be getting a free DLC pack by the name of&nbsp;<em>Stories from Los Sueños</em>, which will add two new stages you can tackle either in single-player or alongside friends in online co-op.</p>

VOID says PC players will get the two extra stages "day-and-date" with the console release. That is, of course, in addition to levels and features that have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/huge-ready-or-not-november-update-adds-new-maps-and-more" rel="nofollow">already been added</a> to the game via <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ready-or-not-update-includes-new-maps-and-physics" rel="nofollow">updates</a>.</p>

<p>Pre-ordering&nbsp;<em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em>on either PS5 or Xbox Series X|S will also get you three special weapons, but if you're a PC player, you'll get these items for free.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Ready or Not</em>, VOID Interactive describes it as an "intense, tactical first-person shooter" in which you and your co-op partners (or just you, if you're in single-player mode) are SWAT officers sent in to defuse potentially volatile situations.</p>

<p>You may, for example, be sent in to negotiate the release of hostages, or you might be taking care of bomb disposal or dealing with suspects who've barricaded themselves inside a location. Suffice it to say this isn't one for the faint of heart.</p>




<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1144200/Ready_or_Not/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>. It's launching for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S sometime this summer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-us-canada-april-24th<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced that Switch 2 pre-orders in the US will open next week, and the price of the console won't be changing as a result of previously-announced tariffs, although accessories are a different story.</p>

<p>In a post on its official website, the Japanese gaming giant says Switch 2 US pre-orders will open on April 24th. As previously announced as part of the console's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">reveal</a>, the base machine will cost $449.99, and a bundle with&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>will set you back $499.99.</p>

<p>Pre-orders were originally due to begin earlier this month, but they were delayed due to sweeping economic tariffs imposed on countries and regions around the world by President Donald Trump. Some of those regions, like Vietnam and China, are critical to Nintendo's hardware manufacturing and production process.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-april-24th-console.jpg?itok=89Gnm850 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-april-24th-console.jpg?itok=Vi2fEMl7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Switch 2 pre-orders are back on in the US.</figcaption></figure><p>Since the pre-order delay, Trump's stance on his tariffs has been...confusing, to say the least. Suffice it to say that for now, at least, tariffs on all countries except China have been paused for a 90-day period, and several electronic devices <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c20xn626y81o" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">have been exempted</a> from the China tariffs (although not gaming consoles, unfortunately).</p>

<p>As well as the Switch 2's price remaining the same, Nintendo has also confirmed that both&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">Mario Kart World</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2" rel="nofollow">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>&nbsp;</em>won't be getting price changes. They'll stay at $80 and $70, respectively.</p>

<p>However, a number of Switch 2 accessories will see their prices increased "due to changes in market conditions", according to Nintendo. They include the Joy-Con 2 controllers, the Pro Controller, and the Camera. You can read a full list of accessory price changes via Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/nintendo-maintains-nintendo-switch-2-pricing-retail-pre-orders-to-begin-april-24-in-u-s/" rel="nofollow">original post</a>.</p>

Canadian pre-orders will also go live on April 24th, following a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-pre-orders-delayed-canada" rel="nofollow">similar delay</a> in that country. There's still no news on the Switch 2's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-delayed-in-china-thanks-to-government-regulations-and-demand" rel="nofollow">release in China</a>, however.</p>

<p>You'll be able to pre-order a Switch 2 in the US and Canada starting from April 24th. The console itself is set to launch on June 5th.</p>
