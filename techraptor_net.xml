            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/infinity-nikki-steam-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Infold Games has announced the&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>Steam release date, with the cozy open-world adventure on its way to Valve's platform later this month.</p>

<p>Back in February, Infold revealed that&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>would be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/infinity-nikki-steam-confirmed" rel="nofollow">making its way to Steam</a>, and now, in a <a href="https://x.com/InfinityNikkiEN/status/1910543603606446579" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on social media platform X, the studio has confirmed that the game's Steam release date is April 29th.</p>

<p>What's more,&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>has apparently surpassed 200,000 wishlists on Steam, and to celebrate, Infold is gifting players with 10 of the game's Resonite Crystal currency, which you can use as part of the gacha system. That's on top of the items that were already promised for the 100,000 wishlist goal.</p>

<p>It doesn't sound like you'll need to be playing&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>on Steam to reap the rewards, either; rather, it sounds as though all players will be getting these rewards, even if they're on console. Huzzah!</p>

<p>Given&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki</em>'s popularity, it's not hard to see why Infold wants to bring it to Steam. The game managed to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/infinity-nikki-downloads-10m" rel="nofollow">hit 10 million downloads</a> within its first few days of release, and that number is only going to go up now it's coming to Valve's storefront.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>is, it's a cutesy, cozy open-world adventure that emphasizes platforming and minigames over traditional combat (although it's got its own spin on that too).</p>




<p>Playing as Nikki and her companion Momo, you'll explore the world of Miraland, meet its inhabitants, and discover its mysteries. The game has a gacha system, too, through which you can obtain new outfits and clothing pieces for Nikki.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>on <a href="https://infinitynikki.infoldgames.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices</a>&nbsp;right now, and the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3164330/Infinity_Nikki/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam version</a> is set to launch on April 29th.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/enshrouded-sales-hit-4m-as-sixth-major-update-revealed.1161858/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/enshrouded-sales-4m-update-6<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Keen Games has announced a major new sales milestone for open-world survival-crafter&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded</em>, and new details about the game's sixth major update have also been revealed.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded&nbsp;</em>has now crossed the four million sales mark. As a reminder, the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/enshrouded-sales-3-million" rel="nofollow">passed the three million milestone</a> back in August, which means it's sold another million copies in the intervening eight months.</p>

<p>As for the sixth update, it's called Thralls of Twilight, and it'll bring "new enemies that creep, crawl, and stalk you further", so you'll have to keep your wits about you if you want to survive its trials and tribulations.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/enshrouded-sales-4m-update-6-enemy.jpg?itok=NUgp6r_1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/enshrouded-sales-4m-update-6-enemy.jpg?itok=GPt_Il0m 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Enshrouded</em>'s sixth major update is coming in May.</figcaption></figure><p>Due in May, Thralls of Twilight follows on from previous&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded&nbsp;</em>updates like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/enshrouded-pact-of-flame-update-1-0-launch-2026" rel="nofollow">Pact of the Flame</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/enshrouded-souls-of-frozen-frontier-update" rel="nofollow">Souls of the Frozen Frontier</a>, and like those updates, you won't have to pay a penny for it.</p>

<p>Keen Games is promising "more reasons than ever to enter the Shroud"; it'll be "more dangerous than ever before", but venturing into the fog will grant you new resources, so it'll be worth your while.</p>

<p>The update will also bring a brand new weapon customization mechanic, as well as "enhancements to the nighttime cycle" that will include more enemies roaming the world and new nighttime-specific rewards.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait until May for more information, but suffice it to say that Thralls of Twilight is shaping up to be just as significant as previous&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded&nbsp;</em>updates, so if you like the game, you should be excited for this one.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded</em>, it's an open-world survival-crafting game in which you (and, optionally, other players) must descend into the semi-eponymous Shroud in order to find resources, battle enemies, and uncover its mysteries.</p>

<p>The game is available right now for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1203620/Enshrouded/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam Early Access</a>. The 1.0 release is scheduled for sometime in 2026, which is also when you can expect the game to hit consoles.</p>
