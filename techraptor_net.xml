            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/everything-we-learned-about-magic-gathering-aetherdrift<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Magic The Gathering</em> is off to the races with the new expansion, <em>Aetherdrift</em>, using the setting of an interplanar Grand Prix to bring together well-known characters and refresh lore on some less-seen planes and their inhabitants. <em>Magic The Gathering Aetherdrift</em> releases physically on February 14th.</p>

<p>Before it releases we got to sit down with members of the team behind <em>Aetherdrift </em>including Max McCall – Executive Producer, Miguel Lopez&nbsp; – Worldbuilding Lead, Sarah Wassel&nbsp; – Senior Art Director, and Lisa Hanson – Print Innovation Director. Through this call, we were treated to information about some of the different teams that would be competing in the Grand Prix, some unique mechanics to the set, and what kinds of new card treatments we'd be seeing.</p>

<h2>Welcome To The Ghirapur Grand Prix!</h2>

<p>There are 10 different racing teams from across the different planes that are being gathered to compete in the Ghirapur Grand Prix. Miguel Lopez took some time to explain to us just what that is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"<em>Aetherdrift </em>focuses on an edition of a multi-day multi-planar combat stage race called the Ghirapur Grand Prix. This is a race put on by the plane of Avishkar. It's intended to be, on the one, a thrilling spectacle that is inspiring to watch and a statement to the multiverse of the new Avishkari government's ability to manage and coordinate multi-planar logistics."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first Grand Prix has already happened off-screen, it's more chaotic and a test for the technology, and the second Grand Prix is the one that is the setting of <em>Aetherdrift</em>.</p>

<p>Other planes involved in the Grand Prix include Amonket and Muraganda. While it will be a return to Amonket, slowly rebuilding itself after the Phyrexian Invasion, it will be the first deep dive into Muraganda "a place where magic and life is raw and young."</p>

<p>But what is the prize for such an impressive tournament? The Aetherspark, a Planeswalker spark suspended in a super-cooled aether solution.</p>

<h2>The Mechanics Of Racing</h2>

<p>The key mechanic that <em>Aetherdrift </em>is introducing is Speed. At the start of the game you'll start with no speed, by playing a card that has the <em>Start your engines!</em> Trait your speed will become 1.</p>

<p>You can then gain one speed per turn by causing your opponent to lose life. If you <em>Start your engines!</em>&nbsp;and then <em>Lightning Bolt</em> will get you to Speed 2, but another <em>Lightning Bolt</em> won't get you to Speed 3 on the same turn. Once you've reached Speed 4 you'll be at max speed and can't increase it any further.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mtg-aetherdrift-vnwxt-and-speed.jpg?itok=lOnz_7ay 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mtg-aetherdrift-vnwxt-and-speed.jpg?itok=yLJk5AVK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Use Speed to start your engines and use powerful abilities</figcaption></figure><p>Each of the cards that have the <em>Start your engines!</em> Trait also have a Trait that relates to an additional effect once max speed has been reached. An example given was <em>Vnwxt, Verbose Host</em> will let you draw two cards when you would normally only be able to draw one.</p>

<p>Another mechanic being introduced is <em>Exhaust</em>. This is a one-shot mechanic that does something powerful, that the player needs to know when to use to get the most effectiveness out of it. <em>Exhaust </em>can only be used once by a card, so if you see a card like <em>Loot, The Pathfinder</em> who has three powerful <em>Exhaust </em>abilities you'll only get to use one.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mtg-aetherdrift-loot-and-exhaust.jpg?itok=aXAcHfdW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mtg-aetherdrift-loot-and-exhaust.jpg?itok=vBFBbAQu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Exhaust is powerful, but you need to know the right time to use it</figcaption></figure><p>Interestingly, if a card has been returned to your hand and played again the <em>Exhaust </em>gets refreshed. This allows for some tricky wants to be able to refresh that and use these powerful abilities again.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"In general, you can only activate Exhaust abilities once per game… unless you're doing shenanigans" - Max McCall</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The last new mechanic is <em>Saddle</em>. This allows Mount cards to be saddled by other creatures you control. Some of the Mounts that appear in this set aren't just mechanical vehicles but also beasts such as beast mounts. When cards are Saddled normally something extra-good happens.</p>

<h2>The Ten Teams Of The Ghirapur Grand Prix</h2>

<p>There are ten teams from across the planes that are competing in the Ghirapur Grand Prix. Each team doesn't just represent a plane or group but consists of two colors, this will help players find the right team for their playstyle. These teams are:</p>

<ol><li aria-level="1"><strong>Guidelight Voyagers (White / Blue) -</strong> A returning team that was accidentally formed during the first Grand Prix who have been invited back.</li>
	<li aria-level="1"><strong>Speed Demons (Blue / Black)</strong> <strong>-</strong> This is a crew led by Winter and The Speed Demon, they have a chance for freedom by Valgavoth if they manage to obtain the Aether Spark.</li>
	<li aria-level="1"><strong>The Endriders (Black / Red) - </strong>Survivors from Gastal, a harsh environment of natural disaster and road warriors (think Mad Max). Now at Ghurapur they're wanting to obtain the Aetherspark to bring it unlimited water.</li>
	<li aria-level="1"><strong>Goblin Rocketeers (Red / Green) -</strong> This team is rocket scientists who have applied their knowledge to cars and other vehicles. Their goal is to break the velocity limit to escape from their plane and worship the BOOSTGOD. (We were specifically told that that's in all capital letters)</li>
	<li aria-level="1"><strong>Alacrian Quickbeasts (Green / White) -</strong> These racers ride beasts instead of vehicles and are interested in the Grand Prix based purely out of their enjoyment of competition.</li>
	<li aria-level="1"><strong>The Champions of Amonkhet (White / Black) - </strong>A team of living and undead representatives from Amonkhet led by Basri and Zahur.</li>
	<li aria-level="1"><strong>The Speedbrood (Black / Green) -</strong> A group of insectoid racers who are trying to grow their life into becoming velocity and speed itself.</li>
	<li aria-level="1"><strong>Aether Rangers (Green / Blue) -</strong> The team native to Avashkar equipped with fast vehicles that slightly hover giving them an edge over any terrain.</li>
	<li aria-level="1"><strong>Chordatan Keelhaulers (Blue / Red) -</strong> Fishfolk who are new to the Grand Prix but who have settled in Avashkar.</li>
	<li aria-level="1"><strong>Cloudspire Racing Team (Red / White) - </strong>Racers from Kylum that specialize in high speed and low drag racing allowing them to be very quick. This team also won the previous year's Grand Prix.</li>
</ol><figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mtg-aetherdrift-chandra-and-teams.jpg?itok=NzUO8ZKB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mtg-aetherdrift-chandra-and-teams.jpg?itok=AfOCxEwv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Add another one to the "Akira slide in pop culture" compilation</figcaption></figure><h2>Art Worth A Thousand Laps</h2>

<p>Full Art Lands will show the different courses that the teams will be racing on from a first-person perspective of some of the drivers. You'll get to see sand-covered raceways, winding jungle tracks, and even scenes of vehicles racing down riverways.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mtg-aetherdrift-full-art-and-box-topper-lands.jpg?itok=k6HSgveN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mtg-aetherdrift-full-art-and-box-topper-lands.jpg?itok=E8R4sKwq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Full Art lands alongside the First-Place Foil box topper lands</figcaption></figure><p>Another new look for cards is the Borderless Revved Up treatment that each of the teams have. Each of these cards are meant to highlight a driver and their vehicle, working as a sort of glamour-shot showing off what is meant to be an inspirational scene.</p>

<p>Wassell likened these treatments to something you might see a full page ad for in a magazine, or the kind of poster that a fan of the team or driver would want.</p>

<p>There are two Commander Decks that will be released with <em>Aetherdrift</em>. One led by Temmet, Eternal Might, which will be a White/Blue/Black deck. This Commander Deck will not only have Temmet but also Hashaton, Scarab's Fist and will focus on creating zombies and building up to one big turn where you flood your enemy with damage.</p>

<p>The second Commander Deck is Living Energy, a Green/Blue/Red deck, that features <em>Saheeli, Radiant Creator </em>and <em>Pia Nalaar, Chief Mechanic</em> as Commanders.</p>

<p>Both of these Commander Decks will retail for $44.99 MSRP</p>

<p>Box-Toppers for this set will come with a new First-place Foil treatment. This version is meant to look like a gold prize medal and while the background and outer elements are shiny and gold the core element of the card's artwork and focus of the card will remain in color to really pop.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/indie-smash-hit-balatro-hits-5m-sales.1087920/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-5m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher PlayStack and developer LocalThunk have announced that smash hit indie card roguelike&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>has passed yet another major sales milestone, further solidifying the game's status as a runaway success.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/BalatroGame/status/1881728578712474019" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message</a> on social media platform X, the two studios reveal that&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>has crossed the five million sales mark, which puts it about on par with Nexon's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dave-diver-sales-5m" rel="nofollow">"indie" hit&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver</em></a>&nbsp;or Focus and Saber's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-player-count-5m" rel="nofollow"><em>Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2</em></a>.</p>

<p>The studios thank everyone who's played&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>"after seeing it at The Game Awards", where it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/game-awards-2024-nominees-announced" rel="nofollow">nominated for</a> (and eventually won) the Best Indie Game prize. Rather charmingly, the studios then recommend trying to make playing indie games "a habit", as "there's some amazing stuff out there".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/balatro-sales-5m-game.jpg?itok=gTL0GZej 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/balatro-sales-5m-game.jpg?itok=wQX0ITQC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>has broken yet another sales barrier.</figcaption></figure><p>It's been an excellent year for&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>, all things considered. The game launched in February 2024 and quickly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-half-million" rel="nofollow">crossed the half-million sales mark</a>, going on to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-one-million" rel="nofollow">break a million sales</a> less than two weeks after that milestone.</p>

<p>In August last year,&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-reach-2-million-as-devs-promise-first-major-update-soon" rel="nofollow">hit two million sales</a>, and in December of the same year, Playstack and LocalThunk announced the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-hit-3-5m" rel="nofollow">had reached 3.5 million</a>, which means it's managed to rack up another 1.5 million in the intervening weeks.</p>

<p>If you've somehow managed to come this far without either playing or hearing about&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>(and you're not alone if you're in the first camp, because I haven't either), it's a poker roguelike in which the goal is to rack up points by utilizing "adrenaline-pumping, outrageous combos".</p>




<p>While it bases itself on poker,&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>'s appeal lies in its array of powerful joker cards, which provide a range of bonuses. Stacking these bonuses up correctly is the key to building your score and breaking through to the next round.</p>

<p>According to a press release,&nbsp;<em>Rogue Trader&nbsp;</em>has crossed one million sales across all of the platforms on which it's currently available, i.e. PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

<p>Studio head Oleg Shpilchevskiy says the milestone is a "sign" that Owlcat is "working in the right direction", and that he wants his team to "bring more stories to the endless universe of&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k</em>".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-rogue-trader-sales-1m-cassia.jpg?itok=lbT7y2F9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-rogue-trader-sales-1m-cassia.jpg?itok=KYWndPTW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Warhammer 40k: Rogue Trader&nbsp;</em>has hit an important sales milestone for Owlcat.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Rogue Trader</em>, it's a CRPG set in the grim darkness of the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k&nbsp;</em>universe. As the title suggests, you play one of the titular Rogue Traders, who are essentially Imperium-sanctioned explorers and merchants given special permission to travel the galaxy.</p>

<p>As you'd expect from an Owlcat game, you'll meet a number of companions who represent several of the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k</em>&nbsp;setting's races and character archetypes. Companions include a Navis Nobilite navigator, a tech-priest, and a warrior from the Adeptus Sororitas, among many others.</p>

<p>Released <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-rogue-trader-alpha-goes-live-today" rel="nofollow">in alpha in 2022</a>, the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-rogue-trader-release-date" rel="nofollow">scored a full 1.0 release</a> on PC and consoles in December 2023, and a number of updates both <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-rogue-trader-update-biggest-yet" rel="nofollow">big</a> and small have been released for&nbsp;<em>Rogue Trader&nbsp;</em>in the intervening months.</p>




<p>In September last year,&nbsp;<em>Rogue Trader</em>'s first DLC,&nbsp;<em>Void Shadows</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-rogue-trader-dlc-void-shadows-delayed" rel="nofollow">was released</a>. It added lots of content to the game, including a new Death Cult assassin companion, new quests, and more.</p>

<p>Another major expansion,&nbsp;<em>Lex Imperialis</em>, is currently in the works, bringing a new companion from the Adeptus Arbite, which you can essentially think of as the Imperium's police force. Naturally, you can also look forward to new areas, mechanics, and plenty more in that expansion.</p>

<p>In a press release, Bohemia says its revenue jumped 34% in 2024, reaching a total of $60.8 million. The company managed to sell 4.85 million copies of its games across PC and consoles last year, with player numbers hitting 17 million around the world.</p>

<p>According to Bohemia, 99% of those sales came from "abroad" rather than from its native Czech Republic, with the US enjoying a 42% market share. Bohemia also reports "significant growth" in Ukraine, which saw player numbers doubling year-on year, and points to Brazil as a market of "growing importance".</p>

<p>The studio also says that fans can look forward to "interesting game surprises" over the coming year, including the "intensive development" of&nbsp;<em>Arma 4</em>, which is now expected to launch sometime in 2027.</p>

<p>More games under the Bohemia Incubator program, through which Bohemia gives smaller teams funding and publishing support for their games, will also be introduced this year, with action platformer&nbsp;<em>Brute Horse&nbsp;</em>and sandbox RPG&nbsp;<em>SkyVerse&nbsp;</em>both on Bohemia's 2024 infographic.</p>

<p>It's fair to say that Bohemia's growth certainly goes against the grain in that regard, although given the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-ceo-payrise-layoffs" rel="nofollow">eye-watering cash</a> some of these companies' C-suites <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-ceo-25-million-income-layoffs" rel="nofollow">took home for themselves</a> last year and the year before, I'd question whether those decisions were, in fact, made due to industry trends.</p>

<p>In any case, we'll bring you more on what Bohemia Interactive gets up to in 2025 as and when we get it, so stay tuned for that.</p>
