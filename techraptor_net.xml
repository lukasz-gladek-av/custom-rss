            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-donkey-kong-land<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has added another Game Boy game to the Nintendo Switch Online roster, and if you're looking for a platformer to keep you entertained this Thanksgiving, you could do a lot worse than this one.</p>

<p>As revealed in <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1859764097480355961" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a message on X (formerly Twitter) earlier today</a>,&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Land&nbsp;</em>has found its way to the Switch Online library. It joins the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-zelda-july" rel="nofollow">Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Zelda: Oracle&nbsp;</em>games</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-game-boy-launch" rel="nofollow">Super Mario Land</a></em>, as well as many other Game Boy classics.</p>

<p>Rather intriguingly, the plot for&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Land&nbsp;</em>sees Cranky Kong and King K. Rool working together in order to get Diddy and Donkey Kong to prove they can successfully embark on an adventure on the Game Boy. It's all very meta.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/donkey-kong-land-nintendo-switch-online.jpg?itok=VcjDjt5q 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/donkey-kong-land-nintendo-switch-online.jpg?itok=9U3ysc_K 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Donkey Kong Land&nbsp;</em>takes a decidedly more meta approach to proceedings.</figcaption></figure><p>Much like&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Land</em>,&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Land&nbsp;</em>is an entirely original game rather than a remake or port of&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Country</em>. It features 30 levels across four worlds, and it also features several of the staples of&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong&nbsp;</em>platformers, including collecting K-O-N-G letters, firing yourself from barrel cannons, and more.</p>

<p>The game features similar visuals to&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Country</em>, with developer Rare using the same technology as in the SNES series to transfer pre-rendered graphics into a 2D space.</p>

<p>Despite that, it does also take the Game Boy's limitations into account in some ways; the system is more limited than the SNES from a technical standpoint, for instance, so only one Kong can appear on screen rather than the two of them working in tandem.</p>




<p><em>Donkey Kong Land&nbsp;</em>is available to play right now on Nintendo Switch. All you need is a Switch Online membership; you won't need an Expansion Pack addon like you would to play <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/38-nintendo-switch-online-n64-games-are-planned-dataminer-says" rel="nofollow">N64 games</a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/game-boy-and-game-boy-advance-titles-are-finally-coming-to-nintendo-switch-online" rel="nofollow">Game Boy Advance titles</a>.</p>

<p>Despite several&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong&nbsp;</em>games being made available via Switch Online,&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong 64&nbsp;</em>is yet to make its way to the service. We'll have to wait and see whether it does or not in the coming months.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Stalker 2 Sales Top One Million in Just Two Days]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-sales-one-million</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stalker-2-sales-top-one-million-in-just-two-days.1042797/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-sales-one-million<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher GSC Game World has announced that&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>sales have already crossed a big milestone, and the game has only been on release for two days.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/4455843903878201787" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam announcement</a>, a million copies of&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>have been sold since the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-delayed-once-again-november" rel="nofollow">launched on Wednesday</a>, a feat for which GSC Game World thanks the players who've already bought&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>.</p>

<p>The game's sales achievement is even more impressive when considering that it was a day-one Xbox Game Pass release as well, which means that a million players have bought&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>in addition to those who've checked it out as part of Microsoft's subscription service.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stalker-2-sales-radar.jpg?itok=sMtIWCLl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stalker-2-sales-radar.jpg?itok=Q1J2zd4F 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>is off to a very strong start sales-wise.</figcaption></figure><p>Although&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>'s sales performance has been strong, the game hasn't been without its issues. Its Steam reviews are <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">broadly positive at time of writing</a>, but even many of those who recommend the game acknowledge that it's got more than its fair share of bugs (or "anomalies", if you will).</p>

<p>Speaking <a href="https://x.com/stalker_thegame/status/1859265478276894856" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on X (formerly Twitter) on Wednesday</a>, GSC Game World acknowledged that&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>has some "rough edges", but that hotfixes to correct some of the game's most egregious bugs are on the way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following those fixes, the development team has pledged to release larger updates that will include extra content for&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>, with a roadmap for the game on its way in December.</p>




<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>, it's the second mainline entry in GSC Game World's&nbsp;<em>Stalker&nbsp;</em>series, which combines open-world RPG-inflected gameplay with a non-linear, hands-off approach to exploration and combat.</p>

<p>The game has had a long and troubled development history; it was first revealed in 2010 before numerous delays and studio troubles saw the game shelved for a number of years.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>was then <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-heart-of-chernobyl-release-date-announced" rel="nofollow">reintroduced at E3 2021</a>&nbsp;with an intended April 2022 release date, although that was naturally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/post-apocalyptic-shooter-stalker-2-delayed-until-december" rel="nofollow">pushed back</a> several times. The invasion of Ukraine by Russia in early 2022 also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-developer-reportedly-leaving-ukraine" rel="nofollow">significantly impacted development</a> for GSC Game World, which is based in the besieged country.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/stalker-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and it's also available as part of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/all-confirmed-xbox-game-pass-november-2024-games" rel="nofollow">November's Xbox Game Pass lineup</a>.
