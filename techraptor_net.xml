            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-57-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has announced the release date for&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.7, with the latest update for the gacha action RPG arriving later this month and bringing new characters, plus new story and more, with it.</p>

<p>Just like with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-56" rel="nofollow">previous</a>&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-5-5-release-date" rel="nofollow">updates</a>, you can expect this one to introduce new story for you to experience, including a continuation of the Archon Quest, which will introduce a "new unrest" brewing between the Traveler twins.</p>

<p>Perhaps more exciting, however, is the debut of Skirk, Childe's "enigmatic master" and a unique 5-star fighter. She wields "Abyssal power camouflaged as Cryo", according to HoYoverse, and she can switch between two combat styles for a choice of burst damage or more sustained output.</p>

Both of her combat modes will use that resource for their abilities. She can also buff Hydro and Cryo users, buffing herself in the process.</p>

<p>Skirk isn't the only character joining the roster for&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.7, however. Also entering the fray in this update is Dahlia, a 4-star Hydro-wielding support fighter who can shield his allies and boost their stats.</p>

<p>Skirk and Dahlia will feature in the first half of the update's Event Wishes, alongside a rerun of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/genshin-impact-shenhe-build-guide" rel="nofollow">Shenhe</a>. The second half, meanwhile, will play host to reruns of Mavuika and Emilie, so look out for them if you didn't add them to your team the first time around.</p>




<p>If you're a returning customer to&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>updates, then you probably know what's next. That's right: it's time for some juicy codes. Here are this update cycle's goodies! Remember to put these in without the colons at the end of the codes.</p>

<ul><li>MasterSkirk0618: 100 Primogems, 10 Mystic Enhancement Ore</li>
	<li>YourSpaceTime: 100 Primogems, 5 Hero's Wit</li>
	<li>VoidStar0618: 100 Primogems, 50,000 Mora</li>
</ul><p><em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>is available to play right now for free on <a href="https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation, Xbox Series X|S, and mobile devices</a>. Version 5.7 lands on June 18th.</p>
