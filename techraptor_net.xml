            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/carmen-sandiego-reboot-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Gameloft has revealed the release date for its upcoming&nbsp;<em>Carmen Sandiego&nbsp;</em>reboot, and the game is launching first on Netflix Games for mobile devices, followed by a PC and console launch later this year.</p>

<p>As revealed in <a href="https://carmensandiego-game.com/news/carmen-sandiego-launch-date" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on the game's official website,&nbsp;<em>Carmen Sandiego&nbsp;</em>will arrive on Android and iOS via Netflix Games on January 28th, and it'll then launch digitally for PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch on March 4th.</p>

<p>In addition to the digital launch, a special 40th-anniversary physical edition will also be made available through "Amazon and leading retailers" in late April. Those retailers include GameStop (although perhaps <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/more-gamestop-store-closures" rel="nofollow">not quite as many stores as we might have hoped</a>), BestBuy, Target, and Walmart.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/carmen-sandiego-release-date-newspaper.jpg?itok=bO8iATLT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/carmen-sandiego-release-date-newspaper.jpg?itok=c9kCR_ul 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Gameloft's&nbsp;<em>Carmen Sandiego&nbsp;</em>reboot is due out in January on mobile, then in March everywhere else.</figcaption></figure><p>Unlike previous games in the&nbsp;<em>Carmen Sandiego&nbsp;</em>series, the new game will cast Sandiego as a vigilante who, according to Gameloft, "steals from thieves to protect the world's treasures". This will be the first game in the series in which you'll actually play as Carmen herself, too.</p>

<p>Where Carmen was once the head of the criminal organization V.I.L.E., she's now battling that same organization, using her gadgets to track down V.I.L.E. syndicates and bring them to justice.</p>

<p>Gameloft is promising "a 3D world with puzzle-solving mechanics, real-world locations, and the classic gameplay of tracking down suspects and solving cases" for&nbsp;<em>Carmen Sandiego</em>, further stating that the game will offer a "fresh, immersive experience for both long-time fans and newcomers".</p>

<p>You can check out the latest trailer for&nbsp;<em>Carmen Sandiego</em>, which gives a good impression of the game's art style and direction, right here.</p>




<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Carmen Sandiego&nbsp;</em>when it launches on mobile devices via Netflix Games on January 28th. It'll then arrive for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2475300/Carmen_Sandiego/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012106" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/carmen-sandiego/9N2MZJPCXS6V" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and Nintendo Switch digitally on March 4th, with the physical version arriving sometime in April.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sonic the Hedgehog Movies Cross $1B at the Box Office]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-the-hedgehog-movies-1b-box-office</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sonic-the-hedgehog-movies-cross-1b-at-the-box-office.1074825/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-the-hedgehog-movies-1b-box-office<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Paramount Pictures has announced that the three&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog&nbsp;</em>movies have crossed a major box office milestone between them.</p>

<p>According to a press release, the franchise has managed to surpass $1 billion in "total box office receipts worldwide", and given that phrasing, it's unlikely Paramount is including any revenue generated by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/knuckles-series-release-date" rel="nofollow">the&nbsp;<em>Knuckles&nbsp;</em>TV show</a> in that figure.</p>

<p>The first two movies constitute $725.2 million of that figure, with $181m in "consumer spending" also being generated by those two movies, although it's not clear whether Paramount is counting that figure as part of the $1b total.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sonic-the-hedgehog-movies-box-office-shadow.jpg?itok=FV4BErv_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sonic-the-hedgehog-movies-box-office-shadow.jpg?itok=GGxTjaEy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The third&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>movie, which stars Keanu Reeves as Shadow the Hedgehog, was released last month.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Paramount,&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em>, the latest installment in the franchise's movie adventures, has earned over $312m around the world, hitting number one at the US box office in its opening weekend.</p>

<p>The studio says that this result puts&nbsp;<em>Sonic 3&nbsp;</em>"83% ahead of&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog 2</em>" on a "like-for-like basis, including previews".&nbsp;<em>Sonic 3&nbsp;</em>also apparently managed to hit $100m at the global box office "more quickly than its predecessors".</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with any of the&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>movies, they're all essentially adaptations of the&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog&nbsp;</em>"mythology", for want of a better word.</p>

<p>While <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-hedgehog-film-coming-to-theaters-next-year" rel="nofollow">the first movie</a> revolved mainly around Sonic himself, the second saw Sonic's longtime sidekick Tails joining the cast, as well as the stoic Knuckles, played by none other than Idris Elba. In the third, we're introduced to brooding antihero Shadow the Hedgehog, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-sonic-hedgehog-3-movie-trailer-keanu-shadow" rel="nofollow">played by Keanu Reeves</a>.</p>




<p>The three movies also all feature legendary comic actor Jim Carrey as Dr. Ivo Robotnik, alongside a human cast that includes the likes of James Marsden and Krysten Ritter (in the case of the third movie, at least).</p>

<p>Given the success of the existing&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog&nbsp;</em>movies, it probably won't come as a surprise that a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fourth-sonic-hedgehog-movie-2027-report" rel="nofollow">fourth movie is reportedly already in development</a>, with a tentative release window of 2027.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-shift-up-ps5-pro-bonus</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stellar-blade-developer-shift-up-gave-all-its-employees-a-ps5-pro-as-a-bonus.1074822/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-shift-up-ps5-pro-bonus<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>developer Shift Up has gifted all of its employees with a PS5 Pro, as well as a cash sum, as part of the studio's end-of-year bonus program.</p>

<p>According to Korean news platform <a href="https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/008/0005137533?sid=105" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Naver</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/stellar-blade-studio-shift-up-has-gifted-all-its-employees-a-ps5-pro-and-3-4k/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">VGC</a>), around 300 employees at Shift Up have received their very own PS5 Pro as an end-of-year bonus, as well as 5 million Korean won, which works out at around $3,400.</p>

<p>A Shift Up rep told Naver that the bonuses had been awarded "for the purpose of encouraging talent" (a quote for which we've used machine translation).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stellar-blade-shift-up-bonuses-monster.jpg?itok=FtMFXaDh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stellar-blade-shift-up-bonuses-monster.jpg?itok=XD3gwNFp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>has done so well that Shift Up has granted all of its employees a pretty impressive bonus.</figcaption></figure><p>Given that the PS5 Pro <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-pro-announced-november" rel="nofollow">retails for around $700</a>&nbsp;(which works out at about 1 million won), these bonuses are not to be sniffed at.</p>

<p>Still,&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>managed to shift (no pun intended) <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-sales-one-million" rel="nofollow">around a million copies</a> within its first couple of months on release, and although Shift Up hasn't released newer sales figures than that, it seems the game is at least performing well enough to prompt the studio to issue these goodies.</p>

<p>News of Shift Up's end-of-year employee bonuses comes as the studio gears up to release&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>on PC, at least if its <a href="https://shiftup.co.kr/eng/ir/ir.php?ptype=view&amp;code=ir_eng&amp;idx=203&amp;category=" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">latest financial results</a> are anything to go by.</p>

<p>The PC release of&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>is apparently planned for sometime this year, and Shift Up expects sales on the platform to "exceed that on consoles". Hey, who knows? Maybe Shift Up employees will get new gaming PCs at the end of this year.</p>




<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>itself, it's received a number of updates since launching in April this year, including <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-nier-automata-crossover" rel="nofollow">a&nbsp;<em>Nier: Automata&nbsp;</em>crossover</a>&nbsp;and several <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/festive-stellar-blade-update" rel="nofollow">festive outfits</a>.</p>

<p>While Shift Up's attention is doubtless focused on&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>for the near future, the studio has apparently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-developer-shift-up-new-action-rpg" rel="nofollow">already begun work on its next game</a>, which will, according to the studio itself, be a "cross-platform next-gen project".</p>

<p>It's likely to be some time before we hear more about that, so while we wait, you can check out&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/stellar-blade/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right now on PS5</a>. Make sure to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/stellar-blade-review-mother-sphere-knows-best" rel="nofollow">read our very own Austin's glowing review</a> if you want more encouragement to pick up the game.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/notch-minecraft-2</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/minecraft-creator-markus-notch-persson-basically-announced-minecraft-2.1074774/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/notch-minecraft-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Markus "Notch" Persson, the original creator of&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>, says he's "basically announced&nbsp;<em>Minecraft 2</em>" after releasing a poll in which he asked his fans what type of game they'd like to see him work on next.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://x.com/notch/status/1874522284813107617" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">poll</a>, which was posted on social media platform X a few days ago, gave fans two options with regards to Notch's next project: "a traditional roguelike" in the vein of&nbsp;<em>ADOM&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Nethack</em>, or "a spiritual successor thing to&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>".</p>

<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the poll, which has attracted over 285,000 votes at time of writing, heavily skews towards "<em>Minecraft 2</em>", as he calls it, with 81.5% of votes weighing in for that project and just 18.5% of votes supporting the roguelike concept.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/minecraft-2-notch-announced.jpg?itok=MWQpjJ3h 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/minecraft-2-notch-announced.jpg?itok=aIleTtcQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Notch can't actually make&nbsp;<em>Minecraft 2</em>, since he no longer holds the rights to the franchise.</figcaption></figure><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/notch/status/1875230756437479658" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">followup message posted later on</a>, Notch then says he "basically announced&nbsp;<em>Minecraft 2</em>" in the poll. Despite feeling that "spiritual successors are usually kind of...tragic", he goes on to say "why not do the thing that people DO want and are willing to give me, somehow, even MORE cash for".</p>

<p>Of course, Notch doesn't actually own the rights to&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>anymore (which <a href="https://x.com/notch/status/1874532442637475973" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">he himself acknowledges</a>); since Mojang was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mojang-yes-were-being-bought-by-microsoft-notch-leaves" rel="nofollow">purchased by Microsoft in 2014</a>, at which point Notch also left the company, it's Microsoft that owns&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>, not Notch.</p>

<p>In his post, Notch says he intends to make the&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>spiritual successor without "sneakily infring[ing] on the incredible work the Mojang team is doing and that Microsoft is successfully doing the Microsoft shittification about". He doesn't elaborate on exactly what that means.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that Notch doesn't reveal any details whatsoever about this project, so it's likely that we're a long way away from seeing any actual gameplay or even learning any concrete information about it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/minecraft-2-notch-announced-portal.jpg?itok=BVZTQS7r 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/minecraft-2-notch-announced-portal.jpg?itok=x_BYQmIk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>could be getting a "spiritual successor" courtesy of Notch.</figcaption></figure><p>Notch also doesn't sound particularly enthusiastic about making&nbsp;<em>Minecraft 2</em>; he's open about knowing it'll make more money than his roguelike idea, but he <a href="https://x.com/notch/status/1874530816216482169" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">implored his supporters</a> to vote for his roguelike project, so that's likely where his heart is (or was).</p>

<p>While the concept of&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>'s original creator making a spiritual successor will be exciting to many, he's not a figure without his fair share of controversy.</p>

<p>He's been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/minecraft-ditches-references-to-notch" rel="nofollow">accused of homophobia, transphobia, misogyny, and other prejudices</a> due to his posts on social media, leading to Mojang <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/notch-excluded-from-minecraft-anniversary-for-comments-and-opinions" rel="nofollow">excluding him</a> from&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>'s tenth anniversary due to his "comments and opinions".</p>

<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>itself, it's going from strength to strength.</p>

<p>It's still the best-selling game of all time, having <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-67105983" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">hit 300 million sales</a> back in 2023, and a number of tie-in projects are in the works, including <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/minecraft-attractions-merlin-entertainments" rel="nofollow">real-life attractions</a>, an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/minecraft-animated-series-netflix" rel="nofollow">animated series</a> on Netflix, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-minecraft-movie-trailer" rel="nofollow">a live-action movie</a>. As far as we're aware, Mojang and Microsoft have no plans for a&nbsp;<em>Minecraft 2&nbsp;</em>of their own.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-9m</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-cross-9m-capcom-announces.1074738/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-9m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has announced that its&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em>remake has topped another major sales milestone, so it looks like the game is selling solidly.</p>

<p>Back in October, Capcom revealed that&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em>had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-8m" rel="nofollow">broken the eight million sales barrier</a>, and now, according to <a href="https://x.com/dev1_official/status/1876175498398822673" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a new post</a> on social media platform X, the game has topped nine million sales.</p>

<p>That means that in the intervening months,&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em>notched up another million sales or so for itself. To celebrate this latest milestone, Capcom also posted a new piece of artwork that depicts many of&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4</em>'s characters enjoying a surprisingly civil meal together.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-9m-artwork.jpg?itok=NeovxWmN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-9m-artwork.jpg?itok=IwStviWP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Resident Evil 4</em>'s sales milestones are growing increasingly impressive.</figcaption></figure><p>Given that it took&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e240313.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">around six or seven months</a> to amass the million sales needed to take it from seven to eight million, this latest milestone is perhaps even more impressive than previous achievements, too.</p>

<p>The remake was originally released in March 2023, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-hit-3-million-in-just-2-days" rel="nofollow">racking up three million sales</a> in the two days following its launch and swiftly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-top-4-million-mercenaries-mode-now-available" rel="nofollow">reaching four million</a> within just a couple of weeks. The game had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-reach-5-million-capcom-announces" rel="nofollow">hit five million sales</a> by July that year.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with the&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em>remake, it's a reimagining of the influential 2005 action-horror classic, which sees Leon Kennedy descending into a European village in order to rescue Ashley Graham, the US president's daughter, from a sinister cult.</p>

<p>The remake introduces a number of changes and additional elements to the original, including new exploration areas, revamped gameplay that more closely resembles the&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>3&nbsp;</em>remakes, and more.</p>




<p>Our very own Sam gave&nbsp;the&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em>remake an impressive score of 9.5 in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/resident-evil-4-review" rel="nofollow">his review</a>, praising its "fantastic" gameplay improvements and "beautiful" visuals, among other things.</p>
