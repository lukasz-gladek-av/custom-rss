Boardlandia, a popular online operation dedicated to quality, cannot move past the 145% (at the time of writing) trade tariffs on Chinese imports. As a result they have announced their closure.</p>

<h2>The Boardlandia Online Closure</h2>

<p>According to a report by <a href="https://boardgamewire.com/index.php/2025/04/23/online-board-game-seller-boardlandia-shuts-down-after-tariffs-add-unsustainable-burden-to-companys-existing-challenges/" rel="nofollow">Board Game Wire</a>, the Boardlandia closure is a direct result of the US trade tariffs adding, "an unsustainable burden" to existing financial challenges by the business.</p>

The Fendts did confirm that the brick-and-mortar store of Boardlandia in Appleton, Wisconsin, is not part of this closure.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Please know that this outcome is not what we ever envisioned. We are not walking away from a thriving venture.</p>

<p>This closure is a direct result of circumstances that have become beyond our control, and it carries significant personal financial consequences for us as well.</p>

<p>We understand that you, our valued customers, may have questions and even concerns during this time.</p>

<p>We want to assure you that this was not a decision taken lightly or with any intention other than to responsibly address the financial realities we now face.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Fendts confirmed that they are committed to shipping out any unfulfilled orders for which they have stock. They did not say how they will approach refunds for pre-orders or items that are out-of-stock.</p>

<p>The Boardlandia online store closure is yet another extension of the volatile actions by the Trump Administration in the past two months. Due to the vast majority of board game accessories and products are produced overseas in China, a 145% increase in important cost has severely impacted multiple tableop developers and publishers like Sentinels of the Multiverse developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/greater-than-games-shuts-down-in-response-to-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Greater Than Games</a>.</p>

<p>It is an act so devastating Stonemaier Games is <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/stonemaier-games-suing-us-president-over-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">filing a lawsuit</a> against the administration over its use of trade tariffs.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-circana-march-2025-sales<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>US analysis firm Circana has released its gaming sales data for March, and it probably won't come as a surprise that Ubisoft's latest major release&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>is leading the pack for the month.</p>

<p>According to Circana's Mat Piscatella over on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lniaufpggs26" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>,&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>topped the all-format sales chart for March, with new sports release&nbsp;<em>MLB: The Show 25&nbsp;</em>coming in second. Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>is in third, which isn't surprising given its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-10m" rel="nofollow">incredibly strong sales performance</a>.</p>

<p><em>Shadows&nbsp;</em>is also Xbox's top-selling game for the month, although it's pipped to the post on PlayStation by the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>MLB: The Show 25</em>. Since neither game launched on Switch, the honor for Nintendo's console goes instead to&nbsp;<em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-announced" rel="nofollow">recent remaster</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xenoblade-chronicles-x-circana-sales-data-march-2025.jpg?itok=CajVuSfV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xenoblade-chronicles-x-circana-sales-data-march-2025.jpg?itok=qOFJBYOP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Xenoblade Chronicles X&nbsp;</em>was the best-selling Switch game in March.</figcaption></figure><p>In terms of play time,&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>topped the charts for both PlayStation and Xbox, although the honor on Steam goes to wacky co-op horror game&nbsp;<em>R.E.P.O.</em>, probably because&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>isn't available on Steam.</p>

<p>Just in case you're wondering,&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>' March performance wasn't enough to give it the top spot in the year-to-date sales chart; that still belongs to&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, although&nbsp;<em>Shadows&nbsp;</em>is in a very respectable second place.</p>

<p>Hardware spending fell by 25% over last March, representing the lowest March total since 2019. Sony's PS5 was once again the market leader for both dollar and unit sales, with Xbox Series X|S coming in second on both measures.</p>

<p>Switch sales dropped by 37% when compared to last March, although that's almost certainly due in large part to consumers waiting for the Switch 2, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">launching in June this year</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-circana-sales-data-march-2025.jpg?itok=quiYN9ZJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-circana-sales-data-march-2025.jpg?itok=h_sClzgN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Switch sales are down, but the Switch 2 is coming later this year.</figcaption></figure><p>Overall, gaming spending dropped by 6% in March when compared to March last year, with only non-mobile subscriptions and console premium digital purchases growing.</p>
