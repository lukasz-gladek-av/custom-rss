            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has revealed a ton of new information about upcoming racing sequel <i>Kirby Air Riders</i>, including when you can expect to play the game.</p>

<p>In a new Nintendo Direct presentation aired earlier today, Nintendo, along with&nbsp;<em>Air Riders&nbsp;</em>director (and Nintendo legend) Masahiro Sakurai, revealed that&nbsp;<em>Kirby Air Riders&nbsp;</em>will be launching exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2 on November 20th.</p>

<p>Along with revealing the release date, Sakurai and Nintendo also divulged lots of new info about&nbsp;<em>Air Riders</em>' gameplay mechanics, characters, and game modes, and it sounds like the game will boast Sakurai's usual maximalist design philosophy (which is definitely a good thing!).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kirby-air-riders-release-date-racing.jpg?itok=JxorEaKP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kirby-air-riders-release-date-racing.jpg?itok=Ng6yfY_- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kirby Air Riders&nbsp;</em>is launching in November.</figcaption></figure><p>Essentially,&nbsp;<em>Air Riders&nbsp;</em>takes the form of a sort of auto-racer; you won't need to press any buttons to accelerate, but you will need to perform maneuvers to outfox your opponents, use specials to gain advantages, and more.</p>

<p>Each rider has different stats; Kirby, for instance, has a different weight stat to King Dedede, who won't feel the same to play as Meta Knight. You'll need to weigh up which racer you want to use on which course if you want to win.</p>

<p>If you're a&nbsp;<em>Kirby Air Ride&nbsp;</em>fan, you'll probably recognize the returning City Trial mode, which has been expanded; it now takes place on a massive floating island by the name of Skyah, which is a free-roaming map packed with events to enjoy.</p>

<p>Of course, you'll also be able to take part in the game's titular Air Ride mode, which sees you and up to five other riders competing to cross the finish line, as well as other gameplay modes to try out.</p>




<p><em>Kirby Air Riders</em>' release in November means it's one of two major Nintendo racing games to be released during the Switch 2's launch window, with the other naturally being the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">flagship launch game&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em></a>.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Kirby Air Riders&nbsp;</em>launches exclusively for <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/kirby-air-riders-switch-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch 2</a> on November 20th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and Xbox have confirmed that the teased&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2 Halo 3: ODST&nbsp;</em>crossover is indeed real, and it's taking the form of the game's latest Warbond, which also happens to be its first "Legendary Warbond".</p>

<p>The crossover was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-halo-crossover-seemingly-teased" rel="nofollow">first teased</a> as part of a&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>trailer promoting the game's Xbox release, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-xbox-series-xs-august" rel="nofollow">set for next Tuesday</a>. Rather than a new map or an in-game event,&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Halo 3: ODST&nbsp;</em>crossover will instead take the form of a Warbond.</p>

<p>That means you can expect new weapons, new armor and capes, and all the other good stuff that usually comes with a&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Warbond, but as the "Legendary" designation suggests, Sony and Arrowhead reckon they're kicking it up a notch with this one.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-halo-3-odst-warbond-armor.jpg?itok=2ZatJhGW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-halo-3-odst-warbond-armor.jpg?itok=JR7IMNeW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Helldivers 2</em>'s new&nbsp;<em>Halo 3: ODST&nbsp;</em>Warbond brings lots of new&nbsp;<em>Halo</em>-themed gear to collect.</figcaption></figure><p>This Warbond comes complete with four weapons, and they should all be pretty familiar to&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>fans. The MA5C assault rifle is an iconic weapon that packs an ammo counter and a compass, while the M6C pistol boasts <i>Helldivers 2</i>'s first suppressor.</p>

<p>The M90A shotgun has a flashlight attached to it to help you see what you're shooting in darker areas, and the M7S SMG includes a suppressor you can't remove, so it's perfect for sneakier engagements (although it'll still rip enemies to shreds in a loud firefight).</p>

<p>Of course, it wouldn't be a&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Warbond if there wasn't some armor to enjoy as well, and the&nbsp;<em>Halo 3: ODST&nbsp;</em>Warbond features two sets: the A-9 Helljumper and the A-35 Recon, both modeled after iconic&nbsp;<em>Halo 3: ODST&nbsp;</em>characters.</p>

<p>There's plenty more included as part of this Warbond as well, so make sure you check out the full announcement over on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/19/helldivers-2-x-halo-odst-legendary-warbond-arrives-august-26/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation Blog</a> if you want to see everything that's included.</p>




<p>The&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2 Halo 3: ODST&nbsp;</em>Warbond will be available on August 26th, which is the same day the game launches on Xbox Series X|S. It's also currently available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/helldivers-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and you can read <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/helldivers-2-review-fighting-for-managed-democracy" rel="nofollow">our review of it right here</a>.</p>
