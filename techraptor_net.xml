<p><em>Hunters Gathering</em> is just one of the two multiplayer <em>Horizon </em>spinoffs in the works; the other, <em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em>, is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/horizon-steel-frontiers-announcement" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6e846926-a867-4dfb-94eb-b908c540bda9" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">an MMO</a> being worked on by <em>Guild Wars </em>and <em>Throne and Liberty </em>studio NCSoft.</p><p>As Kotaku and Schreier tell it, these projects are being considered main entries in terms of focus and development time, so if you're not into either of them, then it's probably going to be some time before the next <em>Horizon </em>game that appeals to you.</p><p>Of course, <em>Horizon </em>is also moving beyond the world of games, just like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-movie-director" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a9c59ec8-3853-4f23-9cd0-2a0396cacad7" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">other Sony properties</a>; there's a live-action <em>Horizon </em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-helldivers-horizon-movies-ghost-of-tsushima-anime" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2e3004d3-4622-4ff6-a7ef-39de11054b8d" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">movie in the works</a>, although we don't know too much about the creative personnel behind the project yet.</p><p>Considering <em>Horizon Hunters Gathering </em>and <em>Steel Frontiers</em>, Sony's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-tencent-light-of-motiram-lawsuit" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="158b5a17-6308-4b2e-9131-b6559d6e961f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">belligerence towards Tencent</a> for its decidedly <em>Horizon</em>-esque <em>Light of Motiram </em>makes a lot more sense, although it's also fair to say Sony is generally quite protective over its IP.</p><figure role="group">

<p>If you want to play a <em>Horizon </em>game that isn't explicitly multiplayer-focused, you'll probably want to head back to <em>Forbidden West</em>, or perhaps <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/lego-horizon-adventures-review-a-lego-icon" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d1e6d896-d6ad-4b87-a743-b01f9d88b7b3" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">give <em>Lego Horizon Adventures </em>a try</a> (on your own, natch).
