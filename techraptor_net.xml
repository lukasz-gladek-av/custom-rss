            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Well, it's finally happened; after six years of development and lengthy silences on the part of developer Team Cherry, the&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>release date has been revealed at last.</p>

<p>As revealed during today's special announcement (which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/major-hollow-knight-silksong-announcement-set-for-this-week" rel="nofollow">was first teased on Tuesday</a>),&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>will be releasing on September 4th. It's good of Team Cherry not to keep us waiting for too much longer after we've already waited for so long!</p>

<p>The game's release date was announced as part of a brand new trailer that also showed off protagonist Hornet's impressively acrobatic moveset, as well as some of the enemies and bosses you'll be facing as you bring "hope" to&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em>'s ruined kingdom du jour.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-acrobatics.jpg?itok=EB14JlPm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-acrobatics.jpg?itok=eLg2dEhQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>looks like a much more acrobatic game than the first.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, much of&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>will look familiar to you if you're a&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight&nbsp;</em>fan, but the new trailer promises that you'll be able to face off against more than 200 enemies and vanquish over 40 new bosses, so it's fair to say this is almost certainly a much bigger and more expansive game than its predecessor.</p>

<p>Hornet's moves look much more acrobatic than her predecessor knight's, too; she can chain jumps, attacks, dashes, and more together for some specatacular-looking platforming that looks just as nimble and satisfying as the first game's gauntlets.</p>

<p>We also get a glimpse of&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>'s map in the new trailer, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed if you're hoping for a massive, interconnected Metroidvania world to explore. In short,&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>is looking every bit like the game we've all hoped it would be since <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-is-hollow-knight-sequel-youve-been-waiting-for" rel="nofollow">that fateful day in 2019</a>.</p>
