            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-sales-2m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA and Hazelight Studios have announced that sales of their genre-hopping co-op platformer&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>have hit another big milestone just a single week after the game's initial launch.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hazelightgames.bsky.social/post/3lkbeztsqbs2b" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on social media platform Bluesky,&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>has managed to break the two million sales barrier, a feat the studio describes as "simply amazing". Hazelight also thanks "all of [its] new and old fans", describing itself as "blown away" by the milestone.</p>

<p>As a quick reminder,&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-sales-1m-48-hours" rel="nofollow">hit one million</a> within the game's first 48 hours on sale, which means the game has picked up another million sales for itself in the interim. This one looks like it's going to run and run.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/split-fiction-sales-2m-combat.jpg?itok=xMxZU07h 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/split-fiction-sales-2m-combat.jpg?itok=qFZjcNvj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>sales have hit another milestone, which will be good news for EA and Hazelight.</figcaption></figure><p>It took&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>'s predecessor&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two&nbsp;</em><a href="https://x.com/HazelightGames/status/1405499693438808064" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">almost four months</a> to reach the same milestone, so it's clear&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>is continuing to strike a chord with players, perhaps because of&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two</em>'s positive reputation.</p>

<p>Again, as a reminder,&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two&nbsp;</em>went on to sell <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hazelight-josef-fares-new-ip-it-takes-two-sales" rel="nofollow">over 20 million copies at last count</a>, so it's not unrealistic to imagine that&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>might do even better than that over the next couple of years.</p>

<p><em>Split Fiction</em>'s performance also throws into sharp relief EA's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-the-veilguard-shared-world-elements" rel="nofollow">apparent suggestion</a> that recent flop&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>didn't do well because it lacked "shared world elements"; after all, Hazelight's latest isn't a live-service game, but it's already sold <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-ea-sports-fc-25-underperformed" rel="nofollow">more than&nbsp;<em>Veilguard&nbsp;</em>did</a> within its first three months on sale.</p>

<p>Just in case you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>, it's a co-op action-adventure game from&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>A Way Out&nbsp;</em>developer Hazelight Studios, headed up by industry personality Josef Fares.</p>




<p>The game revolves around Mio and Zoe, two writers who must work together in order to escape a nefarious machine that wants to drain them of their ideas. Like the aforementioned games, it's co-op only, so grab a friend or partner for this one.</p>

<p><em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>is available to buy right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2001120/Split_Fiction/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/split-fiction/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/split-fiction/9N1WXXD1RL8D" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[PowerWash Simulator 2 Announced, Coming Later This Year]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/powerwash-simulator-2-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/powerwash-simulator-2-announced-coming-later-this-year.1133592/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/powerwash-simulator-2-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher FuturLab has announced&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em>, a followup to the popular 2022 work sim. It's coming to PC and current-gen consoles sometime later this year.</p>

<p>Unlike the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/powerwash-simulator" rel="nofollow">original game</a>,&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>will be a self-published affair; it is, after all, the studio's first new game since being snapped up by mobile and browser game giant Miniclip <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/miniclip-futurlab-acquisition" rel="nofollow">back in April last year</a>.</p>

<p>As you'd probably expect from a&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator&nbsp;</em>sequel,&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>will task you with cleaning a whole new set of environments. You'll be able to explore more of Muckingham, and a number of new locations will also be available to you in a brand new campaign.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/powerwash-simulator-2-cleaning.jpg?itok=NbY_6b1l 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/powerwash-simulator-2-cleaning.jpg?itok=KrNJ1b7w 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>is coming sometime this year.</figcaption></figure><p>When you're not cleaning, you can kick back and relax at your home base, which you can also fill with "furniture and trinkets" to make it a more homely place.</p>

<p>You'll also be able to share your campaign progress with another player online, but if you don't fancy playing together at a distance, you can also team up in split-screen co-op. It's not yet clear whether&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>will support crossplay.</p>

<p>Of course, some improvements have also been made to gameplay mechanics; FuturLab says you can expect "enhanced soap that clings to stubborn stains and annihilates dirt", making cleaning feel "even better" than in the game's predecessor.</p>

<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em>, which gives a sense of what the game will look and play like, right here. Of course, if you've played&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator</em>, you'll probably already know what to expect on that score.</p>




<p><em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>will launch for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2968420/PowerWash_Simulator_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S later this year.
