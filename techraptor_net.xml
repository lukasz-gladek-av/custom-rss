            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new actual play live show is making the rounds. <a href="https://www.glasscannonnetwork.com/tour" rel="nofollow">Glass Cannon Network are selling tickets for Call of Cthulhu Live</a>, a live show that blends improvised storytelling, live performances, and the distinct, Lovecraftian cosmic horror associated with the franchise.</p><h2>The Call of Cthulhu Live Announcement</h2><p>According to an official press release, Call of Cthulhu Live features a fresh approach to the live experience. The show will be a national tour, featuring special guests like Keeper Troy Levallee and players Joe O' Brien, Skid Maher, Matthew Capodicasa, Jared Logan, Ross Bryant, Rob Kerkovich, Sydney Amanuel, Noura Ibrahim, Mary Lou, and more.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The fresh spin on the material is that each show will feature a standalone investigation. Cast members and special guests will vary from show to show, ensuring that every experience at each venue is different. The closest comparison is another live play, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dropout-announces-vod-dates-for-their-actual-play-live-show-dimension20-time-quangle" rel="nofollow">Dimension 20 Time Quangle</a>, except that show had the same cast playing different characters across different settings.</p><p>This structure is in keeping with Chaosium's <em>Call of Cthulhu</em> RPG. Based off the work of H. P. Lovecraft, the stories involve investigators uncovering the presence of supernatural forces beyond mortal understanding. The RPG is a tabletop staple, debuting in 1981. The game, currently on its seventh edition, stands alongside older peers like Cyberpunk and Dungeons &amp; Dragons.</p><p>In keeping with the source material, investigations usually end badly in <em>Call of Cthulhu</em>. Investigators either die or go irreversibly mad from the cursed knowledge they learn by the end. Because of this, investigations are usually self-contained affairs, lending themselves an episodic story structure. A fact to which Call of Cthulhu Live appears to be taking advantage.</p><p>If you are unable to physically attend the shows, the Los Angeles performance of Call of Cthulhu Live will be livestreamed, with digital tickets on sale for that show. It is unclear at this time if this show will appear on VOD.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p><span><div>
