            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/eberron-forge-of-artificer-newest-dungeons-dragons-2024-supplement-is-available-for<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The first <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> 2024</em> supplement is now available for pre-order. Wizards of the Coast is returning to the beloved setting of Khorvaire with <em>Eberron: Forge of the Artificer</em>, bringing the magical tinkerer player class to the latest version of the fantasy TTRPG.</p>



<p>According to an official press release, <em>Eberron: Forge of the Artificer</em> is a new <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> 2024 supplement. The supplement will contain new player options, monster statblocks, and magic items. These options will be based on the titular setting created by Keith Baker.</p>

This class is a staple of the Eberron setting, embodying the power fantasy of channeling magic through gadgets and scientific devices. It was absent in the 2024 core rulebooks until it returned in recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dd-beyond-releases-dungeons-dragons-2024-artificer-unearthed-arcana" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Unearthed Arcana</a>.</p>

<p>In fact, not only will <em>Eberron: Forge of the Artificer</em> contain revised versions of all four Artificer subclasses, it will also contain a brand new subclass: the Cartographer. In addition to this revised class, the supplement will include an overhauled Dragonmark system, new player species including the Warforged, and new player bastions.</p>

<p>Lastly, the book's official store page on D&amp;D Beyond, mentions campaign templates for Game Masters. The book contains three distinct, genre-based templates based on the key thematic elements of Eberron: fantasy noir, political thriller, and pulp adventure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Aside from these templates, it is unclear if the book will contain new lore or background details on the setting. This inclusion seems to go against the company's production roadmap as part of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dd-direct-2024-highlights-future-of-dd-and-showcases-project-sigil" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">D&amp;D Direct 2024</a>. During this presentation, it seemed future books would be separated into Player Guides and Campaign Guides intended for GMs.</p>

<p>Considering one of the critiques of <em>D&amp;D</em> books has been unevenly distributed material across several books, this appears to be WOTC falling back into bad habits. But considering, the 2014 supplement, <em>Eberron: Rising from the Last War</em>, is still compatible with the 2024 ruleset, it is more likely WOTC is avoiding reprinting old information.</p>

<p><em>Eberron: Forge of the Artificer</em> is available for pre-order now on <a href="https://marketplace.dndbeyond.com/category/5147000?pid=D5147000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">D&amp;D Beyond</a>. It is available in digital for $19.99, a physical book for $29.99 and an Ultimate Bundle for $39.99 which includes digital and physical books alongside digital maps and digital dice. The books are set to release August 19.</p>
