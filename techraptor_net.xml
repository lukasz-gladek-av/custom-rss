            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has revealed that&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 2.2 will be arriving in early September, bringing with it new Agents for your squad, a new story chunk to uncover, and more.</p>

<p>Following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-version-21-release-date" rel="nofollow">July's Version 2.1 update</a>, Version 2.2 of&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero</em>&nbsp;is launching on September 4th (which, given <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-september" rel="nofollow">recent developments</a>, is a pretty daring release date to commit to on HoYoverse's part, it must be said).</p>

<p>Story-wise, you'll be dealing with the fallout of the Exaltists' conspiracy and getting to know the Obol Squad, a new elite unit alongside whom you'll be working in order to "uncover long-buried truths", as well as to reveal the hidden stories behind one of its members.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zenless-zone-zero-version-2.2-seed-orphie.jpg?itok=roa5RDDh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zenless-zone-zero-version-2.2-seed-orphie.jpg?itok=xlZ7I-ZC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Two new Agents are joining the fray in&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 2.2.</figcaption></figure><p>That agent is Seed, and you'll be getting the chance to add her to your team in&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 2.2. She's a genius mechanic and Electric Attack Agent who can enhance sustained damage across her whole team.</p>

<p>Joining Seed is the twofer unit Orphie &amp; Magus, a Fire Attack Agent who can boost team Attack and cause Aftershocks to ignore part of your enemy's Defense stat. They're joined by S-rank Bangboo Mercury, who can serve as a tank for their team.</p>

<p>Alongside Seed and Orphie &amp; Magus, you'll also get another chance to pick up Evelyn and Trigger throughout the course of Version 2.2's cycle, and Soldier 0 - Anby, who's "currently undergoing intensive training", will be returning "in future versions" as well.</p>

<p>Of course, Version 2.2 will also bring with it plenty of new events and gameplay improvements, so once you've played through the main part of the new update's story, there should still be plenty for you to do.</p>




<p><em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>is <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">available to check out right now for free</a> on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and mobile devices. Version 2.2, "Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night", launches on September 4th.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splitgate-peer-to-peer-support-confirmed</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/splitgate-peer-to-peer-support-confirmed-after-sequel-returns-to-beta.1278234/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher 1047 Games has announced that peer-to-peer support is coming to&nbsp;<em>Splitgate</em>, allowing you to continue playing the game online even after the central servers are shut down.</p>

<p>Back in July, 1047 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splitgate-2-beta-layoffs" rel="nofollow">announced</a> that in order to focus on rebuilding&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>(which is returning to beta following negative feedback for its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splitgate-2-1-0-release-date" rel="nofollow">initial release</a>), servers for the original&nbsp;<em>Splitgate&nbsp;</em>will be closed down, but at the time, the devs said they would consider either offline play or peer-to-peer support.</p>

<p>Now, in a news post on the official&nbsp;<em>Splitgate&nbsp;</em>website, 1047 confirms that the direction it's chosen to go down is peer-to-peer play, which means you'll still be able to play with others online, although you'll do so via direct connection and not through a central server.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/splitgate-peer-to-peer-servers-shooting.jpg?itok=HlgMDqex 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/splitgate-peer-to-peer-servers-shooting.jpg?itok=gOsRvXZq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you love the original&nbsp;<em>Splitgate</em>, fear not; it'll still be playable after next week.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as introducing peer-to-peer play, 1047 says it's made "previously unreleased, stockpiled, or work-in-progress" content for&nbsp;<em>Splitgate&nbsp;</em>playable, including 14 new maps for you to gallivant around.</p>

<p>In essence, peer-to-peer play means that certain players will act as hosts, so the stability of the game will depend on how strong their connection is. You'll be able to view in-progress&nbsp;<em>Splitgate&nbsp;</em>games from the server browser.</p>

<p>You'll also be granted all in-game cosmetics to enjoy, and all of your previous progression will remain intact as well, so everything you've unlocked over the course of your time with&nbsp;<em>Splitgate&nbsp;</em>will still be accessible.</p>

<p>PC and console play will still be supported, as will cross-play, so you'll be able to play&nbsp;<em>Splitgate&nbsp;</em>alongside players on other platforms. Anticheat, however, will not be enabled, so there's a chance you may come across more nefarious behavior than before.</p>




<p>You can read the full FAQ for how peer-to-peer play will work in&nbsp;<em>Splitgate&nbsp;</em>via the <a href="https://www.splitgate.com/news/splitgate-1-lives-on-through-peer-to-peer-support" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement post</a>, and you can check the game out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/677620/Splitgate/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/splitgate/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/splitgate/9P4S1BPJLPHZ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Pokemon TCG Pocket Secluded Springs Booster Pack Revealed for Next Week]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-secluded-springs-booster-pack</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pokemon-tcg-pocket-secluded-springs-booster-pack-revealed-for-next-week.1278189/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company and DeNA have announced a brand new themed booster pack expansion for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>, and it's bringing a ton of new cards for you to collect next week.</p>

<p>Arriving on August 28th,&nbsp;<em>Secluded Springs</em>, like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-eevee-grove" rel="nofollow">Eevee Grove</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-expansion-shining-revelry" rel="nofollow">Shining Revelry</a>&nbsp;</em>before it, is a themed booster pack rather than a mainline expansion (like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-wisdom-of-sea-and-sky-expansion" rel="nofollow"><em>Wisdom of Sea and Sky</em></a>), which effectively means that it's bringing fewer cards and no seismic gameplay changes to&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>.</p>

<p>That doesn't mean you can't expect lots of new cards, though, and true to form,&nbsp;<em>Secluded Springs&nbsp;</em>will bring brand new digital goodies for you, including a gorgeous new Suicune ex card, a new full-art Milotic, and more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-secluded-springs-suicune.jpg?itok=8Mj89KIM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-secluded-springs-suicune.jpg?itok=taH36410 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A new Suicune ex card is just one of the cards that awaits you in&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Secluded Springs&nbsp;</em>expansion.</figcaption></figure><p>You can also look forward to new cards depicting the likes of Entei and Raikou, as well as Mantyke, Slowking, and other 'mons you might find around a hot spring area. By the looks of the art that's been shown for the expansion so far, it's all lovely high-quality stuff, too.</p>

<p>Of course, there's no guarantee that the art for these cards won't turn out to have been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-ho-oh-production-issue-plagiarism" rel="nofollow">inadvertently stolen from fanart pieces</a>, but at least we can probably expect The Pokemon Company to act quickly if that does turn out to be the case.</p>

<p>Just in case you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>, it's a mobile version of the popular&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG&nbsp;</em>card game that simplifies combat rules and renders your collection digitally rather than physically.</p>

<p>It's got plenty of cards from the main game to collect, as well as a number of unique art pieces you can only find within&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>itself, and hey, it's free to play, so you may as well check it out, right?</p>




<p><em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>is available to play now on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.pokemon.pokemontcgp&amp;hl=en_GB" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pok%C3%A9mon-tcg-pocket/id6479970832" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">iOS</a>, and its&nbsp;<em>Secluded Springs&nbsp;</em>themed booster pack launches on August 28th.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Escape from Tarkov 1.0 Release Date Set for November]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/escape-from-tarkov-10-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-tarkov-1-0-release-date-set-for-november.1278186/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Escape from Tarkov&nbsp;</em>developer and publisher Battlestate Games has announced that the game's 1.0 release finally has a release date, and it's just around the corner.</p>

<p>In a new trailer titled "Prepare for Escape" (which is pretty brief and doesn't feature too much in the way of gameplay footage), a man can be seen typing code on a screen, interspersed with footage of soldiers in camo gear engaging in firefights.</p>

<p>Eventually, amidst blaring alarms, the man types a single date on the screen: November 15th. Technically speaking, the trailer doesn't specifically say that this is&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov</em>'s 1.0 release date, but it's hard to imagine what else could warrant this kind of fanfare.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/escape-from-tarkov-1.0-release-date-snow.jpg?itok=VubJzyJu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/escape-from-tarkov-1.0-release-date-snow.jpg?itok=jTBCsqBa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Escape from Tarkov&nbsp;</em>is finally getting a 1.0 release later this year.</figcaption></figure><p>Battlestate first teased a 1.0 release for&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov&nbsp;</em>this year <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/escape-from-tarkov-10-2025-steam-confirmed" rel="nofollow">back in April</a>, and the studio confirmed that the game will be coming to Steam then as well, although whether that'll happen alongside the 1.0 launch remains to be seen.</p>

<p><em>Escape from Tarkov&nbsp;</em>was first released in closed beta back in 2017, and since then, it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/escape-from-tarkov-patch-0-16-0-0" rel="nofollow">undergone</a> a number of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/escape-from-tarkov-patch-01400-brings-new-location-for-beginners-achievements-weapons" rel="nofollow">changes</a> thanks to consistent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/escape-from-tarkov-patch-0135" rel="nofollow">updates</a> (and progress wipes to go along with them, of course).</p>

<p>The game has also spawned a spinoff in the form of <i>Escape from Tarkov: Arena</i>, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/escape-from-tarkov-arena-shows-its-fps-gameplay-in-new-trailer" rel="nofollow">more traditional FPS</a> that forgoes&nbsp;<em>Tarkov</em>'s wide-open areas and PvPvE gameplay for more straightforward player-versus-player deathmatch engagements.</p>

<p>If you wish, you can check out the new Preapre for Escape trailer right here. It doesn't give too much away other than the date, but it's a fun little creation on Battlestate's part regardless.</p>




<p><em>Escape from Tarkov&nbsp;</em>is, as far as we know, due to launch in full on November 15th this year. If you want to check it out ahead of that date, you can <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pick up its beta right now on PC</a>. Stay tuned for more.</p>
