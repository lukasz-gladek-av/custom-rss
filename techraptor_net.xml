            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Legendary industry veteran and <em>Fallout </em>creator Tim Cain has announced that he's made a return to Obsidian Entertainment, and it's the real deal; he's no contractor, but rather a "full-time employee".</p><p>In a video posted on his YouTube channel today, Cain explained that he's returned to the <em>Fallout: New Vegas </em>and <em>Grounded </em>studio "in person" rather than remotely, and that this means he's no longer "working in other places", although there's at least one project on which Cain worked apart from Obsidian that has yet to be released.</p><p>Cain says that the period between 2020 and 2025 was "a weird time in the industry", and as such, there are games on which he's worked that he isn't sure will see the light of day, too. How tantalizing!</p><figure role="group">

<p>Unfortunately, Cain also says he can't elaborate on the project on which he's currently working at Obsidian, but that "you're not gonna guess right" if you try to guess what it is, so it sounds like a novel idea, whatever it might be.</p><p>He also says he's "a lot less retired now than [he] was before", so his previous state of "semi-retirement" is no longer applicable. Additionally, Cain's YouTube channel will remain operational, since "no-one at Obsidian has even remotely suggested that [he has] to stop it".</p><p>Tim Cain first joined Obsidian in 2011, going on to work on the studio's successfully Kickstarted RPG <em>Pillars of Eternity</em>, as well as serving as one of the directors for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/outer-worlds" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="cd8a1852-2307-4184-b0df-b9afab69154e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">2019's <em>The Outer Worlds</em></a>. He also worked as a creative consultant on <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/outer-worlds-2" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f7b9881c-df25-4849-881d-eafe092b40f7" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">this year's <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em></a>, albeit not as a full-time employee.</p><p>You can check out Cain's full video, in which he also discusses other recent events in his life, right here.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen exactly what Tim Cain will do with Obsidian now he's back with the company; let's hope that Microsoft sees sense and opts to give the studio another chance at a <em>Fallout </em>game. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
