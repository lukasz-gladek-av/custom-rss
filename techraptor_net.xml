            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This year has not been kind to Xbox users as Microsoft continually finds new and creative ways to make their customers mad. Xbox's attempt to kill its own brand is making huge progress as they <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-tiers-reworked-2025" rel="nofollow">increased the subscription costs of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a>&nbsp;by 50%. Amusingly enough, the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate price hike is being advertised as the "<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/01/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-premium-essential-plans/" rel="nofollow">most expansive upgrade yet, including more day one games than ever before.</a>"</p>

<p>For a service that was once considered the best deal in modern gaming history, the new $30 monthly bill borders on daylight robbery. For 1.5 times the previous price, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate would fundamentally function as it did before, with no particularly noteworthy added features.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you want to retain the current cost of $20 per month, you'll have to settle for the Premium tier at $15.&nbsp;The Premium tier does not have day-one access to Xbox-published games, which may be withheld for up to a year after launch before it is added to the Game Pass library. You also lose out on EA Play, which was part of the $20 pricing of Game Pass Ultimate.</p>

<p>It should be noted that it seems as though a large number of third party games are being locked behind the Ultimate tier as well. The Xbox store page <em>for&nbsp;Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> for example <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/hollow-knight-silksong/9N116V0599HB" rel="nofollow">specifies that it is included in Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a>, whereas the store page for <em>Deep Rock Galactic</em> <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/deep-rock-galactic-survivor/9PHGQPRBBSXK" rel="nofollow">only mentions Game Pass Premium</a>. As it stands now, Xbox's Game Pass page lists 838 available games for Ultimate and 372 games available for Premium users. Whether or not this will change when the new subscription prices goes live remains to be seen.</p>

<h2>Xbox Game Pass: What's Cost-Benefit Analysis?</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-game-pass-price-change.jpg?itok=giOGHC-p 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-game-pass-price-change.jpg?itok=QhMBYzEG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Maybe Xbox should consider a custom plan instead where people can pick and choose what they want instead. Nah, that'd make way too much sense.</figcaption></figure><p>Historically, Xbox Game Pass' main selling point was that it was usually more cost efficient than buying a game. At $20, you get three months of Game Pass Ultimate for the price of a $60 game.&nbsp;Three months should be sufficient playtime for the average person to finish most full-priced games. They could then play one of the many other games in the Game Pass library, which might keep people in the ecosystem under the guise of affordability and convenience.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the new subscription prices, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate will only offer two full months of value for the full cost of a AAA game. This is especially relevant now that $70 and $80 games are starting to enter the equation. Game Pass Ultimate would have remained competitive at $20 in such an environment. There is no scenario where $30 can be considered by most people.</p>

<p>To put this into perspective, one month of the new Game Pass Ultimate subscription costs more than outright buying <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong" rel="nofollow"><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em></a><em>.&nbsp;</em>At two months, you can get the Deluxe Edition of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-french-revolution" rel="nofollow"><em>Clair Obscur:&nbsp;</em><em>Expedition 33</em></a>. Of course, you can drop down to Premium tier for a better exchange rate, but you're giving up day-one access to first-party Xbox games for up to a year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Xbox is attempting to offset this by bundling&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>Crew, EA Play, and Ubisoft+ Classics with Ultimate.&nbsp;The problem is that EA Play has been a part of Game Pass for years by now, and Ubisoft games were routinely being added to the Game Pass library regardless.</p>

<p>Logically, if people were that interested in EA or Ubisoft games they would've subscribed to their respective services already.&nbsp;Those who are long-term subscribers to Xbox Game Pass likely care more about first-party Xbox games, smaller third-party titles, and indie games since these games make up the majority of the Game Pass library.</p>

<h2>Xbox Game Pass: Where're the Games, Phil?</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-game-pass-games.jpg?itok=5MZIKik5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-game-pass-games.jpg?itok=-7oaUUEd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>So, how's that Bethesda and Activsion Blizzard acquisition working out for ya, Xbox?</figcaption></figure><p>Ironically, all these changes might end up decimating the player base of first-party Xbox games.&nbsp;Even the best games in the world are not worth the additional $15 monthly charge for the mere privilege of day one access. Most people would simply stick with Premium (if they remain subscribed at all) and then switch to Ultimate for a month or two if they really wanted to play a specific game that was not available on Premium. Or they could simply buy the game.</p>

<p>That's assuming that those first-party Xbox games are worth playing, or exist, to begin with. Despite spending a literal fortune on Bethesda and Activision Blizzard King, neither purchase has resulted in an increased variety of games for the end user, to say nothing of new IPs. Not to mention the fact that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" rel="nofollow">news of workers being fired and game development studios being closed down</a> isn't exactly inspiring confidence in anyone.</p>

<p>One would almost think that Sony has someone feeding ideas to Xbox leadership because the changes to Game Pass Ultimate are absolutely incredible... for PlayStation. For starters, a monthly subscription to PlayStation Plus Premium is $18, while the current cost of a Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription is $20. The new Game Pass pricing scheme would put Ultimate at $30, a full 60% more than the comparable service offered by PlayStation.</p>

<p>Xbox Game Pass only returns to a competitive price at the Premium level, but at that point Game Pass is ceding its massive advantage in library size and day-one access for a monthly discount of $3. If there was ever an attempt to position Xbox as the affordable way to game, then this Game Pass update just torpedoed those efforts in less than 24 hours.</p>

<h2>Xbox Game Pass: Gearing Up for the Next Console War?</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-hardware.jpg?itok=WynVXDHd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-hardware.jpg?itok=4-lUgrTI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's a bold strategy to make everything an Xbox, let's see if it pays out for them</figcaption></figure><p>Without the niche of offering a superior subscription service, it's hard to make a case for Xbox hardware. A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/b/xboxconsoles?icid=DSM_Gaming_Consoles_AllXboxConsoles_Slot01" rel="nofollow">2TB Xbox Series X is selling for $730</a>. Meanwhile, a&nbsp;<a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-pro-console" rel="nofollow">2TB PS5 Pro goes for $750</a>. The <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/handhelds/rog-xbox-ally" rel="nofollow">ROG Xbox Ally is projected to sell for $600</a>. A <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-switch-2-system-123669/" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch 2 has a price tag of $450</a>&nbsp;by comparison.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Saving $20 on hardware between PlayStation and Xbox hardly counts for much if the monthly subscription costs for Ultimate are going to be $30. If Ultimate was $20 with all of its perks intact, then an argument for long-term affordability can be made, especially if individual games are $70 or $80.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, Xbox does have a slight advantage over its competitors in that Xbox Game Pass has cloud-gaming functionality available for PCs, most modern phones, tablets, and some TVs.&nbsp;Ultimate users are apparently given priority access, though whether or not that's worth the added cost is up to you.</p>

<p>Perhaps the idea is to give up on consoles altogether and leapfrog the high cost associated with PC hardware via Xbox Game Pass' cloud gaming functionality. In theory this would make everything a potential Xbox and everyone a potential Xbox Game Pass subscriber. The PC and phones would thus become the next battleground, given that one or the other are almost mandatory to have in this day and age.</p>

<h2>Xbox Game Pass: A Lesson on How to Shoot Yourself in the Foot</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-game-pass-perks.jpg?itok=5_9p_gRG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-game-pass-perks.jpg?itok=Zipq8EeI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's kind of funny how Xbox keeps advertising in-game bonuses for otherwise free-to-play games as if they're a huge draw for Game Pass rather than just... bonuses.</figcaption></figure><p>Even if the strategy is to abandon traditional consoles and move Xbox into a multiplatform publishing role, no one on PC is going to spend the equivalent of four to six full-price AAA games on a year of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. You can probably make a case for Premium, but it's going to be difficult when Xbox releases games on Steam anyways.</p>

<p>Needless to say, this seems to be the worst possible time for Xbox to agitate longtime fans of Xbox Game Pass.&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>,&nbsp;<em>Clockwork Revolution</em>, <em>Gears of War: E-Day</em>, and <em>Forza Horizon 6</em>&nbsp;are releasing within the next year, all games that could've otherwise boosted Game Pass numbers. Not to mention that Hideo Kojima's next (Xbox published, mind you) project, <em>OD</em>, finally got a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kojima-productions-10th-od-physint" rel="nofollow">reveal trailer</a>.</p>

<p>The real victims in this whole fiasco would be the smaller or more obscure game developers who might've found new audiences thanks to Xbox Game Pass. Games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/haven" rel="nofollow"><em>Haven</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/trek-to-yomi" rel="nofollow"><em>Trek to Yomi</em></a>, and <em>OPUS: Echo of Starsong</em> were excellent additions that fully deserved their spot in the Game Pass library, serving as fantastic examples of how a subscription service does have its use cases in the gaming industry.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has revealed what you can expect from the first season of free-to-play skateboarding sim&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>when it arrives next week, and there are a ton of new cosmetics up for grabs, plus more.</p>

<p>As detailed in <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/skate/news/skate-season-1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on the game's official blog, the first season of&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>will bring two seasonal events with it, as well as "a little makeover" for San Vansterdam, lots of new challenges and objectives for you to pursue, and, of course, a brand new battle pass.</p>

<p>First up, it's the first of two seasonal events, Skate-o-Ween. It's San Vansterdam's annual Halloween celebration, but EA says it's "less focused on the spookiness" and "more about getting a chuckle out of someone". It runs from October 21st to November 11th.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skate-season-1-details-skating.jpg?itok=9GkDyJ_V 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skate-season-1-details-skating.jpg?itok=x-M6o5tQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Skate</em>'s first season is bringing new stuff galore next week.</figcaption></figure><p>The second big event this season is the 7-Ply Maple Harvest, which begins on November 18th and ends on December 2nd. Both events will feature updated community parks, plus new themed cosmetics you can grab either via in-game challenges or by visiting the Extravert Shop.</p>

<p>Completing seasonal events will earn you event currency, and you can then use that currency to grab special cosmetic items. EA says it'll have more info about both events before they go live in&nbsp;<em>Skate</em>.</p>

<p>Season 1 will also bring new general cosmetics for you to earn outside of the specific seasonal events, but of course, the battle pass will have both a free and a premium track, and you'll have to cough up some cash if you want to get premium items.</p>

<p>It's not all about spending money, though; several new music tracks are also being added for Season 1, including the likes of Bad Religion's "Against the Grain", Jane's Addiction's "Stop!", and Gang Starr's "Full Clip", among others.</p>




<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>for free right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3354750/skate/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/skate/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/skate-game-preview/9PHF9K5Q6ZLZ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and its first official season kicks off on October 7th.
