            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gta-5-pc-update-ps5-xbox-series-xs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rockstar has announced a date for the long-awaited&nbsp;<em>GTA 5&nbsp;</em>PC update that will add enhancements previously only available on the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions of the game.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/akk98a4o755825/free-upgrade-for-grand-theft-auto-v-on-pc-coming-march-4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">update</a>, which is coming on March 4th, will add features like new vehicles and upgrades at Hao's Special Works, an animal-centered Wildlife Photography Challenge, and the ability to sign up for a GTA+ <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gta-online-subscription-gta-announced-for-consoles" rel="nofollow">membership</a> if you're on PC.</p>

<p>Lots of recent features added to&nbsp;<em>GTA 5&nbsp;</em>on consoles, like kernel-level anti-cheat for&nbsp;<em>GTA Online&nbsp;</em>and "proactive voice chat moderation", will also be available for the PC version, as well as a number of technical enhancements.</p>

Of course, you'll need compatible hardware to take advantage of these enhancements.</p>

<p>Loading times should also be improved if you're playing on an SSD and using DirectStorage, and the game will now also support "higher resolutions, higher aspect ratios, and higher framerates" across the board.</p>

<p>If you're a PS5 controller owner, you'll be happy to know that&nbsp;<em>GTA 5&nbsp;</em>will now support the DualSense controller on PC, complete with adaptive trigger compatibility.</p>

<p>The game's first trailer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-released-early-following-leak-coming-in-2025" rel="nofollow">aired back in December 2023</a>, racking up a staggering <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-achieved-crazy-90-million-views-in-24-hours" rel="nofollow">90 million views</a> within a 24-hour period. It's safe to say that people are pretty excited for this one.</p>

<p>According to Rockstar's parent company Take-Two,&nbsp;<em>GTA 6&nbsp;</em>is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gta-6-still-on-track-for-fall" rel="nofollow">still on track to launch in fall this year</a>, but until then, you can content yourself with this upcoming&nbsp;<em>GTA 5&nbsp;</em>PC update. It's launching on March 4th.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dune: Awakening Brings Open-World Survival to Arrakis in May]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dune-awakening-brings-open-world-survival-to-arrakis-in-may.1114491/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Funcom has revealed the&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>release date, and if you're eager to begin your journey of survival on the desert world of Arrakis, then you can get stuck into the character creation tool right now.</p>

<p>As revealed in a new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>launches on PC on May 20th. Unfortunately, it won't be landing on consoles at the same time; Funcom says a PS5 and Xbox Series X|S release date for&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>has yet to be revealed.</p>

<p>As a sweetener, however, you can try out the game's character creation tool right now. It also comes complete with a benchmark tool, so you can check whether your PC is beefy enough to run the game in the first place.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dune-awakening-release-date-combat.jpg?itok=1B-mbdvd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dune-awakening-release-date-combat.jpg?itok=fFNP_ldX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>officially lands on PC in May.</figcaption></figure><p>When it launches,&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>will set you back $49.99 or your regional equivalent. Pre-orders aren't live just yet, but when they do go live, pre-ordering the game will net you the Terrarium of Muad'Dib, which you can use to decorate your base with an adorable little desert mouse.</p>

<p>Additionally, if you check out the character creator and benchmark tool for&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>ahead of launch, you'll get a Frameblade knife skin that you'll be able to redeem once you pick up the full game. Of course, you can transfer your created character into&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>when it launches.</p>

<p>Using the tool, you can not only make your character, but also decide which caste, home planet, and mentor you want. Which mentor you pick will determine your starting abilities, but you'll be able to mix and match as well, so you can be a Swordmaster with some Bene Gesserit abilities if you want.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening</em>, it's an open-world survival game with an emphasis on multiplayer. The game takes place on the desert planet of Arrakis and sees you "embark[ing] on a journey from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-reveals-spectacular-gameplay-and-details" rel="nofollow">scavenging and survival to controlling the planet itself</a>".</p>




<p>Funcom says&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>will be perfect for both fans of Frank Herbert's original&nbsp;<em>Dune&nbsp;</em>novels and those who've never picked up one of the books or watched one of the movies.</p>

<p><em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172710/Dune_Awakening/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> on May 20th. You can check out our hands-off preview of the game from back in March last year <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/dune-awakening-preview-pax-east-2024" rel="nofollow">right here</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-hits-back-at-christopher-barrett-bungie-lawsuit-with-evidence-of-pattern-of-misconduct.1114341/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-christopher-barrett-lawsuit-evidence<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has responded to a lawsuit brought against it by ex-Bungie employee Christopher Barrett, whose employment was terminated by the&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2&nbsp;</em>developer last year following allegations of misconduct.</p>

<p>Barrett brought the suit against Sony in December, alleging that the company, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-is-acquiring-destiny-2-developer-bungie" rel="nofollow">is Bungie's parent</a>, engaged in a "sham" investigation in order to support its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marathon-director-fired-report-bungie" rel="nofollow">termination of his contract</a>.</p>

<p>However, as spotted by Stephen Totilo of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/sony-bungie-christopher-barrett-lawsuit-response" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Game File</a>, Sony has now filed a response, and the 128-page document contains evidence that Sony says reveals Barrett's "pattern of misconduct" with regard to his communications with female employees.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/christopher-barrett-destiny-2-sony-lawsuit.jpg?itok=HzhTMBAC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/christopher-barrett-destiny-2-sony-lawsuit.jpg?itok=uuMNcmc8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ex-Bungie employee Christopher Barrett is suing Sony, but Sony has a thing or two to say about that.</figcaption></figure><p>As you can probably imagine, the document is extremely extensive and exhaustive. It contains answers to many of Barrett's claims in his own suit, but most explosively, it includes several exchanges Sony says are evidence of Barrett's attitude towards female employees.</p>

<p>The exchanges include Barrett allegedly telling a female employee she was "hot" and asking her what she thought her best and worst physical features were, as well as telling another employee he would "hit on [her]" if she wasn't being treated well by her boyfriend.</p>

<p>He asked the same employee what "the steps one would have to take" to date her were, asking "what's the strategy guide". To another victim, he said he didn't want her boyfriend to "get the right idea" about the messages he was sending her.</p>

<p>There are several more text exchanges like these, and if they are indeed legitimate, then I think they're pretty damning with regards to Sony's motive for firing Barrett.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/christopher-barrett-sony-lawsuit-halo-3.jpg?itok=l_rlxe0h 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/christopher-barrett-sony-lawsuit-halo-3.jpg?itok=5lJq3S9J 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Christopher Barrett has also worked on Bungie games like&nbsp;<em>Halo 3</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Sony goes on to say that Barrett's "predatory behavior" caused his victims to "seek guidance" from other employees on how to manage his "constant boundary-pushing".</p>

<p>Victims reported to HR that they were "afraid for their jobs during" the encounters with Barrett, but Sony says these employees were "placed...in a vulnerable position" in which they "felt compelled to engage with" Barrett in order to maintain "good standing".</p>

<p>In Barrett's original suit, he says he was a "scapegoat" for Sony and Bungie and that he was "falsely" accused of sexual misconduct, which Sony says is "outrageous considering the evidence". The company says the evidence provided in the document "will demonstrate his termination...was justified".</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see where this lawsuit goes next; none of this represents a definitive conclusion, of course, and Barrett will doubtless have responses prepared for Sony in due course. Stay tuned for more.</p>
