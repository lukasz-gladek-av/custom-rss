            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stardew-valley-sales-40m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Smash hit indie farming sim&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley&nbsp;</em>is somehow continuing its meteoric ascent despite the fact that it's almost nine years old, at least if its latest sales figures are anything to go by.</p>

<p>Over on the official <i>Stardew Valley&nbsp;</i>site's <a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/press/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press portal</a>, Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone says that the game has managed to shift a staggering 41 million copies "as of December 2024".</p>

<p>According to Barone, more than 26 million of those copies have been sold on PC alone, while 7.9 million copies have been sold on the Nintendo Switch. The game's success being primarily PC-based makes a lot of sense given that that's the first platform on which it was released.</p>

Just a couple of months after the game's initial launch, it had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stardew-valley-breaks-million-copies-sold" rel="nofollow">crossed a million sales</a>, hitting <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stardew-valley-1-on-switch-eshop-over-35m-owners-on-steam" rel="nofollow">3.5 million players on Steam alone</a> in January 2018.</p>

<p>Even on mobile platforms, where free-to-play games reign supreme and upfront paid products often struggle,&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stardew-valley-ios-version-crosses-1-million-in-sales-on-itunes" rel="nofollow">managed to rake in $1 million</a> in sales on iOS within just a few weeks of its launch on the app store.</p>

<p>It's clear that&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley&nbsp;</em>has struck a chord to an even greater degree than other cozy farming sims; it arguably spearheaded the current wave of such games, especially in the indie sphere, so its success makes a lot of sense through that lens.</p>

<p>The game, which is heavily inspired by the&nbsp;<em>Story of Seasons&nbsp;</em>(formerly&nbsp;<em>Harvest Moon</em>) franchise, even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/harvest-moon-creator-on-his-new-game-and-how-stard/1100-6445583/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">attracted praise</a> from that franchise's creator Yasuhiro Wada, who said&nbsp;<em>Stardew&nbsp;</em>"carries on the legacy of the original&nbsp;<em>Harvest Moon&nbsp;</em>very well".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stardew-valley-sales-40m-sign.jpg?itok=ZE5YXRQO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stardew-valley-sales-40m-sign.jpg?itok=N9wkuq20 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's no wonder Eric Barone is taking his time with his next game.</figcaption></figure><p>As for what Barone is working on next, he's currently developing a new cozy life sim-style game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/haunted-chocolatier-is-next-game-from-stardew-valley-developer-concernedape" rel="nofollow">by the name of&nbsp;<em>Haunted Chocolatier</em></a>.</p>

<p>The game's development is progressing slowly, largely because Barone is still working on&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley</em>, which he describes as a "big and popular game" to which he has "a lot of attachment".</p>

<p>He also says that&nbsp;<em>Haunted Chocolatier&nbsp;</em>will "still take a while", but that following the&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley&nbsp;</em>1.6 release on all platforms, he "<a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/stardew-valley-1-6-mobile-console-release-date/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">would like to finish&nbsp;<em>Haunted Chocolatier&nbsp;</em>next</a>".</p>

<p>Here's hoping that happens sooner rather than later. Until then,&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/413150/Stardew_Valley/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/stardew-valley/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/stardew-valley/C3D891Z6TNQM" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/stardew-valley-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>, and mobile platforms.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/team17-martyn-brown-dies-57<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Team17 co-founder Martyn Brown has passed away aged just 57. He worked with the publisher for two decades, helping to oversee the release of games like&nbsp;<em>Worms</em>,&nbsp;<em>Alien Breed</em>, and the PSP remake of&nbsp;<em>Lemmings</em>.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/team17-co-founder-martyn-brown-dies-aged-57" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GamesIndustry.biz report</a>, Brown's son Jack confirmed his death following "a prolonged battle with a series of strokes". Jack says Brown passed "on his own terms listening to his favorite music and surrounded by loved ones".</p>

<p>GI.biz points to a number of emotional tributes from other folks in the gaming industry, including one from Riot Games' EMEA publishing director Hannes Seifert, who somberly declares that "the light of our generation of developers is slowly but steadily dimming".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/team17-martyn-brown-dies-worms.jpg?itok=14rQ4uXI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/team17-martyn-brown-dies-worms.jpg?itok=oi1aCyJN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Team17 is best known for the&nbsp;<em>Worms&nbsp;</em>series, among others.</figcaption></figure><p>Brown's untimely death comes just a month after he <a href="https://gamerepublic.net/awards/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">received an award</a> from gaming body Game Republic.</p>

<p>The Games Legend award is reserved for industry figures who've had a major impact on the gaming world, with previous winners including the likes of Revolution Software's Charles Cecil and Noirin Carmody.</p>

<p>Indeed, Game Republic managing director Jamie Sefton was one of the industry figures paying tribute to Brown, calling him "such a friendly, funny person" and describing him as an "industry legend not just for Team17 but also for his incredible support and help" for other devs and gaming figures.</p>

<p>Brown co-founded Team17 in 1990 as a merger between two pre-existing companies: British studio 17-Bit Software and Swedish outfit Team 7. His co-founders include Debbie Bestwick, who <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/team17-ceo-to-step-down-after-over-30-years" rel="nofollow">stepped down</a> as Team17 CEO earlier this year following <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/team17-employees-allege-harassment-terrible-pay-and-more" rel="nofollow">allegations of a poor work culture</a> by employees.</p>

<p>As GI.biz says, he's survived by his wife Heather, as well as his children Jack and Harry and his stepdaughter Darcy.</p>
