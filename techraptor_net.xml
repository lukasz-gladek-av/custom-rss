            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Former&nbsp;<em>Everwild&nbsp;</em>producer Louise O'Connor has been recruited by Xbox to serve as its new chief of staff, following the cancellation of that game earlier this year.</p>

<p>Back in early July, Rare's <i>Everwild&nbsp;</i><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">was canceled</a> and various staff members at the studio were let go as part of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" rel="nofollow">wider layoff wave</a> at parent company Microsoft. However, it looks as though O'Connor is one of the Rare staffers who's managed to escape unemployment.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/rare-veteran-lands-new-role-at-xbox-game-studios-after-everwild-cancellation/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">VGC</a>, O'Connor, who previously served as an artist and animator at Rare before overseeing <i>Everwild&nbsp;</i>as an executive producer, will now occupy the position of Xbox's chief of staff, which means she'll be overseeing the gaming division's various teams and employees.</p>

<p>Her last credit with Rare is a special thanks nod on 2020's side-scrolling beat-'em-up&nbsp;<em>Battletoads</em>, with which our reviewer Austin was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/battletoads-review" rel="nofollow">particularly impressed</a>&nbsp;(the game, that is, not the credit).</p>

<p>O'Connor also isn't the only Rare luminary to jump ship to Xbox in the last twelve months. She follows in the footsteps of former Rare boss Craig Duncan, who <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-studios-head-retiring" rel="nofollow">took the place of Xbox's Alan Hartman</a> as the head of Xbox Game Studios back in October last year.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, many Rare staffers weren't as lucky as O'Connor or Duncan, with several employees losing their jobs as part of the aforementioned Microsoft employee cull, including long-time Rare veteran <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sources-banjo-kazooie-sea-of-thieves-director-leaves-rare-after-35-years-following-everwild-cancellation/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gregg Mayles</a> (again, according to VGC).</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what Rare will announce next (if anything; it may end up going the same way as&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow"><em>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</em>studio The Initiative</a>). Stay tuned for more.</p>
