            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft has announced that&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>, along with other Xbox holiday releases, will, in fact, cost the standard price of $70 rather than the $80 the studio previously announced.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/OuterWorlds/status/1948020672502137257" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on social media, Xbox and developer Obsidian say that as part of "making sure that corporations do not go unfettered" (a tongue-in-cheek reference to the game's satirical anti-corporate message), the price of&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2&nbsp;</em>will be lowered from $80 to $70.</p>

<p>Additionally, Xbox confirmed to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-u-turns-on-the-outer-worlds-2-80-price-point-reverting-to-70-and-reimbursing-pre-order-customers" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">IGN</a>&nbsp;that this pricing change applies not only to&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>, but also to all Xbox holiday releases, so that includes the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>. Xbox is also releasing&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 4&nbsp;</em>this holiday, but that game was already set at $70.</p>

<p>If you missed it, Xbox made the announcement that it would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-prices-raised-hardware-software" rel="nofollow">raise hardware and software prices back in May</a>, with its two major holiday releases (<em>The Outer Worlds 2&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</i>) serving as the first $80 games from Microsoft.</p>

<p>That announcement was, of course, met with exactly the same hostility and criticism with which Nintendo was met when it announced that&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>would cost the same, although Nintendo hasn't climbed down on its pricing structure.</p>

<p>Xbox is, however, in a different position to Nintendo. Thanks to a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" rel="nofollow">recent massive wave of layoffs</a> at Microsoft, which saw in-development projects like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">Rare's&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">Everwild</a>&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">The Initiative's&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">Perfect Dark</a>&nbsp;</em>canceled (as well as the latter shutting its doors for good), Xbox is arguably in need of some goodwill right now.</p>

It's worth bearing in mind that both games are also available on Game Pass on day one, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-price-hike-new-tier" rel="nofollow">if you're a PC- or Ultimate-tier member</a>.</p>
