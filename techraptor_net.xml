Focus Games has partnered with an accomplished humanities professor to produce <em>Legless in London</em>, a board game about playing as an amputee in Victorian London.</p>

<h2>The <em>Legless in London</em> Announcement</h2>

<p>According to the game's <a href="https://www.leglessinlondon.com/" rel="nofollow">official page</a>, <em>Legless in London</em> is a nuanced board game about disability.</p>

<p>It is a game where players face challenges, opportunities, and choices at every turn. They will navigate the workplace, the marriage market, property ownership, medicine, and the prosthesis market while aiming to achieve their character's personal goals.</p>

Everyone from beloved poet William Ernest Henley to <em>Moby Dick's</em> Captain Ahab are represented here.</p>

<p>In addition to being designed for fun, Legless in London encourages players to think about the various barriers that disabled people face in real life and the different hurdles they confront. Furthermore, the designers hope players will reflect on how disabled people are represented in fiction and popular culture.</p>

<p><em>Legless in London</em> was designed in collaboration with Focus Games and Dr. Ryan Sweet, a Senior Lecturer in Humanities at Swansea University, alongside a focus group of members of the disabled community.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Disability and disability history are underrepresented in culture—and especially in tabletop gaming. Many mainstream tabletop games also present accessibility problems for disabled players (for example, wordy and/or complex rules, which can be troublesome for neurodivergent users). Legless in London addresses both representational and accessibility concerns as it provides a balanced, researched-informed, positive, and fun portrayal of disability in an inclusive format.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That consideration for disability also extends to the game's design. It will launch with a smartphone app, providing a digital alternative to the game's physical components including dice rolls, event cards, health tracker, and in-game money.</p>

<p>As for the physical components, the game will ship with large accessible font text, screen reader-friendly resources, easy-read rules, and more.</p>

<p><em>Legless in London</em> will launch in February 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-marine-2-2025-outline-pvp<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>publisher Focus Entertainment has shared what's coming to the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k&nbsp;</em>shooter in 2025, and if you're a fan of the PvP game modes, you'll be pleased with the roadmap.</p>

<p>In a new <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/135-december-community-update" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">December community update</a>, Focus first looks at the last few months for&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>, highlighting things like major updates and the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-player-count-5m" rel="nofollow">rather impressive sales figures</a>.</p>

<p>Following the 2024 recap, Focus then moves onto highlighting what you can expect from next year in&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>, and the first thing on the agenda is more PvP content. The publisher says it knows PvP fans feel "left out", and so next year will bring a new map, custom lobbies, and more.</p>

New Operations and enemies are also on the way for you to tackle.</p>

<p>We also got a look at the next champion making his way to&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>, and it's a Salamander sniper. Focus acknowledges that the Raven Guard Chapter would have been "an obvious choice" for a sniper, but that the studio has "different plans" for the Raven Guard.</p>

<p>More customization options are also coming, alongside a new Datavault option on the Battle Barge. It'll allow you to read "unlockable information on most elements from the game", in case you want to brush up on your&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>lore.</p>




<p>In case you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>, it's a third-person shooter set in the grim darkness of the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k&nbsp;</em>universe.</p>

<p>The game sees protagonist Demetrian Titus returning from the first game. Having spent time with the Deathwatch in order to prove himself free of heresy, Titus is re-inducted into the Ultramarines and tasked with eradicating a Tyrannid infestation on the planet Kadaku.</p>

<p>Like its predecessor,&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>emphasizes both close-quarters combat and ranged weaponry, and it's also got a renewed focus on co-op play. Fittingly enough, its credits also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-credits-totalbiscuit" rel="nofollow">feature a rather touching tribute</a> to a man who championed the original title.</p>
