            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-soul-aside-release-window-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and developer Ultizero Games have announced that long-awaited hack-and-slash action game <i>Lost Soul Aside&nbsp;</i>finally has a release window, and they've given us a fresh glimpse at some gameplay as well.</p>

<p>In a new trailer, the two studios confirm that the game is set for release on PC and PlayStation 5 in 2025, so let's hope that this time, we're finally going to be able to get our hands on this one.</p>

<p><em>Lost Soul Aside&nbsp;</em>has had a very lengthy development process indeed. It was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/impressive-one-man-project-lost-soul-aside-will-be-timed-exclusive-for-ps4" rel="nofollow">first announced</a> as part of the inaugural round of games in Sony's China Hero Project all the way back in 2016, at which point it was to be a timed exclusive on PS4.</p>

That trailer was all about the ray tracing that will be featured in&nbsp;<em>Lost Soul Aside</em>, so perhaps we'll see this one get some <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-pro-announced-november" rel="nofollow">PS5 Pro enhancements</a> as well.</p>

<p>As for details regarding the game's plot and moment-to-moment gameplay, Sony and Ultizero are remaining fairly tight-lipped for now. It'll be a hack-and-slash "action-adventure RPG", according to Ultizero, and it'll be a single-player game too.</p>

<p>Narrative-wise, you're out to "save your sister and the whole of humankind from dimensional invaders", so you can perhaps think of this one as a sort of cousin to&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade</em>, albeit one with perhaps less of an emphasis on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/festive-stellar-blade-update" rel="nofollow">the main character's costumes</a>.</p>

<p>You can check out the new release window announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Lost Soul Aside&nbsp;</em>right here. It's got some nice stylish action for you to look at as well.</p>




<p><em>Lost Soul Aside&nbsp;</em>is due to arrive on PlayStation 5 and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3378960/Lost_Soul_Aside/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> sometime next year. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/path-of-exile-2-update-0-1-0e-brings-checkpoint-fast-travel-and-much-more.1064238/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-update-010e<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Grinding Gear Games has released&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile&nbsp;</em><em>2&nbsp;</em>update 0.1.0e, and it's designed to introduce several oft-requested quality-of-life features to the action RPG, including checkpoint fast travel and more.</p>

<p>The update introduces the ability to travel between an area's checkpoints, and more checkpoints have also been added to areas "generally at all the entrances and exits", so traveling around an area should be a little less painful now.</p>

<p>On the whole, this update is focused on adding lots of little changes to make your&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>experience smoother, rather than one or two bigger additions. It's all in keeping with the promise made by Grinding Gear last week to&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-devs-feedback-early-access" rel="nofollow">address user feedback and implement changes</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/path-of-exile-2-update-0.1.0e-forest.jpg?itok=-Cr6spvP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/path-of-exile-2-update-0.1.0e-forest.jpg?itok=8tSksYdi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Path of Exile 2</em>'s latest update adds a ton of quality-of-life features.</figcaption></figure><p>Various changes have been made to&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2</em>'s endgame content as well, and its monster balance has also been addressed. Monsters will now deal 40% less bonus damage from critical strikes, for instance, while higher-tier maps no longer have extra elemental resistance penalties.</p>

<p>You'll also find a ton of changes to individual classes and skills, with lots of abilities' damage values and effects being changed to improve the difficulty curve.</p>

<p>There are far too many tweaks in update 0.1.0e to list here, but you can check out the full&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3645467" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">patch notes</a> if you want to read everything that's new. If you're a buildcraft hound, I'd recommend doing so.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2</em>, it's an action RPG that serves as a followup to 2013's popular&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile</em>. Originally planned as a major expansion of the original game, it was instead <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-will-be-standalone-game-closed-beta-date-gameplay-revealed" rel="nofollow">revealed to be a full sequel in July last year</a>.</p>




<p>The sequel released in Early Access <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-early-access-release-delayed" rel="nofollow">earlier this month</a>, proving so popular that its developers <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-early-access-server-issues-warning" rel="nofollow">expressed concern</a> regarding whether or not the game's servers would be able to hold up. Luckily, it seems those issues didn't manifest to any significant degree at launch.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>right now on PC <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2694490/Path_of_Exile_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">via Steam Early Access</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/path-of-exile-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/path-of-exile-2/9ND8N4RW5GHX" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.
