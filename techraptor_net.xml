            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has released a new preview of their upcoming <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> Forgotten Realms book. This new supplement for the 2024 edition of the game is bringing back an older mechanic, circle magic, which will bring more utility and power to spellcasting groups.</p>



<p>In a D&amp;D Beyond <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/2083-circle-magic-and-new-spells-gain-mastery-over-the" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>, Wizards of the Coast provided a small sneak peek into the new circle magic mechanic coming to <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024</em>. As the name implies, this magic is a ritual art that allows spellcasters to combine their strength, amplifying and even reshaping some rules of magic.</p>

In that edition, the mechanic was used by the Red Wizards of Thay, the magic-supremacist casters who act on behalf of the lich, Szass Tamm.</p>

<p>The post then explains how this mechanic is expressed in-game. First, the spell must use a spell slot, and have a casting time of one action or 1 minute or longer. One of the casters in the circle, called the primary caster, chooses the targets for the spell, spends the spell slot and expends any material components, and maintains concentration if it is required.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The other casters in the magic circle are secondary casters. They must take the Magic action and be near the primary caster to contribute to the spell. They must do this every turn for the duration of the spell's casting time.</p>

<p>Once this is done, the primary caster can enhance the spell's effects. These effects include enhancing its distance, area of effect, eschewing material components, letting all casters share maintaining Concentration on the spell, and protecting allies from the spell's negative effects.</p>

<p>The post confirms that the new <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-details-emerge-on-new-dungeons-dragons-forgotten-realms-supplements" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024</em> Forgotten Realms</a> books will include new spells that greatly benefit from circle magic.Two of the spells previewed include Doomtide, a debilitating sphere of darkness that deals psychic damage and imposes a penalty on saving throws. The second one, Spellfire Storm, hails radiant fire on enemies and disrupts spellcasting.</p>

<p>The Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024 Forgotten Realms books will be available in both physical and digital November 11, 2025.</p>
