            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Blizzard has revealed <em>Overwatch Rush</em>, a brand new top-down hero shooter "set in the <em>Overwatch </em>universe", and it's currently in active development, although there's no release date yet.</p><p>In a <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24244645/development-update-overwatch-rush" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">news post</a> on the official Blizzard website, the studio describes <em>Overwatch Rush </em>as a new game "designed specifically for mobile" and developed by a "dedicated team" with "deep mobile experience". The company also released an in-development gameplay preview to show off what <em>Overwatch Rush </em>will offer.</p><p>According to Blizzard, the team working on <em>Overwatch Rush </em>is separate from <em>Overwatch</em>'s Team 4, which remains "fully focused" on the main game. Testing in select countries and regions should begin soon, Blizzard says.</p><figure role="group">

<p>By the looks of the trailer, <em>Overwatch Rush </em>will share some of its DNA with games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/league-of-legends-coming-to-mobile-and-consoles-with-wild-rift" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1677dde0-b02a-457d-abb1-56798dbc3723" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>League of Legends: Wild Rift</em></a><em> </em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/pokemon-unite" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="686e435d-5353-438b-99f6-31ea1dd5be84" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Pokemon Unite</em></a>, although it's worth noting that Blizzard doesn't describe the game as a MOBA.</p><p>It'll feature recognizable <em>Overwatch </em>heroes like Mercy, Reinhardt, and Soldier 76, and like the main game, it looks like gameplay will revolve around contesting objectives in fast-paced shootouts, although this time from a top-down perspective.</p><p>We don't know too much else about <em>Overwatch Rush </em>yet, except that Blizzard says that there's still "a lot of work to do" on the game, and that you should check out the official <a href="https://discord.gg/overwatchrush" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Discord server</a> if you want to keep up with the newly-announced project's progress.</p><p>You can take a look at the debut trailer for <em>Overwatch Rush</em>, which shows off what the gameplay will look like and how some of the heroes in the game will play, right here.</p>
<p><em>Overwatch Rush</em>'s announcement comes after a <a href="https://x.com/PlayOverwatch/status/2019118032635724211" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">major relaunch</a> for the original <em>Overwatch</em>, which saw Blizzard <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/blizzard-announces-overwatch-2-includes-shared-multiplayer-environment" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="61f2536d-30de-44b4-853e-caef9bf9646c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">dropping the "2" from the title</a> and reverting to just "<em>Overwatch</em>", as well as the launch of several new heroes and more.</p><p>We'll have to wait and see what comes of <em>Overwatch Rush</em>, but it could be a little while before Blizzard reveals more about this one. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
