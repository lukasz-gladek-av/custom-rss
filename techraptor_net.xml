            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-update-clone-rumble<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>NetEase has released a new&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>update, and it's bringing a chaotic new game mode along with it, as well as a new Galacta-themed event and plenty of balance changes.</p>

<p>The update was released earlier today, but two of its biggest additions won't be going live until tomorrow: the Galacta's Cosmic Adventure event and the Clone Rumble game mode.</p>

<p>First up, Clone Rumble is a new mode that allows you and your teammates all to play as the same hero. If you've ever wondered what six Mr. Fantastics or six Rocket Raccoons could accomplish in a <em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>match, this mode is for you.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-rivals-clone-rumble-update-punisher.jpg?itok=Ux31xIdJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-rivals-clone-rumble-update-punisher.jpg?itok=V38OQTBO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Marvel Rivals</em>' new Clone Rumble update looks set to cause chaos.</figcaption></figure><p>The mode will only be available across three distinct three-day time periods, though. You'll be able to check it out between tomorrow and March 10th, and it'll then be available again from March 14th-March 17th and March 21st-March 24th.</p>

<p>As well as Clone Rumble, you can also check out the new Galacta's Cosmic Adventure event, which launches tomorrow as well. Joining the event will net you an exclusive Black Widow outfit for free, and this event runs until April 11th, so the time period isn't as limited as Clone Rumble.</p>

<p>Of course, you can also expect plenty of optimizations and gameplay tweaks in this update. It's well worth checking out the full&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/20250304/41548_1215931.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">patch notes</a> for the Clone Rumble update so you can stay up-to-date on what's going on.</p>




<p>It's been a strange few months for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>. The game launched back in December and reached <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-10m" rel="nofollow">10 million registered players</a> within just 72 hours, going on to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-40m" rel="nofollow">break the 40 million barrier</a> by NetEase's last count.</p>

<p>However, that didn't stop the Chinese gaming giant from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-studio-shockingly-closed-by-netease-laying-off-everyone" rel="nofollow">unexpectedly closing down the Seattle studio</a> responsible for developing the game. I guess nobody is really safe from the recent wave of industry cuts and layoffs, unfortunately.</p>

<p><em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>is available to play right now for free on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2767030/Marvel_Rivals/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010451" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/marvel-rivals/9n8pmw7qmd3d" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>
