            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The TTRPG community has lost one of its pioneers. Tim Kask, a man who would shape the earliest version of the iconic TTRPG <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> and the first full-time employee of TSR Inc., has passed away.</p><h2>The Passing of Tim Kask</h2><p>The influence Tim Kask had on the tabletop industry is substantial. He was an avid wargamer, playing many tactical war games in the 1970s. Eventually, he had a chance to play <em>Chainmail</em>, designed by Gary Gygax.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>This experience led to the two men corresponding about miniature game rules, which led to Kask being invited to Gen Con to playtest Gygax's next game: <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. Kask was the first playtester outside of Gygax's family to play this version, originally called "The Fantasy Game."&nbsp;</p><p>This relationship deepened when Tim Kask was hired full-time by Gygax's company, TSR Inc., in 1975. He edited and contributed to various <em>D&amp;D</em> supplements, such as the influential and genre-blending <em>Blackmoor</em> setting and <em>Eldritch Wizardry</em>, which introduced <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dungeons-dragons-2024-psion-ua-update-refines-new-psychic-casting-class" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">psionics</a> and Mind Flayers to the game. There is even a device in the game named after a character he made: the Apparatus of Kwalish.</p><p>Kask was also known for periodical work. One of his biggest contributions was as editor for the TSR magazine, <em>The Strategic Review</em>, which would eventually split into two different books: <em>Dragon Magazine</em> and <em>Little Wars</em>. <em>Dragon Magazine</em> is vital since it introduced ideas, spells, and magic items that would appear in official <em>D&amp;D</em> products.&nbsp;</p><p>One of those ideas is the now iconic Forgotten Realms setting. The same setting that has hosted many epic and beloved D&amp;D adventures, such as <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/baldurs-gate-3" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a>.</p><p>Tim Kask would depart from TSR in 1980. The reason for his departure was creative disagreement around the creation of <em>Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. According to <a href="https://gamerant.com/tim-kask-dungeons-and-dragons-editor-death/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Game Rant's</a> findings, Kask thought original <em>D&amp;D</em> should stay, "a free-wheeling game" and didn't like the new rules-focused approach.</p><p>But Kask didn't completely vanish from the tabletop community. He would appear at conventions and continue writing and developing in the industry. His most recent work was the founding of Eldritch Enterprises in 2010.&nbsp;</p><p>Tim Kask passed away on December 30, 2026, after a sudden illness. He passed peacefully in his sleep, surrounded by friends and family.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
