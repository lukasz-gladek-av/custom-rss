<p>To clarify, this doesn't seem to mean you won't get a <em>Modern Warfare </em>game one year and then a <em>Black Ops </em>game the next; rather, it looks like it means successive years won't see the same sub-franchise launching, so there won't be two <em>Black Ops </em>or <em>Modern Warfare </em>games in a row.</p><p>Activision also says that in the future, it intends to "drive innovation that is meaningful, not incremental" when it comes to <em>Call of Duty</em>, and that while it has no more information to share about what that might mean right now, it will share more "when the time is right".</p><p>If you've yet to try <em>Black Ops 7</em> (and <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/1990519018537812406" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">sales data suggests</a> you're far from alone if you haven't played it yet), Activision is holding a free weekend for the shooter next week, so you can jump in and try its multiplayer and Zombies game modes for free.</p>
<p><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 </em>launched back in mid-November, and despite its predecessor apparently enjoying the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-series-sales-black-ops-6-launch" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="0e8aa163-0fd6-4fc9-a2e0-23799b12215b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">franchise's biggest ever launch</a>, it looks like the game <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/november-2025s-top-new-steam-games" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">hasn't exactly been a smash hit</a> for Activision.</p><p>Indeed, it looks as though EA's <em>Battlefield 6 </em>has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-6-sales-7m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7f54e66c-a1d7-49c6-a458-a64a557a9323" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">significantly outperformed</a> its rival, at least in terms of initial sales, which is probably why Activision is scrambling to figure out what's gone wrong.</p><p>Whether or not this results in any real change in terms of what's next for <em>Call of Duty </em>remains to be seen, but there's clearly still enough faith in the franchise at Activision HQ to move ahead with a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-movie" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5bcbe900-0a2b-4995-b155-09cc3df0eb7f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Paramount-led movie adaptation</a>.
