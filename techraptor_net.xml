            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-pre-orders-delayed-canada<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has confirmed that Switch 2 pre-orders in Canada have been delayed, following on from the company's decision last week to push back the pre-order window for the console in the US.</p>

<p>On Friday last week, Nintendo announced that US Switch 2 pre-orders <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/us-switch-2-pre-orders-delayed-tariffs" rel="nofollow">would be delayed</a> in order to give the Japanese gaming giant time to assess "evolving market conditions" brought about by President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs.</p>

<p>Now, in a statement given to Canadian tech news platform <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2025/04/08/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-canada-delay/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">MobileSyrup</a>, Nintendo has confirmed that Switch 2 pre-orders in the US' neighboring Canada will also be delayed. Pre-orders in Canada were originally due to open on April 9th, but a new date hasn't been announced.</p>

<p>Just like in the US, however, Nintendo hasn't given any suggestion that the Switch 2's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">release date of June 5th</a> will be delayed in Canada. It is, however, possible that the console's price will be changed, although no price change has been announced in either country.</p>

<p>This also shouldn't affect pre-orders in any other countries, although as usual, it's worth keeping an eye out for any specific announcements pertaining to your country of residence to be on the safe side.</p>

<p>Just in case you need a reminder, Nintendo fully revealed the Switch 2 last week. Launching on June 5th, the console will cost $450 in the US and around $630 in Canada (at least, as far as we know).</p>




<p>The Switch 2's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-launch-lineup" rel="nofollow">launch lineup</a> will include the likes of racer&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a>, as well as tech demo-style title&nbsp;<em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em>, which, despite its title, won't be a free pack-in game.</p>

<p>As far as we know, the Switch 2 will still be launching on June 5th in Canada. Nintendo will likely announce when pre-orders will open in both the US and Canada in the coming days or weeks, so stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/planet-zoo-americas-animal-pack-dlc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Frontier Developments has announced a new DLC pack for zoo sim&nbsp;<em>Planet Zoo</em>, and this one's for you if you've ever wanted to populate your zoo with American animals.</p>

<p>The aptly-named&nbsp;Americas Animal Pack<em>&nbsp;</em>follows on from previous&nbsp;<em>Planet Zoo&nbsp;</em>DLCs focused around various other <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-planet-zoo-expansion" rel="nofollow">regions</a> of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/planet-zoo-dlc-pack-adds-southeast-asian-animals-aplenty" rel="nofollow">world</a>, adding seven new animals for you to put in your zoo, as well as lots of new scenery items and more.</p>

<p>First up, this DLC brings what is perhaps the most iconic American animal of all time in the form of the coyote, which "can run up to 40 miles per hour", according to Frontier. Hopefully, it'll find a happy home in your zoo.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/planet-zoo-americas-animal-pack-ocelots.jpg?itok=PRL17eui 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/planet-zoo-americas-animal-pack-ocelots.jpg?itok=iterDqrg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Seven new American animals will be available in the&nbsp;<em>Planet Zoo&nbsp;</em>Americas Animal Pack DLC.</figcaption></figure><p>Your next animal is the ocelot, a Central and South American wildcat that can variously be seen hanging out in trees, stalking the land, and even swimming.</p>

<p>Five more animals are included as part of this pack as well: the greater rhea, the white-faced saki, the American flamingo, the bush dog, and the Bighorn sheep. As Frontier says, these animals "showcase some of the diverse and rich wildlife that makes the Americas so unique".</p>

<p>As well as the above animals, you'll also find more than 80 new scenery pieces to put in your zoo to help your guests feel more at home, including new fabric flags, ironwork lamps, and paper fans.</p>

<p>A brand new campaign scenario will also be made available in which you'll be able to learn about the animals included as part of the DLC. You'll be helping "the notorious Dominic Myers" transform his public image and build a successful zoo in Central America.</p>




<p><em>Planet Zoo</em>'s&nbsp;Americas Animal Pack DLC will be available on April 15th <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3473820/Planet_Zoo_Americas_Animal_Pack/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on Steam</a>, although no release date has yet been revealed for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/planet-zoo-ps5-xbox-announcement" rel="nofollow">console versions</a> of the game. Stay tuned for more.</p>
