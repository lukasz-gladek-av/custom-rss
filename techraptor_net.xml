            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-update-boss-rush<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GameScience has announced a brand new&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>update, and it's introducing a boss rush mode into the game, as well as a new Journeyer's Chart feature and more.</p>

<p>Two different challenge modes have been introduced in this update: Return of Rivals and Gauntlet of Legends. The former allows you to take on previously-fought bosses in single combat and features "three levels of difficulty", but if you haven't fought that boss in the main game, you won't be able to take it on here.</p>

<p>Gauntlet of Legends, meanwhile, is a boss rush mode in which you can fight "multiple opponents in succession" with different modifiers to make things more interesting. Some bosses will also sport new moves, so you'll need to be on your guard.</p>

<p>As well as these new combat challenges, the latest&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>update is also adding a Journeyer's Chart feature to the game, which allows you to chart areas "for guidance and marking". You'll need to reach the Black Wind Mountain area and meet the Keeper to unlock this feature.</p>

<p>To celebrate the Chinese New Year (early, of course), GameScience has also gifted all&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>players with a special set of armor, which you can redeem through the Trailblazer's Gift feature at Keeper's Shrines.</p>

<p>You can read the full list of changes in this update <a href="https://www.heishenhua.com/news/detail?id=149" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>. It's been released on the Epic Games Store first, and other platforms will follow "gradually".</p>




<p><em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>is a Soulslike action RPG developed by Chinese studio GameScience. It follows the Destined One, a simian warrior who seeks to follow in the footsteps of the great fallen trickster king Sun Wukong.</p>

<p>The game was hugely popular upon its release back in August, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-24-hour-player-count" rel="nofollow">topping the Steam charts</a> within a handful of hours and reaching 18 million sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-expansion-sales-18m" rel="nofollow">within two weeks</a>.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2358720/Black_Myth_Wukong/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/black-myth-wukong/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[Space Engineers 2 Announced, Release Date Coming Next Week]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-engineers-2-announced</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/space-engineers-2-announced-release-date-coming-next-week.1056909/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-engineers-2-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Keen Software House (not to be confused with&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded&nbsp;</em>developer Keen Games) has revealed&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2</em>, a sequel to the popular space sandbox building sim&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers</em>.</p>

<p>The game was revealed in a rather nondescript-sounding video simply titled "Concordia Research Facility for Modular Engineering", which, if you're a&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers&nbsp;</em>fan, is exactly the kind of thing you'd expect a sequel announcement to appear in.</p>

<p>Said teaser shows off a number of features you can expect from&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2</em>, including new creative tools, the ability to partially copy certain elements of a construction, and "instant undoing of mistakes", as well as the ability to redo anything you've accidentally undone.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/space-engineers-2-announcement-window.jpg?itok=dm1w2ngN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/space-engineers-2-announcement-window.jpg?itok=4x7qCSE8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>promises all-new tools to play with.</figcaption></figure><p>Despite the complexity of these new tools, the voiceover in the new trailer reassures players that said tools have been made "intuitive enough for anyone to grasp", even though they're "sophisticated enough to build wonders".</p>

<p>The trailer concludes by bidding players to "prepare for an experience unlike anything before", so if you're a&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers&nbsp;</em>fan, it sounds like this is exactly the kind of sequel you'd want for the first game.</p>

<p>A livestream will be held on December 19th at 6pm UTC (that's around 1pm Eastern) with more&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>info, including an extended gameplay showcase and a reveal for the game's Early Access release date as well.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>right here.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with the original&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers</em>, its developers describe it as a "sandbox game about engineering, construction, exploration, and survival in space and on planets".</p>

<p>Released in February 2019 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-engineers-release-date-set-for-february-with-major-overhaul-to-survival" rel="nofollow">after five years of Early Access development</a>, the game allows you to build ships, space stations, outposts, and various other structures, using what you've built to carve out a life for yourself in the harsh wilderness of space.</p>

<p><em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>doesn't have a release date yet, but we'll learn when you'll get to play it on December 19th. Stay tuned for more.</p>
