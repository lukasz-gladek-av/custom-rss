            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-year-of-eevee-merchandise<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has designated 2025 as the "Year of Eevee", promising tons of Eevee-themed merchandise throughout the year including plushies, TCG sets, figurines, and much more.</p>

<p>Over on the UK version of the Pokemon Center <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/en-gb/year-of-eevee" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>&nbsp;(with the promo likely also on its way to the US website soon), the company promises "a year of Eevee products" as a gift for those who "love Eevee". Who doesn't?</p>

<p>The site goes on to say that "from plush to apparel,&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG&nbsp;</em>to figures, you won't be short on Eevee merch this year". True to its word, the site then spotlights a number of existing plushies, toys, and pins themed around Eevee and its evolutions (or Eeveelutions).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-center-year-of-eevee-listings.jpg?itok=qY6xd3Bn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-center-year-of-eevee-listings.jpg?itok=WoNLmx1t 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Year of Eevee is already well and truly underway on the Pokemon Center website.</figcaption></figure><p>Further down, the Pokemon Center site looks forward to Eevee merchandise that's coming later this year, including "a new series of beautifully-crafted Evolving Personalities figures" based on Eeveelutions.</p>

<p>They include the Splashes Vaporeon figure, the Skillful Strategy Jolteon figure, and the Satisfied Snooze Flareon figure, with several more based on the remaining Eeveelutions coming later on.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to a new kind of plushie that features "the most cozy, fleecy material", and as you've probably guessed, Eevee will be one of the options for that plushie, although you can also pick up Pikachu if you like.</p>

<p>All of this is, of course, in addition to the new <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-brings-eevee-and-its-many-forms-to-scarlet-violet" rel="nofollow"><em>Prismatic Evolutions&nbsp;</em>set</a> for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG</em>, which launches next week and revolves mainly around Eevee and its evolutions.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-center-year-of-eevee-prismatic-evolutions.jpg?itok=j7zmhfec 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-center-year-of-eevee-prismatic-evolutions.jpg?itok=1mYb5EEQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pokemon TCG</em>'s new&nbsp;<em>Prismatic Evolutions&nbsp;</em>set will be heavily themed around Eevee.</figcaption></figure><p>All of this Eevee-related excitement comes as speculation regarding the upcoming Nintendo Switch successor mounts. Nintendo has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation" rel="nofollow">promised an announcement</a> before April this year, so it's very possible the new console could be revealed this month.</p>

<p>In February, a new&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends&nbsp;</em>game in the form of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-a-announced" rel="nofollow">was revealed</a>, and we still don't have a concrete release date for that. Additionally, mainline&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games have been released every three years since 2013, so we could be due an announcement on that front soon as well.</p>

<p>All of this is to say that given that 2025 is now apparently the Year of Eevee, and given all of the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em> news we might reasonably expect this year, we could finally be in for a new Eeveelution being revealed soon. Let's hope so!</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valorant-tejo-season-2025-act-1</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-valorant-agent-tejo-revealed-for-season-2025-act-1.1074864/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valorant-tejo-season-2025-act-1<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Riot Games has revealed a brand new&nbsp;<em>Valorant&nbsp;</em>Agent in the form of Tejo, an Initiator with a number of rather intriguing gadgets to his name.</p>

<p>Tejo will arrive alongside Season 2025 Act 1, which is set to debut in just a couple of days. He's a Colombian intelligence consultant with a "ballistic guidance system" that both helps his allies to identify their foes and deals direct damage into the bargain.</p>

<p>First up, Tejo's Special Delivery ability fires a sticky grenade onto the first surface it hits, exploding and Concussing targets caught up in its blast radius. You can also launch the grenade with just one bounce using the alt fire key.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/valorant-new-agent-tejo-special-delivery.jpg?itok=HhmTWk0d 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/valorant-new-agent-tejo-special-delivery.jpg?itok=VmWEB5g0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Tejo is&nbsp;<em>Valorant</em>'s latest Initiator Agent.</figcaption></figure><p>Stealth Drone, meanwhile, allows Tejo to control a drone as it reveals the enemies its pulse hits, as well as Suppressing them. Finally, the Guided Salvo ability hits up to two locations on the map with missiles that detonate as soon as they arrive.</p>

<p>Of course, Tejo also has an Ultimate ability in the form of Armageddon, a tactical strike that delivers a payload of explosives along a custom-set path. It sounds like Tejo won't be for those who prefer their Agents simple, but he'll be a rewarding choice for more skilled players.</p>

<p>Along with Tejo,&nbsp;<em>Valorant</em>'s Season 2025 Act 1 also brings with it the Flex system, consisting of "handheld objects that [give] players more ways to express themselves in-game". Each player will get one Flex for free, and a second will be available via the battle pass.</p>

<p>You'll also be able to get your hands on the new EX.O skin line, which offers skins for the Vandal, the Sheriff, the Spectre, the Outlaw, and the Katana.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Valorant</em>, it's a competitive multiplayer first-person shooter created by&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>developer Riot Games.</p>

<p>The game mixes the objective-based gameplay of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/counter-strike-global-offensive" rel="nofollow">Counter-Strike</a>&nbsp;</em>with the hero-focused approach of the likes of&nbsp;<em>Overwatch&nbsp;</em>and the more recent&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/marvel-rivals" rel="nofollow"><em>Marvel Rivals</em></a>, offering players unique abilities for each Agent while also keeping the focus on map control and awareness.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Valorant&nbsp;</em>for free right now on <a href="https://playvalorant.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S</a>. Season 2025 Act 1 arrives on January 8th.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/carmen-sandiego-reboot-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/carmen-sandiego-reboot-release-date-revealed.1074837/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/carmen-sandiego-reboot-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Gameloft has revealed the release date for its upcoming&nbsp;<em>Carmen Sandiego&nbsp;</em>reboot, and the game is launching first on Netflix Games for mobile devices, followed by a PC and console launch later this year.</p>

<p>As revealed in <a href="https://carmensandiego-game.com/news/carmen-sandiego-launch-date" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on the game's official website,&nbsp;<em>Carmen Sandiego&nbsp;</em>will arrive on Android and iOS via Netflix Games on January 28th, and it'll then launch digitally for PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch on March 4th.</p>

<p>In addition to the digital launch, a special 40th-anniversary physical edition will also be made available through "Amazon and leading retailers" in late April. Those retailers include GameStop (although perhaps <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/more-gamestop-store-closures" rel="nofollow">not quite as many stores as we might have hoped</a>), BestBuy, Target, and Walmart.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/carmen-sandiego-release-date-newspaper.jpg?itok=bO8iATLT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/carmen-sandiego-release-date-newspaper.jpg?itok=c9kCR_ul 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Gameloft's&nbsp;<em>Carmen Sandiego&nbsp;</em>reboot is due out in January on mobile, then in March everywhere else.</figcaption></figure><p>Unlike previous games in the&nbsp;<em>Carmen Sandiego&nbsp;</em>series, the new game will cast Sandiego as a vigilante who, according to Gameloft, "steals from thieves to protect the world's treasures". This will be the first game in the series in which you'll actually play as Carmen herself, too.</p>

<p>Where Carmen was once the head of the criminal organization V.I.L.E., she's now battling that same organization, using her gadgets to track down V.I.L.E. syndicates and bring them to justice.</p>

<p>Gameloft is promising "a 3D world with puzzle-solving mechanics, real-world locations, and the classic gameplay of tracking down suspects and solving cases" for&nbsp;<em>Carmen Sandiego</em>, further stating that the game will offer a "fresh, immersive experience for both long-time fans and newcomers".</p>

<p>You can check out the latest trailer for&nbsp;<em>Carmen Sandiego</em>, which gives a good impression of the game's art style and direction, right here.</p>




<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Carmen Sandiego&nbsp;</em>when it launches on mobile devices via Netflix Games on January 28th. It'll then arrive for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2475300/Carmen_Sandiego/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012106" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/carmen-sandiego/9N2MZJPCXS6V" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and Nintendo Switch digitally on March 4th, with the physical version arriving sometime in April.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sonic the Hedgehog Movies Cross $1B at the Box Office]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-the-hedgehog-movies-1b-box-office</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sonic-the-hedgehog-movies-cross-1b-at-the-box-office.1074825/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-the-hedgehog-movies-1b-box-office<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Paramount Pictures has announced that the three&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog&nbsp;</em>movies have crossed a major box office milestone between them.</p>

<p>According to a press release, the franchise has managed to surpass $1 billion in "total box office receipts worldwide", and given that phrasing, it's unlikely Paramount is including any revenue generated by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/knuckles-series-release-date" rel="nofollow">the&nbsp;<em>Knuckles&nbsp;</em>TV show</a> in that figure.</p>

<p>The first two movies constitute $725.2 million of that figure, with $181m in "consumer spending" also being generated by those two movies, although it's not clear whether Paramount is counting that figure as part of the $1b total.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sonic-the-hedgehog-movies-box-office-shadow.jpg?itok=FV4BErv_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sonic-the-hedgehog-movies-box-office-shadow.jpg?itok=GGxTjaEy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The third&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>movie, which stars Keanu Reeves as Shadow the Hedgehog, was released last month.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Paramount,&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em>, the latest installment in the franchise's movie adventures, has earned over $312m around the world, hitting number one at the US box office in its opening weekend.</p>

<p>The studio says that this result puts&nbsp;<em>Sonic 3&nbsp;</em>"83% ahead of&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog 2</em>" on a "like-for-like basis, including previews".&nbsp;<em>Sonic 3&nbsp;</em>also apparently managed to hit $100m at the global box office "more quickly than its predecessors".</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with any of the&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>movies, they're all essentially adaptations of the&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog&nbsp;</em>"mythology", for want of a better word.</p>

<p>While <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-hedgehog-film-coming-to-theaters-next-year" rel="nofollow">the first movie</a> revolved mainly around Sonic himself, the second saw Sonic's longtime sidekick Tails joining the cast, as well as the stoic Knuckles, played by none other than Idris Elba. In the third, we're introduced to brooding antihero Shadow the Hedgehog, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-sonic-hedgehog-3-movie-trailer-keanu-shadow" rel="nofollow">played by Keanu Reeves</a>.</p>




<p>The three movies also all feature legendary comic actor Jim Carrey as Dr. Ivo Robotnik, alongside a human cast that includes the likes of James Marsden and Krysten Ritter (in the case of the third movie, at least).</p>

<p>Given the success of the existing&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog&nbsp;</em>movies, it probably won't come as a surprise that a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fourth-sonic-hedgehog-movie-2027-report" rel="nofollow">fourth movie is reportedly already in development</a>, with a tentative release window of 2027.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-shift-up-ps5-pro-bonus</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stellar-blade-developer-shift-up-gave-all-its-employees-a-ps5-pro-as-a-bonus.1074822/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-shift-up-ps5-pro-bonus<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>developer Shift Up has gifted all of its employees with a PS5 Pro, as well as a cash sum, as part of the studio's end-of-year bonus program.</p>

<p>According to Korean news platform <a href="https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/008/0005137533?sid=105" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Naver</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/stellar-blade-studio-shift-up-has-gifted-all-its-employees-a-ps5-pro-and-3-4k/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">VGC</a>), around 300 employees at Shift Up have received their very own PS5 Pro as an end-of-year bonus, as well as 5 million Korean won, which works out at around $3,400.</p>

<p>A Shift Up rep told Naver that the bonuses had been awarded "for the purpose of encouraging talent" (a quote for which we've used machine translation).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stellar-blade-shift-up-bonuses-monster.jpg?itok=FtMFXaDh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stellar-blade-shift-up-bonuses-monster.jpg?itok=XD3gwNFp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>has done so well that Shift Up has granted all of its employees a pretty impressive bonus.</figcaption></figure><p>Given that the PS5 Pro <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-pro-announced-november" rel="nofollow">retails for around $700</a>&nbsp;(which works out at about 1 million won), these bonuses are not to be sniffed at.</p>

<p>Still,&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>managed to shift (no pun intended) <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-sales-one-million" rel="nofollow">around a million copies</a> within its first couple of months on release, and although Shift Up hasn't released newer sales figures than that, it seems the game is at least performing well enough to prompt the studio to issue these goodies.</p>

<p>News of Shift Up's end-of-year employee bonuses comes as the studio gears up to release&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>on PC, at least if its <a href="https://shiftup.co.kr/eng/ir/ir.php?ptype=view&amp;code=ir_eng&amp;idx=203&amp;category=" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">latest financial results</a> are anything to go by.</p>

<p>The PC release of&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>is apparently planned for sometime this year, and Shift Up expects sales on the platform to "exceed that on consoles". Hey, who knows? Maybe Shift Up employees will get new gaming PCs at the end of this year.</p>




<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>itself, it's received a number of updates since launching in April this year, including <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-nier-automata-crossover" rel="nofollow">a&nbsp;<em>Nier: Automata&nbsp;</em>crossover</a>&nbsp;and several <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/festive-stellar-blade-update" rel="nofollow">festive outfits</a>.</p>

<p>While Shift Up's attention is doubtless focused on&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>for the near future, the studio has apparently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-developer-shift-up-new-action-rpg" rel="nofollow">already begun work on its next game</a>, which will, according to the studio itself, be a "cross-platform next-gen project".</p>

<p>It's likely to be some time before we hear more about that, so while we wait, you can check out&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/stellar-blade/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right now on PS5</a>.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/notch-minecraft-2</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/minecraft-creator-markus-notch-persson-basically-announced-minecraft-2.1074774/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/notch-minecraft-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Markus "Notch" Persson, the original creator of&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>, says he's "basically announced&nbsp;<em>Minecraft 2</em>" after releasing a poll in which he asked his fans what type of game they'd like to see him work on next.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://x.com/notch/status/1874522284813107617" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">poll</a>, which was posted on social media platform X a few days ago, gave fans two options with regards to Notch's next project: "a traditional roguelike" in the vein of&nbsp;<em>ADOM&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Nethack</em>, or "a spiritual successor thing to&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>".</p>

<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the poll, which has attracted over 285,000 votes at time of writing, heavily skews towards "<em>Minecraft 2</em>", as he calls it, with 81.5% of votes weighing in for that project and just 18.5% of votes supporting the roguelike concept.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/minecraft-2-notch-announced.jpg?itok=MWQpjJ3h 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/minecraft-2-notch-announced.jpg?itok=aIleTtcQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Notch can't actually make&nbsp;<em>Minecraft 2</em>, since he no longer holds the rights to the franchise.</figcaption></figure><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/notch/status/1875230756437479658" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">followup message posted later on</a>, Notch then says he "basically announced&nbsp;<em>Minecraft 2</em>" in the poll. Despite feeling that "spiritual successors are usually kind of...tragic", he goes on to say "why not do the thing that people DO want and are willing to give me, somehow, even MORE cash for".</p>

<p>Of course, Notch doesn't actually own the rights to&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>anymore (which <a href="https://x.com/notch/status/1874532442637475973" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">he himself acknowledges</a>); since Mojang was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mojang-yes-were-being-bought-by-microsoft-notch-leaves" rel="nofollow">purchased by Microsoft in 2014</a>, at which point Notch also left the company, it's Microsoft that owns&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>, not Notch.</p>

<p>In his post, Notch says he intends to make the&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>spiritual successor without "sneakily infring[ing] on the incredible work the Mojang team is doing and that Microsoft is successfully doing the Microsoft shittification about". He doesn't elaborate on exactly what that means.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that Notch doesn't reveal any details whatsoever about this project, so it's likely that we're a long way away from seeing any actual gameplay or even learning any concrete information about it.</p>

<p>While the concept of&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>'s original creator making a spiritual successor will be exciting to many, he's not a figure without his fair share of controversy.</p>

<p>He's been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/minecraft-ditches-references-to-notch" rel="nofollow">accused of homophobia, transphobia, misogyny, and other prejudices</a> due to his posts on social media, leading to Mojang <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/notch-excluded-from-minecraft-anniversary-for-comments-and-opinions" rel="nofollow">excluding him</a> from&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>'s tenth anniversary due to his "comments and opinions".</p>

As far as we're aware, Mojang and Microsoft have no plans for a&nbsp;<em>Minecraft 2&nbsp;</em>of their own.</p>
