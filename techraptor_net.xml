            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Modiphius Entertainment has announced an official <em>Doom Arena Board Game</em>. The tabletop publisher behind <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/modiphius-announces-fallout-wasteland-warfare-second-edition" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Fallout: Wasteland Warfare</em></a> and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/mass-effect-board-game-review-back-to-reaper-war" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Mass Effect</em> board game</a> will be bringing the hyperviolence of the seminal shooter series to gaming tables.</p>

<h2>The Doom Arena Board Game Announcement</h2>

<p>In an official press release, Modiphius has announced that two versions of the <em>Doom Arena Board Game</em> will be available later this year via a Kickstarter campaign.</p>

The simple, but effective narrative of Doom Guy trapped on a Mars outpost surrounded by demonic enemies.</p>

<p>The second game, <em>Doom: The Dark Ages Arena Board Game</em>, is based on the 2025 release of "New Doom," an era packed with cosmic factions of demons, angels, cosmic horrors, and a superpowered hero called The Doom Slayer.</p>

<p>Regardless of which game you pick, both will feature a quick-to-learn competitive experience. Players face off as either Doom Guy or the demonic hordes as they navigate different battlefields, uncovering weapons and hidden power-ups straight from the series. These battles will escalate across three rounds. Last one standing wins. Of course, no matter who wins, the arenas are going to have a new crimson paint job.</p>

<p>Both versions of the <em>Doom Arena Board Game</em> will share the same ruleset. Additionally, the Kickstarter campaign will feature optional expansions, covering various enemies found in each franchise. Enemies such as the Atlan mech and the Mecha Dragon from <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/doom-dark-ages" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em></a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Chris Birch, co-founder of Modiphius, said: “DOOM has been that game that hard-core FPS players have loved since the original, and it brings back so many memories. We’re so excited to bring that frantic action, combined with our awesome miniatures, to the tabletop!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is unclear at the time of writing who the developers of the <em>Doom Arena Board Game</em> are or when the game is expected to ship. However, there is a good chance the base price may be more than expected due to recent current events.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Wolfenstein TV Series In Production for Prime Video]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wolfenstein-tv-series</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wolfenstein-tv-series-in-production-for-prime-video.1253547/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>According to a new report, a TV show based on id Software and Bethesda's legendary&nbsp;<em>Wolfenstein&nbsp;</em>franchise is currently in development, and it's set to air on Prime Video.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/wolfenstein-tv-series-amazon-kilter-patrick-somerville-1236469609/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Variety</a>, the show will be produced by&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>studio Kilter Films, with executive producer duties being handled by Keyframe Films' James Altman and MachineGames' Jerk Gustafsson, the latter of whom served as director on&nbsp;2014's&nbsp;<em>Wolfenstein: The New Order&nbsp;</em>and 2019's&nbsp;<em>Wolfenstein: Youngblood</em>.</p>

<p>We don't yet know what the story of the series will be, but as Variety points out, the logline for the series is simply this: "the story of killing Nazis is evergreen". It's hard to argue with that.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wolfenstein-tv-show-new-colossus.jpg?itok=JWPaEvZx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wolfenstein-tv-show-new-colossus.jpg?itok=p6g4rqpr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A&nbsp;<em>Wolfenstein&nbsp;</em>TV series is in development for Amazon.</figcaption></figure><p>Although story details are being kept under wraps, if it were me, I'd probably adapt the narrative of&nbsp;<em>The New Order</em>; it's almost certainly the strongest the series has to offer.</p>

<p>Casting also hasn't been revealed yet, but if you ask me,&nbsp;<em>Reacher</em>'s Alan Ritchson was essentially born to play swole hero B.J. Blazkowicz, so if he doesn't end up in the lead role, something's gone seriously wrong.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Station Eleven&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Maniac&nbsp;</em>creator Patrick Somerville will serve as the showrunner for&nbsp;<em>Wolfenstein</em>, so it'll essentially be up to him and Amazon what direction the show decides to take.</p>

<p>No third mainline game in MachineGames' rebooted&nbsp;<em>Wolfenstein&nbsp;</em>series has been revealed yet (I'm very much trying to ignore&nbsp;<em>Youngblood</em>); while&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/indiana-jones-and-great-circle" rel="nofollow">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>&nbsp;</em>had more than its fair share of Nazi-punching, this might be the closest you're going to get to more&nbsp;<em>Wolfenstein&nbsp;</em>for some time.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wolfenstein-tv-show-new-order.jpg?itok=y72U415q 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wolfenstein-tv-show-new-order.jpg?itok=WBlJYOG4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>More&nbsp;<em>Wolfenstein&nbsp;</em>games might not be on the way for a while, so the TV show could be the best you're going to get.</figcaption></figure><p>This&nbsp;<em>Wolfenstein&nbsp;</em>series is the latest in a string of video game-to-TV-series adaptations in recent years. Other successes on that front include <i><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/fallout-tv-show-proves-last-of-us-wasnt-fluke" rel="nofollow">Fallout</a>&nbsp;</i>(also made for Amazon), HBO's&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us</em>, and&nbsp;<em>League of Legends</em>' <i>Arcane</i>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/more-league-of-legends-shows-on-way" rel="nofollow">won't be the only&nbsp;<em>League&nbsp;</em>show soon enough</a>.</p>

<p>As well as these shows, plenty of as-yet-unadapted games are getting their own TV adaptations as well, including&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clash-of-clans-tv-show" rel="nofollow"><em>Clash of Clans</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/beyond-two-souls-tv-series" rel="nofollow"><em>Beyond: Two Souls</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-live-action-series-netflix-soon" rel="nofollow"><em>Assassin's Creed</em></a>.</p>
