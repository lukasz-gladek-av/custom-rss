            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I got a chance to get my hands on <em>Riftbound</em> earlier this year as I was invited to Riot HQ to test out some trial decks. I've dabbled in a lot of TCGs over the years, finding elements that I like and dislike about them, but I've never enjoyed one quite as much as <em>Riftbound</em> off the bat. As I dive into the Proving Grounds beginner set, the starter decks and deckbuilding, and playing the game I'll get into what makes this game such a strong contender.</p>

<h2>Your Cards Teach You Deckbuilding</h2>

<p>In talking about <em>Riftbound</em> and how to play the game we've got to talk about how the decks are made. Each Deck has a Legend, a two colored card that features a League of Legends Champion that will serve as the face of your deck. From there, you'll then also want a Champion Unit, normally the same League of Legends hero as another ambassador for your deck.</p>

<p>Your Legend will have an ability that can be accessed at any time, normally once a turn, while your Champion Unit is a Unit you can summon with the required Runes without having to worry about drawing it to your hand.</p>

<p>Hand of Noxus, Darius' Legend card, gives you an additional Rune as a Legion ability, while Lee Sin's Blind Monk, can buff a friendly unit. From here you can find all manner of other cards that will have Legion effects or allow for the spending of buffs.</p>

<p>It's in this way that as you create your deck based off the chosed Legend you're being taught by the game "This is how a deck using these cards will want to function, so you should continue to work with that mechanic." While loose, it's a basic framework that means even if you don't know all of the cards or the best strategies that you can start planning your own combos.</p>

Each deck will also include three different Battlefields, potential battle grounds that you'll be moving your units to and from during games of <em>Riftbound</em>, and 12 Rune cards (six of each color) that work as your ramping energy system for the game.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the cards that I was most short on opening booster packs was Runes. Each pack has 1, maybe 2, that to create a deck with 12 of the same colored Runes you'll need to hope that you open enough of a certain type. For a lot of my playtesting, I just pooled all of my Runes from Boosters, Proving Grounds, and Starter Decks together so that I'd have enough. There will definitely be a time where I don't need to do that… but that time is not now.</p>

<h2>Proving Grounds Is Where To Start</h2>

<p>If you're just interested in getting into <em>Riftbound</em>, Riot Games has created a box for up to four players. This is something a bit closer to a board game approach to Riftbound but works as a starter set with underpowered decks to hopefully keep scalpers away.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While this box was planned to be less desirable, it hasn't stopped a few cards, such as the Flash spell and the Master Yi and Annie Legends, from becoming very desirable.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Playing <em>Riftbound</em></h2>

<p><em>Riftbound</em> can be played with two to four players in pretty much any configuration from 1v1, to 2v2, and free for all. On each turn a player channels (draws) an additional two Runes, draws a card from their deck, and then can take any number of actions provided they're allowed to and they have the Runes to back it up.</p>

<p>Before the game is started Battlefields are put out on the table, these are zones that combat will take place in. Each player has a chance to contribute their own Battlefield as a way to potentially give themselves an additional advantage. Playing with friends, I never seemed to get to use my Battlefield and when a friend had a Battlefield that made use of Buffs (something my deck had none of) there was immediately an uphill battle to be had.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riftbound-origins-review-playing.jpg?itok=dZ6Su5y6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riftbound-origins-review-playing.jpg?itok=PboB3ki5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Players will summon Units to their field, activate Gear and Abilities, cast spells, or move their units from their base to a battlefield, resolve combat where necessary and pass their turn to the next player.</p>

<p>There are a lot of common aspects that you'll find in <em>Riftbound</em> if you're familiar with other TCGs: Units come out exhausted unless they have an ability to say otherwise, Runes create an energy that's accumulated to play cards etc.</p>

<p>The two major differences for <em>Riftbound</em> that I have really enjoyed are its Battlefields and the ramping Rune system.</p>

<p>When summoning a Unit you can normally only summon them to your base, which is a zone that's (normally) safe from your enemies. It's only when you start moving them out to the previously mentioned battlefields that they are at risk. Battlefields are where you earn points, so it's important to get Units out there, but the base lets you be more deliberate about when you do and don't want to engage in combat.</p>

I lost this battle</figcaption></figure><p>Playing in a free for all, being high on points but low on Units, I was able to look at my board and hand and know that I didn't have anything to make any power plays this turn but I was able to take two turns to focus on my base, filling it up with Units and abilities to then launch an assault later. When to move your characters up, and when to lie in wait, becomes a bit of a game of chicken waiting for the right time to strike.</p>

<p>The other feature that I really love from <em>Riftbound</em> is that your Runes are constantly accumulating. Each turn there's two more energy to be able to spend on more units of weaker strength, or you can gain access to far stronger units. This ramping guarantees there's no way you're stuck with nothing to do at any point in time, and better than that it always means there's escalation to the tempo of the game.</p>

<p>Round 1 and 2 are always one or two cards being played, and then passing on, while round 8 or 9 has you chaining together a variety of different abilities letting your Legend abilities truly shine.</p>

<p>There's an excitement that's inherent to pretty much every <em>Riftbound</em> game I have played as you get to see your opponent building up their abilities and you try to stop them.</p>

<p>As expected, <em>Riftbound</em> is facing current issues of pretty much every TCG, high resale and scalpers. It's not really something that can be avoided, and I definitely didn't think that Riot would have an answer, but it does make me worry about my own ability to enjoy the game outside of digital simulators.</p>

<p>As we go into Set 2: Spiritforged, already set to release in February of 2026, it will be interesting to see how the general public is able to get their hands on the product.</p>

<p>I do hope that we'll eventually see an official simulator, but for now I'm going to continue enjoying my time with the three decks that I was able to make from a Booster Box.</p>

<p>I'm a huge fan of <em>Riftbound</em>, everything that I enjoyed about playing it earlier this year is even better now that I'm able to be playing it with a wider variety of players and have more cards to craft decks out of.</p>

<p>I love how intuitive building a basic deck is, and how playing and refining it helps you continue to funnel towards what might be your 'perfect' deck. In addition to that I love how varied each of the different major abilities in the game are. Even when playing your own deck a number of times the way you need to respond to a trap player vs a ganking player is going to cause you to reconsider strategies at any point in the game.</p>

<p>I think what Riot Games has pulled off here is incredible, creating a fresh and quite unique TCG in what is a very busy space right now and it's almost terrifying to think with how many LoL champions out there how much room they have to continue growing.</p>
