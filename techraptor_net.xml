            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warmachine-shadows-and-scum-review-sneaky-villainy<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><i>Warmachine</i>, a tabletop wargame that initially came to life to focus on balanced and competitive gameplay, has been around since 2003 under Privateer Press, until last year when Steamforged Games announced that they had <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/steamforged-games-acquires-warmachine-and-whole-iron-kingdom-ip-0" rel="nofollow">bought the IP</a>. <em>Warmachine</em> had recently moved into a new edition of the rules, and SFG has continued to run with that, kicking off a <a href="https://steamforged.com/en-gb/blogs/brands/iron-kingdoms-manifesto-part1?srsltid=AfmBOoqbPX8-yaogfTtpMsWSffAvNYYnSy0vGEqaKdAeX5njSJbqbpHm" rel="nofollow">roadmap</a> of new and exciting releases. These releases started with a brand new 2-player starter set which we reviewed <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-review-metal-and-magic" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and in this article,&nbsp;we'll have a detailed look at a brand new starter set, <em>Warmachine</em> Shadows and Scum, featuring 2 very different factions from the first starter set.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-shadows-and-scum-2.jpg?itok=V369PE9E 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-shadows-and-scum-2.jpg?itok=Vqpo6Xbd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Metal and Magic</h2>

<p>Games of <em>Warmachine</em> begin with each player's selection of a Warcaster, a powerful mage that sets the tone for the rest of your army. While each faction has a distinct feel, the Warcaster you choose, each with a unique once-per-battle ability, can change how the force functions. Backing up the Warcaster are Warjacks, powerful metal constructs that pack a punch on the battlefield.&nbsp;Further supporting your Warcaster and Warjacks are Solos, individual warriors, and Units, groups of warriors, who flesh out the rest of your force</p>

<p>All of the rules and unit stats are available for free on the <a href="https://steamforged.com/en-gb/pages/warmachine-app" rel="nofollow"><em>Warmachine</em> app</a>, and we covered some of the cool mechanics in our <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-review-metal-and-magic" rel="nofollow">2-Player Starter Set review</a>, so check that out if you want to know more about <em>Warmachine</em>.</p>

<p>Like the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-review-metal-and-magic" rel="nofollow">Blood and Thunder</a> starter set before this, the Shadows and Scum box comes with 2 30-point forces, with a spread across unit types to give new players a look at how they play. This time though, the forces are led by Warlocks (rather than Warcasters) and contain a Warbeast (rather than Warjack). Warlocks/Warcasters and Warjacks/Warbeasts are different in name only and use fury rather than focus. This harks back to the days when Warmachine and Hordes were sold as different systems, sharing the same rules, but are now combined into just Warmachine. Both forces also have 2 solo units (rather than the single solo in Blood and Thunder), and all the miniatures are still Cadre for their respective factions,&nbsp;which means they can be used across all forces in the faction.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As before, this starter set only contains miniatures for the 2 forces; all the rules and unit cards are on the <em>Warmachine</em> app. If you want to use this set straight away, you'll also have to have some 6-sided dice, a measuring tool and some tokens. The box does make this clear, and this is similar to many other systems now, taking their rules almost entirely digital.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;Khymaera troops in Shadows and Scum are the&nbsp;Shard Nocturnes, elite and stealthy killers led by&nbsp;Vallyx, Fateâ€™s Eclipse. Vallyx gives all friendly Shard Noctures the Flying High ability, which means that all attacks against them suffer -3 range, which reduces the range threat as they close the distance with their enemies. Vallyx's feat also makes all friendly hits within their control range Critical Hits, which means you can set up a pretty devastating round of combat. Vallyx is backed up by the warbeast Akylss, who can deploy a caustic mist to cover the Shard Nocturnes advance. Akylss has a corrosive ranged and melee attack, that gains an additional dice against construct and undead enemies.</p>

The stealthy Shades are the Shard Nocture's unit, and they gain an additional dice on attacks and damage against character models. Along with a high threat range due to reposition and unpredictable movement abilities, they can strike straight for the enemy leader.</p>

<p>The Shard Nocturnes like to make fast, explosive plays for the enemy leader, with several of their units stealthily advancing with boosted attacks and threat ranges.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Foulblood's Armada is the Southern Kriels army in the Shadows and Scum box, led by Commodore Foulblood himself. Foulbood has some great overlapping abilities with Battle Plan: Open Bar, which gives any friendly units Stumbling Drunk, which means they can't be knocked down, then as a Feat, Foulblood can use Happy Hour, which gives all units that are Stumbling Drunk, +3 armor for the turn. Foulblood's shoulder-mounted monkey also reduces enemy melee attacks by 2. Foulblood is backed up by the huge Chum, who has incredible healing with D3 wounds whenever they activate, and also D3 wounds if it boxes a living model and removes it from play. They also have critical consume rules on their Great Maw attack, which allows them to remove a small model from a critical hit.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-shadows-and-scum-7.jpg?itok=GG0g1f37 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-shadows-and-scum-7.jpg?itok=s5_SUEjh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Foulblood's Armarda are supported by 2 solos, Sully a flying albatross who drops explosives from the sky, with a fantastically thematic Albatross special rule that gives all enemies -1 to attack and damage rolls for the remainder of the turn when Sully is taken out, and Mr Bogs, who's adept at taking out enemy warbeasts, and who's massive rifle pushes both them away from their target, and their target directly away from them when hit. The 3 model unit, the Lochabash Brothers round out the force, who can charge into combat, and if grouped together can get up to +4 on damage rolls, then side step out of combat, and with snap fire, can fire twice if they take out an enemy with their first ranged attack.</p>

<p>Foulblood's Armada are pretty hard-hitting. Bunching up and smashing into enemies gives them boosts to attacks and defense, supported by Sully dropping fire from the skies, and Mr Bogs softening up the larger enemies.</p>

<h2>Warmachine Shadows and Scum Final Thoughts?</h2>

<p>Both of the 2 new Cadres in <em>Warmachine</em> Shadows and Scum offer interesting playstyles, very different from those in Blood and Thunder. The Shard Nocturnes like to stealthily work their way up, and make explosive and often devastating assassination attempts, whereas Foulblood's Armarda are solid in both ranged and melee attacks and like to smash into combat together, benefitting from overlapping buffs. Both factions are set up for new players, with 30-point forces with a variety of different units. The cadre rules also allow them to be used in any force of their faction beyond this box as well. While both forces have less straightforward playstyles than some, they're fairly easy to pilot, but there are still several rules to keep track of for new players.</p>

<p>As with Blood and Thunder, this set is just miniatures, as the rules and stats are all available for free on the <em>Warmachine</em> app and you will have to add a couple of accessories (dice, measuring tool, and tokens) to get playing, but once you have those, getting started with Shadows and Scum is easy.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/forteller-games-announces-sunset-ttrpg-about-confronting-and-processing-death<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A TTRPG studio has announced a new project. Forteller Games, a company mostly known for creating immersive audio material for games like Gloomhaven, has announced <em>Sunset</em>, a TTRPG tackling the heavy subject matter of death.</p>

<h2>The Sunset TTRPG Announcement</h2>

<p>According to a press release, <em>Sunset</em> is the first TTRPG being developed by Forteller Games. In <em>Sunset</em>, players, known in the game as Threads, are actively facing their deaths through a process called Life Review.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sunset-ttrpg-thread-artwork.jpg?itok=2Trb0qbZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sunset-ttrpg-thread-artwork.jpg?itok=xwsMpsXL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The Death Master guides these Threads through a series of pivotal memories of their life. If the Threads want to parlay with Death to get more time in life, they must unweave lies within these memories.</p>

<p>The game is a rules-lite experience utilizing the Deck of Many Dice. Each game is played in a series of memory locations called a Weave. This Weave is made collaboratively by the players and the Death Master. These Weaves can be anything from bustling cities to quiet meadows to anything in between.</p>

<p>Players draw cards from the deck to determine the outcome of their actions. Alternatively, actions can be resolved with a pool of D4s and D6s.</p>

<p>Despite the intense subject matter, <em>Sunset</em> is described as a hope-punk experience. It has explicit content warnings regarding death, violence, and the human psyche, but creators Michael Tomasek, Adam Lehenbauer, and Thomas St. Pierre state the intended feeling of the game is hope in the face of challenges and a counter to pessimism.</p>

<p>The design team also contains strong industry talent. The writing team includes Sebastian Yue (<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/pathfinder" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Pathfinder</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/brandon-sandersons-cosmere-rpg-kickstarter-raised-5-million-in-one-day" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Cosmere RPG</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-daggerheart-miniseries-announced-featuring-age-of-umbra-campaign-frame" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Daggerheart</em></a>), Kage Freudigmann, Omnis Strader (<em>Paragons: The Roleplaying Game</em>), and Alicia Marie (<em>Idle Champions of the Forgotten Realms</em>).</p>

<p>If you are curious about the tone and gameplay mechanics of <em>Sunset</em>, the Quickstart Rules are available on <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/499582/sunset-quickstart" rel="nofollow">DrivethruRPG</a> for free in PDF format. The game will be released sometime next year through a Kickstarter campaign.</p>
