            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alan-wake-2-profitable-sales-2m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remedy Entertainment has announced that&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</em>is finally profitable, having recouped its development costs and marketing fees by the end of last year.</p>

<p>According to a new financial <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/inderes-widgets-prod-assets/remedy/attachments/6930dba3-2c3f-41a3-a596-8933ce7c454b/remedy-q4-fy-2024-financial-statement-release.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a> covering the full 2024 fiscal year, not only is&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</em>profitable, but it had also exceeded two million sales at the close of 2024, meaning it's picked up <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alan-wake-2-sales-control-2-action-rpg" rel="nofollow">another 200,000 sales or so since November</a>.</p>

<p>Back in April 2024, Remedy reported that&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alan-wake-2-budget-remedy-financials" rel="nofollow">still hadn't earned back its budget</a>, although the studio said it had "recouped a significant part" of its expenses (stopping short of elaborating on exactly how much).</p>

Hurrah!</figcaption></figure><p>The game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-q3-financials-alan-wake-2" rel="nofollow">inching closer towards profitability</a> as of November, at which point Remedy reported that it had earned back "most" of its development and marketing costs. That leads us to the present moment and&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2</em>'s final crossing of that all-important finish line.</p>

<p>In terms of finances, Remedy says its revenue jumped by 49.3% in 2024 when compared to the previous year, although the company hasn't had a profitable year overall.</p>

<p>That could well be down to the fact that Remedy hasn't released any major games this year (although it did launch two DLC packs for&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2</em>), as well as the company's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-control-franchise-rights" rel="nofollow">acquisition of the rights to&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em>from former owner 505 Games</a> back in February last year.</p>

<p>With regards to the fourth quarter of 2024, Remedy says its revenue increased compared to last year's fourth quarter, although once again, profits are down compared to the same period the year prior.</p>

<p><em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>is still on track to launch this year, while&nbsp;<em>Control 2&nbsp;</em>entered full production earlier this month and the&nbsp;<em>Max Payne&nbsp;</em>remakes are "making steady progress". Neither of the latter two have release dates yet, unfortunately.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crytek-layoffs-hunt-showdown</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hunt-showdown-developer-crytek-lays-off-15-of-staff.1106643/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crytek-layoffs-hunt-showdown<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Crysis&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown&nbsp;</em>developer Crytek has laid off around 60 employees, citing the same "complex, unfavorable market dynamics" that have claimed jobs across many of the studio's peers in recent months.</p>

<p>Speaking <a href="https://x.com/Crytek/status/1889623029723885913" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on X</a>, Crytek says it isn't "immune" to said market conditions, confirming that it's laying off "an estimated 15% of [its] around 400 employees". Layoffs at the studio will, Crytek says, "affect development teams and shared services".</p>

<p>According to Crytek, development on the upcoming next installment in the&nbsp;<em>Crysis&nbsp;</em>series was put on indefinite hold in the third quarter of last year, and since then, the studio has been "trying to shift developers over" to <em>Hunt: Showdown 1896</em>, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hunt-showdown-sequel-esrb-leak-rumor" rel="nofollow">updated relaunch of PvPvE shooter&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown</em></a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/crytek-layoffs-hunt-showdown-1896.jpg?itok=wnfgg6G1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/crytek-layoffs-hunt-showdown-1896.jpg?itok=9_5WvrSp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Crytek is moving developers off the indefinitely-delayed&nbsp;<em>Crysis 4&nbsp;</em>and onto&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown 1896</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Despite these efforts and <em>Hunt: Showdown 1896</em>'s continued growth, Crytek says it "cannot continue as before and remain financially sustainable". The studio says it first explored other avenues for cost reduction before determining that layoffs were "inevitable to move forward".</p>

<p>Affected employees will, according to Crytek, receive "severance packages and career assistance services".</p>

<p>Crytek finishes its statement by reaffirming its belief in&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown 1896</em>, confirming that it remains "fully committed" to the game's continuing "operation". If you're playing&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown 1896&nbsp;</em>right now, it sounds like you don't need to worry about the game being affected by these layoffs.</p>

<p>Crytek's round of layoffs are the latest in a long line of staff cuts, studio closures, and project cancellations in the last year or two. Big companies like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-layoffs-january-2025" rel="nofollow">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Sony</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-interactive-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Take-Two</a> have been affected, alongside <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/piranha-bytes-shut-down-report" rel="nofollow">plenty</a> of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/midnight-society-shutdown-dr-disrespect" rel="nofollow">smaller studios</a>.</p>

<p>Instead, it's going all-in on&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown 1896</em>, so let's hope that game continues to see success in the future. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things industry-related.</p>
