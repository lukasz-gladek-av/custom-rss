            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remedy has officially unveiled&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>'s Breakpoint update, and it comes complete with a ton of seismic changes to the first-person shooter, although whether they can turn its fortunes around remains to be seen.</p>

<p>Back in July, Remedy <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fbc-firebreak-whats-next" rel="nofollow">promised</a> that it would release&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>'s first big update in September, and the studio has made good on that promise; Breakpoint launches on September 29th (that's this coming Monday at time of writing).</p>

<p>According to Remedy, Breakpoint is "packed with systemic overhauls, new content, and quality-of-life improvements" with a view towards making&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>"more fun, varied, and rewarding to play".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fbc-firebreak-breakpoint-update-monster.jpg?itok=xXi0Afvl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fbc-firebreak-breakpoint-update-monster.jpg?itok=CdHCAshj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>FBC: Firebreak</em>'s Breakpoint update aims to turn the game's fortunes around on Monday.</figcaption></figure><p>Breakpoint's first big addition to&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>is the Crisis Board, which will replace the Job Board and offer "curated playable content" in order to make the shooter "feel more dynamic, less predictable, and closer to the first-responder fantasy" Remedy intends.</p>

<p>The Crisis Board will show you situations emerging around the Oldest House, and you'll be expected to respond to them; after all, Remedy says, you should be "reacting to dynamic, unpredictable dangers" rather than "being asked to create danger for yourself".</p>

<p>You can also expect a brand new tutorial mission by the name of Orientation, which will be "accompanied by onboarding improvements across the game", so if you felt a bit lost when you jumped into&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>, this should hopefully improve that experience.</p>

<p>There are a ton of other huge changes coming to&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>as part of this update as well, so if you want to know everything that's changing, be sure to check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540/view/530984095140809426" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">full announcement right here</a>.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>, it's a multiplayer-oriented first-person shooter set in&nbsp;<em>Control</em>'s Oldest House. You play a member of the titular Firebreak team, and it's your job to contain a range of bizarre supernatural threats within the Federal Bureau of Control.</p>

<p>The game launched back in June to a mixed reception, and player numbers have dwindled significantly since launch according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2272540/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> (although&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>is also available on both PS Plus and Game Pass, for which I don't have player data).</p>

<p>Remedy itself <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-fbc-firebreak-launch-sales-financials" rel="nofollow">admitted back in August</a> that launch sales of&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>had been disappointing, but the studio described the game as having a "solid" foundation and expressed optimism that it could turn the shooter's fortunes around. Breakpoint is, presumably, the first step in that effort.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2272540/FBC_Firebreak/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/fbc-firebreak/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/fbc-firebreak/9PDCN8Z4HKRN" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and it's available as part of certain tiers of PS Plus and Game Pass as well.

            <title><![CDATA[Forza Horizon 6 Officially Revealed, and It's Coming to PS5 Too]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/forza-horizon-6-revealed-ps5</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/forza-horizon-6-officially-revealed-and-its-coming-to-ps5-too.1308693/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Xbox has officially announced&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 6</em>, the next installment in the&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon&nbsp;</em>series of simcade racers, and as well as PC and Xbox, the game will also be coming to PS5.</p>

<p><em>Forza Horizon 6&nbsp;</em>was unveiled during Xbox's spot at the Tokyo Game Show, so it feels particularly appropriate that the game will take players to Japan as its setting. The trailer shows off a number of Japanese accouterments, including a maneki-neko and a katakana license plate.</p>

<p>We didn't learn too much more about the game during the initial announcement, but we do know that after launching on PC and Xbox Series X|S in 2026,&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 6&nbsp;</em>will be coming to PlayStation 5. Whether it'll be available on Sony's console next year, however, remains to be seen.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/forza-horizon-6-announcement-forza-horizon-5.jpg?itok=NmC_VKte 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/forza-horizon-6-announcement-forza-horizon-5.jpg?itok=fZ7s6dvn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>After&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 5&nbsp;</em>took us to Mexico,&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 6&nbsp;</em>will take place in Japan.</figcaption></figure><p>The next&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon&nbsp;</em>game is just the latest in a string of Xbox titles to make their way to PlayStation; it follows the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gears-of-war-reloaded-announced" rel="nofollow"><em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-ps5-release-date-enhancements" rel="nofollow"><em>Senua's Saga: Hellblade II</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sea-of-thieves-grounded-and-pentiment-officially-announced-for-playstation-platforms" rel="nofollow"><em>Sea of Thieves</em></a>, among others.</p>

<p>It's not just Xbox crossing the divide, though; Sony is also reciprocating (to a degree, at least), since popular live-service shooter&nbsp;<em>Helldivers II&nbsp;</em>was released for Xbox Series X|S <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-xbox-series-xs-august" rel="nofollow">on the same day</a> as&nbsp;<em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em>'s launch.</p>

<h2>What else did Xbox reveal at Tokyo Game Show?</h2>

<p>It's not just&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 6&nbsp;</em>that Xbox showed off during its Tokyo Game Show spot. We also got to see what else the studio is up to, including new trailers for&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>,&nbsp;<em>007: First Light</em>, and a first reveal for&nbsp;<em>Gungrave Gore Blood Heat</em>, a remake of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/gungrave-gore" rel="nofollow">the 2022 shooter</a>.</p>

<p>IO Interactive also revealed a brand new mission for&nbsp;<em>Hitman: World of Assassination&nbsp;</em>during the show, and it'll star none other than legendary Chinese martial artist and actor Bruce Lee, whom you must protect as he infiltrates a high-stakes martial arts tournament.</p>




<p>If you want a full rundown of everything Xbox announced during the show, you can <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/09/25/xbox-tokyo-game-show-broadcast-recap-everything-announced/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">check it out right here</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hoyoverse-petit-planet-cozy-life-sim</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hoyoverse-officially-reveals-cosmic-life-sim-petit-planet-closed-beta-signups-now-open.1308663/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>studio HoYoverse has officially unveiled&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet</em>, and it is indeed the studio's first foray into cozy gaming, with closed beta signups available now if you want to get a chance to try it out.</p>

<p>We got our first glimpse of&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet&nbsp;</em>earlier this week when HoYoverse <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hoyoverse-petit-planet-teaser" rel="nofollow">updated the game's socials</a>, and just as expected, a full reveal wasn't far behind. In a press release, the studio describes its new game as a "cosmic life simulation" that "blends the joy of creation, discovery, and community-oriented experiences".</p>

<p>In&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet</em>, you'll nurture your very own planet, tending to its ecosystem and shaping it as you see fit. As you play, you'll form a galaxy "by connecting with different planets scattered across the starry sky".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/petit-planet-announced-flower.jpg?itok=xwolBn44 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/petit-planet-announced-flower.jpg?itok=K-xQ9vCY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Petit Planet&nbsp;</em>represents HoYoverse's first foray into cozy gaming.</figcaption></figure><p>The game will feature a variety of the kinds of activities you'd probably expect from a cozy game, like fishing, mining, and cooking, as well as "beachcombing" and "harvest[ing] exotic crops".</p>

<p>It looks like you'll also be able to fill up your planet with&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing</em>-style Neighbors, who will move in and populate your little corner of the galaxy. You can also build connections with these Neighbors and form relationships with them "through heartfelt conversations, thoughtful gift exchanges, and unique interactions".</p>

<p>You'll also be able to venture beyond your planet by visiting the Galactic Bazaar, described as "an ever-bustling social hub where conversations spark over coffee" and you can meet other players to forge friendships with them.</p>

<p>You can take a look at the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Petit Planet&nbsp;</em>right here. It should give you a good sense of what you can expect when HoYoverse's cozy game eventually lands on our planet.</p>




<p><em>Petit Planet&nbsp;</em>is coming to PC and mobile devices, although HoYoverse says "additional platforms [are] currently in development". You can sign up for a chance to check out the closed beta <a href="https://planet.hoyoverse.com/en-us/home" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Pokemon TCG Pocket Deluxe Pack ex Set Brings a New Shine to Old Cards]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-deluxe-pack-ex</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pokemon-tcg-pocket-deluxe-pack-ex-set-brings-a-new-shine-to-old-cards.1308615/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has announced the next major&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>expansion set, and this one works a little differently to the others.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/uk/pokemon-news/deluxe-pack-ex-is-coming-to-pokemon-tcg-pocket" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a>, the&nbsp;<em>Deluxe Pack ex&nbsp;</em>expansion is coming on September 29th, and unlike previous&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-wisdom-of-sea-and-sky-expansion" rel="nofollow">expansions</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-secluded-springs-booster-pack" rel="nofollow">booster packs</a>, it looks like you won't find any brand new cards contained within this one.</p>

<p>Instead,&nbsp;<em>Deluxe Pack ex&nbsp;</em>will introduce new booster packs that are guaranteed to contain one card from previous expansions (<em>Genetic Apex&nbsp;</em>through&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-wisdom-of-sea-and-sky-expansion" rel="nofollow"><em>Wisdom of Sea and Sky</em></a>) with a four-diamond rarity rating or higher.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-deluxe-pack-ex-cards.jpg?itok=CXCostXN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-deluxe-pack-ex-cards.jpg?itok=jjHLJwit 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>'s new expansion puts a fresh spin on old classics.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as offering up guaranteed high-rarity cards from previous expansions,&nbsp;<em>Deluxe Pack ex&nbsp;</em>will also feature brand new art for several older cards, including new full-art designs for cards that previously didn't have them.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to being able to "collect 'parallel foil' cards with a unique shine effect", according to The Pokemon Company, as well as a new Raichu ex drop event that will occur during the period in which&nbsp;<em>Deluxe Pack ex&nbsp;</em>is available.</p>

<p>That's right: this isn't a permanent expansion. The Pokemon Company says you'll be able to grab packs from&nbsp;<em>Deluxe Pack ex&nbsp;</em>until October 30th, at which point they'll be removed. However, the trailer does promise that these packs will be available again at some point in the future.</p>

<p>You can check out the trailer for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Deluxe Pack ex&nbsp;</em>expansion right here. It shows off some of the new art for existing cards, as well as some gorgeous ex designs.</p>




<p>News of the latest&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>expansion comes after The Pokemon Company promised Mega Evolution would make its way to the mobile card game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mega-evolution-fall" rel="nofollow">sometime this fall</a>; presumably, it'll be part of the next expansion set after&nbsp;<em>Deluxe Pack ex</em>.</p>

<p>In the meantime, however,&nbsp;<em>Deluxe Pack ex&nbsp;</em>launches on September 29th and runs until October 30th. You can download&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>right now for free on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.pokemon.pokemontcgp&amp;hl=en_GB" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pok%C3%A9mon-tcg-pocket/id6479970832" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">iOS</a> devices.</p>
