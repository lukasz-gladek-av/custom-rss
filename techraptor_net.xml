            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/den-of-wolves-preview-welcome-to-machine<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s been a little over a year since we last checked in with 10 Chambers, creators of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/gtfo-rundown-80-preview-youre-already-dead" rel="nofollow"><em>GTFO</em></a>. While we’ve been away, they’ve been hard at work on their next project – <em>Den of Wolves</em>, an all-new co-op shooter that calls back to the studio’s heist game roots when their founders worked on projects like the original <em>Payday</em>.</p>

<p>While <em>Den of Wolves</em> was announced towards the end of 2023, we’re only now just getting to see how it’s shaped up in the time since then. 10 Chambers has called it the game they “must make”, and all of this is coming together through gameplay, its themes, and design philosophies.</p>

<p><em>Den of Wolves</em> is set in a dystopian near-future place called Midway City – one controlled by corporations, and where the player will work as a criminal for hire as they engage in industrial espionage, sabotage, and assassinations to help rival companies.</p>

<p>Much of <em>Den of Wolves</em> centers on traditional first-person gunplay, but there’s also an all-new mechanic called “Dive”, which lets players hack into human neural networks with unique gameplay elements.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/den-of-wolves-screenshot-012.jpg?itok=zngtdmHW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/den-of-wolves-screenshot-012.jpg?itok=7Nls8EfT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>With a focus on strategic planning in play, <em>Den of Wolves</em> blends stealth and action in a way we haven’t quite seen before.</p>

<p>We were able to preview some select missions from <em>Den of Wolves</em>, which still doesn’t have a release date, but will be available on Early Access when it launches in the future. That said, the preview was largely focused on two missions that helped draw up a picture of what players can look forward to in the full release.</p>

<p>For the first part, four of us gathered up together, meeting in a traditional load-out screen where you select weapons and what kind of tools you want to use for the mission. There’s a selection of guns, knives, and other supplies like shields – the latter especially will come in handy later.</p>

<p>So with weapons in hand, the first smaller mission we attempted involved getting some supplies, and a drone that will be important at some point in the future.</p>

<p>A lot of the level design here feels like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/gtfo-review" rel="nofollow"><em>GTFO</em></a> – you’ll go in, take out stationed enemies with stealth or force, and then meet up at scanning points to continue. There are also vaults that can be opened using drill tools, and it’s important to keep an eye on these because they do need to be repaired once in a while as they go.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/den-of-wolves-screenshot-001.jpg?itok=M8ELpEMj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/den-of-wolves-screenshot-001.jpg?itok=RwOsTElr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The co-op nature of these missions comes into focus here too because you’ll want to coordinate what everyone is doing – especially when there’s some enemies that can detect you with proximity, or when you’re in the middle of scanning and there’s a rush of enemies, you’ll need to take them out efficiently.</p>

<p>Once we’d obtained the drone, it was on to the next, bigger mission we’d get to see in <em>Den of Wolves</em>. For this we actually took a step back in the real world and planned out this mission on a scale map to work out how each of us was going to work during the heist.</p>

<p>Our first idea was to split up. The mission would have us find a set of three keys randomly inside three different vaults. Then we’d meet up and blast some windows out for an eventual escape, whilst also fighting off enemies and then getting to the whole Dive portion of the game.</p>

<p>We gave it a go, and after getting into the vault building through some nefarious means, we executed the plan. Two of us took the upstairs floor, and two of us went to the floor below. While we were starting to collect our keys, however, we came under fire, and the team ended up regrouping but ultimately dying and failing the mission because we weren’t equipped well enough.</p>

<p>But <em>Den of Wolves</em> encourages trying again, so that we did, and this time we decided to go around to each vault as the whole lot of us, break down those vaults and get the keys quickly. We also grabbed enough shields in the load-out screen to get us through some tough firefights.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/den-of-wolves-screenshot-006.jpg?itok=1p9AMfGm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/den-of-wolves-screenshot-006.jpg?itok=MYQUmRTZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>Den of Wolves</em>’ unique mechanic, the Dive system, came into play during the part of the mission where we had to hold our ground. This neural link counts down three separate times, and all four of us are seemingly transported into a virtual world where the goal is to get to the end.</p>

<p>It’s not as easy as going from point A to point B, however. The gravity is abnormal, and perspective can change after a single jump. There’s platforming too, and it can get tricky to time with all of that considered.</p>

<p>There is a bit of leniency, though, as only one person needs to scan in at the end of the map. There is a countdown, so you can’t stay in there forever.</p>

<p>It’s all fairly hectic and again, it’s why communicating with your team can be the difference between success and failure. We did manage to complete the mission, and it really did feel like the perfect taste of what’s to come in <em>Den of Wolves</em>.</p>

<p>For those looking for a deep co-op challenge or just want to have fun with some heist gameplay, it’s certainly one to watch, whenever it gets around to releasing.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fall-guys-ranked-knockout-is-real-and-its-here.1151100/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fall-guys-ranked-knockout<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mediatonic has officially added a&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys&nbsp;</em>Ranked Knockout mode to its wacky 3D platformer, and while that might sound a bit like an April Fools' joke, make no mistake; the ranked mode is very real.</p>

<p>The new mode was revealed in <a href="https://www.fallguys.com/en-US/news/fall-guys-ranked-knockout" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys&nbsp;</em>website earlier today. It might sound like a ranked mode for a game as silly and light-hearted as&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys&nbsp;</em>is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/april-fools-day-2025-gaming-roundup" rel="nofollow">a gag</a>, but I headed into the game earlier to check, and it's absolutely a real mode you can try out right now.</p>

<p>In the post, Mediatonic confirms there are eight ranks to rise through in Ranked Knockout: Rookie, Contender, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Ace, Star, and Superstar. You'll begin as a Rookie, and the better you perform in each round, the more you'll climb the ranked ladder.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fall-guys-ranked-knockout-platforming.jpg?itok=LA9tIkqQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fall-guys-ranked-knockout-platforming.jpg?itok=aOJnNUxa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fall Guys&nbsp;</em>Ranked Knockout is very real, apparently.</figcaption></figure><p>Like other competitive games,&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys&nbsp;</em>will divide its ranked play into seasons, or Cycles. Each Cycle will last eight weeks, and at the conclusion of the Cycle, you'll get rewards based on your performance.</p>

<p>If you belong to one of the first four ranks, you can't lose points, but once you get into Gold, subpar performance will see points deducted from your overall score, meaning you'll be demoted and have to work your way back up again.</p>

<p>Getting into the upper echelons will reward you with a special Emoticon, and if you get to the top two Star or Superstar ranks, you'll get a Supreme Idol Costume to show everyone else just how great you are at&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys</em>.</p>




<p>Ranks will, of course, be reset every eight weeks, and Mediatonic says it's "on the lookout for any suspicious behavior" when it comes to cheating. Not only that, but matchmaking will be "fair" and will "place you against players as close to your current rank as possible".</p>

<p>You can check out Ranked Knockout right now in&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys</em>, which is free to play on <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/fall-guys" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/fall-guys-ultimate-knockout/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/fall-guys/9pmxh5249dg5" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/fall-guys-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/sam-riegel-talks-wildmount-wildlings-beau-and-yashas-adoption-plans-and-campers<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We've only just seen the close of Critical Role Season 3, some entertaining sponsored games related to the world of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c9d86c47-b86e-43a2-bfe0-a023f6d37eee" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-story-attempting-to-hit-word-limit" rel="nofollow"><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em></a> and <em>Suikoden</em>, but Critical Role fans are in luck because this week we go back to Exandria. Sam Riegel is the GM for <a href="https://critrole.com/wildemount-wildlings/" rel="nofollow">Wildmount Wildlings</a>, a new adventure following Veth, Yasha, and Beau as they attempt to help some troubled campers earn some badges.</p>

<p>Ahead of the shows release on <strong>April 3rd</strong>, 10th, and 17th at <strong>6pm Pacific</strong> I got to sit down with the GM and Camp Director Sam Riegel to hear what it was like to bring his home game back to the public, where this game picks up, and what level of "rules lite, entertainment heavy" gameplay we can expect.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"That's what the Wildmount Wildlings is, it's a camp"</p>
</blockquote>
<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed//rCzXUz8UyRQ"></iframe></p>

<p>To give a brief recap of what led to the Wildmount Wildlings Riegel explained "In Campaign 2 of Critical Role Nott The Brave/Veth Brennato retired from adventuring to open a summer camp for adventuring kids. Ever since then she's been running this camp with her family."</p>

<p>Riegel explained that he's been using Veth's post-campaign story to run a game of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3579fb91-ffa9-4c99-a750-de9f92ba642f" href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow"><em>D&amp;D</em></a> at home for his children and their friends as they're campers. "They all play campers, and they learn stuff and go on adventures. Sometimes on weekend breaks they go off and explore Wildemount and it's been a lot of fun".</p>

<p>I asked him about what decision led to bringing a part of Exandria that he's taken home and made himself back to the public's eye with this mini-series. The answer came in two parts "Everything we've ever done at Critical Role starts from a place of us wanting to have fun, and us playing games". He referenced the origins of Critical Role and how <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a49b5305-f71e-4b04-a989-6db6823aa8cc" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/critical-role-and-legend-of-vox-machina-s3-cast-discuss-changing-story" rel="nofollow">Vox Machina</a> began as a home game between friends. "It just felt natural to take some of the fun that I've been having at home and put it up on Beacon, and Twitch, and YouTube for our fans to see."</p>

<p>The second part of his answer referencing the business side of Critical Role as he stated "also we're between campaigns right now, we finished Campaign 3 and frankly we need stuff to put on on Thursday night and Marisha (Ray) has been amazing at programming some really great one-shots and mini-series and specials that have been airing and this just felt like a good one to throw up there and it's within our world and it's a different take on our content and we thought it would be really fun"</p>

<h2>Where in time is Wildmount Wildlings?</h2>

<p>"Right at the end of Campaign 3 Yasha and Beau were talking about what they were going to do next and I think they mentioned something about taking some time off, maybe visiting Veth at her camp, or at least taking some time off to explore and so Wildmount Wildlings, our little 3-episode series, picks up right after the events of Campaign 3 and Yasha and Beau are going to come to the camp, partly for vacation, but partly to check out what it's like to hang out with kids"</p>

<p>This did lead to a question about Yasha and Beau's other current objective, to figure out if they want to adopt a child yet, when asked if we'd be seeing them consider adopting one of these campers Riegel explained "Beau and Yasha have been debating whether to have kids, or if they're ready to be parents"</p>

<p>"I think this little three shot is a way for them to figure out where they are in their life, if they're ready for kids, what kind of parents they would be, and to work out some stuff with each other." Riegel compared it to the real life conversations that many couples have to go through when they're growing up together</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"This will be [Beau and Yasha's] opportunity to have that conversation and for the audience to get a glimpse at it"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Knowing that this session was taking place after the level 20 party of The Mighty Nein took on the Weave Mind on Ruidus I did ask about how the party balance worked between seasoned adventurers and literal children.</p>

<p>"The kids are all level 1, all the kids in the O.L.G.A Cabin (Oops, Let's Go Again) are outcasts. They're underperforming kids, they need a little extra help. Beau and Yasha are being brought in to give them a little bit of tough love, almost like a scared straight program to whip them into shape so that they can advance up a level"</p>

<p>"Beau and Yasha are terribly overpowered, and could mop the floor with these kids, however Veth as a good counsellor and also Sam Riegel as a decent GM comes up with ways to nerf them so that they are a little bit less powerful"</p>

<h2>Building A World With A Childs Eye</h2>

<p>Riegel explained that when this idea was first drafted there were early thoughts to have kids be the players, "we quickly decided that that wasn't a good idea because our channel is very dirty, we have a lot of adult themes." Instead though the adventure, including monsters that the party will face, were created with the input of Riegel's children and their friends that are part of his homegame.</p>

<p>"We had these brainstorming sessions with these kids where they came up with monsters, encounters, traps, NPCs that Beau and Yasha and the campers are going to meet. Not only did we have this pitch session but you're actually going to get to see those pitch sessions."</p>

<p>When asking for clarification if those sessions would be Beacon exclusive Riegel clarified "I believe they're going to be part of the episodes. You're going to see at the beginning of each episode kids coming up with the encounters for each episode. Later when you see the monster you'll know exactly where it's coming from"</p>

<p>Moving on to talk about the cast of campers for this season – Eden Riegel (<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2b75fcbb-a1e5-4678-ad54-cccd2ebfde56" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/crash-bandicoot-4-its-about-time-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Crash Bandicoot 4</em></a>), Aleks Le (<em>Solo Leveling</em>), Brennan Lee Mulligan (<em>EXU: Calamity, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b6ff64e2-0570-485e-860b-402771d3faf6" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/we-chat-dimension-20-burrows-end-generational-trauma-and-environmental" rel="nofollow">Dimension 20</a></em>), Libe Barer (<em>Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur, Sneaky Pete</em>) – I asked about how it was having family at the table.</p>

<p>"I've been wanting to get Eden involved in one of our shows for years now and schedules haven't aligned. But because this is my game I get to do what I want. Eden has not played a lot of <em>D&amp;D</em>, in fact this is the second time she ever played. The first time was a week earlier when she came over to my house and I taught her how to play"</p>

<p>Riegel explained that aside from Brennan Lee Mulligan, who has obviously played a lot of <em>D&amp;D</em> and TTRPGs, all of the other campers are very very new to tabletop roleplaying games. "They've either only played once, or not at all."</p>

<p>"It worked great. As level 1 campers at a camp where they're supposed to be learning about their powers it works great that they don't really know what they're doing. It fit in beautifully."</p>

<p>Riegel explained that Mulligan being an "expert in all things tabletop roleplaying" his character was able to help the other campers along.</p>

<h2>Who Are The Campers?</h2>

<p>I didn't get too much information about the campers of the O.L.G.A cabin but Riegel was able to share that "they're all between the ages of 14-16, they're all the lowest rank at the camp which is called Dainty Feet." He didn't want to spoil their introductions but that they're newly coming into their powers.</p>

<p>He referenced mages having trouble casting their spells, a rogue who isn't good at stealing or attacking."Over the course of these three episodes they sort of figure it out, or at least try to."</p>

<p>Talking about the ranks at cap Riegel began to explain that by obtaining these badges they'll work to achieve the Three Below rank.</p>

<p>Riegel talked further about the world of Wildmount Wildlings that he's build up. "For the home game I have the campgrounds set, there's different areas of the camp that I identify that the players know about that they can go to."</p>

<p>"I developed camp counsellors, other camp cabins, other campers who my kids have met, and definitely spots around the campground that they either need to avoid or that they can go interact with."</p>

<p>Listing off some of these locations Riegel told me about "the 'Do Not Hike' trail, the Hubbub Hub where they meet for camp meetings, the Gross which is the cafeteria and Phyllis the Centaur lunch lady, Salmon Lake which has no salmon in it, it's just a disgusting lake that's the color of salmon."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"There's all kinds of spots that my kids are familiar with and now our audience and these campers will also be familiar with too"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the show they also had artwork developed to better define the look of the setting, a camp map, and new creations. One of these was a curfew creature that "is so adorable and weird and so I'm going to bring that into the home game."</p>

<h2>A setting for your own home games</h2>

<p>Riegel's hope for Wildmount Wildlings, a setting that he created for his kids, is that "people watch these episodes and can maybe set their own home game for their kids in this camp. It would be so cool if other people around the world were playing set in this weird camp that my kids play in"</p>

<p>Before we hit our time limit I wanted to know what Riegel really wanted to make sure the audience knew coming into this three-parter. "I hope it's going to be a fun time, as many people know who have watched me GM before, I'm Rules Lite and Entertainment Heavy. You'll see me flounder a bit as I try to remember rules, and I even turn to Brennan Lee Mulligan a few times and ask him to help me"</p>

<p>"We had a lot of fun, this series is done out of love, it's done out of family, and it really celebrates being a kid, being who you are, and just Wilding out"</p>
