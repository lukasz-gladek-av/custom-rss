            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>CD Projekt Red has announced a new <em>Witcher</em> board game. This new entry, <em>The Witcher: Legacy</em>, will be handled by Go On Board, building upon the foundation of their past experience with the license to bring a new narrative-focused board game experience.</p>

<h2><em>The Witcher: Legacy</em> Board Game Announcement</h2>

<p>On its official <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/projects/go-on-board/the-witcher-legacy" rel="nofollow">Gamefound campaign</a> page, Go On Board's own Łukasz Woźniak discusses what players can expect from <em>The Witcher: Legacy </em>board game.</p>

Each player takes on the role of a witcher from the School of the Wolf after a devastating attack has devastated their home..</p>

<p>Players will battle monsters, train their skills, explore the kingdom of Kedwin, and manage resources, all while tracking down the ones responsible. How will these witchers protect what remains of their legacy? That is for your table to decide. The game's narrative scenarios will feature challenging moral decisions with long-term consequences for your campaign, contributing to its high replayability.</p>

<p>Woźniak also confirms that <em>The Witcher: Legacy</em> will build upon what the design team learned from their last big experience with the franchise, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/witcher-old-world-now-on-kickstarter" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>The Witcher: Old World</em></a>. This Kickstarter success story is similar to <em>Legacy</em>, in that both are prequels set before the time of Geralt of Rivia and focus on witchers facing down monsters in a hostile environment.</p>

<p><em>The Witcher</em> is one of Poland's most popular fantasy franchises ever. What began as a series of novels swiftly shot to mainstream success with three acclaimed action RPGs designed by CD Projekt Red, several crossovers with <em>Soul Calibur</em> and <em>Monster Hunter</em>, and a popular live-action Netflix adaptation. CD Projekt Red has announced both <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/witcher-4-official-reveal" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>The Witcher 4</em></a>, featuring new protagonist, Ciri.</p>

<p>At time of writing, the Gamefound campaign for <em>The Witcher: Legacy</em> hasn't gone live. However, you can follow the campaign and receive updates if you are interested in backing the campaign.</p>
