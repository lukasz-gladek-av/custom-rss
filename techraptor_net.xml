<p>In a message shared on the mod's Discord server (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/fallout-nuevo-mexico-mod-cancelled-prioritize-mental-health/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">TheGamer</a>), developer Zapshock says that while&nbsp;<em>Nuevo Mexico&nbsp;</em>has been his "passion" and "obsession" for years, the project's workload and costs are "too great".</p>

<p>As such, continuing with&nbsp;<em>Nuevo Mexico</em>'s development "simply isn't sustainable for [Zapshock] and everyone involved, including voice actors", and so the decision was made to cancel the project. Zapshock says the decision was "painful", but "necessary".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fallout-nuevo-mexico-mod-canceled-guns.jpg?itok=1SqRHiLS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fallout-nuevo-mexico-mod-canceled-guns.jpg?itok=EcpTjdIf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The ambitious&nbsp;<em>New Vegas&nbsp;</em>mod&nbsp;<em>Fallout: Nuevo Mexico&nbsp;</em>has sadly been canceled.</figcaption></figure><p>Before its cancellation,&nbsp;<em>Nuevo Mexico&nbsp;</em>was set to be a mod roughly the size of one of the&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>series' DLC packs, and it would have taken you to the US state of New Mexico, as the name suggests.</p>

<p>The mod was to be set five years after the events of the original&nbsp;<em>Fallout</em>, putting it several decades before the events of&nbsp;<em>Fallout 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>New Vegas</em>, both of which take place as humanity is beginning to rebuild something resembling a coherent society.</p>

<p>Per a Game Rant <a href="https://gamerant.com/fallout-new-vegas-mods-good-nuevo-mexico-scripting/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">interview</a> from February last year, the modders were planning to include&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age</em>-style origins for characters in&nbsp;<em>Nuevo Mexico</em>, including one for a ghoul character, which would have fundamentally changed the mod's gameplay experience.</p>

<p>Honestly, it sounds to me like it's no wonder the mod was canceled; Zapshock and his team clearly had an insane level of ambition for&nbsp;<em>Nuevo Mexico</em>, and with just four people working on the project, they were bound to burn out sooner or later.</p>




<p><em>Nuevo Mexico&nbsp;</em>isn't the only&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>mod to have been canceled in recent months; back in October, the developers of&nbsp;<em>Fallout: Vault 13</em>, a mod that attempted to remake the entirety of the original&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>in the fourth game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-vault-13-mod-development-suspended" rel="nofollow">shut down their mod</a> due to "a combination of factors".</p>

<p>If you are looking for a DLC-sized&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>mod experience, however, all is not lost. There's still&nbsp;<em>Fallout: London</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-london-out-now" rel="nofollow">launched in July last year</a>&nbsp;and which had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-london-mod-million-downloads" rel="nofollow">attracted a million downloads</a> by October. It's a&nbsp;<em>Fallout 4&nbsp;</em>mod, though, so you'll need the base game to play.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Division 2 Story DLC Delayed Again, No New Release Date Announced]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/division-2-story-dlc-delayed-again</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-division-2-story-dlc-delayed-again-no-new-release-date-announced.1093788/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/division-2-story-dlc-delayed-again<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has delayed the upcoming&nbsp;<em>The Division 2&nbsp;</em>story DLC out of the game's sixth year, but it looks like the third season will remain on the cards for February.</p>

<p>In an X <a href="https://x.com/TheDivisionGame/status/1884255116636705006" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, Ubisoft says that it wants to "deliver the best possible experience" for&nbsp;<em>The Division 2</em>'s story DLC, and so it "will not ship during Year 6". That likely means it won't be released until at least summer this year, although it could be even longer.</p>

<p>The DLC was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/division-heartland-division-2-resurgence-news" rel="nofollow">announced back in 2023</a>&nbsp;and was initially intended to be part of the game's fifth year of content, adding new zones, main missions, and "a whole new endgame structure" towards the end of 2024.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-division-2-story-dlc-delayed-beyond-2025-map.jpg?itok=UDvPwOZ5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-division-2-story-dlc-delayed-beyond-2025-map.jpg?itok=TnDQ-HoP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Division 2</em>'s story DLC has been delayed again.</figcaption></figure><p>However, in December 2023, the game's story DLC <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/division-2-story-dlc-delayed-to-2025-as-ubisoft-launches-project-resolve-to-improve" rel="nofollow">was delayed</a>&nbsp;beyond 2024, making this the second time the DLC has been pushed back. Perhaps appropriately, that first delay was revealed alongside "Project Resolve", an initiative that aimed to improve&nbsp;<em>The Division 2&nbsp;</em>across the board.</p>

<p>Ubisoft hasn't revealed a new release date for&nbsp;<em>The Division 2</em>'s story DLC. Honestly, at this stage, I don't think I'd be surprised if the expansion was canned altogether, although perhaps the game still enjoys a sizable enough player base for these delays not to spell the end.</p>

<p>The pushback of this DLC comes after what has been a pretty horrendous year for Ubisoft. The studio has endured multiple <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-h1-2024-25-fiscal-results" rel="nofollow">high-profile failures</a>, including&nbsp;pirate game&nbsp;<em>Skull and Bones</em>, open-world adventure&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, and first-person shooter&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing" rel="nofollow"><em>XDefiant</em></a>.</p>

<p>Not only that, but Ubisoft has&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-february" rel="nofollow">delayed</a> its upcoming flagship RPG&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-march" rel="nofollow">twice</a>, faced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-strike-investor-letter" rel="nofollow">investor unrest</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-lawsuit-data-policy" rel="nofollow">legal action</a>, and closed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-layoffs-leamington-closure" rel="nofollow">three of its studios</a>, with several more undergoing downsizing.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ubisoft-star-wars-outlaws.jpg?itok=CanXzuiy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ubisoft-star-wars-outlaws.jpg?itok=xuTsrXLK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It hasn't exactly been a great year for Ubisoft.</figcaption></figure><p><em>The Division 2</em>'s story DLC&nbsp;may not exactly be the flagship release Ubisoft has been banking on to turn its fortunes around, but this delay won't exactly come as a balm to shareholders who are already concerned the company has no clue what it's doing.</p>

<p>At any rate, if you'd like to catch up on&nbsp;<em>The Division 2&nbsp;</em>before the DLC launches (a pursuit for which it seems you'll have plenty of time), you can grab it right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2221490/Tom_Clancys_The_Division_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/tom-clancys-the-division-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 4</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/tom-clancys-the-division-2/9nc944t50735" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox One</a>, as well as on current-gen consoles through backwards compatibility.</p>
