            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/undaunted-2200-callisto-old-mechanics-new-tricks<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Undanuted</em> by Osprey Games, is a series heralded as perfectly blending a deck-building game with wargaming elements. The series of games first started in 2020 with <em>Undaunted Normandy</em>, and rather than start with a review of the original game, we're going to work backward from the latest game, and the only one so far set outside of the World War II setting, <em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto</em>.</p>

<p>Although we haven't covered <em>Undaunted</em> on the site before, we have covered several of Osprey Games' titles, including the brand new <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bolt-action-3rd-edition-review-snapping-into-action" rel="nofollow">Bolt Action 3rd Edition</a></em>, copublished with Warlord games, and also some of their awesome supplements for their miniatures agnostic system,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/frostgrave-wildwoods-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Frostgrave</em></a>.</p>

<p>In <em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto</em>, players draw 4 cards from their deck each turn and then use those cards to play actions from the tokens they have on the board, such as moving and attacking. Certain cards also allow you to draw more cards from your supply, or move cards from your deck to your supply, allowing you to tailor your deck as you play. New tokens can also be added to the game board as you draw new units into your deck. Some tokens have multiple cards that can activate them, with the cards having the same unit or squad name, but representing a different individual in that unit or vehicle.</p>

<p>This card system, as well as working for actions, also controls a unique damage system. As a unit takes hits, you must discard a matching card from your hand. If you don't have a matching card in your hand, you discard one from your discard pile, and if there isn't one there too, you discard it from your deck. If you can't find the card at all, the unit is eliminated. This can put real pressure on going first in the turn and focuses you on picking your targets. If a unit you have the card for in your hand is hit, then you discard the card and you might not be able to activate it this turn. It also adds a nice hidden element as you and your opponent try to work out how many cards units have left, and which is the optimum target to hit.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/undaunted-2200-callisto-5.jpg?itok=YKVtEzN8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/undaunted-2200-callisto-5.jpg?itok=t6V0aXNu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Most troops in <em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto&nbsp;</em>have multiple cards, representing the various troops or operators in a unit. In the image above we can see the 5 members of the huge LFA Centurion mech.</figcaption></figure><p>Introduced in <em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto</em>, which wasn't in the previous games, are maps with different elevations. These are handled extremely well, with tiles that are higher than others, but also with tiles that have bridges across. If an elevated element is on the same tile, then the units on the two different elements can't engage. But if you are shooting at an adjacent tile from an elevated position, then you change from using the standard 10-sided dice (D10) to 12-sided dice (D12), and if you are shooting at an elevated position, you drop to an 8-sided dice (D8). This mechanic simulates the advantages and disadvantages of shooting from and at elevated positions well, without making things too complicated.</p>

<p>Most of the game box is taken up with 4 large double-sided game boards, of which each has 1 of the 8 scenarios printed on them. The scenarios are designed to be played through in order, increasing in map size, force size, and complexity as you move through. But you are able to play any scenario you wish. The game can also be played cooperatively 2 v 2, with each player taking one of the listed groups, or solo for which there is a separate rulebook, with 8 scenarios, with rules for playing against both of the included forces.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/undaunted-2200-callisto-3.jpg?itok=FX5pzJ3e 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/undaunted-2200-callisto-3.jpg?itok=1lPZ6XDn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The highground is king in&nbsp;<em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto.&nbsp;</em>In the image above, the Stalker would roll a normal D10 to hit the Nailgunner, but would roll the better D12 against the Ripper who's on a lower elevation, and the Ripper in turn would only roll a D8 against the Stalker.</figcaption></figure><h2>Does Undaunted 2200 Callisto Have Different Factions?</h2>

<p><em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto</em> has 2 playable forces. The&nbsp;Inter-Jovian Mining Union (IMU), known as the Breakers, who are the combined workers and unions, united against the corporation, the&nbsp;Lunar Frontier Authority (LFA), and their hired security staff. They used to work together in harmony, but poor conditions and a focus on profits over the workers and making the mining colony a reasonable place to live has led to strikes and riots, which the LFA are looking to quell.</p>

<p>The 2 forces do have slightly different playstyles. The LFA has fewer token troops and has 5 mechs that use card standee figures rather than tokens. The Breakers have more troops, and 2 vehicles, the Drill and Hauler. These slightly different forces gives the impression of the Breakers swarming the LFA, with the slightly less limited LFA troops having to support each other, especially the mechs. Both sides do feel balanced, but I would recommend giving any new players you're playing with the Breakers (unless the really want to be the LFA) as they're slightly easier to pilot.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/undaunted-2200-callisto-6.jpg?itok=EryP76Ur 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/undaunted-2200-callisto-6.jpg?itok=oLCoO4XZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Both the LFA and Breakers have a unique thematic feel based on their avialable action cards in&nbsp;<em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto.</em></figcaption></figure><h2>How Does The Blend Of Deck Building And Wargaming Feel In Undaunted 2200 Callisto?</h2>

<p>The blending works extremely well. The way damage works with removing cards, and the limited card draws each turn means there are always tactical choices to be made. You need to use a scout action before you can move into a square, so there is a chance you might get an awkward draw and not be able to move forward because you don't have a scout card, which can really hamper your mobility, especially if you're opponent really hammers down on your scouts, but it's not common, so doesn't break the game.</p>

<p>I love the damage mechanic (using your hand and deck as health is my favorite mechanic in any gaming system), but there doesn't feel like much agency to it, and I wish there was a choice of where you lost the card from, with different repercussions depending on where you lose if from. It can feel oppressive when your opponent hammers down on a unit and negates your turn because of a poor draw. Again, it doesn't happen often, but it can happen simply because of the deck mechanic. You are of course, able to do this to your opponent too, and that's what made it enjoyable for me. It's not a matter of taking out your opponent's best unit, you need to pick your targets and stop them from scoring objectives, along with limiting their movement and options.</p>

<p><i>Undaunted 2200 Callisto </i>is a very interesting blend of board, card, and wargame, which offers some great moments and some surprising narrative depth in the 8 scenarios it includes. It's not super deep, but you can feel the difference between the Breakers and the LFA, and over the campaign, you can really get behind their motives. Solo works well, although somewhat predictably as each of the enemy units has a fixed flowchart of actions it takes, which makes it feel more like a puzzle than a strategy wargame. The 4 player coop is fun and actually has a nice way of streamlining the draws with the smaller decks, rather than feeling restrictive with smaller forces. I really hope that we see an expansion to <em>Undaunted 2200</em>, either through another faction or 2, or more troops for the IMU and LFA. Even though the maps are fixed, they do offer a lot of replayability if more forces were to be added.</p>

<h2>Should I Buy Undaunted 2200 Callisto?</h2>

<p><em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto</em> has some interesting new elements for veteran <em>Undaunted</em> players, along with all the mechanics that you know and love, in a new setting. New players will find this version approachable if they're not behind the WWII theme of previous games. Wargamers might not like the randomness and control of the deck system, as it can feel extremely restrictive if you're coming from a purely wargaming background, and takes some getting used to. If you're looking for a super technologically advanced sci-fi setting, then <em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto</em> does feel like WWII in space, even though both forces do feel thematically unique (and not like 2 countries fighting), the weapons and equipment still feel very modern, and combat feels very close.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wizkids-return-of-the-dragons-review-great-for-a-new-collector.1070427/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/wizkids-return-of-dragons-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If there's anything that I enjoy more than Dungeons… It's Dragons, so I was incredibly happy to hear that Wizkids was releasing a set of miniatures to represent the initial <em>D&amp;D 5E</em> adventure, <em>Tyranny of Dragons</em> (aka <em>Hoard of the Dragon Queen </em>and <em>Rise of Tiamat</em>). <em>Wizkids Dungeons &amp; Dragons Icons of the Realms Return of the Dragons</em> features a variety of minis that will help you bring your <em>Tyranny of Dragons</em> campaign to life.</p>

<p>Much like other releases this collection is made up of a number of blind boxes, featuring a variety of minis relevant to the campaign alongside some much larger stand alone minis representing the different dragons that you'd face along the way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wizkids sent us eight of the blind boxes to take a look and try our chances at getting some cool minis, and cool minis we did receive. Included in this set the minis obtained ranged from stand-ins for player characters, minis for key faction members, a healthy number of dragons, and even some impressive Giant characters.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizkids-return-of-the-dragon-more-monsters.jpg?itok=NVRe4oJp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizkids-return-of-the-dragon-more-monsters.jpg?itok=X09LwDyk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some of the stranger minis we obtained</figcaption></figure><p>Inside each Blind Box you'll find 3-4 miniatures, normally one is a medium-sized mini while the others are smaller tucked in around the plastic frame.</p>

<h2>Choose Your Character</h2>

<p>From the blind boxes I obtained, I ended up with seven different generic enough characters that could become player characters. These were:</p>

<ul><li aria-level="1">Barbarian (13/44)</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Gnome Wizard (1/44)</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Halfling Bard (2/44)</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Hobgoblin Fighter (12/44)</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Orc Fighter (10/44)</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Orog Fighter (14/44)</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Svirfneblin Fighter (4/44)</li>
</ul><p>While there was an interesting lead towards Fighters I was really impressed with the variety of species that was present. Players might not be familiar with an Orog (offspring of an Orc and Ogre) or might not know that Deep Gnome's proper title is Svirfneblin but it prompts players to take a playable race and see what tweaks they can make to make them more unique to the experience.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizkids-return-of-the-dragon-player-characters.jpg?itok=y192VcW3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizkids-return-of-the-dragon-player-characters.jpg?itok=Ra98pOHa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A nice assortment of minis to be any new player's first PC</figcaption></figure><p>Each of the melee characters wields an axe or sword, the wizard with their staff, and the Bard poses playing their violin ready to support the party with all kinds of magics and inspiration. While there are set names for each of these I could imagine just as easily the characters like the Hobgoblin being a Paladin, Rogue, or even a Ranger allowing it, and each of the others to fit into any table.</p>

<p>Of all of these, my favorite is the Orog, standing two heads over the Orc (even if more hunched) the comparison really allows you to understand how the Ogre blood would alter this creature. The blueish hue of its skin against its dark armor and axe makes it a very imposing figure.</p>

<h2>There Be Monsters In Them Boxes</h2>

<p>The offering of opponents for a party to fight against was also incredibly healthy. I got standard enemies – like Kobold (5/44), Bugbears (21/44), Needleblight (11/44), and a Wraith (23/44) – alongside some key members of different factions that play a larger role in the story. A Sun Elf Guard (9/44), Dragonclaw (20/44), Human Zhentarim Bandit (18/44), and a Red Wizard (34/44).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizkids-return-of-the-dragon-monsters.jpg?itok=62OG_aRY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizkids-return-of-the-dragon-monsters.jpg?itok=jh7nhG5j 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Fun fodder to throw at your party</figcaption></figure><p>Going through the blind box approach for the standard bad guys is a bit of a rough go. You'll get one or two Red Wizards, but when an encounter calls for 3, 4, or even 10 of them you're not going to want to be going to these blind boxes for the answer.</p>

<p>On top of those already mentioned other monsters that I got were the Quickling (3/44), Doppelganger (8/44), Mind Flayer (35/44), Manes (7/44), Guard Drake (22/44), and even a Ballista (19/44).</p>

<h2>Large And Up</h2>

<p>From the medium and larger monsters I received I was incredible happy. The Oni (25/44) and Pegasus (28/44) were unexpected to receive, but what I did get was a healthy amount of dragons.</p>

<p>Inside my eight blind boxes I received four different Dragons (kinda). I got the Young Blue Dragon (41/44), Young Green Dragon (31/44), Young Copper Dragon (32/44), and a Wyvern (29/44). If I was purchasing this expansion dragons of a variety would be what I was after and in that sense this expansion completely delivered.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizkids-return-of-the-dragon-the-dragons.jpg?itok=SCfQKSO1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizkids-return-of-the-dragon-the-dragons.jpg?itok=x_JnhSzO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Even more fun to cause a low level TPK</figcaption></figure><p>On top of the range of dragons included I was most impressed by the range on their poses. The seated Copper and Green Dragons flare their brilliant wings out or keep them close respectively, while the Blue Dragon is in mid-flap allowing it to powerfully ascend.</p>

<p>Bigger than the dragons are the Hill Giant and Frost Giant (that come in two easily assembled pieces). With strange body proportions and unique armor styles both of these are incredibly eyecatching. While not as unique as some of the giants that came with the Bigby Presents collection these are going to get far more versatile use on the table.</p>

<h2>A Classic Assortment Of <em>D&amp;D</em> Minis</h2>

<p>Something that I loved so much about Tyranny of Dragons when I ran it was that it was a quintessential <em>D&amp;D</em> adventure. You have all kinds of hallmark monster encounters, dark cults, strange wizards, and a battle to stop the world being taken over by evil dragons. That same vibe is alive through the array of miniatures available in this blind box.</p>

<p>For a new DM wanting to start out their collection of higher quality minis there's a lot here that will be useful like the player characters of different races, different fodder enemies for along the way, and a few great setpiece monsters.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizkids-return-of-the-dragon-giants-and-beasts.jpg?itok=jw3zALYK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizkids-return-of-the-dragon-giants-and-beasts.jpg?itok=Qk7FchBn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>For when you want to shock them</figcaption></figure><p>As I said above you'll never have the consistency for a multi-monster encounter, but if you can even show your players what one Red Wizard looks like, while filling the rest of the ranks with a Bugbear or Bandit then it creates a more visually enticing experience.</p>

<h2><em>Wizkids Return of the Dragons</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><em>Return of the Dragons</em>, much like the campaign it's based on, is a quintessential collection of minis that are incredibly versatile and appealing for any game you're going to be running. With a good collection of characters for players to take on, interesting yet frequently faced monsters adding repeated use, and dragons for your <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> game there's a lot here.</p>

<p>The major complaint that I have, with any blind box, is that it puts everything up to chance. For a campaign where there is a 10 Red Wizard encounter, or even one where you need 3 then you're going to have issues fielding the team.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/three-pokemon-tcg-collections-coming-in-2025-complete-with-unique-items<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>New <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/pokemon-trading-card-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Pokemon TCG</a> collections are coming next year. Fans of The Pokemon Company's enduring card game should watch for these collections. They will contain unique cards and special physical products for hardcore Pokemon fans.</p>

<h2>The Pokemon TCG Collections Announcement</h2>

<p>According to a post <a href="https://www.pokebeach.com/2024/12/three-tcg-collections-releasing-in-2025-with-new-unique-items-including-lenticular-card" rel="nofollow">on Pokebeach</a>, three new <em>Pokemon TCG</em> collections will be available in North America in 2025.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-tcg-collections-postcard-image.jpg?itok=Dm707iHS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-tcg-collections-postcard-image.jpg?itok=Kp3t_xPA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The first of these is an "ex-Collection Box" that will be released alongside the <em>Journey Together</em> set on March 28. This set is notable since it will bring back Owners' Pokemon cards. The Collection Box will contain three promo cards, one jumbo card, four booster packs, a code card, and a Polaroid-style postcard.</p>

<p>The last time a Polaroid was included in one of these boxes was part of the 2001 <em>Southern Islands</em> set.</p>

<p>The second of these Pokemon TCG collections is a new Premium Collection box coming April 11. The box will contain six boosters, two promo cards, a photo sticker, a backdrop card, and an acrylic standee sheet.</p>

<p>The post mentions how these products will work isn't entirely clear. However, acrylic stands have been released at Japan's Pokemon Centers before featuring different characters. There's a chance they may operate similarly, letting fans have little dioramas of beloved characters on display.</p>

This will contain five boosters, a code card, three promo cards, and a jumbo lenticular card. This is major since the last time a lenticular card was released, it was in promotion of the 2004 <em>Pokemon Destiny Deoxys</em> movie.</p>

<p>This is different from the lenticular posters contained in certain <em>Pokemon TCG</em> marketing kits. While nice bits of promotion, these promo items aren't real cards.</p>

<p>The <em>Pokemon TCG</em> is one of the most popular trading card games in the world. Its popularity has only grown thanks to the massive success of the mobile game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-dena-revenue" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em></a><em>.</em></p>
