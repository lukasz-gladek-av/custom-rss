            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Nacon and developer Spiders have announced that their action RPG sequel <em>GreedFall 2: The Dying World </em>will launch in full on PC and consoles in March.</p><p>As revealed in a brand new trailer, <em>GreedFall 2: The Dying World </em>will be hitting PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S on March 12th, having been in Early Access for the last <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/greedfall-2-release-date" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a936cedb-778a-48c2-a788-07da845a360a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">year and a half or so</a>.</p><p>Since launching in September 2024, <em>GreedFall 2 </em>has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/greedfall-2-early-access-roadmap" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="70a6d13b-4284-4869-8f2d-989e1b544615" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">received a number of updates</a>, bringing features like new companions, quests, and story elements, as well as a crafting system, a new skill tree, and more.

<p>In practice, some Steam reviewers <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1997660/GreedFall_The_Dying_World/#app_reviews_hash" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">beg to differ</a>. <em>GreedFall 2 </em>has amassed a Mixed rating across over 500 reviews since its Early Access launch, and even more recent opinions point to what players perceive as game-breaking bugs, unfinished systems, and iffy optimization.</p><p>Of course, there's a good chance that Spiders and Nacon can turn around <em>GreedFall 2 </em>and fix its issues in time for launch in March; there are, after all, two months between now and then, which should be enough time to at least iron out some of the more troubling-sounding problems.</p><p>However, given that Spiders was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/spiders-layoffs" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1d57ded4-a6cf-40e0-93cb-59588606ff42" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">hit by layoffs in July last year</a>, the studio is operating at a reduced capacity compared to when <em>GreedFall 2 </em>launched, so you might want to temper your expectations accordingly if you're going to pick the game up on PS5 or Xbox.</p><p>If you're unfamiliar with <em>GreedFall 2: The Dying World</em>, it is, as the name implies, the sequel to the 2019 RPG <em>GreedFall</em>, although it's actually a prequel.</p>
<p><em>GreedFall 2 </em>once again revolves around notions of colonialism and exploitation; this time, you're playing as a Teer Fradee native, who must navigate political intrigue and deadly fauna across the open world of Gacane.</p><p><em>GreedFall 2: The Dying World </em>is available now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1997660/GreedFall_The_Dying_World/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC via Steam Early Access</a>, and it's coming to <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010517" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PS5</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/greedfall-ii-the-dying-world/9P2SLNTMLJ2Q" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a> on March 12th.
