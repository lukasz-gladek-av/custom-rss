            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/awesome-games-done-quick-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Charity speedrunning event Awesome Games Done Quick 2025 has come to a close, and the event has raised a huge amount of money for charity organization Prevent Cancer Foundation.</p>

<p>Per a press release, AGDQ 2025 has raised a grand total of $2,556,305 for the cancer charity, which advocates for cancer prevention and early detection. That's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/awesome-games-done-quick-raises-26-million-for-prevent-cancer-foundation" rel="nofollow">around the same amount raised</a> during Awesome Games Done Quick 2023 and slightly more than AGDQ 2024's total.</p>

<p>Like last year's event (but <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/awesome-games-done-quick-2023-cancels-in-person-event" rel="nofollow">not the previous year's</a>), AGDQ 2025 took place over a seven-day period in Pittsburgh, PA, with over 2,000 people attending the event and "tens of thousands" of people streaming it online.</p>

<p>Highlights, as a press release points out, include Dr. Doot's saxophone-driven&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>stream (which you can see below), as well as an actual opera performance by Xem upon completion of his&nbsp;run of&nbsp;<em>Ratchet and Clank: Going Commando</em>.</p>

<p>You may also have seen FunkopotamusWes playing&nbsp;<em>New Super Mario Bros. Wii&nbsp;</em>using his head and feet while using his hands to play the piano, then doing the same while blindfolded. No wonder the amount raised for charity was so high.</p>

<p>Lest you think AGDQ 2025 focused only on good games, though, think again; the Awful Block segment featured streamers playing through games like the legendarily godawful&nbsp;<em>Superman 64&nbsp;</em>and the just-plain-weird&nbsp;<em>Golf With Your Grandmother</em>.</p>




<p>Awesome Games Done Quick 2025 concluded on Sunday morning with a&nbsp;<em>Super Metroid&nbsp;</em>run, which feels like a nice, classic way to bring proceedings to a close.</p>

<p>If you missed any of the runs that took place during AGDQ 2025, you can check them all out via the official <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@gamesdonequick" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Games Done Quick YouTube channel</a>. You can also still make a donation to Prevent Cancer Foundation <a href="https://preventcancer.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">via its official website</a> if you'd like to.</p>

<hr><h2>Third Place -&nbsp;Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</h2>



<p>Developer: Saber Interactive | Release Date: September 9th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Andrew Otton</p>

<p>It seems crazy that it took this long for someone to really nail what it feels like to play as a Space Marine for the <em>Warhammer 40K </em>universe. Obviously, this is a sequel to a first solid attempt at that game, but it wasn't quite there. Now, though, <em>Space Marine 2</em> is the ultimate <em>40K </em>fantasy.</p>

<p><em>Space Marine 2</em>'s co-op is set up in a classic way. Honestly, there's nothing more to it than you can just join up with some friends to absolutely demolish people as a squad of Space Marines. Because the gameplay is so visceral and the visual design so perfectly captures that universe, you can't help yourself but have a good time.</p>

<p>It isn't often we're treated with some really fun co-op experiences, but you owe it to yourself to try out <em>Space Marine 2</em>, especially if you're into <em>Warhammer</em>.</p>

<h2>Second Place - Marvel Rivals</h2>



<p>Developer: NetEase Games | Release Date: December 6th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Robert Scarpinito</p>

<p>Ever since I played it while it was in beta over the summer, I felt something I hadn't felt in a while: low-pressure competitive joy. It reminds me of the early days of <em>Overwatch </em>(in more ways than one). No matter which character you play, it's fairly easy to feel effective, but games are also just short enough that if you royally screw up, the opportunity to redeem yourself is around the corner.</p>

<p>The Team-Up Abilities also feel like an innovative take on hero selection. Pairing up two heroes who benefit each other gives you a slight edge, but it never feels like it breaks the game. Instead, it's a lore-friendly way to strategize your picks, playing into the rich history of Marvel stories that are on offer.</p>

<p>We're just getting into season 1 now, which has introduced Reed Richards and the Invisible Woman, with The Thing and the Human Torch just around the corner. Already, that's an impressive amount of support for a hero shooter that could really shake up the somewhat stale genre.</p>

<h2>Winner - Helldivers 2</h2>



<p>Developer: Arrowhead Game Studios | Release Date: February 8th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Dan Rockwood</p>

<p>In 2024, no game captured the chaos and camaraderie of fighting on a united front better than <em>Helldivers 2</em>. Not only is it super fun to coordinate calling in stratagems that will bomb entire acres of a map, but on higher difficulty levels <em>Helldivers 2</em> requires optimized teamwork to keep from being overrun by Terminids, Automatons and, most recently, the Illuminate.</p>

<p>When you are battling alone, outgunned and outnumbered, there's no greater feeling than a friendly ship coming out of hyperspace, the fresh Hellpod deploying, screaming through the atmosphere like a missile until it slams into the ground, releasing a new Helldiver to help turn the tide of battle.</p>

<p><em>Helldivers 2</em> seamlessly integrates and relies on cross-platform coordination and cooperative play to win missions but doesn't shy away from the hilarity of accidentally (or intentionally) dropping a 500 kg bomb on one of your friends or napalming an extraction point moments before evacuation. <em>Helldivers 2</em> is among the greatest multiplayer experiences of the past decade, and with frequent updates and an ever-evolving story, it shows no signs of slowing down.</p>
