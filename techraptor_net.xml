            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/video-game-history-foundation-free-online-library<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Video Game History Foundation (VGHF) has launched a brand new online library that contains a massive repository of gaming history research materials, and it won't cost you a penny to access.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://gamehistory.org/vghf-library-launch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on its website, VGHF says it's been building, cataloging, processing, and digitizing its collections since <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/video-game-history-foundation-officially-launches" rel="nofollow">it started in 2017</a>, and that the library is now "ready to open [its] (virtual) doors to the public for the first time", albeit in Early Access.</p>

<p>As for what the library contains, it'll give you access to "a curated selection of materials" from the wider VGHF library, including unseen game development materials, iconic games' press kits and promos, and "over 1500 full-text searchable out-of-print video game magazines".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/video-game-history-foundation-free-online-library-mgs4-promo-booklet.png?itok=g6hIcMax 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/png"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/video-game-history-foundation-free-online-library-mgs4-promo-booklet.png?itok=2yFwJWGC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/png"></picture><figcaption>The Video Game History Foundation has launched a massive new gaming history library that anyone can access online.</figcaption></figure><p>Specifically, VGHF points to what it calls "the Mark Flitman papers", a series of digitized documents and file backups kept in the basement of retired game producer Mark Flitman.</p>

<p>His collection includes work he did for companies like Konami, Acclaim, and Midway during the 90s and 2000s, and it's all available right now for you to view online, along with tons of other materials.</p>

<p>The library also includes "over 100 hours of footage" from developer Cyan's work on the&nbsp;<em>Myst&nbsp;</em>series, including never-before-seen interviews with the development team behind the likes of&nbsp;<em>Myst&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Riven</em>.</p>

<p>You can access all of this material via an interface that allows you to search for the material you want, view digital items directly in your browser, and even search for text within articles, making this one of the biggest online repositories of gaming information available right now.</p>




<p>As you might expect, the library will also be adding new materials to its archive over the coming years, so even if you don't find what you're looking for now, you may well do in the future.</p>

<p>It's the Video Game History Foundation's self-proclaimed mission to preserve, celebrate, and teach gaming history, and it's doing so through initiatives like the new online library, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/simcity-nes-prototype-digitized-and-dissected-by-video-game-history-foundation" rel="nofollow">digitizing rare game prototypes</a> and more.</p>

<p>VGHF is one of several organizations currently aiming to bring game preservation to the forefront of conversations within the industry; it joins the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gog-preservation-program" rel="nofollow">GOG and its Preservation Program</a> on that front. Good show, say I.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/path-of-exile-updates-paused-as-grinding-gear-focuses-on-path-of-exile-2.1096002/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-updates-paused-poe-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Path of Exile&nbsp;</em>developer Grinding Gear Games has announced that it's pausing updates for the first game while it works on&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2</em>.</p>

<p>In a video message to fans, game director Jonathan Rogers says that Grinding Gear "can't really work on [upcoming update]&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile&nbsp;</em>3.26 before&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>0.2.0 has shipped", and that the studio "probably need[s] to support that for a couple of weeks" after launch, too.</p>

<p>While the studio will be working on "a bunch of preproduction" for <i>Path of Exile&nbsp;</i>update 3.26, it'll be dragging across staff from the first game in order to work on the second, which Rogers says still has "major issues", making it the priority for Grinding Gear at the moment.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/path-of-exile-updates-paused-path-of-exile-2-lightning.jpg?itok=BPMhx2Ys 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/path-of-exile-updates-paused-path-of-exile-2-lightning.jpg?itok=j17ztKKC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Updates for the first&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile&nbsp;</em>are being paused while Grinding Gear works on the second game.</figcaption></figure><p>Rogers goes on to say that it's "hard to even think about" what the team might create for&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile&nbsp;</em>when the sequel has "really obvious problems that need fixing".</p>

<p>He goes on to say that once&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>0.2.0 has been launched, the team will "devote as many resources as are needed" to get&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile&nbsp;</em>update 3.26 finished "as soon as possible".</p>

<p>Previously, Rogers had said that dedicating resources to both&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile&nbsp;</em>and its sequel "shouldn't be an issue", and that Grinding Gear Games is "set up" in a way that allows it to do so. Evidently, however, that's not the case, at least not this time.</p>

<p>You can see Rogers' full video message, which contains a little more information regarding the shift in focus, right here.</p>




<p><em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>originally started life as a major update for the first game, but eventually, its scope expanded to the point that Grinding Gear Games decided to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-will-be-standalone-game-closed-beta-date-gameplay-revealed" rel="nofollow">make it its own title instead</a>.</p>

<p>The game was released to a broadly positive reception from players, although several issues were identified, leading Grinding Gear to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-devs-feedback-early-access" rel="nofollow">promise fixes for those issues</a> in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2694490/Path_of_Exile_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>, as well as on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/path-of-exile-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/path-of-exile-2-game-preview/9ND8N4RW5GHX" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. The first game is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/238960/Path_of_Exile/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/path-of-exile/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 4</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/path-of-exile/bwc95bzpfbs7" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox One</a>, and you can play that one for free, too.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bioware-hit-by-layoffs-following-dragon-age-the-veilguards-failure.1095981/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioware-layoffs-veilguard-failure<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>BioWare has laid off several of its employees as part of an initiative to become a "more agile" studio, although the developer itself hasn't officially announced these layoffs.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bioware-quietly-lay-off-key-dragon-age-team-members-while-talking-up-the-next-mass-effect" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">noted</a> by Rock Paper Shotgun, several BioWare employees who worked on&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, including lead writer Trick Weekes and producer Jennifer Cheverie (among others), have posted on social media that they're now looking for a new job.</p>

<p>Yesterday, BioWare posted a studio <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2025/01/29/bioware-studio-update/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">update</a>&nbsp;in which general manager Gary McKay said the studio was becoming "a more agile, focused studio", referring obliquely to "today's news" and refraining from announcing any of the staff departures that were subsequently confirmed by staff members themselves.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-bioware-layoffs-combat.jpg?itok=ZepTStaq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-bioware-layoffs-combat.jpg?itok=eZWGZM6v 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>'s flop appears to have led to layoffs at BioWare.</figcaption></figure><p>McKay also says that "a core team" at BioWare is currently working on the next&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect</em>, and that the game will boast the involvement of folks who worked on the original trilogy. He cites names like series producer Mike Gamble, designer Preston Watamaniuk, and cinematics animator Parrish Ley.</p>

<p>He also says that given the "stage of development" the next&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect&nbsp;</em>is currently at, the team doesn't "require support from the full studio", and so some BioWare employees have been moved to "other teams at EA that had open roles that were a strong fit".</p>

<p>While this isn't necessarily the sole reason behind these layoffs, it's worth noting that EA recently revealed its flagship RPG&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>was a flop, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-ea-sports-fc-25-underperformed" rel="nofollow">selling around half of the copies</a> the publisher expected it to shift.</p>

<p>The game also spent a very, very long time in development, undergoing at least one major reboot before being shaped into the game that was eventually <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-release-date-leaked-trailer" rel="nofollow">released in October</a>.</p>




<p>Right before these layoffs were reported,&nbsp;<em>Veilguard&nbsp;</em>director Corinne Busche <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/veilguard-director-corinne-busche-leaving-bioware" rel="nofollow">revealed</a> that she was leaving BioWare, so it's possible that she jumped before she was pushed.</p>

<p>Whatever the case may be, all eyes are now on the next&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect</em>, which seemingly has a lot of work to do if it's going to pull BioWare back from what appears to be a pretty dangerous brink. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/laika-aged-through-blood-review-burst-tyre-under-fire</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/laika-aged-through-blood-review-burst-tyre-under-fire.1095933/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/laika-aged-through-blood-review-burst-tyre-under-fire<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s never a dull moment to freshly visit a release that’s already got more than enough critical lauding behind it. <em>Laika: Aged Through Blood</em>, developed by Spanish team Brainwash Gang, and dubbed “Motorvania”, has already met the positive end of the critical reception stick since its release in 2023. 2 years later, it has finally driven over to the Nintendo Switch, which you’d assume to be a perfect victory lap.</p>

<p>You play as Laika, an immortal anthropomorphic dog who’s in an endless war alongside her similar animal compatriots against a covenant of birds, who’ve deemed themselves genetically superior. Due to her accursed immortality, she’s often seen as the first and last line of defense for the rest of her cabal, who are preparing for a devastating weapon to be used against them by the birds. In between all of this, she is the mother to a growing and otherwise affable pup, who’s destined to take her mantle, as well as her curse, much to the chagrin of Laika.</p>

<p>When I say “Motorvania”, what exactly does that entail? Well, that requires a bit of context. <em>Laika: Aged Through Blood </em>is a title specifically inspired by the Adobe Flash games of old, from <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/review/trials-fusion-review" rel="nofollow">Trials</a> </em>to <em>Bush Shoot-Out</em>. It’s the former that is obviously the bigger mine for inspiration, as <em>Laika </em>utilizes old-school Flash bike-riding as its main movement mechanic. As such, you’ll be flipping your bike, wheelie-ing, and struggling with the most curvaceous of hills for most of your playtime.</p>



<p>Not only that but there’s combat on top, the closest comparison being something like the equally audacious <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/my-friend-pedro-review-max-pedro" rel="nofollow"><em>My Friend Pedro</em></a>. The difference between the two however is that instadeath is a permanent possibility throughout your playthrough, but Laika can fight back. The underside of your motorbike can deflect most bullets, as well as your character being able to turn on the 2D platforms in order to deflect bullets on a straight plane.</p>

<p>It’s an easy-to-learn, hard-to-master mechanic, and one that initially provides some berth and exceptionally high swells of pride once you perfect it. Drive head-first into a valley of trigger-happy avian bastards, and spam bullets in every direction until the screen turns into a sea of magnetically-attracted currency and guts. Once it starts, <em>Laika </em>will never let off the brakes, and that’s both a blessing and a burden.</p>

<p>It’s quite easy to find yourself stuck in a relentless cycle of dying and restarting over and over again just to perfect a single section that’s just as likely to have another difficulty spike behind it. It’s an endurance test in how much BS you can take before you either break through with bloody knuckles or shut the console off and say “That’s enough”. As it stands, the latter was the more likely outcome for me.</p>



<p>As it stands, <em>Laika </em>is a game where you have to put the time in, especially when its main movement mechanic defines the progression. As such, the level design seeks to at least be engaging enough throughout the entire runtime with obstacle courses and trick jumps you’re more likely to see in <em>Trials</em>-adjacent titles. However, this doesn’t make backtracking necessarily interesting, more that it becomes a permeating checklist of remembering exactly how and where you’re meant to execute specific jumps on specific ramps, that look like every other specific jump or specific ramps.</p>

<p>This is something that correlates to Brainwash Gang’s history, as their debut game, <em>Nongunz</em>, was a similar war of attrition between how far you’re willing to go to progress, or hell, even understand. In <em>Nongunz</em>’ case, however, the playing field wasn’t surmounted by what could – in certain pretenses – be described as a gimmick. Gimmicky narrative? Sure, but there are bigger demons in sight here.</p>

<p>For one, despite <em>Nongunz</em>’ mono-chromatic visual design, enough attention was paid to busier arenas to make sure the player wasn’t overwhelmed with odds. In <em>Laika</em>, the visual design has been over-produced to the point where it’s an unintelligible mess in its peaks, at least on the Nintendo Switch. This isn’t a case of playing on handheld either, whether it’s the handheld mode, or docked, <em>Laika </em>is simply too busy of a game to justify its messy proceedings.</p>



<p>How do we fix this? Make the camera static. Seriously, <em>Laika </em>is much too interested in constantly messing up perspective, as well as throwing mixed challenges of precision platforming and sludgy combat which I can’t ascertain is a design decision or not. Performance is all over the place on the Nintendo Switch, which puts me in the camp of believing this is a poorly-performing port.</p>

<p>So the question becomes “Is <em>Laika: Aged Through Blood</em> worth driving through despite this?”, and the answer I came to is “no”. The long and short of it is that the story is much too interested in pitting its frankly mawkish narrative against the even more absurd gameplay core of <em>Trials-</em>flipping combat nonsense. It’s an exceptionally harsh juxtaposition that’s hard to shake off unless you’re fully committed to its over-wrought presentation.</p>

<p>It’s not without its failings, mind you. As was the case with <em>Nongunz</em>, <em>Laika </em>is blessed with an utterly fantastic and melancholic soundtrack, <a href="https://beicoli.bandcamp.com/album/laika-aged-through-blood-ost" rel="nofollow">composed by Beatriz Ruiz-Castillo</a>. They’re a collectible within the world also, and you bet your bottom dollar they’re worth going the extra mile for. Beautifully composed, and far and away, the most well-intentioned and aligned aspect of <em>Laika</em>’s more gloomy angles.</p>



<p>There’s a distinct flavor to how <em>Laika </em>presents its story, one which requires full dedication to the edginess of its world-building. I mean, it starts off with your daughter wailing at the sight of a crucified anthropomorphic animal - quite upsetting in its depiction, but in hindsight, silly as you see how Laika enacts revenge by being the best showboating motorbike rider in the wastelands.</p>

<h2><em>Laika: Aged Through Blood </em>Review | Final Verdict</h2>

<p>In any other timeline, the kind of antics <em>Laika: Aged Through Blood</em> showcases would be a perfect fit for the kind of platforming shenanigans the Nintendo Switch is known for at this point. This isn’t the case, however, as its overdesigned, overcomplicated, and indeed, overcooked storyline fails to make a dent in the library's more venerated classics.</p>

<hr><p><strong><em>Laika: Aged Through Blood </em></strong><em>was reviewed on Nintendo Switch using a copy provided by the publisher over the course of 20 hours of gameplay - all screenshots were taken during the process of review.</em></p>

<p>Previous&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>updates have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-update-152" rel="nofollow">set the precedent</a> of bringing <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-update-144" rel="nofollow">new cars to check out</a>, and this one's no different, starting with the original formula car F3500-A, which has been created "in the image of classic F1 cars". If you like old-school racing machines, you'll love this one.</p>

<p>Your next new car is the Honda Civic Si Extra (EF) '87, a touring car racer that's also known as the Grand Civic, and it's known for being used at events like the Japan Touring Car Championship.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gran-turismo-7-update-1.55-new-cars.jpg?itok=zm7JmJAd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gran-turismo-7-update-1.55-new-cars.jpg?itok=S_JvEj0d 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Four new cars are available to drive in&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>Update 1.55.</figcaption></figure><p>Next up, it's the Hyundai IONIQ 5 N '24, a revision of Hyundai's first all-electric model that "challenges the preconceptions of BEVs", according to Sony (that's battery electric vehicles, by the way).</p>

<p>Last but not least, you can now also drive the Toyota C-HR S '18, an "unconventional crossover SUV" most famous for taking on the&nbsp;Nürburgring 24 Hours circuit in prototype form. Pretty impressive stuff, no?</p>

<p>All four of these cars can be purchased from&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7</em>'s Brand Central, so head on over there and pick up whichever is your favorite (or all of them, if you're so inclined).</p>

<p>You can check out a trailer that shows off these cars, as well as some other elements of the new update, right here.</p>




<p>Also new in this update are two new courses for&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7</em>'s Sophy AI racing agent, as well as new events in the game's World Circuits and more. You can take a look at everything that's been added <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/30/gran-turismo-7-update-1-55-details-revealed-live-today/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here via the PlayStation Blog</a>.</p>

<p><em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/gran-turismo-7/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>; unlike <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-psn-account-requirement-incentives" rel="nofollow">many other Sony first-party games</a>, it's yet to secure itself a PC release.

<p>Per a Deadline <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/01/beyond-two-souls-video-game-television-series-elliot-page-pageboy-1236267129/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, the adaptation is currently in early development, and it's expected to follow the same storyline as the game, which tracks Page's Jodie as she comes to terms with the supernatural powers that allow her to see and communicate with a mysterious entity known as Aiden.</p>

<p>Page says that&nbsp;<em>Beyond: Two Souls&nbsp;</em>represented "one of the most challenging and fulfilling acting experiences of [his] career", and that the goal is to "create a unique vision of the characters" in what he describes as a story with "rich narrative and emotional depth".</p>

<p>Deadline's report doesn't state whether Page or Dafoe will be returning to star; the production is still fairly early on in development, so it's possible that actors haven't been cast yet.</p>

<p>Quantic Dream's David Cage says he's "absolutely thrilled" to be working with Page on the&nbsp;<em>Beyond: Two Souls&nbsp;</em>TV show, and that Page "has all the talent and instinct to make it something really unique on TV".</p>

<p>Whether Page himself is as thrilled to be working with Cage is less clear. Back in 2015, it was <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ellen-page-explored-legal-action-154256357.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reported</a>&nbsp;(note: this article is several years old and uses Page's deadname) that he explored legal action following his discovery that Quantic Dream had made a fully rendered nude model of his in-game character without his permission.</p>




<p>As for what's next for Quantic Dream, the studio, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/quantic-dream-acquired-by-netease" rel="nofollow">acquired by Chinese gaming giant NetEase</a> in 2022, is currently developing adventure game&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Eclipse</em>.</p>

<p>Announced during the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-announcement-from-game-awards-2021" rel="nofollow">2021 Game Awards</a>, the studio has been relatively silent about the game since; it still has no release date or even vague release window, so it's likely to be some time before we hear from it again.</p>

<p>That's also true about the&nbsp;<em>Beyond: Two Souls&nbsp;</em>TV show, given how early in production it apparently is. Stay tuned for more on that, and in the meantime, you can check the game out right now on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/beyond-two-souls/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS4</a> (and PS5 via backwards compatibility) and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/960990/Beyond_Two_Souls/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>.</p>
