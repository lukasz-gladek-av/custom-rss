<p>As a reminder, this Direct doesn't have anything for you when it comes to the Switch 2; you'll have to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">wait until next week's show</a> for that. With that in mind, here's everything that was announced during today's Nintendo Direct showcase!</p>

<hr><h2><em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD Remaster</em>&nbsp;still coming this year</h2>

<p>First, we got to see a little footage from the upcoming JRPG collection&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD Remaster</em>, which is still coming to Switch sometime this year. No release date was revealed for the collection, sadly.</p>

<h2><em>No Sleep for Kaname Date - From AI: The Somnium Files&nbsp;</em>is a&nbsp;<em>Zero Escape</em>-style adventure</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-direct-march-2025-ai-somnium-files.jpg?itok=-Dhrt5J0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-direct-march-2025-ai-somnium-files.jpg?itok=_CzgAo5U 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A new&nbsp;<em>AI: The Somnium Files&nbsp;</em>game is coming.</figcaption></figure><p>Next up, it's time to take a look at the next game in the&nbsp;<em>AI: The Somnium Files&nbsp;</em>series. This one stars detective Kaname Date, who must work together with the sophisticated AI embedded in his eye in order to save internet personality Iris from a "mysterious escape game". It's coming to Switch on July 25th.</p>

<h2><em>Raidou Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army&nbsp;</em>has more Atlus RPG shenanigans</h2>

<p>A remastered version of Atlus' action RPG <i>Devil Summoner: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. the Soulless Army&nbsp;</i>is coming to Switch on June 19th. If you like&nbsp;<em>Persona&nbsp;</em>but wish the combat was a bit more active, this one's probably for you.</p>

<h2><em>Shadow Labyrinth&nbsp;</em>is, uh, a&nbsp;<em>Pac-Man&nbsp;</em>Metroidvania</h2>

<p>Have you ever wanted Pac-Man to star in his very own Metroidvania platformer? Well, you're in luck.&nbsp;<em>Shadow Labyrinth&nbsp;</em>is that very thing, although you're teaming up with "Puck" rather than exclusively playing as him. This one's coming on July 18th.</p>

<h2><em>Patapon 1+2 Replay&nbsp;</em>brings the&nbsp;<em>Patapon&nbsp;</em>games to Switch in July</h2>

<p>The PSP's&nbsp;<em>Patapon&nbsp;</em>games were some of that system's most delightful and joyful titles, and they're now coming to Switch as part of&nbsp;<em>Patapon 1+2 Replay</em>, which will hit the system on July 11th.</p>

<h2><em>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar&nbsp;</em>is a remake of a DS farming classic</h2>

<p>A new&nbsp;<em>Story of Seasons&nbsp;</em>game is coming to Switch...well, sort of.&nbsp;<em>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar&nbsp;</em>is a remake of the DS game (which was released under the series' previous&nbsp;<em>Harvest Moon&nbsp;</em>name), and it's coming on August 27th.</p>

<h2>More&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond&nbsp;</em>gameplay info revealed</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-direct-march-2025.jpg?itok=S1CsocbO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-direct-march-2025.jpg?itok=1slXJ7c2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond&nbsp;</em>is shaping up to be great, but I wish we had a release date for it.</figcaption></figure><p>Next, we got a new look at hotly-anticipated first-person shooter&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>. No release date, sadly, but we did get to see some of the game's combat, which looks like it's in the classic&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime&nbsp;</em>tradition.</p>

<p>We also got to see some of Samus' new psychic abilities, which can be used both to explore the world around you and to enhance combat.</p>

<h2><em>Disney Villains Cursed Cafe</em>&nbsp;is essentially&nbsp;<em>Coffee Talk&nbsp;</em>with added Ursula</h2>

<p>If you thought&nbsp;<em>Coffee Talk&nbsp;</em>could use some extra villainy, this next one is for you.&nbsp;<em>Disney Villains Cursed Cafe&nbsp;</em>lets you brew potions and serve them to Disney villains, and the kinds of potions you brew can even have an effect on the story. You can play it on Switch later today.</p>

<h2><em>Witchbrook&nbsp;</em>looks like the cozy magic school game you've been waiting for</h2>

<p>Next, it's time for a look at Chucklefish's&nbsp;<em>Witchbrook</em>, a cozy magic school game in which you can fly on broomsticks, learn magic spells, and hang out with other witches. This one's heading to Switch sometime this holiday season.</p>

<h2>Action and arcade sizzle reel</h2>

<p>Nintendo showed an action and arcade-focused sizzle reel next, featuring THQ's hand-drawn platformer&nbsp;<em>The Eternal Life of Goldman&nbsp;</em>(coming this holiday), retro collection <i>Gradius Origins&nbsp;</i>(launching in August), and rhythm game&nbsp;<em>Rift of the NecroDancer&nbsp;</em>(coming to Switch today).</p>

<h2><em>Tamagotchi Plaza&nbsp;</em>is a new&nbsp;<em>Tamagotchi Connection&nbsp;</em>game</h2>

<p>In&nbsp;<em>Tamagotchi Plaza</em>, twelve stores await your help, and you can do everything from designing eyewear through to, uh, being a dentist. The game features over 100 "new and classic" Tamagotchi and launches on June 27th.</p>

<h2><em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>sure does look fun</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-direct-march-2025.jpg?itok=O-ewIs2x 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-direct-march-2025.jpg?itok=pQ-yMcvi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll have to fight a lot of trainers to be the very best in&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>We were treated to some more&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>info next, although much of it was already revealed in February's&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>Presents show.</p>

<p>This Nintendo Direct showed off some of the game's Z-A Royale tournament, which will let you face off against fellow Trainers for the chance to "have a wish granted". Still no release date, though.</p>

<h2><em>Rhythm Heaven Groove&nbsp;</em>brings more fun rhythm minigames next year</h2>

<p>Next, we got to see a new entry in the&nbsp;<em>Rhythm Heaven&nbsp;</em>series, which is always welcome. This one will have lots of the franchise's signature quirky, off-the-wall minigames when it comes to Switch next year.</p>

<h2>Nintendo's new Virtual Game Card system looks...odd</h2>

<p>It looks like Nintendo is introducing a new system for game-sharing between Switch consoles. The Virtual Game Card system will render each digital purchase as a Virtual Game Card, which can then be loaded onto second Switch consoles using local communication.</p>

<p>Two systems can share cards freely, and you can also lend cards out to those on your family Switch account for two weeks. Nintendo says this system will make "digital games even easier to use", and it's being added in late April. It'll be used on Switch 2 as well.</p>

<h2>More sizzle reel goodness</h2>

<p>A few more games are making their way to Switch, and we got a sizzle reel for them. Here are the games that were featured in that reel.</p>

<ul><li><em>High on Life&nbsp;</em>(May 6th)</li>
	<li><em>Star Overdrive&nbsp;</em>(April 10th)</li>
	<li><em>The Wandering Village&nbsp;</em>(July 17th)</li>

<h2><em>Everybody's Golf: Hot Shots&nbsp;</em>brings wacky golf to Switch this year</h2>

<p>A new&nbsp;<em>Everybody's Golf&nbsp;</em>game is heading to Switch this year, bringing the series' signature cartoony golfing action to Nintendo's console. It'll support local play or online multiplayer for up to 4 players.</p>
