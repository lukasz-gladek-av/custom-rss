            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-sales-8m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Warhorse Studios has announced that&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance&nbsp;</em>sales have crossed another big sales barrier just a few months before the sequel is due to launch.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance&nbsp;</em>has sold eight million copies since launching back in 2018, which works out at more than a million copies a year (on average, at least; the studio doesn't break down when those sales occurred, of course).</p>

<p>This also means&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance&nbsp;</em>has managed to sell around two million copies in around nine months; back in February, it was announced that the game had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-sales-six-million">crossed the six million mark</a>. Looks like Warhorse's RPG really is a steady seller.</p>

<p>Originally due to arrive this year,&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>will instead be launching on February 11th; it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-delay">delayed back in August</a>&nbsp;owing to a need for "a tiny bit more time" on Warhorse's part.</p>

<p>When it does arrive, however,&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>is promising just as weighty and lengthy an RPG as its predecessor. In late August, it was revealed that the game's script <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-script-words">will have over two million words</a>, so if you like a lot of dialogue and text in your RPGs, you're in luck.</p>




<p>As for the original&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em>, it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/acclaimed-open-world-rpg-kingdom-come-deliverance-coming-to-nintendo-switch">ported to Nintendo Switch</a> earlier this year, which means it's now possible to play the RPG on all major platforms (and I'd recommend you do so if you want to be fully prepared for the followup).</p>

<p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/379430/Kingdom_Come_Deliverance/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP2047-CUSA07238_00-KCDGAME010000000" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 4</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/kingdom-come-deliverance/BNBWFH89FCF1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox One</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/kingdom-come-deliverance-royal-edition-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>, and it's also playable on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S via backwards compatibility. The sequel is due out on February 11th, and you can read <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-preview-bigger-better-and-more-approachable">our preview of it here</a> if you want to know how it's shaping up.</p>
