During the LVO 2025 Preview show, the tabletop publisher announced new army boxes for several big franchises: <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Warhammer 40,000</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-age-of-sigmar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Age of Sigmar</a></em>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/warhammer-old-world-core-boxes-announced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>The Old World</em></a>. Here is everything they announced.</p>

<h2>The LVO 2025 Preview Show Reveals</h2>

<p>Games Workshop made several major announcements as part of the LVO 2025 Preview Show. Several of those announcements involved new army boxes coming to their games.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lvo-2025-preview-soulblight-gravelords.jpg?itok=cDEbzbx8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lvo-2025-preview-soulblight-gravelords.jpg?itok=-fsYQqG4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The first of these announcements is the return of the <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/yu1duwle/lvo-preview-2025-the-barrow-kingdoms-rise-to-serve-the-soulblight-gravelords/" rel="nofollow">Soulblight Gravelords</a> to <em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em>. The vampiric nobles of this army have made a pact with the armies of the Barrow Kingdoms, adding new legions of undead to their ranks.</p>

<p>The aptly named Deathrattle army box will include these new skeletal miniatures, the latest Soulblight Gravelords Battletome, and 55 warscroll cards.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lvo-2025-preview-elves-of-ulthuan-army.jpg?itok=KvLxuOMw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lvo-2025-preview-elves-of-ulthuan-army.jpg?itok=HDK2WnO7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Going back to the time of <em>Warhammer The Old World</em>, Games Workshop previewed a new <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/q4oh518o/lvo-preview-2025-the-resplendent-host-of-ulthuan/" rel="nofollow">Elves of Ulthuan</a> army. The strong yet prideful army stands alongside named units like Ishaya Vess against the forces of Chaos. In addition, these miniatures will have both returning plastic and metal kits.</p>

<p>The High Elf Realms Battalion Box will include an updated Arcane Journal, dice, reference cards, and 66 miniatures. Those miniatures include 32 Elven Spearmen, 32 Elven Archers, and two Tiranoc Chariots.</p>

<p>Another army coming to <em>Warhammer The Old World</em> are the <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/jbz6zd6h/lvo-preview-2025-a-blind-bray-shaman-grants-a-glimpse-of-the-future-of-the-old-world/" rel="nofollow">Beastmen Brayherds</a>. This preview is more of a teaser, showing some artwork and a Bray-Shaman miniature. Hopefully, new details will come later.</p>

The Ash Wastes Nomads are getting a new book, <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/zlyt0pyr/lvo-preview-2025-new-nomads-rule-the-dunes-of-the-ash-wastes/" rel="nofollow"><em>Tribes of the Wastelands</em></a>, which will give them new gang rules, hired guns, and new Dramatis Personae.</p>

<p>Those new hired guns include Sha'dar Hunters, sneaky close-quarters scouts, and Arthromite Spinewyrms, ferocious worm monsters tamed for their shear power.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lvo-2025-preview-noise-marine-artwork.jpg?itok=MmnXR6dc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lvo-2025-preview-noise-marine-artwork.jpg?itok=nZK638qy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Lastly, <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> will see the return of a Chaos Space Marine army. The <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/evne31tw/lvo-preview-2025-establish-exactly-how-much-is-too-much-with-the-emperors-children/" rel="nofollow">Champions of Slaanesh</a> army box brings back the Emperor's Children. That means loud Noise Marines, strategic Lords Exultant, and devastating Tormentors. The army box will contain the latest codex, two units of six Noise Marines, two units of 10 Infractors which can be built as Tormentors, and a Lord Exultant.</p>

<p>The second preview was for a new Nurgle. The <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/elxrte0d/lvo-preview-2025-nurgle-coughs-up-a-new-lord-of-poxes/" rel="nofollow">Lord of Pox</a> miniature is a unit that continues the Death Guard's whole motif of pestilence and disease. Aside from some preview images however, not much else was revealed.</p>

<h2>Fifth Place -&nbsp;<b>Kill Team 3rd Edition</b></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tabletop-game-of-the-year-kill-team.jpg?itok=4Vhbrids 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tabletop-game-of-the-year-kill-team.jpg?itok=WKsvZS5m 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>Written by Adam Potts</em></p>

<p>The latest version of the Warhammer 40K skirmish wargame streamlined a lot of rules (and got rid of the crazy shapes for measuring), and while the 2nd edition was great, this edition feels more polished and I love the addition of the free faction rules online, letting you build your force out of your existing models without any other purchase. It also introduced a great cooperative/solo mode (at the cost of the narrative campaign play, which we hope they bring back).</p>

<h2><b>Fourth Place - The Magnus Archives Roleplaying Game</b></h2>



<p><em>Written by Tyler Chancey</em></p>

<p>This year, Monte Cook Games managed two impressive tasks. Adapting the cult horror podcast series The Magnus Archives into a fun, atmospheric TTRPG. Second, through that adaptation introduce a compelling mental Stress system and with it a layer of cosmic horror into the award-winning Cypher System. Truly a wonder to behold.</p>



<h2><b>Third Place - The Lord of the Rings: Duel for Middle-earth</b></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tabletop-game-of-the-year-lord-of-the-rings-duel.jpg?itok=pNlkit7Z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tabletop-game-of-the-year-lord-of-the-rings-duel.jpg?itok=MI9Mg8Ca 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>Written by Giaco Furino</em></p>

<p>When you give the elevator pitch of this game (a LOTR reskinning of <i>7 Wonders: Duel</i>, which is itself a 2-player version of&nbsp;<em>7 Wonders</em>) you'd be excused for thinking this is just a cash grab using a strong IP. But you'd be more wrong than Boromir suggesting one cannot simply walk into Mordor! With a tense back and forth, fun mechanics built around building a card tableau, and multiple routes to victory (including map control, points, and more),&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings: Duel for Middle-earth</em>&nbsp;was one of the most surprising gaming experiences we've had this year!</p>

<h2><b>Second Place - HeroQuest First Light</b></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tabletop-game-of-the-year-heroquest-first-light.jpeg?itok=nW8P3jKt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tabletop-game-of-the-year-heroquest-first-light.jpeg?itok=xtO-3CEZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>Written by Andrew Stretch</em></p>

<p>For families wanting to begin to broach more complicated TTRPGs with young family members HeroQuest First Light is an all-in-one box that will have them dungeon diving in no time. With a versatile game board that can be explored nearly infinite ways, and quick to grasp but satisfying combat, it becomes a bridge between a traditional board game and a pen and paper RPG. An added benefit is the GM Companion App that will allow for a party of four to explore without needing a GM lowering the barrier to entry even further.</p>

<h2><b>First Place - Wyrmspan</b></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tabletop-game-of-the-year-wyrmspan.jpeg?itok=BQua3WM0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tabletop-game-of-the-year-wyrmspan.jpeg?itok=N-HrbQ6U 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>Written by Giaco Furino</em></p>

<p><em>Wyrmspan</em>&nbsp;is a game that takes something incredible and perfects upon it further, pushing the design right up to the limits to create a bold, inviting, and strategically rewarding experience. I think&nbsp;<em>Wyrmspan&nbsp;</em>may be one of the most engrossing gaming experiences I've had this year, and fans of the original&nbsp;<em>Wingspan</em>&nbsp;absolutely need to check this game out as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Even if the birding aspect is what initially drew you into&nbsp;<em>Wingspan</em>, rest assured that this game - full of its own swath of gorgeous illustrations - will completely sink its talons into you and your gaming group!</p>
