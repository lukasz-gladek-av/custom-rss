This sneak peek features the new <em>Age of Sigmar</em> Deathrattle army, the newest edition to the Soulblight Gravelords.</p>

<h2>The <em>Age of Sigmar</em> Deathrattle Army Preview</h2>

<p>In an official <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/jellrva2/deathrattle-army-set-this-skeleton-legion-has-a-bone-to-pick-with-the-mortal-realms/" rel="nofollow">Warhammer-Community post</a>, Games Workshop breaks down what the new <em>Age of Sigmar</em> Deathrattle army will bring to the gaming table.</p>

Given this army is home to vampires and liches, this tracks. This is important since it ties into a new feature: Cursed Sepulchres. These are fonts of necromantic power that you can set up on the battlefield as part of the Deploy Faction Terrain step of your Deployment Phase.</p>

<p>This terrain is crucial since they are conduits for Manifestations and rallying points for Rising Dead units. These are units that start in the grave but can be deployed within 6" of one of these Cursed Sepulchres. The upside of being undead is they don't stay dead for long.</p>

<p>One set of units in the <em>Age of Sigmar</em> Deathrattle army is the Barrow Knights. Their passive, Knights of the King, give all nearby units Ward 5+. That is bad enough, but then there's the end of turn ability, Cursed to Rise Once More, which lets you bring back one slain model.</p>

<p>On the more offensive end is the Wight King unit. In addition to solid stats and a ferocious skeletal steed, the Wight King can inclict an Ancient Barrow Curse on a unit it crits. This curse will cause a -1 to all saves. A unit can only be cursed once, but multiple units can be affected.</p>

<p>Naturally, this <em>Age of Sigmar</em> Deathrattle army preview is just a glimpse at what these units will bring to the game. There is still plenty more to be seen with this faction of the undead. More that may be unearthed in its upcoming battletome.</p>
