            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A team of modders calling itself Slurm Team has created a mod for the classic 2003 open-world game&nbsp;<em>The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run&nbsp;</em>based on&nbsp;<em>Futurama</em>, and you can check out a demo right now.</p>

<p>As spotted by the good folks at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-simpsons-hit-run-modders-have-made-their-own-futurama-total-conversion-with-future-and-ramas" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Rock Paper Shotgun</a>,&nbsp;<em>Futurama: Hit &amp; Run</em>'s demo is available to <a href="https://modbakery.donutteam.com/projects/view/48" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">download now</a> from Mod Bakery, and it's got a pretty significant slice of the final mod for you to take a look at as well.</p>

<p>The aptly-named&nbsp;<em>Futurama: Hit &amp; Run&nbsp;</em>requires you to have a copy of the original game on PC, and you'll also need the Lucas'&nbsp;<em>Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run&nbsp;</em>Mod Launcher program, which, as the name suggests, allows you to launch mods for the game (as well as adding various other improvements).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/futurama-hit-run-mod-fry-bender.jpg?itok=-t_qDKBU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/futurama-hit-run-mod-fry-bender.jpg?itok=qrOBjT7V 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Futurama: Hit &amp; Run&nbsp;</em>has a demo for you to check out right now.</figcaption></figure><p>The demo comes complete with four story missions and a bonus mission, as well as a wager race and three street races by way of side activities. It's also got four costumes and six vehicles for you to drive.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to nine "gags" and one "secret gag", as well as 25 wasps that serve as the mod's collectibles.&nbsp;<em>Futurama: Hit &amp; Run&nbsp;</em>even comes with a custom version of&nbsp;<em>The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run</em>'s map based on New New York, as well as custom music.</p>

<p>There is one caveat, though. Slurm Team says&nbsp;<em>Futurama: Hit &amp; Run&nbsp;</em>comes with generative AI-based voice acting for now; the team already has "professional voice artists" lined up for the full mod release, but for now, you'll hear AI voices. If that's a deal-breaker, you may want to wait for the mod's full release.</p>




<p>This is probably the closest thing you're going to get to an actual&nbsp;<em>Futurama&nbsp;</em>video game in the near future (assuming you're not content with&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-futurama-crossover" rel="nofollow"><em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>skins</a>, that is), so if you're a fan of the futuristic animated comedy series, I'd recommend giving the mod a look.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Sims Mobile to Shut Down in January]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sims-mobile-shutdown-january</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-sims-mobile-to-shut-down-in-january.1329598/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has announced that&nbsp;<em>The Sims Mobile&nbsp;</em>will be shutting down early next year, and that the update being made available today will serve as the game's final patch before shutdown.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-mobile/news/final-update" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>The Sims Mobile&nbsp;</em>website, EA says the game's servers will be closing down on January 20th next year. Since this is an online-only game, that means you won't be able to play it anymore, and it doesn't sound like there will be any kind of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-offline-december" rel="nofollow"><em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp</em>-style offline version</a> either.</p>

<p><em>The Sims Mobile</em>'s final update will offer the chance to experience several seasonal events between now and January, including today's Eerie Autumn event, Season's Greetings in December, and the New Year's Dock and Roll treasure hunt towards the end of the year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-sims-mobile-shutdown-house.jpg?itok=OhGJm3Rr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-sims-mobile-shutdown-house.jpg?itok=efPDojjC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Sims Mobile&nbsp;</em>isn't sticking around for much longer.</figcaption></figure><p>Today's update also marks the end of the ability to purchase in-game currency for real cash in&nbsp;<em>The Sims Online</em>. Any SimCash, Simoleons, or Tickets you still have in the game can be used until the date of the game's shutdown.</p>

<p>Additionally, EA is awarding all players unlimited energy to "complete projects and enjoy the last few months of play", and on January 6th, all of&nbsp;<em>The Sims Mobile</em>'s in-game content will unlock for all players, which EA says will help you to "experience everything&nbsp;<em>The Sims Mobile&nbsp;</em>has to offer" before it disappears.</p>

<p>If you've already downloaded&nbsp;<em>The Sims Mobile&nbsp;</em>but you've deleted it from your device, you can download and play it again until January 20th, but after that date, both the game and any save data you might have will be deleted for good.</p>

<p>EA doesn't clarify a reason for&nbsp;<em>The Sims Mobile&nbsp;</em>being delisted, but it's pretty easy to guess that the game isn't pulling the kind of player numbers the publisher wants in order to keep the experience alive.</p>

The game will be delisted from those storefronts tomorrow, so you've got until then to download it.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New MindsEye Report Alleges "No Coherent Direction" and Heavy Crunch During Development]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mindseye-failure-new-report</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-mindseye-report-alleges-no-coherent-direction-and-heavy-crunch-during-development.1329595/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report has emerged which may shed some light on why ill-fated third-person shooter&nbsp;<em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>flopped so disastrously when it launched earlier this year, and the reasons are probably going to sound pretty familiar to you.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gzn34gwvwo" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">article</a> for the BBC, reporter Tom Richardson spoke to former staff who worked for developer Build a Rocket Boy (which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mindseye-build-a-rocket-boy-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">underwent a hefty round of layoffs</a> earlier this year following&nbsp;<em>MindsEye</em>'s release).</p>

<p>An ex-developer known as "Jamie" (which isn't their real name) told Richardson that <i>Everywhere</i>, the user-generated content sandbox which was BARB's initial focus, was "quite special", but that once the studio's focus shifted to&nbsp;<em>MindsEye</em>, boss Leslie Benzies "never decided what game he wanted to make".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/build-a-rocket-boy-everywhere-mindseye.jpg?itok=CVb_3x0x 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/build-a-rocket-boy-everywhere-mindseye.jpg?itok=uUDg0txO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A former Build a Rocket Boy developer described sandbox project&nbsp;<em>Everywhere&nbsp;</em>as "quite special".</figcaption></figure><p>Jamie says there was "no coherent direction" on&nbsp;<em>MindsEye</em>'s development, and that Benzies would routinely request huge changes to features or missions in the game. Jamie says the team referred to these bug and feature requests as "Leslies", and that they "had to be taken care of" immediately.</p>

<p>Additionally, former staff at Build a Rocket Boy allege that&nbsp;<em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>was developed under crunch conditions, with staff routinely working additional unpaid overtime hours during the week in order to finish the game.</p>

<p>Former employee Margherita Peloso, known as Marg, says they attempted to raise concerns regarding the state of&nbsp;<em>MindsEye</em>, but that they were "laughed at" by management. Marg says staff felt they were "commanded to give a lot to the company without too much in return".</p>

<p>According to Richardson, ex-Build a Rocket Boy workers are "pessimistic" about whether&nbsp;<em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>can be turned around, despite assurances from BARB that this is the studio's intention.</p>




<p>If you need a reminder,&nbsp;<em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>launched earlier this year to a decidedly negative reception from both players and critics alike (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/mindseye-review-mideye" rel="nofollow">ourselves very much included</a>).</p>

<p>The <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mindseye-launch-messy" rel="nofollow">game's launch</a> resulted in players requesting refunds over what they perceived to be unacceptable bugs and performance issues, as well as a sponsorship for streamer CohhCarnage being pulled at the last minute as reports of&nbsp;<em>MindsEye</em>'s many problems poured in.</p>

<p><em>MindsEye</em>'s launch was so bad, in fact, that it appears to have prompted publisher IO Interactive to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/io-interactive-mindseye-third-party-publishing" rel="nofollow">reconsider its entire relationship</a> with third-party publishing, although that didn't stop UKIE boss Nick Poole from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ukie-nick-poole-mindseye-scottish-gaming" rel="nofollow">seemingly citing the game</a> as an example of the strength of the Scottish gaming industry.</p>

<p>I'm not entirely sure why you'd want to, but if you're so inclined, you can check out&nbsp;<em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3265250/MindsEye/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/mindseye/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/mindseye/9PJ9WXK3V9FN" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>
