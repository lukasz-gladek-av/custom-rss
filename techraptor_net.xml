            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced that another retro game has made its way to the Nintendo Switch Online service, and this time, it's beloved GameCube platformer <em>Wario World</em>.</p><p>Yesterday, the gaming giant revealed that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-n64-december-2025-rayman" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5c545bd7-8940-4a33-a061-5c9542586bb3" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">two N64 platformers</a> would make their way to the service, but now, if you're <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-gamecube-switch-2-online" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="241c07c4-1dc7-413f-8a41-5b112e805b97" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">a Switch 2 player</a> (and a Switch Online Expansion Pack member, of course), you can enjoy a third at no extra cost.</p><p>If you're not familiar with <em>Wario World</em>, it's a 3D platformer released for the GameCube back in 2003. Unlike its sister <em>Mario </em>series, <em>Wario World </em>is largely a linear affair that mixes in elements of beat-'em-ups and other genres as well.</p><figure role="group">

<p>Although the game is, of course, published by Nintendo, <em>Wario World </em>was developed by Treasure, best known for run-and-gun games and shooters like <em>Radiant Silvergun </em>and <em>Gunstar Heroes</em>.</p><p>At time of writing, <em>Wario World </em>is still the last mainline 3D platformer in which the character appeared; he's starred in <em>WarioWare </em>minigame compilations and 2D sidescrollers since, but <em>Wario World </em>is still the place to go if you want to see him strutting his stuff in 3D.</p><p><em>Wario World </em>joins a number of other GameCube games that have made their way to Nintendo Switch Online; others include the likes of "survival horror" classic <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/luigis-mansion-nintendo-switch-online" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="559128f7-0f60-43f5-a4e0-64e6a9d1d5b0" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Luigi's Mansion</em></a> and platformer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chibi-robo-switch-online" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5eda1a19-710c-4126-8f24-86dd16fbc1ae" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Chibi-Robo!</em></a>.</p><p>They've joined an initial lineup that includes games like <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</em>, <em>F-Zero GX</em>, and <em>SoulCalibur II</em>, and with more being drip-fed to subscribers on a regular basis, it's a good time to be nostalgic for the GameCube.</p>
<p><em>Wario World </em>is available right now via Nintendo Switch Online, but you will need an Expansion Pack addon to play it. Thankfully, you'll also get access to Genesis, N64, and Game Boy Advance games if you pick it up, so it's not just GameCube titles waiting for you.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
