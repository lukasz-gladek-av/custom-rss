<p>Continuing down the top ten, Capcom's <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>is in fourth place for 2025, which demonstrates <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-10m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3047bd12-37c9-4b65-bd39-064968be79fa" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">just how strong initial sales were</a> (even if things did start to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-ps5-barrier-capcom" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a0c5ff11-5fb9-4929-804b-8a8d4f7adae0" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">peter out after a few months</a>).</p><p>Fifth place goes to <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>, which may be a little worryingly low for Activision and Microsoft, especially since the game's biggest rival is in the top spot.</p><p>In sixth, seventh, and eighth place are three EA sports titles, namely <em>Madden NFL 26</em>, <em>EA Sports College Football 26</em>, and <em>EA Sports FC 26 </em>respectively, with the final two spots in the top ten taken up by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/oblivion-remastered-sales-circana-april-2025" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="64e25692-338e-455e-b91a-4b1b51fbb682" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">the <em>Oblivion </em>remaster</a> and <em>Black Ops 6</em>.</p><p>Hardware-wise, it probably won't come as a surprise to learn that the Switch 2 led the year in both unit and dollar terms; it's a new piece of Nintendo kit, after all, so there was almost no chance it was going to be outperformed by two five-year-old consoles (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-sales-wii-u-vita-dreamcast" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="91ebec60-06fa-4b54-b925-a0fb963092d1" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">almost being the operative word</a>).</p><figure role="group">

<p>When it comes to December as a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3mczdurb4ik2b" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">single month</a>, <em>Black Ops 7 </em>managed to take the top spot for software, with <em>NBA 2K26 </em>and <em>Battlefield 6 </em>trailing in second and third place, respectively.</p><p>As always, it's worth reading Mat Piscatella's <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3mczdup376s2b" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">full thread</a> if you want some more nerdy stats about the state of gaming sales as 2026 gets started.
