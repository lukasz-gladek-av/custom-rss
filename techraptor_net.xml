            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>According to a new report, Ubisoft canceled an in-development&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>game that was set to take place in the Reconstruction-era USA last year, citing political concerns.</p>

<p>That's per Stephen Totilo of <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/scoop-ubisoft-cancelled-a-post-civil" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Game File</a>, who cites "interviews with five current and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-layoffs-leamington-closure" rel="nofollow">former Ubisoft employees</a>". Said employees told Totilo that they were "enthusiastic" about this potential&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>game, but were "frustrated by its cancellation", which they saw as "Ubisoft bowing to controversy".</p>

<p>If Totilo is to be believed, players would have taken the role of a Black former slave who had moved from the South in order to begin a new life. The Assassins would have recruited said protagonist, and he would have fought the Ku Klux Klan, among other hostile forces.</p>

<p>If you need reminding, said backlash revolved around whether or not the historical Yasuke (who was a real person) would actually have held the rank of samurai. Its proponents claimed historical inaccuracy, but those opposed to the backlash accused its adherents of covert racism.</p>

<p>The second reason the&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>project in question was canceled was, according to Totilo's report, the political climate in the US, which a source said was "too unstable" to justify the continuation of the game's development.</p>

<p>The sources to whom Totilo spoke said that cancelling a project in the gaming industry was not unusual (to which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-project-baxter-canceled-layoffs" rel="nofollow">recent events</a> will certainly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/contraband-canceled-report-avalanche-studios" rel="nofollow">attest</a>), but that doing so for the above reasons was.</p>

<p>The French studio also announced back in September that future games in the&nbsp;<em>Far Cry&nbsp;</em>series, another franchise that serves as one of Ubisoft's flagships, would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/far-cry-multiplayer-ubisoft" rel="nofollow">focus much more on their multiplayer elements</a>.</p>
