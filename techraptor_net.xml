            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/tarkir-dragonstorm-commander-deck-reviews<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Tarkir: Dragonstorm </em>is, at the time of this publication, in pre-release, and with each clan getting its own preconstructed deck, we thought it only made sense to take a look at each one with some&nbsp;<em>Tarkir: Dragonstorm</em> commander deck reviews. Unlike past commander deck overviews we've done like with Aetherdrift's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/aetherdrift-commander-living-energy-review-and-upgrades" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" MTG Aetherdrift Commander: Living Energy Review and Upgrades">Living Energy</a>, these are focused just on reviews, and not on upgrades as well.</p>

<h2>Jeskai Strikers Review</h2>

<p>The latest Spellslinger Commander preconstructed deck, Jeskai Strikers has plenty of potential power for <a href="https://techraptor.net/topic/magic-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Magic: The Gathering"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> spellcasters everywhere.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/jeskai-strikers-commanders.jpg?itok=LyMbDa_D 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/jeskai-strikers-commanders.jpg?itok=uMPKy6QA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Its commander options are <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/7/shiko-and-narset-unified" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Shiko and Narset, Unified">Shiko and Narset, Unified</a>, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/2/elsha-threefold-master" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Elsha, Threefold Mentor">Elsha, Threefold Mentor</a>, each of which wants the deck to go in somewhat different ways. Shiko and Narset want a mixture of cheap spells and larger payoffs that target to maximize the return from its ability, which doesn't require a focus on instants and sorceries unlike many cards like it. Meanwhile, Eisha wants lots of small spells and voltron type inclusions so that the number of tokens can be maximized, and then exploited by playing spells to pump them all.</p>

<p>There are two standouts in the new cards. Starting with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/40/will-of-the-jeskai" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Will of the Jeskai">Will of the Jeskai</a> it is both a <a href="https://mtg.wiki/page/Wheel_effect" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Wheel Effect in Magic: The Gathering">wheel</a> and a <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mm3/105/past-in-flames" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Past in Flames">Past in Flames</a> effect for a lot of value in spellslinger and combo decks. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/16/tempest-technique" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Tempest Technique">Tempest Technique</a> is the other allstar having the Storm Mechanic on it, and its pump getting exponentially larger as you get more of it on a creature.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/jeskai-strikers-will-of-the-jeskai-and-tempest-technique.jpg?itok=ZEsL5HWQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/jeskai-strikers-will-of-the-jeskai-and-tempest-technique.jpg?itok=D8q0IT6k 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As for reprint value, it’s a bit weak in the area. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/92/narsets-reversal" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Narset's Reversal">Narset’s Reversal</a>, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/157/lier-disciple-of-the-drowned" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Lier, Disciple of the Drowned">Lier, Disciple of the Drowned </a>lead a number of $5-$10 cards but the deck lacks a $10+ marquee reprint in it.</p>

<p>While lacking the raw power of last year’s Quick Draw Jeskai Strikers hit most of the expected marks for a spellslinger deck. Its largest flaw is how it is pulled in a few directions, which can show up in hiccups in gameplay, but provides lines in how to improve it. Others may also regret that it doesn’t significantly innovate on the spellslinger archetype in any way.</p>

<h2>Mardu Surge Review</h2>

<p>The Mardu clan take center stage with Mardu Surge, an aggressive WBR deck capturing the relentless spirit of the spirit.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mardu-surge-commanders.jpg?itok=6o1LcKf1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mardu-surge-commanders.jpg?itok=79FPzpPp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Led by <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/10/zurgo-stormrender" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Zurgo Stormrender">Zurgo Stormrender</a> and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/6/neriv-crackling-vanguard" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Neriv, Crackling Vanguard">Neriv, Crackling Vanguard</a>, the deck features a pair of aggressive aristocrats commanders. Zurgo makes you a token each attack, and provides payoffs when you kill tokens in the form of cards, or damage. Meanwhile, Neriv comes with bodies, and provides card draw that rewards the range of different tokens in the deck. Both synergize well, and work together, for an aggressive, token heavy plan.</p>

<p>Among the new cards two stand out to me quite clearly. The first is <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/11/ainok-strike-leader" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Ainok Strike Leader">Ainok Strike Leader</a>, a bear who when it or your commander attack it creates a 1/1 goblin attacking each opponent. Beyond that 5 power attack force for 2 mana, it can also sacrifice to give your creature tokens indestructible for a turn, making it quite a powerful and flexible creature. The other one is this deck’s inclusion in the powerful Will cycle with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/17/will-of-the-mardu" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Will of the Mardu">Will of the Mardu</a>. This one can serve almost as a pseudo-fog by giving you one creature for each an opponent of your choice has, while also being an army in a box. It pairs that with a burn for each creature you control to an opponent.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mardu-surge-ainokstrike-leader-and-will-of-the-mardu.jpg?itok=5FNcTi_V 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mardu-surge-ainokstrike-leader-and-will-of-the-mardu.jpg?itok=NVs8nDYM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>They are joined with a marquee reprint in <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/118/grand-crescendo" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Grand Cresendo">Grand Crescendo</a>. Previously only printed in Streets of New Capenna Commander, this instant protects your creatures, and creates an army. It’s joined by some other solid value cards like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/181/gix-yawgmoth-praetor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Gix, Yawgmoth Praetor">Gix, Yawgmoth Praetor</a>, and a number of other cards in the $5-$9 range.</p>

<p>Mardu Surge is a powerful go-wide deck with a lot of strong cards, and synergy in it. While it can, of course, be improved, out of the box this deck is worth buying both from a value and playability standpoint.</p>

<h2>Sultai Arisen Review</h2>

<p>Rise from the grave, or at least otherwise interact with there is the plan for the Sultai Arisen preconstructed deck.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sultai-arisen-commanders.jpg?itok=E16-Nbzf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sultai-arisen-commanders.jpg?itok=dvrS0Mzo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Sultai Arisen’s commanders are a tale of two stories in <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/5/kotis-sibsig-champion" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Kotis, Sibsig Champion">Kotis, Sibsig Champion</a>, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/8/teval-the-balanced-scale" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Teval, The Balanced Scale">Teval, the Balanced Scale</a>. Kotis is not a particularly interesting commander, as it’s an ability we’ve seen before, and better. The escape-esq cost of exiling cards to escape is notable, and the growing isn’t enough to redeem it. On the other hand, Teval is fire, and should be moved right into the command zone. A solid 4/4 for 4 flying, it mills 3 on attack, getting you a land back, and anytime you grab something from your grave, you get a zombie token. There’s a lot of things to do with the dragon, and it’s no surprise he’s an early leader for one of the most popular commanders.</p>

<p>Sultai Arisen’s new cards are tied to graveyard mechanics as you would expect. To highlight two cards I call attention to <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/25/afterlife-from-the-loam" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Afterlife from the Loam">Afterlife from the Loam</a>, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/28/tevals-judgment" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Teval's Judgment">Teval’s Judgment</a>. Afterlife from the Loam can cost only BBB (with Delve 5) and gets you the best creature from each player’s graveyard. While that’s a powerful reanimator spell, Teval’s Judgment is a strong value piece for decks that want to play out of their graveyard, giving mana, cards, and creatures for doing so.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sultai-arisen-afterlife-from-the-loam-and-tevals-judgment.jpg?itok=OmXIPajQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sultai-arisen-afterlife-from-the-loam-and-tevals-judgment.jpg?itok=gOrdUe8M 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>There are some solid reprints in the deck in <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/192/ob-nixilis-the-fallen" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Ob Nixilis, The Fallen">Ob Nixilis, The Fallen</a> running over $15, and being a strong card. It’s joined by a series of $10ish reprints like the classic <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/96/life-from-the-loam" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Life from the Loam">Life from the Loam</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/176/dauthi-voidwalker" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Dauthi Voidwalker">Dauthi Voidwalker</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/295/lord-of-extinction" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Lord of Extinction">Lord of Extinction</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/352/command-beacon" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Command Beacon">Command Beacon</a>, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/354/crypt-of-agadeem" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Crypt of Agadeem ">Crypt of Agadeem </a>to give the deck a solid monetary value.</p>

<p>Overall Sultai Arisen brings a new marquee commander option in Teval, Balanced Scale, and provides a lot of useful cards for graveyard based decks in Sultai colors. It plays a bit lumpy, and its curve needs some smoothing, but there’s no denying the power here.</p>

<h2>Abzan Armor Review</h2>

<p>The tough Abzan come to play with a deck that’s all about toughness and making use of that toughness.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/abzan-armor-commanders.jpg?itok=MNvSdvy6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/abzan-armor-commanders.jpg?itok=DBcPrFUg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Commander options here are very split with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/4/felothar-the-steadfast" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Felothar the Steadfast">Felothar the Steadfast</a>, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/1/betor-ancestors-voice" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Betor, Ancestor’s Voice">Betor, Ancestor’s Voice</a>. Felothar the Steadfast is a new toughness matters commander who allows defenders to attack, and will compete for one of the top spots in that archetype with Arcades, the Strategist due to it also having an explosive card draw ability. Betor, Ancestor’s Voice isn’t really fit to lead the deck - while an interesting commander, the deck lacks the life gain and loss support that it really needs to work.</p>

<p>Abzan’s new cards are weaker overall than many of the others I feel. That’s not to say though that you shouldn’t be interested in <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/31/will-of-the-abzan" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Will of the Abzan">Will of the Abzan </a>as a strictly better <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fdn/187/zombify" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Zombify">Zombify</a> with upside, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/27/jaws-of-defeat" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Jaws of Defeat">Jaws of Defeat</a> will become an archetype staple for toughness matters decks. The new cards here are pretty narrow though.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/abzan-armor-will-of-the-abzan-and-jaws-of-defeat.jpg?itok=4RMdpi2Z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/abzan-armor-will-of-the-abzan-and-jaws-of-defeat.jpg?itok=v6UITLip 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Reprint wise the deck is led by <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/286/dragonlord-dromoka" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Dragonlord Dromoka">Dragonlord Dromoka</a>, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/268/seedborn-muse" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Seedborn Muse">Seedborn Muse</a>, with the former often around $15, and the latter a green staple typically over $10. Other than those though, reprints here are very narrow like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/336/weathered-sentinels" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Weathered Sentinels">Weathered Sentinels</a>, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/121/indomitable-ancients" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Indomitable Ancients">Indomitable Ancients</a>, or often not particularly desirable like the inevitable <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/142/zetalpa-primal-dawn" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Zetalpha, Primal Dawn">Zetalpha, Primal Dawn</a> printing.</p>

<p>I like some of what is going on in Abzan Armor, but the attempt to graft in a life-loss/life-gain theme with Betor and some of the cards interferes with the deck. It’s also light on card draw, relying on Felothar to carry that, making it fragile if it needs to restock.</p>

<h2>Temur Roar Review</h2>

<p>RAWR! Dragons Go RAWR! That in a nutshell encapsulated the Temur deck, as one of the most dragon forward decks we’ve ever seen from Wizards of the Coast.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/temur-roar-commanders.jpg?itok=SXMnWvLL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/temur-roar-commanders.jpg?itok=IL1K8Ot_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Led by your choice of <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/3/eshki-temurs-roar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Eshki, Temur’s Roar ">Eshki, Temur’s Roar </a>or <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/9/ureni-of-the-unwritten" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Ureni of the Unwritten">Ureni of the Unwritten</a>, you can see the focus here is on big creatures coming down fast. Eshki is a bit awkward as there are only a few creatures with power 6 or more to get the most from her ability. Ureni of the Unwritten is the more specific dragon focused commander and has a powerful ability that should have you put it in charge of this deck.</p>

<p>There are a fair number of new cards, including those from the main set. Exclusive to the Commander Deck I want to highlight <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/44/broodcaller-scourge" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Broodcaller Scourge">Broodcaller Scourge</a>, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/38/thundermane-dragon" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Thundermane Dragon">Thundermane Dragon</a>. The Broodcaller Scourge lets you cash in on the damage you’re doing with new permanents, synergizing particularly well with the <a href="https://scryfall.com/search?q=dragonstorm+set%3ATDM" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Dragonstorms">Dragonstorms </a>(especially <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdm/101/breaching-dragonstorm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Breaching Dragonstorm">Breaching Dragonstorm</a>) to get a lot of value out of your attack. Helping get you there is Thundermane Dragon, who lets you play creatures with power 4 or more from the top of your deck, and gives them haste.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/temur-roar-broodcaller-scourge-and-thundermane-dragon.jpg?itok=VXfoQpUz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/temur-roar-broodcaller-scourge-and-thundermane-dragon.jpg?itok=CNS5mgUZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Temur Roar really stands out in terms of reprint value. The inclusion of <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/218/hellkite-courser" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Hellkite Courser">Hellkite Courser</a>, a $20 card in its own right, is already a boon, but it’s accompanied by <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/226/nogi-draco-zealot" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Nogi, Draco-Zealot">Nogi, Draco-Zealot </a>in that same price range due to previous scarcity. This is the first reprinting for Nogi since its very limited printing in Game Night 3, and the only non-foil version. They are joined by a number of other useful dragon related cards, and solid reprints, giving the deck the best monetary value of the bunch.</p>

<p>Temur Roar may not be a great Temur clan deck, but it is a good dragon pre-con. Become like Sarkhan Vol, and worship the dragons with this deck, and toss in whatever other dragons you have with it.</p>

<hr><p>What do you think is the best commander deck from the bunch?
