            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-movie-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report has emerged which claims that a&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>movie is in the works, and that several major Hollywood studios are already engaged in a bidding war over the rights to said movie.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/split-fiction-movie-video-game-adaptation-1236344367/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Variety</a>, media company Story Kitchen is currently scouting writers and directors, as well as cast members, for the project. You might also recognize Story Kitchen's name from the likes of the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/live-action-dredge-movie" rel="nofollow"><em>Dredge&nbsp;</em>movie</a>, which was announced last year, as well as the upcoming&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/it-takes-two-movie-and-tv-adaptations-in-works" rel="nofollow"><em>It Takes Two&nbsp;</em>movie adaptation</a>.</p>

<p>Citing "sources at the Game Developers Conference (GDC) in San Francisco", Variety says that a number of "top Hollywood studios" are currently making offers for the rights to the&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>movie, although it sounds like nothing has been decided yet.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/split-fiction-movie-report-barriers.jpg?itok=9mK7HXCQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/split-fiction-movie-report-barriers.jpg?itok=72JyqCAo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>movie adaptation is apparently in the works.</figcaption></figure><p>Given&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>'s close focus on gameplay, I'm having a bit of a hard time imagining how a movie would work; I can only imagine some of the game's uniqueness will be lost in the transition. Still, it's testament to&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>'s popularity that a movie adaptation is already underway.</p>

<p>Of course, the movie makes a lot of sense from a financial perspective, too. After all,&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>managed to reach <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">two million sales in a single week</a>, so creating more media based around the IP is sound logic.</p>

<p>It's the same logic that drove Story Kitchen to create the&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two&nbsp;</em>adaptation, and that game recently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hazelight-josef-fares-new-ip-it-takes-two-sales" rel="nofollow">passed the 20 million sales mark</a>. It just remains to be seen whether&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>'s gaming audience would also be interested in a non-interactive version of the story.</p>




<p>In case you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>, it's the latest co-op adventure from&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>A Way Out&nbsp;</em>developer Hazelight, led by Josef Fares.</p>

<p>The game casts you and your co-op buddy as Mio and Zoe, two writers who must learn to work together when they're thrust into a diabolical machine that threatens to steal all of their ideas.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2001120/Split_Fiction/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/split-fiction/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/games/store/split-fiction/9n1wxxd1rl8d" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/painkiller-revival-fall-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/painkiller-revival-could-give-doom-the-dark-ages-a-run-for-its-money.1141320/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/painkiller-revival-fall-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Saber Interactive and developer Anshar Studios have announced a revival of the classic FPS&nbsp;<em>Painkiller</em>, and it's coming to PC and current-gen consoles sometime this fall.</p>

<p>The two studios describe&nbsp;<em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>as "an intense new spin on the classic action-shooter" that you can experience either solo or in co-op play. According to a press release,&nbsp;<em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>will support "online co-op for up to three players", which is a little odd given that it has four playable characters.</p>

<p>In any case, the game is promising "gruesomely detailed gothic environments" and the chance to "blast your way through hordes of demons and titanic terrors", so it sounds very much like Saber and Anshar are hoping to give Bethesda's&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marty-stratton-dark-ages-like-nothing-players-have-had-their-hands-on-in-doom-game" rel="nofollow">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>&nbsp;</em>a run for its money.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/painkiller-revival-pistol.jpg?itok=VeV-bHOr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/painkiller-revival-pistol.jpg?itok=drZT-ZK2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>is back. Rejoice.</figcaption></figure><p>The game will boast an emphasis on traversal, promising the ability to "jump, dash and hook" across each stage while engaging in "bloody, fast-paced combat". You can also look forward to a host of new weapons, as well as the return of some of the original's classic arsenal.</p>

<p>Four playable characters will be available: Ink, Void, Sol, and Roch. They'll each have "unique perks" you can take advantage of, and your abilities are upgradeable via the use of signature&nbsp;<em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>tarot cards as well.</p>

<p>It sounds as though those extra characters will be crucial to&nbsp;<em>Painkiller</em>, too, since the game will replace your co-op buddies with bots if you're playing on your own.</p>

<p>All of this will, according to Saber and Anshar, be set to a "powerful metal soundtrack". There's no other genre suitable for this kind of thing, really, but if Judas Priest's "Painkiller" doesn't feature in this game, I will be very disappointed indeed.</p>




<p>Saber and Anshar's&nbsp;<em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>reboot comes to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2300120/Painkiller/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10013491" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/p/9NMSW622HWNH" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> in the fall. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dave-the-diver-like-a-dragon-dlc-release-date-revealed-for-next-month.1141269/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dave-the-diver-like-dragon-dlc-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mintrocket has announced the release date for its upcoming&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver Like a Dragon&nbsp;</em>crossover, and the aptly-named&nbsp;<em>Ichiban's Holiday&nbsp;</em>is making its way to the cozy diving game-slash-restaurant sim next month.</p>

<p>As revealed by Mintrocket in a new Dev Dive video,&nbsp;<em>Ichiban's Holiday&nbsp;</em>is coming to&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver&nbsp;</em>on April 10th. It'll be available across all platforms on which you can play the game, and it'll introduce everyone's favorite lovable goof Ichiban Kasuga to the Blue Hole.</p>

<p>This will be the latest in a long string of&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/big-dave-diver-collaboration-update-balatro" rel="nofollow">collaborations</a>; the game has also entertained the likes of fiendishly addictive roguelike&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>, potion sim&nbsp;<em>Potion Craft</em>, and Shift Up's&nbsp;<em>Goddess of Victory: Nikke</em>, among others.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dave-the-diver-like-a-dragon-dlc-ichiban.jpg?itok=Cik3khLS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dave-the-diver-like-a-dragon-dlc-ichiban.jpg?itok=_T-5qCxc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Ichiban's Holiday&nbsp;</em>brings Ichiban Kasuga to the world of&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver&nbsp;</em>in April.</figcaption></figure><p>In the new video,&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver&nbsp;</em>director Jaeho Hwang and community manager Zoe Shin discuss how the collaboration with&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon&nbsp;</em>came about, as well as what you can expect from the upcoming DLC.</p>

<p>Rather sweetly, Hwang shows off some of the goodies he got when meeting longtime&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon&nbsp;</em>producer Masayoshi Yokoyama at last year's Tokyo Games Show, including signed copies of&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth&nbsp;</em>and a Korean translation of the script for the first&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon&nbsp;</em>game.</p>

<p>As for the crossover DLC itself, it'll see Ichiban and the bartender of his hangout spot Survive visiting Dave and Bancho's restaurant. As you might expect, it's not peaceful for long, and soon, Ichiban finds himself drawn into yet another adventure.</p>

<p>You can look forward to a new side-scrolling beat-'em-up minigame, as well as&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon</em>'s signature karaoke and appearances from several other franchise favorites. Hwang says he "basically put everything [he likes] about&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon&nbsp;</em>into this collaboration".</p>




<p>Unlike previous&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver&nbsp;</em>crossovers,&nbsp;<em>Ichiban's Holiday&nbsp;</em>will be paid DLC, which Hwang acknowledges might be "disappointing" for some. He also announces that the DLC will only be available for a "limited time of six months".</p>

<p><em>Dave the Diver</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Ichiban's Holiday&nbsp;</em>DLC launches on April 10th. The game is available to buy right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1868140/DAVE_THE_DIVER/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/dave-the-diver/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/dave-the-diver-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>
