            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-rally-games-pausing-codemasters<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has announced it will be "pausing" development on future rally racing games, including the <em>WRC&nbsp;</em>series, which has been running in one form or another since the early 2000s.</p>

<p>In a development <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-wrc/wrc-24/news/wrc-development-update" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">update</a> on its website, EA says that "every great journey eventually finds its finish line", and that it's "reached the end of the road working on <em>WRC</em>". As such, the 2024 season of&nbsp;<em>EA Sports WRC</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-sports-wrc-announced-promising-most-authentic-awe-inspiring-off-road-experience" rel="nofollow">released back in 2023</a>, will be both the game's last expansion and the last&nbsp;<em>WRC</em>-related thing you'll see from EA, at least for a while.</p>

<p>The studio says it's "pausing development plans on future rally titles", so it sounds like it's not just&nbsp;<em>WRC</em>, but also games like the&nbsp;<em>Dirt&nbsp;</em>series that won't be getting any future installments for the time being.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ea-rally-games-ending-development-car.jpg?itok=0HBHh69H 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ea-rally-games-ending-development-car.jpg?itok=BZ9KAiW0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>EA is pausing development on its rally games.</figcaption></figure><p>EA says its time with&nbsp;<em>WRC&nbsp;</em>was a "culmination of sorts for [its] Codemasters journey", and that it's "provided a home for every rally enthusiast" over the course of its&nbsp;<em>WRC&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Dirt&nbsp;</em>franchises.</p>

<p>News of EA pausing its rally games comes a year or so after <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/layoffs-codemasters-tinybuild-new-world-interactive" rel="nofollow">layoffs at Codemasters</a>, the studio responsible for the aforementioned franchises (as well as the&nbsp;<em>GRID&nbsp;</em>series and the official&nbsp;<em>F1&nbsp;</em>tie-in games, neither of which appear to be affected by this announcement).</p>

<p>The news also follows yesterday's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/respawn-layoffs-ea-cuts-titanfall-game" rel="nofollow">report that EA will lay off around 300 to 400 of its employees</a>, around 100 of whom work on games like&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Jedi&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends&nbsp;</em>for EA subsidiary Respawn. Both franchises remain active, however.</p>

<p>It's also worth noting that the official Codemasters <a href="https://x.com/Codemasters" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">X account</a> appears to have been scrubbed of all of its posts, suggesting that there may be a less-than-heroic end for the studio waiting in the wings following this announcement.</p>

Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-star-wars-crossover-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic Games is releasing a new&nbsp;<em>Fortnite Star Wars&nbsp;</em>crossover just in time for the May 4th celebrations, and it's bringing new map areas for you to explore, new character skins, and more.</p>

<p>This won't be&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s first&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>crossover; the two have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-fortnite-may-2024" rel="nofollow">clashed lightsabers</a> on a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-star-wars" rel="nofollow">number</a> of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-comes-with-fortnite-skin" rel="nofollow">prior occasions</a>, but this one's got some all-new stuff for you to enjoy. First up, you'll find four new&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em>-themed map areas to explore: the First Order Base, the Outpost Enclave, the Resistance Base, and Vader Samurai's Solitude, a modified version of the Shogun's Solitude area.</p>

<p>The new lightsaber weapon should give you new opportunities to get up close and personal with your enemies, although you'll have to train in the Force to use one (or loot one off a dead player, of course).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fortnite-star-wars-2025-darth-jar-jar.jpg?itok=kyxV5h9- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fortnite-star-wars-2025-darth-jar-jar.jpg?itok=8epLuFOk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Truly, a terrifying scene from a nightmare.</figcaption></figure><p>New character skins will also be added in this <i>Fortnite Star Wars&nbsp;</i>crossover, including the likes of the truly terrifying Darth Jar Jar, an alternate interpretation of everyone's (least) favorite Gungan.</p>

<p>Others include Mace Windu, a Mandalorian you can customize, and General Grievous, and any&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>event that allows you to play as General Grievous is automatically above criticism. I don't make the rules.</p>

<p>Excitingly, this event also gives you the chance to pilot an Imperial TIE Fighter, as well as take part in a range of time-limited events that will drop as the month of May goes on.</p>

<p>It'll all culminate in the Death Star Sabotage event, a final showdown with Emperor Palpatine that takes place on June 7th. Let's see him "somehow return" from this one.</p>




<p>It's all go in the world of&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>gaming right now. Recently, Respawn and Bit Reactor revealed&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Zero Company</em>, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-zero-company-respawn-bit-reactor" rel="nofollow">turn-based tactics game</a> set during the dying days of the Clone Wars. It doesn't have a release date yet, though, unfortunately.</p>

<p>In addition, five classic games from the franchise's long and storied history were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gog-preservation-program-star-wars" rel="nofollow">recently added to GOG's Preservation Program</a>, by which the storefront swears to keep certain titles updated in perpetuity even if their developers or publishers haven't made the same commitment.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Fortnite Star Wars&nbsp;</em>crossover event lands tomorrow, and you can read a full breakdown of what to expect from the event <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/strap-in-starfighter-star-wars-is-taking-over-in-fortnite-galactic-battle?lang=en-US" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>.</p>
