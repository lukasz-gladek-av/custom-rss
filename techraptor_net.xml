            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splitgate-2-1-0-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher 1047 Games has announced the&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>1.0 release date, and the full version of the portal-hopping FPS is coming sooner than you might think.</p>

<p>In a press release, 1047 Games reveals that&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2</em>'s full release is coming on June 6th. Given that the game only <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splitgate-2-open-beta-release-date" rel="nofollow">entered its open beta period in late May</a>, that's a pretty rapid turnaround.</p>

<p>The full version of the game will boast several new modes and improvements over the beta release, including new modes, new weapons, and a full map creator to allow you to make your very own<i>&nbsp;Splitgate 2&nbsp;</i>maps.</p>

Surprise!</figcaption></figure><p>Excitingly, 1047 Games says that there's still a "massive surprise" in store for the full release of&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2</em>, describing said surprise as "the biggest part" of the game. It'll be revealed during the Summer Game Fest show, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/summer-game-fest-2025-date-revealed" rel="nofollow">airs on the same day</a> as&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2</em>'s release.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2</em>, it's a multiplayer first-person shooter that essentially marries the arena-focused FPS action of games like&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>with the portal-jumping of, er,&nbsp;<em>Portal</em>.</p>

<p>You'll head into a variety of maps and use portals to traverse them, getting the drop on your enemies or setting up tactical ambushes with your portals to achieve victory. Alternatively, if you're me, you'll be firing portals anywhere you can in a frantic attempt to escape players way better than you at the game.</p>

<p>You can check out the new trailer for&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2</em>'s 1.0 release, described by 1047 Games as "surprisingly emotional", right here. Tissues at the ready.</p>




<p>Since launching into open beta in May,&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>has attracted a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2918300/Splitgate_2__Beta/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">"Mixed" rating</a> on Steam across over 7,000 reviews, with some players comparing it unfavorably to the original&nbsp;<em>Splitgate</em>.</p>

<p>Whether or not the full release remedies those issues remains to be seen, but at any rate,&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2918300/Splitgate_2__Beta/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010012" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/splitgate-2/9pf5q1b0fhsl" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a> in full on June 6th.</p>
