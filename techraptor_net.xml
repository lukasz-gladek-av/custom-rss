            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/as-we-descend-delayed-may<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Roguelike deckbuilder&nbsp;<em>As We Descend&nbsp;</em>has been delayed until May, but a concrete release date for the game has been revealed, so it won't be too much longer until you get to play it.</p>

<p>Back in February, it was announced that&nbsp;<em>As We Descend&nbsp;</em>would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/as-we-descend-early-access-release-date" rel="nofollow">arrive in Early Access in March</a>, but Kevin Chang, director of developer Box Dragon, says the game needs "a little more time in the oven" before it's ready.</p>

<p>As a sweetener, though, the game's demo, which is currently available on Steam, has been localized into 11 languages, including French, German, and Ukrainian, so more folks around the world can check it out before deciding to make a purchase.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/as-we-descend-delayed-early-access-combat.jpg?itok=kVMREYIL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/as-we-descend-delayed-early-access-combat.jpg?itok=v-FI3MAM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Deckbuilder&nbsp;<em>As We Descend&nbsp;</em>is landing a little later than anticipated.</figcaption></figure><p>Chang says Box Dragon has "big plans" for&nbsp;<em>As We Descend</em>, and that now is the "perfect time" to try the game out if you haven't already done so. He goes on to say that the game's Early Access launch is "just the beginning".</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>As We Descend</em>, it's a roguelike deckbuilder set in a post-apocalyptic world "where resources are scarce and monsters threaten humanity’s very existence". Well, it wouldn't be much of a post-apocalyptic world without life-threatening danger.</p>

<p>Gameplay-wise,&nbsp;<em>As We Descend&nbsp;</em>is split between its card-battling combat and its diplomacy systems, which will see you building relationships with key figures in order to stave off crises and make critical alliances.</p>

<p>According to Box Dragon, you can expect&nbsp;<em>As We Descend</em>'s setting to offer a "desperate city that evolves and crumbles in unique ways based on the player’s decisions", so it sounds like you'll need to be careful what you choose during conversations.</p>




<p><em>As We Descend&nbsp;</em>is coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1769830/As_We_Descend/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on May 28th, and a demo is available to try out right now if you want to see whether the game is your cup of (presumably poisoned) tea or not.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/v-rising-11-update-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/v-rising-1-1-update-brings-new-biome-and-more-next-month.1146666/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/v-rising-11-update-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Stunlock Studios has revealed the release date for&nbsp;<em>V Rising&nbsp;</em>Update 1.1, which will serve as the vampire survival game's first major update since its 1.0 release.</p>

<p>The developer first promised a big new update for the game back in January, when&nbsp;<em>V Rising&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/v-rising-sales-top-5-million" rel="nofollow">crossed five million sales</a>. Now, that update, named "Invaders of Oakveil", has a release date: April 28th.</p>

<p>Invaders of Oakveil's first major addition to&nbsp;<em>V Rising&nbsp;</em>is the eponymous Oakveil Woodlands, a new biome filled with "deadly enemies, new bosses, and dark magic techniques" for you to discover. As the name suggests, it's a forest biome.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/v-rising-update-1.1-invaders-of-oakveil.jpg?itok=2LPD8amB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/v-rising-update-1.1-invaders-of-oakveil.jpg?itok=snKXy4JZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>V Rising</em>'s 1.1 update is coming in April.</figcaption></figure><p>It's not just the new biome, though. Update 1.1 will also bring the ability to build custom duel arenas within your castle, then challenge your friends (or anyone you like) to a duel. Don't worry, though; duels won't have any consequences, so you can fight to your heart's content.</p>

<p>Three new weapons will be added in the form of the Claws, the Twinblade, and the Throwing Daggers, each of which, Stunlock says, will unlock "fresh combat strategies and unique playstyles". They'll be accompanied by seven new spells for you to test out.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to&nbsp;<em>V Rising</em>'s "biggest combat overhaul yet", which the developer says will bring "a deep stat rework, rebalanced gear, completely overhauled blood types, and powerful new customization tools".</p>

<p>All of this and more will be introduced as part of Invaders of Oakveil, and you can watch the debut trailer for the update (which admittedly doesn't give a whole lot away) right here.</p>




<p><em>V Rising&nbsp;</em>is an open-world survival game in which you play the vampiric lord of a castle. You must sally forth into the mortal world to collect resources, do battle with powerful rivals, and establish your dominion as a lord.</p>

<p>The game is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1604030/V_Rising/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/v-rising/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and its Invaders of Oakveil update lands on April 28th.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-direct-march-2025-all-the-news-and-announcements.1146597/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-march-2025-all-news-and-announcements<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, Nintendo held a Direct showcase based on upcoming Switch games, and we've got all the news and announcements from that showcase right here.</p>

<p>As a reminder, this Direct doesn't have anything for you when it comes to the Switch 2; you'll have to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">wait until next week's show</a> for that. With that in mind, here's everything that was announced during today's Nintendo Direct showcase!</p>

<hr><h2><em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD Remaster</em>&nbsp;still coming this year</h2>

<p>First, we got to see a little footage from the upcoming JRPG collection&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD Remaster</em>, which is still coming to Switch sometime this year. No release date was revealed for the collection, sadly.</p>

<h2><em>No Sleep for Kaname Date - From AI: The Somnium Files&nbsp;</em>is a&nbsp;<em>Zero Escape</em>-style adventure</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-direct-march-2025-ai-somnium-files.jpg?itok=-Dhrt5J0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-direct-march-2025-ai-somnium-files.jpg?itok=_CzgAo5U 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A new&nbsp;<em>AI: The Somnium Files&nbsp;</em>game is coming.</figcaption></figure><p>Next up, it's time to take a look at the next game in the&nbsp;<em>AI: The Somnium Files&nbsp;</em>series. This one stars detective Kaname Date, who must work together with the sophisticated AI embedded in his eye in order to save internet personality Iris from a "mysterious escape game". It's coming to Switch on July 25th.</p>

<h2><em>Raidou Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army&nbsp;</em>has more Atlus RPG shenanigans</h2>

<p>A remastered version of Atlus' action RPG <i>Devil Summoner: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. the Soulless Army&nbsp;</i>is coming to Switch on June 19th. If you like&nbsp;<em>Persona&nbsp;</em>but wish the combat was a bit more active, this one's probably for you.</p>

<h2><em>Shadow Labyrinth&nbsp;</em>is, uh, a&nbsp;<em>Pac-Man&nbsp;</em>Metroidvania</h2>

<p>Have you ever wanted Pac-Man to star in his very own Metroidvania platformer? Well, you're in luck.&nbsp;<em>Shadow Labyrinth&nbsp;</em>is that very thing, although you're teaming up with "Puck" rather than exclusively playing as him. This one's coming on July 18th.</p>

<h2><em>Patapon 1+2 Replay&nbsp;</em>brings the&nbsp;<em>Patapon&nbsp;</em>games to Switch in July</h2>

<p>The PSP's&nbsp;<em>Patapon&nbsp;</em>games were some of that system's most delightful and joyful titles, and they're now coming to Switch as part of&nbsp;<em>Patapon 1+2 Replay</em>, which will hit the system on July 11th.</p>

<h2><em>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar&nbsp;</em>is a remake of a DS farming classic</h2>

<p>A new&nbsp;<em>Story of Seasons&nbsp;</em>game is coming to Switch...well, sort of.&nbsp;<em>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar&nbsp;</em>is a remake of the DS game (which was released under the series' previous&nbsp;<em>Harvest Moon&nbsp;</em>name), and it's coming on August 27th.</p>

<h2>More&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond&nbsp;</em>gameplay info revealed</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-direct-march-2025.jpg?itok=S1CsocbO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-direct-march-2025.jpg?itok=1slXJ7c2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond&nbsp;</em>is shaping up to be great, but I wish we had a release date for it.</figcaption></figure><p>Next, we got a new look at hotly-anticipated first-person shooter&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>. No release date, sadly, but we did get to see some of the game's combat, which looks like it's in the classic&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime&nbsp;</em>tradition.</p>

<p>We also got to see some of Samus' new psychic abilities, which can be used both to explore the world around you and to enhance combat.</p>

<h2><em>Disney Villains Cursed Cafe</em>&nbsp;is essentially&nbsp;<em>Coffee Talk&nbsp;</em>with added Ursula</h2>

<p>If you thought&nbsp;<em>Coffee Talk&nbsp;</em>could use some extra villainy, this next one is for you.&nbsp;<em>Disney Villains Cursed Cafe&nbsp;</em>lets you brew potions and serve them to Disney villains, and the kinds of potions you brew can even have an effect on the story. You can play it on Switch later today.</p>

<h2><em>Witchbrook&nbsp;</em>looks like the cozy magic school game you've been waiting for</h2>

<p>Next, it's time for a look at Chucklefish's&nbsp;<em>Witchbrook</em>, a cozy magic school game in which you can fly on broomsticks, learn magic spells, and hang out with other witches. This one's heading to Switch sometime this holiday season.</p>

<h2>Action and arcade sizzle reel</h2>

<p>Nintendo showed an action and arcade-focused sizzle reel next, featuring THQ's hand-drawn platformer&nbsp;<em>The Eternal Life of Goldman&nbsp;</em>(coming this holiday), retro collection <i>Gradius Origins&nbsp;</i>(launching in August), and rhythm game&nbsp;<em>Rift of the NecroDancer&nbsp;</em>(coming to Switch today).</p>

<h2><em>Tamagotchi Plaza&nbsp;</em>is a new&nbsp;<em>Tamagotchi Connection&nbsp;</em>game</h2>

<p>In&nbsp;<em>Tamagotchi Plaza</em>, twelve stores await your help, and you can do everything from designing eyewear through to, uh, being a dentist. The game features over 100 "new and classic" Tamagotchi and launches on June 27th.</p>

<h2><em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>sure does look fun</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-direct-march-2025.jpg?itok=O-ewIs2x 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-direct-march-2025.jpg?itok=pQ-yMcvi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll have to fight a lot of trainers to be the very best in&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>We were treated to some more&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>info next, although much of it was already revealed in February's&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>Presents show.</p>

<p>This Nintendo Direct showed off some of the game's Z-A Royale tournament, which will let you face off against fellow Trainers for the chance to "have a wish granted". Still no release date, though.</p>

<h2><em>Rhythm Heaven Groove&nbsp;</em>brings more fun rhythm minigames next year</h2>

<p>Next, we got to see a new entry in the&nbsp;<em>Rhythm Heaven&nbsp;</em>series, which is always welcome. This one will have lots of the franchise's signature quirky, off-the-wall minigames when it comes to Switch next year.</p>

<h2>Nintendo's new Virtual Game Card system looks...odd</h2>

<p>It looks like Nintendo is introducing a new system for game-sharing between Switch consoles. The Virtual Game Card system will render each digital purchase as a Virtual Game Card, which can then be loaded onto second Switch consoles using local communication.</p>

<p>Two systems can share cards freely, and you can also lend cards out to those on your family Switch account for two weeks. Nintendo says this system will make "digital games even easier to use", and it's being added in late April. It'll be used on Switch 2 as well.</p>

<h2>More sizzle reel goodness</h2>

<p>A few more games are making their way to Switch, and we got a sizzle reel for them. Here are the games that were featured in that reel.</p>

<ul><li><em>High on Life&nbsp;</em>(May 6th)</li>
	<li><em>Star Overdrive&nbsp;</em>(April 10th)</li>
	<li><em>The Wandering Village&nbsp;</em>(July 17th)</li>

<h2><em>Everybody's Golf: Hot Shots&nbsp;</em>brings wacky golf to Switch this year</h2>

<p>A new&nbsp;<em>Everybody's Golf&nbsp;</em>game is heading to Switch this year, bringing the series' signature cartoony golfing action to Nintendo's console. It'll support local play or online multiplayer for up to 4 players.</p>

<h2><em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion&nbsp;</em>calls back to retro beat-'em-ups</h2>

<p>Next, a beat-'em-up right out of the 16-bit era was revealed.&nbsp;<em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion&nbsp;</em>is a sidescroller from Dotemu that lets you play as classic Marvel heroes like Spider-Man, Captain America, and Venom, and it supports four-player co-op. It's coming this holiday.</p>

<h2><em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream&nbsp;</em>looks characteristically offbeat</h2>

It'll see Mii characters living on an island at sea and interacting with each other in all kinds of fun ways, and it's coming next year.</p>

<h2>A new Nintendo app is being released</h2>

<p>Finally, we got to see a new Nintendo app being released for smart devices. Nintendo Today! will feature all kinds of news and other Nintendo-related goodies, and it'll also bring you new Switch 2 news every single day following the Direct presentation next week. You can download it now!</p>
