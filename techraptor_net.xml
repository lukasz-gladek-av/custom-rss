            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Team Ninja and Xbox have announced the PS5 release date for&nbsp;<em>Senua's Saga: Hellblade II</em>, as well as the new enhancements current owners on Xbox and PC can expect.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/06/25/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-enhanced-update/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Xbox Wire, the followup to 2017's&nbsp;<em>Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice&nbsp;</em>will <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-ps5" rel="nofollow">arrive on PS5</a> on August 12th. This won't be the first time the franchise has appeared on PlayStation, of course;&nbsp;<em>Senua's Sacrifice&nbsp;</em>got itself a PS4 release, after all.</p>

<p>Still, the game's release on PS5 marks an increasingly friendly approach to PlayStation on Xbox's part. Many of the studio's games are making their way to PlayStation now, including upcoming titles like&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gears-of-war-reloaded-announced" rel="nofollow"><em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em></a>.</p>

<p>Those include a new Performance Mode, which will allow you to play at 60fps on PS5 and Xbox Series X (but not S, unfortunately). The PC version will also include a new Very High graphics preset, allowing you to push more powerful rigs to their limit.</p>

<p>Additionally, Xbox and Team Ninja say that when the enhanced version of&nbsp;<em>Senua's Saga&nbsp;</em>launches, it'll be Steam Deck Verified, so you'll be able to enjoy it on your handheld PC as well.</p>

<p>A new Dark Rot mode, which makes its return from the first game, will also be added to the sequel. Every time you fail, the Dark Rot will advance, and when it reaches Senua's head, you'll fail your run and all of your progress will be lost.</p>




<p>If you pick up the Deluxe Edition of&nbsp;<em>Hellblade II</em>&nbsp;on PS5, you'll also get a version of&nbsp;<em>Senua's Sacrifice&nbsp;</em>enhanced for the PS5, so if you haven't played that game yet, now's your chance.</p>

<p><em>Senua's Saga: Hellblade II&nbsp;</em>is, believe it or not, the sequel to 2017's&nbsp;<em>Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice</em>. It once again follows Senua, who's on a quest to rescue her countrymen from the Northmen.</p>

<p>You can pick the game up right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2461850/Senuas_Saga_Hellblade_II/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/senuas-saga-hellblade-II" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and it's coming to <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012536" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a> on August 12th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has announced the&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares III&nbsp;</em>release date, with the third installment in the spooky cinematic platformer series set to arrive in the most appropriate month for its release.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://x.com/LittleNights/status/1937588067579101399" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X,&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares III&nbsp;</em>will be arriving across PC and consoles on October 10th. Alongside news of the release date, the publisher also revealed that a Nintendo Switch 2 version of the game is on the way as well.</p>

<p>This third installment in the&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares&nbsp;</em>series was originally slated to launch in 2024, but <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/little-nightmares-3-delayed" rel="nofollow">in May last year</a>, Bandai Namco and developer Supermassive Games delayed the game to 2025 in order to give it "the care and love it deserves".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/little-nightmares-iii-release-date-walking.jpg?itok=TUpjmv9W 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/little-nightmares-iii-release-date-walking.jpg?itok=wUpmU3F1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Little Nightmares III&nbsp;</em>is launching in October.</figcaption></figure><p>In addition to&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares III</em>'s release date, Bandai Namco also revealed that an enhanced edition of the original&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares&nbsp;</em>is on its way to PC and current-gen consoles.</p>

<p>It's coming on the same day as&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares III</em>, but unlike that game, this one's not coming to the PS4 or the Xbox One, nor is it heading to the original Switch. You'll have to play it on current-gen machines.</p>

<p>For your trouble, though, you'll get enhanced visuals and performance, as well as "additional helpers" that have been added to give you an "overall better experience". Otherwise, though, it'll be the same&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares&nbsp;</em>you may already know and love, and if you don't, this seems like the perfect way to experience it.</p>




<p><em>Little Nightmares III&nbsp;</em>will revolve around two new characters, Low and Alone, who must work together with one another in order to escape a nightmarish realm known as the Nowhere.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check the game out when it launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1392860/Little_Nightmares_III/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/little-nightmares-3/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/little-nightmares-iii/9PMWB693ZK7X" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and both Nintendo Switch consoles on October 10th. That's also when the enhanced version of&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares&nbsp;</em>will launch.</p>
