            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-update-limited-time-mode<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has released a new&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>update, and it comes complete with adjustments to the game's modes and battle system, as well as a new limited-time mode (although that technically hasn't arrived yet).</p>

<p>Somewhat confusingly, in the update's official <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/dragon-ball/news/update-dragon-ball-sparking-zero-changes-and-adjustments-features-and-battle" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">patch notes</a>, Bandai Namco says the Legendary Warrior Face-Off mode "has been added for a limited time", but players are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SparkingZero/comments/1i6498f/where_is_the_new_gamemode_at/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reporting</a> that they're <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SparkingZero/comments/1i6446m/so_how_can_i_access_legendary_warrior_faceoff/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">unable</a> to access it, even though the update has been applied.</p>

<p>However, other players are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SparkingZero/comments/1i6498f/comment/m8940nx/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">speculating</a>&nbsp;that the new mode will arrive alongside the game's first major DLC, which is currently available for those who forked out for 72 hours' access but which is not on general release yet. It's set to arrive later this week.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-update-new-mode-gamma.jpg?itok=HD1MeMgG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-update-new-mode-gamma.jpg?itok=RPGUa0zH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The new&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>mode will probably arrive later this week alongside the game's first DLC.</figcaption></figure><p>Per a <a href="https://x.com/BandaiNamcoUS/status/1880255701613711711" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Bandai Namco's X page (which also doesn't confirm the release date for the mode), Legendary Warrior Face-Off will allow you to "challenge yourself against characters with sky-high power levels", with the first being iconic Saiyan Broly.</p>

<p>The patch notes clarify that you "cannot select this mode outside of the period" during which it's available, although rather unhelpfully, that period isn't specified.</p>

<p>The wording of Bandai Namco's post, however, suggests that there will be other warriors against whom you can face off, so presumably, this mode will cycle in and out periodically, offering different characters to fight.</p>

<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</em>'s first DLC, that's due out on January 24th, so that's probably also when Legendary Warrior Face-Off will become available. The "Hero of Justice" pack adds a number of new characters, including the likes of Gamma, new Gohan variants, and more.</p>




<p><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>is the latest game in the&nbsp;<em>Budokai Tenkaichi&nbsp;</em>sub-series of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball&nbsp;</em>games and the first to bear the series' original Japanese name in the West.</p>

<p>The game launched in October to the&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball&nbsp;</em>series' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-series-best-steam-debut" rel="nofollow">best Steam debut ever</a>, going on to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-sales-3m" rel="nofollow">sell three million copies</a> across all platforms within its first day on sale.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-release-april-september-nacon</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/switch-2-release-likely-between-april-and-september-says-nacon.1087710/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-release-april-september-nacon<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nacon, the company behind the likes of&nbsp;<em>Test Drive Unlimited: Solar Crown&nbsp;</em>and <i>GreedFall 2</i>, has released a new financial statement, and it contains a prediction regarding the Switch 2 launch window.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://corporate.nacongaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/CP_Nacon_CA-T3-2024-25-Diffusion-English.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">statement</a>&nbsp;covers the period between April and December last year, during which time Nacon's consolidated sales rose by 2.5%, driven mainly by its non-gaming ventures. The company's gaming business fell by 4.6% in that nine-month period when compared to last year.</p>

<p>Later in the statement, Nacon looks ahead to the first half of the next fiscal year, during which the company says it anticipates "the arrival of the Nintendo Switch 2 console". Nacon also says it "already has compatible games and a full range of accessories" for that console.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-release-window-nacon-prediction-dock.jpg?itok=PaZsI9mZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-release-window-nacon-prediction-dock.jpg?itok=QgRbPPmN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nacon reckons the Switch 2 will launch between April and September this year.</figcaption></figure><p>Just as a reminder, since the financial year begins for Nacon in April, that means the company anticipates the release of the Switch 2 sometime between April and September.</p>

<p>Given that we know a Nintendo Direct presentation is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">due to air on April 2nd</a>, this release window timing, which is admittedly rather broad, would make a lot of sense. If I had to guess, I'd put the release in June, although that's just a gut feeling.</p>

<p>When Nacon says it already has games and accessories ready to go for the Nintendo Switch 2, the company is referring to a range of Switch 2 accessories it <a href="https://x.com/Nacon/status/1879938882244088080" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">unveiled last week</a>, including cases, controller housings, and more.</p>

<p>On the game front, while Nacon may well be referring to some of the games on its upcoming slate, it could also be pointing to the range of games it's already released for the Switch, since the new console will <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-successor-will-be-backwards-compatible" rel="nofollow">largely be backwards compatible</a> with the original.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nacon-nintendo-switch-2-prediction-ravenswatch.jpg?itok=Dm4gaf5r 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nacon-nintendo-switch-2-prediction-ravenswatch.jpg?itok=KSt-3P9T 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nacon's range of Switch games (and, therefore, Switch 2 games as well) includes action roguelike&nbsp;<em>Ravenswatch</em>, plus many others.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, given that Nacon also says it has "around 10 new games" in its pipeline, it could well be referring to those as well.</p>

<p>The studio is set to reveal "the main ones" in that lineup during this year's Nacon Connect event, which will take place on March 6th. Previous Nacon Connect events gave us reveals for the likes of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nacon-connect-2023" rel="nofollow">RoboCop: Rogue City</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/terminator-survivors-and-more-unveiled-at-nacon-connect" rel="nofollow"><em>Terminator: Survivors</em></a>, among others.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unknown-9-awakening-layoffs-cancellation-reflector</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/unknown-9-awakening-developer-hit-by-layoffs-after-games-failure.1087683/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unknown-9-awakening-layoffs-cancellation-reflector<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco subsidiary and&nbsp;<em>Unknown 9: Awakening&nbsp;</em>developer Reflector Entertainment has canceled an in-development project and laid off a number of staff following what it calls the "failure" of its first game.</p>

<p>In a LinkedIn <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/reflector-entertainment_activity-7287227402995269633-s4i-/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, Reflector CEO Herve Hoerdt says he's "made the decision not to greenlight further work" on a project that was in the "conceptualization phase", thus "terminating this development line". In layman's terms, that effectively seems to mean he's canceled an ongoing development project.</p>

<p>Hoerdt puts the cancellation down to the "failure" of Reflector's "ambitious and courageous first project", which he describes as a "new IP with a rich transmedia universe". He is, of course, referring to&nbsp;<em>Unknown 9: Awakening</em>, which is Reflector's first (and, to date, only) game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/unknown-9-awakening-layoffs-failure-reflector.jpg?itok=E-CQpTRH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/unknown-9-awakening-layoffs-failure-reflector.jpg?itok=Re1hIfMW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Unknown 9: Awakening&nbsp;</em>wasn't a success for Reflector, apparently.</figcaption></figure><p>The CEO goes on to admit that&nbsp;<em>Unknown 9: Awakening&nbsp;</em>"didn't come near the company expectations" with regards to sales performance, and that the world of the game doesn't "warrant any further exploration" as a result.</p>

<p>He says that the canceled project continuing "would not have been sustainable" for Reflector, but that it will result in "redundancies", although he doesn't state how many.</p>

<p>Going forward, Hoerdt says Reflector will work on a single project at a time, an approach that's also been espoused by the likes of&nbsp;<em>Rime&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tequila-works-rime-sexy-brutale-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Tequila Works</a> (although that company's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tequila-works-insolvency" rel="nofollow">insolvency</a> puts the future of said project into question in that case).</p>

<p>Reflector is currently working on a game "based on an existing Bandai Namco IP", and Hoerdt says development on that project is "shaping up very well", although naturally, he doesn't say what it might be.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/unknown-9-awakening-layoffs-failure-bandai-namco.jpg?itok=NqrzPmQf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/unknown-9-awakening-layoffs-failure-bandai-namco.jpg?itok=D1HIMewD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Reflector will continue to work on another as-yet-unannounced game.</figcaption></figure><p>News of the Reflector layoffs, and of&nbsp;<em>Unknown 9: Awakening</em>'s failure, comes shortly after Bandai Namco <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bandai-namco-sales-projections-shadow-of-the-erdtree" rel="nofollow">increased its sales projections</a> for the 2024-25 fiscal year as a result of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>expansion&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>'s strong performance.</p>

<p>The company has also recently enjoyed success with fighting game&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</em>, which managed to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-sales-3m" rel="nofollow">top three million sales in a single day</a>.</p>

<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Unknown 9: Awakening&nbsp;</em>itself, you can, if you're so inclined, check out the action adventure game right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1477940/Unknown_9_Awakening/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/unknown-9-awakening/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/unknown-9-awakening/9p486zcvt126" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>. For what it's worth, our reviewer Erren was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/unknown-9-awakening-review-adventurers-gamble" rel="nofollow">decidedly less negative about it than many</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-snap-back-online-dev-says-new-publisher<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Card battler&nbsp;<em>Marvel Snap&nbsp;</em>has come back online in the US following an outage related to the shutdown of TikTok, and developer Second Dinner has promised changes in the future to avoid a repeat of the downtime.</p>

<p>The game was taken offline over the weekend after seemingly being caught up in a TikTok ban, which was rendered temporary when now-President Trump <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1880861537981944300" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">declared a temporary reprieve</a> of 75 days for the social media platform. Second Dinner <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1880861537981944300" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">said</a> the outage was "a surprise" and that it "wasn't planned".</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1881535498709266691" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> shared on social media platform X today, Second Dinner confirmed the app was back online in the US, although it still <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1881558007831740708" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">doesn't seem to be available</a> to download from mobile app stores.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-snap-back-online-card-game.jpg?itok=ftF0g2tn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-snap-back-online-card-game.jpg?itok=4xrxFarf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Marvel Snap&nbsp;</em>is back online in the US, but things could change in the future.</figcaption></figure><p>In its post, Second Dinner says that in order "to make sure this NEVER happens again", the studio is "working to bring more services in-house and partner with a new publisher".</p>

<p>As a reminder, the game's current publisher is Nuverse, a gaming-related subsidiary of TikTok owner ByteDance. Last year, ByteDance <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bytedance-selling-gaming-assets" rel="nofollow">reportedly expressed interest</a> in selling off its gaming assets, which would naturally include Nuverse.</p>

<p>At time of writing, in-app purchases are <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1881539047501484050" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">apparently still down</a> within&nbsp;<em>Marvel Snap</em>, but you can make purchases on the web shop. Second Dinner has <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1881099521310269578" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">previously stated</a> that it's "committed to ensuring that all players are compensated for their lost time" due to the outage.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Marvel Snap</em>, it's a competitive card game currently available across PC and mobile devices. The game is described by its devs as a "fast-paced collectible card game that reimagines the genre with innovative mechanics".</p>

<p><em>Marvel Snap&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1997040/MARVEL_SNAP/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, and it's usually available on mobile devices as well, although reports suggest it's not downloadable on those storefronts right now.

            <title><![CDATA[Sony and NCSoft Reportedly Cancel Unannounced Horizon MMO]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/horizon-mmo-canceled-report</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-and-ncsoft-reportedly-cancel-unannounced-horizon-mmo.1087590/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/horizon-mmo-canceled-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>An MMORPG based on Sony and Guerrilla Games' successful IP&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>has apparently been canceled. The project was reportedly a collaboration between Sony and&nbsp;<em>Guild Wars&nbsp;</em>studio NCSoft.</p>

<p>Bear with me on this one. Back in 2023, Sony and NCSoft <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-and-ncsoft-announce-strategic-partnership-to-collaborate-in-various" rel="nofollow">announced a "strategic partnership"</a>, and that partnership was reported to include a&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>MMO, with leaker Kurakasis <a href="https://x.com/Kurakasis/status/1741262087647543736" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pointing to job listings</a> for something called "Project H" (also "Project Skyline") in December that same year.</p>

<p>Now, however, Korean publication <a href="https://news.mtn.co.kr/news-detail/2025011314314667267" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">MTN</a> (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/looks-like-horizons-unannounced-mmo-has-been-quietly-cancelled" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>) has reported that Project H has been canceled following a project review at NCSoft, along with several other titles in development at the company.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/horizon-mmo-canceled-report-aloy.jpg?itok=HnasnYjv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/horizon-mmo-canceled-report-aloy.jpg?itok=WfRjSZmL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>An MMO based on&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>has apparently been canceled.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, all of this should be taken with a pinch of salt, because Sony and NCSoft never officially announced the&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>MMO in question, so naturally, it also hasn't officially been canceled.</p>

<p>However, cancelling such a project would fit in with what appears to be a wider retreat from the live service market on Sony's part. Earlier this week, the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-live-service-games-canceled" rel="nofollow">canceled two live service games</a> in development at Bluepoint and Bend, with the former reportedly being a&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>spinoff.</p>

<p>The retreat is likely inspired by the colossal failure of hero shooter&nbsp;<em>Concord</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds" rel="nofollow">shut down just two weeks after it launched</a> last year. The game's developer would go on to be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-shuts-down-two-studios-including-concord-creator" rel="nofollow">closed down by Sony</a>, along with Neon Koi, previously known as Savage Game Studios.</p>

<p>It's also worth noting that assuming this MMO was actually in development, it's probably not the&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>multiplayer game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/guerrilla-working-on-multiplayer-horizon-game" rel="nofollow">announced back in December 2022</a>, as that's in development at Guerrilla itself rather than a third-party studio (although that could well end up being canceled too).</p>
