            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/striking-distance-layoffs-callisto-protocol<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>The Callisto Protocol&nbsp;</em>developer Striking Distance Studios has apparently laid off the majority of its staff, at least according to two employees who were let go from the company.</p>

<p>As spotted by ResetEra user <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-callisto-protocol-dev-striking-distance-studios-has-made-another-round-of-layoffs.1117866/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Cyberia</a> (who also spotted posts confirming Wizards of the Coast subsidiary Skeleton Key's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wizards-of-the-coast-skeleton-key-project-canceled" rel="nofollow">project cancellation</a>), Striking Distance staff members <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jesseleeconceptart_opentowork-activity-7298625255500091392-t4QX" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Jesse Lee</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/zach-volker_it-was-a-tough-morning-at-striking-distance-activity-7298480796674183168-Ft3a" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Zach Volker</a> posted on LinkedIn earlier this week confirming that they were laid off.</p>

<p>Lee, who served as concept art director for Striking Distance for four years, says in his post that "most of the devs" at the studio "were laid off", while Volker says there were "lots of layoffs, including [himself]".</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with Striking Distance, it's a studio founded by&nbsp;<em>Dead Space&nbsp;</em>creator Glen Schofield back in 2019. The studio's first project was survival horror title&nbsp;<em>The Callisto Protocol</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/callisto-protocol-is-set-in-pubg-universe-apparently" rel="nofollow">originally to be set in the&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>universe</a>, although this aspect of the game was subsequently downplayed.</p>

<p>The game's production was reportedly troubled, with staff <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/callisto-protocol-crunch-is-problem-with-100-hour-work-weeks" rel="nofollow">being asked to work 100-hour weeks</a> in order to finish the project on time.</p>

<p>Eventually,&nbsp;<em>The Callisto Protocol&nbsp;</em>was released in 2022, attracting a range of opinions. Our own Sam <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/callisto-protocol-review" rel="nofollow">"awarded" the game a 4.5 out of 10</a>, praising its "beautiful" visuals but criticizing its story, chaotic combat, and "terrible" boss encounters.</p>




<p>Following&nbsp;<em>The Callisto Protocol</em>'s release, Striking Distance founder Glen Schofield <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-space-co-creator-pursuing-new-opportunities-less-than-year-after-callisto" rel="nofollow">departed the studio</a>, with parent company Krafton confirming his departure was in order to "pursue new opportunities".</p>

<p>A spinoff game,&nbsp;<em>[Redacted]</em>, was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/redacted-callisto-protocol-spinoff-release-date" rel="nofollow">released back in October</a>. Set in the same universe as&nbsp;<em>The Callisto Protocol</em>, the game eschews the&nbsp;<em>Dead Space</em>-style survival horror trappings of its parent, opting instead for a top-down action roguelike approach.</p>

<p>Striking Distance is far from the only studio to lay off staff in recent months. Others include&nbsp;<em>Killer Instinct&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rumbleverse-and-killer-instct-studio-iron-galaxy-suffers-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Iron Galaxy</a>,&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioware-layoffs-veilguard-failure" rel="nofollow">BioWare</a>, and tech giant <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-layoffs-january-2025" rel="nofollow">Microsoft</a>, among many, many others.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-anna-williams-dlc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has revealed that the next&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8&nbsp;</em>DLC fighter, as well as the first one to join the game's roster as part of its second season, is none other than Nina Williams' deadly sister Anna.</p>

<p>As part of&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8</em>'s first season of DLC characters, iconic fighters like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-heihachi-mishima-dlc-release-date" rel="nofollow">Heihachi Mishima</a>, capoeira dancer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-reveals-eddy-gordo-as-first-dlc-character-alongside-season-pass-1-roadmap" rel="nofollow">Eddy Gordo</a>, and&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>'s Clive Rosfield, and Bandai Namco is continuing to add classic&nbsp;<em>Tekken&nbsp;</em>characters to&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8</em>'s roster with its second season.</p>

<p>Introduced as "Scarlet Lightning" in her debut trailer, Anna proceeds to beat seven bells out of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-victor-chevalier-reveal" rel="nofollow">French agent Victor Chevalier</a>, who's voiced by none other than acting legend Vincent Cassel.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/anna-williams-tekken-8-weapon.jpg?itok=z80Nnj4S 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/anna-williams-tekken-8-weapon.jpg?itok=W9KI8BUI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Anna Williams is back in&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8</em>, and she's sporting Lovely Tom once more.</figcaption></figure><p>As you might expect, Anna's moveset is a mixture of elegant martial arts moves and brutal beatdowns with Lovely Tom, her multi-purpose heavy weapon.</p>

<p>After battling Victor, Anna moves on to taking on Polish Prime Minister (in the game, of course, not in real life) and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-lidia-release-date" rel="nofollow">fellow DLC fighter</a> Lidia Sobieska. As you'd expect given that this is Anna's trailer, the assassin makes short work of Lidia.</p>

<p>Finally, in a showdown for the ages, Anna gets to take on her sister Nina, who once again takes a beating from Anna. We also get to see Anna's Rage Art, which sees her summoning a helicopter to provide fire support as she blasts her opponent with Lovely Tom.</p>

<p>Anna will be released for&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8&nbsp;</em>on April 3rd, with three-day early access available on March 31st for those who purchase the game's second season pass. You can see Anna in action via her debut trailer right here.</p>




<p>The second round of&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8&nbsp;</em>DLC will include not only Anna, but also three more characters, as well as two extra stages. The first stage will arrive in summer, as will the next character after Anna. One more character will arrive in fall, and in winter, the season's final character and stage will launch.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1778820/TEKKEN_8/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/tekken-8/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/tekken-8/9ppsm14vkclw" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.
