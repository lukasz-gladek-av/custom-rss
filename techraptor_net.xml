            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has revealed that the next&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>game to be getting the remaster treatment is none other than&nbsp;<em>Tales of Xillia</em>, and the remaster is due to land later this year.</p>

<p>Last week, the studio accidentally confirmed the existence of&nbsp;<em>Tales of Xillia Remastered&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-of-xillia-remaster-rumor" rel="nofollow">via an unfortunate YouTube thumbnail</a>, but earlier today, the remaster was officially revealed. It's landing on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch (but not Switch 2, strangely) on October 31st.</p>

<p>The project is part of Bandai Namco's promise to release remastered versions of games in the&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>series <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-series-remasters-regular" rel="nofollow">"fairly consistently"</a>, with the first entry in the so-called Remaster Project, namely&nbsp;<em>Tales of Graces f Remastered</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/tales-of-graces-f-remastered-review-spirited-journey" rel="nofollow">launching earlier this year</a>.</p>

<p>Big changes include new "vivid and beautiful graphics", as well as the inclusion of over 40 DLC packs released for the original game, although certain licensed content (probably referring to the outfits themed around Japanese anime&nbsp;<em>Star Driver</em>) aren't included.</p>

<p>You'll also find a new autosave function that will save your game after events or "moving around the map", as well as the chance to toggle random enemy encounters, a new Retry feature if you die in battle, and much more.</p>

<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Tales of Xillia Remastered</em>, which shows the work the team has done in order to update the original for modern systems, right here.</p>




<p>When the first <i>Tales of Xillia Remastered&nbsp;</i>leak happened, some suggested that the direct sequel&nbsp;<em>Tales of Xillia 2&nbsp;</em>may also be included as part of a package, but that's not the case. I'd imagine, though, that&nbsp;<em>Xillia 2&nbsp;</em>is on the cards if this remaster does well.</p>

<p><em>Tales of Xillia Remastered&nbsp;</em>is coming to PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch on October 31st. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Major Hollow Knight: Silksong Announcement Set for This Week]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/major-hollow-knight-silksong-announcement-set-for-this-week</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>developer Team Cherry has teased a major announcement regarding the game, and it's coming in just a couple of days as well.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/TeamCherryGames/status/1957812884773433667" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post on social media</a>, Team Cherry says that in just 48 hours, a "special announcement" regarding&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>will be made. I'd wager anything that we'll finally be getting a release date for one of the most hotly-anticipated indie games of all time.</p>

<p>The announcement will take the form of a YouTube video, so that pretty much cements the idea that we're getting a release date; after all, I doubt Team Cherry would make this much of a song and dance just for a fresh look at&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em>'s gameplay.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hollow-knight-silksong-announcement-this-week-boss.jpg?itok=DbLXeY9R 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hollow-knight-silksong-announcement-this-week-boss.jpg?itok=oOFuScC_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>That&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>release date could finally be on the cards.</figcaption></figure><p>It's been a long, strange road for&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>. Announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-is-hollow-knight-sequel-youve-been-waiting-for" rel="nofollow">all the way back in February 2019</a> (yes, it really has been that long), the followup to 2017's celebrated Metroidvania&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight&nbsp;</em>has been in development for a long time.</p>

<p>Each year that went by after&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em>'s initial announcement saw excitement around the game grow, even though&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-still-tba" rel="nofollow">release date</a> was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-delayed" rel="nofollow">nowhere to be seen</a>.</p>

<p>According to SteamDB's <a href="https://steamdb.info/stats/mostwished/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">data</a>,&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>is still Steam's most-followed game, clocking up 356,387 followers. By contrast, the platform's second most-followed game is&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2</em>, which has 217,811 followers.</p>

<p>Excitement rose again when&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>was included as part of Xbox's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">summer showcase this year</a>, as well as the Nintendo Switch 2 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">reveal event back in April</a>, although again, neither presentation brought with it that ever-elusive&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>release date.</p>




<p>It can't be easy for Team Cherry;&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>is easily the most-hyped indie game on the scene right now, and it's hard to imagine anything living up to the astronomical expectations many will have for the platformer.</p>

<p>Still, things are definitely moving forward now, at any rate. We'll almost certainly get to learn when&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>is arriving later this week, so stay tuned for more!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Kirby Air Riders Release Date Set for November, Tons of New Info Revealed]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kirby-air-riders-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kirby-air-riders-release-date-set-for-november-tons-of-new-info-revealed.1273776/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has revealed a ton of new information about upcoming racing sequel <i>Kirby Air Riders</i>, including when you can expect to play the game.</p>

<p>In a new Nintendo Direct presentation aired earlier today, Nintendo, along with&nbsp;<em>Air Riders&nbsp;</em>director (and Nintendo legend) Masahiro Sakurai, revealed that&nbsp;<em>Kirby Air Riders&nbsp;</em>will be launching exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2 on November 20th.</p>

<p>Along with revealing the release date, Sakurai and Nintendo also divulged lots of new info about&nbsp;<em>Air Riders</em>' gameplay mechanics, characters, and game modes, and it sounds like the game will boast Sakurai's usual maximalist design philosophy (which is definitely a good thing!).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kirby-air-riders-release-date-racing.jpg?itok=JxorEaKP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kirby-air-riders-release-date-racing.jpg?itok=Ng6yfY_- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kirby Air Riders&nbsp;</em>is launching in November.</figcaption></figure><p>Essentially,&nbsp;<em>Air Riders&nbsp;</em>takes the form of a sort of auto-racer; you won't need to press any buttons to accelerate, but you will need to perform maneuvers to outfox your opponents, use specials to gain advantages, and more.</p>

<p>Each rider has different stats; Kirby, for instance, has a different weight stat to King Dedede, who won't feel the same to play as Meta Knight. You'll need to weigh up which racer you want to use on which course if you want to win.</p>

<p>If you're a&nbsp;<em>Kirby Air Ride&nbsp;</em>fan, you'll probably recognize the returning City Trial mode, which has been expanded; it now takes place on a massive floating island by the name of Skyah, which is a free-roaming map packed with events to enjoy.</p>

<p>Of course, you'll also be able to take part in the game's titular Air Ride mode, which sees you and up to five other riders competing to cross the finish line, as well as other gameplay modes to try out.</p>




<p><em>Kirby Air Riders</em>' release in November means it's one of two major Nintendo racing games to be released during the Switch 2's launch window, with the other naturally being the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">flagship launch game&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em></a>.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Kirby Air Riders&nbsp;</em>launches exclusively for <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/kirby-air-riders-switch-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch 2</a> on November 20th. Stay tuned for more.</p>
