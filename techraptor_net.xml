            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-space-marine-3-revealed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Focus Entertainment and Saber Interactive have confirmed that&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 3&nbsp;</em>is officially in development, so get ready to suit up as Ultramarine Demetrian Titus once more.</p>

<p>In an announcement <a href="https://www.focus-entmt.com/en/news/focus-entertainment-publishing-announces-the-development-of-warhammer-40000-space-marine-3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, the two studios, as well as&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k&nbsp;</em>IP holder Games Workshop, confirm that the game is coming, and that it'll offer "intense, brutal, and spectacular gameplay" while remaining "true to the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k&nbsp;</em>universe".</p>

<p>Focus deputy CEO John Bert says you can look forward to an "immersive campaign" in&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 3</em>, as well as multiplayer gameplay and "innovations that will redefine the standards of third-person action games".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/space-marine-3-confirmed-space-marine-2.jpg?itok=4qHDQBSZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/space-marine-3-confirmed-space-marine-2.jpg?itok=ly2ZbcLK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Space Marine 3&nbsp;</em>has officially been confirmed.</figcaption></figure><p>Bert also promises "large-scale battles that are even more spectacular", so if you thought the hordes of Tyranids that swarmed your squad in&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>were impressive, it sounds like you ain't seen nothing yet.</p>

<p>Saber CEO Matthew Karch, meanwhile, says&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>was "transformative" for his company, and that while he acknowledges the "tremendous expectations" surrounding&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 3</em>, he's confident his team can create "a true love letter to the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k&nbsp;</em>universe".</p>

<p>Further details about the game are scarce at the moment, but judging by the very short teaser, we'll be seeing the return of Ultramarine Captain Demetrian Titus. If the past two&nbsp;<em>Space Marine&nbsp;</em>games are anything to go by, you'll likely be fighting the forces of Chaos at some point as well.</p>

<p>Given that&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>had sold <a href="https://x.com/Focus_entmt/status/1879948638245261796" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">over six million copies</a> at last count, it probably shouldn't come as a surprise that the game is getting a followup, but it's nice nonetheless.</p>




<p>As well as&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 3</em>, the&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>folks are also currently working on a game that will <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-marine-2-devs-hasbro-tentpole-ip" rel="nofollow">utilize a "tentpole" Hasbro IP</a>, although that IP hasn't been revealed yet.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what Focus and Saber are cooking up for&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 3</em>.

            <title><![CDATA[Disco Elysium Mobile Version Announced to "Captivate the TikTok User"]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/disco-elysium-mobile-version-tiktok-user</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/disco-elysium-mobile-version-announced-to-captivate-the-tiktok-user.1133646/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/disco-elysium-mobile-version-tiktok-user<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>ZA/UM has announced a mobile version of cult hit RPG&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>, and the studio's head Denis Havel says the intent behind the game's reimagined mobile adaptation is to "captivate the TikTok user".</p>

<p>As revealed by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/official-disco-elysium-mobile-version-announced-zaum-calls-it-a-fun-on-the-go-alternative-aimed-at-tiktok-users" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">IGN</a>, ZA/UM wants to both attract new players to&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>and provide a "fun, on-the-go alternative" for those who've already experienced the game in its current PC and console form. The mobile version will, however, be exclusive to Android devices. Sorry, iOS users.</p>

<p>The first two chapters of&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>on Android will be released for free, ZA/UM says, and you'll be able to experience the rest of the game for a single one-off payment, so at least you won't have to buy each chapter one by one.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disco-elysium-mobile-revealed-measurehead.jpg?itok=gWC6eiaH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disco-elysium-mobile-revealed-measurehead.jpg?itok=gVMCjqoJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Have you ever wanted to play&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>on your phone? Well, now you can.</figcaption></figure><p>Perhaps a little defensively, ZA/UM says its current staff comprises "both creators and custodians of the&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>IP", and that this will be "evident in the&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>mobile experience" the studio is creating.</p>

<p>Worryingly, however, studio head Denis Havel then says the goal is to "captivate the TikTok user with quick hits of compelling story, art, and audio". He says he believes this will create an "all-new, deeply engaging form of entertainment".</p>

<p>I can't honestly say I think the&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>experience will be significantly improved by playing the game on your tiny smartphone screen, nor do I think the train or a long car journey are the best places to experience Harry DuBois' descent into (or ascent out of) madness. Still, that's corporations for you, I guess.</p>

<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>on Android devices right here.</p>




<p>This is the second major announcement ZA/UM has made this week. Just a couple of days ago, the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zaum-project-c4-disco-elysium" rel="nofollow">revealed a new "genre-defining" RPG</a> it's currently calling&nbsp;<em>Project C4</em>, although details on that project are scant right now.</p>

<p>It is also worth bearing in mind that although ZA/UM makes noises about being "custodians" of&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>, many of the game's original creators are no longer at the studio due to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-wild-story-behind-disco-elysiums-spiritual-successors-allegations-legal-threats-and-a-usb-stick" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a huge falling-out</a> that carried both cultural and legal ramifications for all concerned.</p>

<p>Several of the original folks behind&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>have, however, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-disco-elysium-devs-new-studios-spiritual-successors" rel="nofollow">announced their own projects</a>, and if I were you, I'd be keeping my eye on those over the mobile version of&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>. Still, who knows? Maybe it'll be great. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-san-francisco-store-may<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced that its planned San Francisco store will be opening on May 15th, thus becoming the company's second major US outlet alongside the flagship store in New York.</p>

<p>Revealing the store's opening date in a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/nintendo-san-francisco-celebrates-grand-opening-may-15/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a>, Nintendo says its new store will offer "game systems and games" as well as "accessories, apparel, home goods and souvenirs" that you'll only be able to buy from the San Francisco store.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/retail-locations/san-francisco/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">FAQ</a> for its new store, Nintendo says "reservations will be required for entry", although it's likely the company is specifically referring to the San Francisco location's grand opening; you probably won't need to reserve a spot just to visit the shop itself once it's open.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-san-francisco-store-new-york.jpg?itok=Kbfov85a 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-san-francisco-store-new-york.jpg?itok=wKskSoSy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nintendo's San Francisco store is due to open in May, and it'll probably resemble the New York store in terms of layout.</figcaption></figure><p>The store will be located on Powell Street in Union Square, and Nintendo says you'll be able to reach it easily via bus or cable car.</p>

<p>If you do want to attend the Nintendo San Francisco store's grand opening, you will need a reservation, but you can't get one just yet; Nintendo says more details will be available "soon", so keep an eye out if you'll be in the area in May and you want to go.</p>

<p>Additionally, Nintendo says that the SF store won't be offering online or phone sales, so if you want some of the exclusive stuff from that store, you'll have to visit physically to get it. Hey, that'll hopefully make the trip feel more special!</p>

<p>As with the New York store, Nintendo says it won't be offering spare parts for your consoles, nor can you go to the San Francisco store to have your Nintendo stuff repaired. Bear that in mind if you're looking to have your Switch screen replaced.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-san-francisco-store-new-york-display.jpg?itok=nvcYEttU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-san-francisco-store-new-york-display.jpg?itok=pDmfWVSZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hopefully, the Nintendo San Francisco store will have some cool displays like this one.</figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo is holding a sweepstakes right now to give you and "up to two guests" the chance to attend the San Francisco store's grand opening. You can see how to enter that <a href="https://my.nintendo.com/rewards/0347dfdfd78e4195?_gl=1*16k8vxz*_gcl_au*MTM3OTk4MDk2NC4xNzM4MjQzNDgy*_ga*MTM3MjQzMjg0OS4xNzMwMjExNzQ3*_ga_F6ERC4HMNZ*MTc0MTg4MDM1NC4xNy4xLjE3NDE4ODE4MjkuMC4wLjA." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>.</p>

<p>In other Nintendo news, the gaming giant is currently gearing up to release the Switch's hotly-anticipated successor sometime this year. The console will be revealed in full during a Nintendo Direct presentation <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">next month</a>, so stay tuned for more.</p>
