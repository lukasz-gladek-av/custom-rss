As the name suggests, the Spooky Update was originally intended to launch sometime around Halloween.</p><p>In terms of new content, you're getting a brand new map, a new character to play as, and a new weapon to use, as well as new items to collect, new enemies and bosses to fight, and new achievements to give you even more motivation to blast your way through <em>Megabonk</em>'s hordes.</p><figure role="group">
