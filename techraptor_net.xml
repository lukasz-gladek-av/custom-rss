            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A rot that started long ago in the Jade Abbey has surged, making a final push, seeking to taint the sacred water of the Everspring. One of its former keepers has gathered a group to stop this from happening, hoping to save the entire realm from falling entirely to the Chaos god Nurgle. <em>Warhammer Quest</em> is back! In this spoiler-free article, we check out the brand new set, <em>Warhammer Quest Darkwater</em>.</p>

<p>We've covered previous editions of <i>Warhammer Quest</i> on the site, including the futuristic <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> iteration, <a href="https://techraptor.net/originals/on-tabletop-warhammer-quest-blackstone-fortress" rel="nofollow">Warhammer Quest Blackstone Fortress</a>, and the horror-filled streets of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/warhammer-quest-cursed-city-preview" rel="nofollow">Warhammer Quest Cursed City</a>.</p>




<h2>What's the Quest?</h2>

<p>The original <i>Warhammer Quest </i>hit tabletops in 1995, following the earlier success of <em>HeroQuest</em>, which has also seen a recent revival. Games Workshop brought <em>Warhammer Quest</em> back in 2016, and since then, we've seen new iterations, using the same concept of players cooperatively exploring and conquering a dungeon. Each edition has had variations in rules and mechanics, along with a brand-new setting for each.</p>

<p>This time, <em>Warhammer Quest</em> continues to explore the depths of the <em>Age of Sigmar</em> setting, moving away from the snowy, cramped, and death-filled streets of Ulfenkarn to Ghyran, the realm of life, and the Jade Abbey, the source of the powerful waters of the Everspring, for which Nurlge, the plague god, has set his sights.</p>

Gelgus Pust, a Chaos Champion of Nurgle, has sought to control the Everspring ever since he betrayed his order. Once a senior in the Jade Abbey, his lust for power corrupted him, and he brought others with him in a revolt that nearly captured the Everspring. To stop him, the Everqueen flooded the Jade Abbey, wiping out attackers and defenders alike, but keeping the Everspring from falling into the Chaos God's hands.</p>

<p>Pust has since been on a ruthless campaign, steadily weakening the defences of the Jade Abbey over centuries until he's now in a position to strike. But there are heroes willing to risk it all to stop him. Gathered by Inara Sion, a former colleague of Gelgus and the last surviving member of the Jade Circle, tasked with defending the Everspring. The battle between Pust and Inara, finally coming to settle the score after centuries, sets the stage for the adventure.</p>

<p><em>Warhammer Quest Darkwater</em> has several mechanical changes from previous editions. The first is the inclusion of a map book, which takes the place of the map tiles from previous editions. This takes away the ability to randomly generate maps and instead fixes maps to those available in the map book. There is still variety to be found, and different missions, enemies, and map placement can make the same map into an entirely new experience. The benefit of the map book is that it speeds up setup time to almost nothing, as you only have to find the map page of the quest card, set up the enemies, heroes, and items, and you're ready to play. In a game that can serve as an entry game into the wider <em>Warhammer</em> and <em>Age of Sigmar</em> settings, this change is very welcome and lets you focus on the core delivery, rather than spending time building a map out of tiles.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-quest-darkwater-6.jpg?itok=6DygxOqc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-quest-darkwater-6.jpg?itok=8fs4yIAY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Each characters turn in&nbsp;<em>Warhammer Quest Darkwater </em>is driven by actions cards.</figcaption></figure><p>The second noticeable mechanical change is that actions are now cards. Each hero starts with 3 core action cards, move, attack, and aid, and each has the dual effect of letting you complete the action and providing the energy to complete other actions. Each time you use an action card, you need to expend other action cards with enough energy to complete the action, which can include the action you are completing.</p>

<p>So you can exhaust the aid card to move, then exhaust the move card to move, and then the attack card to attack, or use all 3 to attack, or any combination thereof. Characters can also gain other action cards, increasing their available energy for the turn, and actions not on cards can also be taken with special quest actions, or individual character actions detailed on their character card. This mechanic will be familiar to those who've played <em>Warhammer Quest The Adventure Card Game</em>, and was one of my favorite mechanics from the game.</p>

<p>I've always loved the action card mechanic, it makes it super clear what you can do each turn and keeps everything really clean visually, especially as you gain actions that provide energy. It really feels like leveling up your hero as they can complete more each turn. The action mechanics themselves are also really straightforward, with the number of dice to roll in an attack listed, and the number you need to roll as well. Enemies block attacks equal to their defence value, which keeps combat really quick.</p>

It takes away from the fixed puzzle nature of some games, where you know if you move here, you can attack or take this action. The randomness of possibly having to take 2 move actions to get to where you need to be, or having a great dice roll and getting there in 1 move, feels very heroic. It also feels very in keeping with regular board games, where your movement is usually based on a dice roll. The exception to this is Drolf, the Duardin, who has a fixed move. This feels very thematic and sets Drolf out with the fixed, determined nature of the Duardin, but also their restriction on speed.</p>

<p>Enemies are controlled with custom dice that give them a simple series of actions they carry out when activated, with stronger enemies taking multiple actions as they scale up. Their movement and attacks feel purposeful, but are quick and simple enough that you get to focus on the heroes, rather than getting bogged down in the minutia of individual swarms of enemies.</p>

<p><em>Warhammer Quest Darkwater</em> features 4 heroes initially, and 3 unlockable heroes that you'll see on the box of the game, and as you put the miniatures together for the set. We'll leave you to discover the 3 unlockable heroes, but the 4 core heroes are:</p>

<ul><li>Edmark Valoran, known as the Manticore Knight, has the best defense of the heroes and has a chance to damage adjacent enemies when he blocks their hits. He starts the game with the Shield of the Manticore, which can be used to automatically block a hit before a saving throw.</li>
	<li>Bren Tylis, the Renegade Saint, gets to choose each round to reroll her move, attack, or save rolls. It's a pretty powerful ability, giving you a better chance to achieve what you need to that round. Bren starts the game with the Relics of the Past equipment card, which can be used when you discard a reward card to stop it from being discarded on a 5+, which is great for keeping some single-use items around.</li>
	<li>Inara Sion, the Cleansing Blade, has a poor defence, but a great ranged attack to keep her&nbsp;away from enemies. They also have a Barrier of Water ability on their card, which can be used like the core abilities to block hexes to enemies, and make lethal hexes safe for the heroes. Their Blade of Flowing Water equipment also lets her&nbsp;move the counter for free, without having to power the ability.</li>
	<li>Drolf Ironhead, the Grizzled Explorer, has a fixed movement, a ranged attack, and can ignore lethal hexes by sprinting through them (by spending more energy on the move card to move 6 hexes instead of the standard movement). They come equipped with the Ranger's Kit, which can let them move through blocked hexes, which is amazing for last-minute objective saves or flanking an enemy who might have your party pinned.</li>
</ul><figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-quest-darkwater-5.jpg?itok=ZqPwGYau 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-quest-darkwater-5.jpg?itok=eopu3qqp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Each of the 3&nbsp;<em>Warhammer Quest Darkwater</em> acts in the campaign are driven by the act cards. Cleanse the Spawn Pit is used as the tutorial for your first game.</figcaption></figure><h2>Standing Against The Rot</h2>

<p>The <em>Warhammer Quest Darkwater</em> campaign consists of 3 acts, and each act is made up of 15 act cards (drawn randomly from 32 for each act). Each act has a final boss (of which there are 3 possible scenarios to face them in), and another 14 cards made up of encounters, events, and rest sites.</p>

<p>This means that you could play the game through all 3 acts, deliberately using different cards for each play-through, and have 2 unique play-throughs with still a spare card and an extra boss scenario, but the randomisation element will keep each play-through unique, or if you just want a one-off game, you can use any of the acts in skirmish mode.</p>

<p>Playing through the campaign first, before embarking on skirmish mode, is worthwhile, as you unlock extra characters and rewards as you do, and it avoids spoilers in skirmish mode, should you wish to play through the entire campaign.</p>

<p>Each encounter is pretty fast to play through, and you can get through a few in an evening, or half an act if you're lucky with event and rest site cards. This is helped by the quick setup for each encounter, letting you progress onto the next quickly. There are also several storage boxes for the heroes and acts, to keep the cards tidy in the box, and help you remember where you got to if you do have to pack away before finishing the campaign.</p>

<p>I had an absolute blast with<i> Warhammer Quest Darkwater.</i> I started my journey into miniatures gaming with <em>Heroquest</em> in the early '90s,&nbsp;and I played the original <em>Warhammer Quest</em> on release a few years later, so there's always been a bit of nostalgia here for me. Having also played the last 2 iterations, <em>Blackstone Fortress</em> and <em>Cursed City</em>, and reviewing them here on the site, this has been one of my favourite dungeon crawler games to date. The setting is perfect, and it captures the oppressive rot nature of Nurgle, whilst still being accessible for gamers who might be having their first experience here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Set up is fast, and games have a great flow with straightforward AI control for the enemies. The heroes feel unique, and the campaign is fast-flowing, but long enough to give it a great sense of depth. Repeat plays are also possible with the number of act cards across the 3 acts, and randomising them when generating the campaign. Previous <em>Warhammer Quest</em> editions got multiple expansions, and I hope that we see that here for <em>Darkwater</em> too.</p>
