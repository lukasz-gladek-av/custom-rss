            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and Xbox have confirmed that the teased&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2 Halo 3: ODST&nbsp;</em>crossover is indeed real, and it's taking the form of the game's latest Warbond, which also happens to be its first "Legendary Warbond".</p>

<p>The crossover was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-halo-crossover-seemingly-teased" rel="nofollow">first teased</a> as part of a&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>trailer promoting the game's Xbox release, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-xbox-series-xs-august" rel="nofollow">set for next Tuesday</a>. Rather than a new map or an in-game event,&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Halo 3: ODST&nbsp;</em>crossover will instead take the form of a Warbond.</p>

<p>That means you can expect new weapons, new armor and capes, and all the other good stuff that usually comes with a&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Warbond, but as the "Legendary" designation suggests, Sony and Arrowhead reckon they're kicking it up a notch with this one.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-halo-3-odst-warbond-armor.jpg?itok=2ZatJhGW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-halo-3-odst-warbond-armor.jpg?itok=JR7IMNeW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Helldivers 2</em>'s new&nbsp;<em>Halo 3: ODST&nbsp;</em>Warbond brings lots of new&nbsp;<em>Halo</em>-themed gear to collect.</figcaption></figure><p>This Warbond comes complete with four weapons, and they should all be pretty familiar to&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>fans. The MA5C assault rifle is an iconic weapon that packs an ammo counter and a compass, while the M6C pistol boasts <i>Helldivers 2</i>'s first suppressor.</p>

<p>The M90A shotgun has a flashlight attached to it to help you see what you're shooting in darker areas, and the M7S SMG includes a suppressor you can't remove, so it's perfect for sneakier engagements (although it'll still rip enemies to shreds in a loud firefight).</p>

<p>Of course, it wouldn't be a&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Warbond if there wasn't some armor to enjoy as well, and the&nbsp;<em>Halo 3: ODST&nbsp;</em>Warbond features two sets: the A-9 Helljumper and the A-35 Recon, both modeled after iconic&nbsp;<em>Halo 3: ODST&nbsp;</em>characters.</p>

<p>There's plenty more included as part of this Warbond as well, so make sure you check out the full announcement over on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/19/helldivers-2-x-halo-odst-legendary-warbond-arrives-august-26/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation Blog</a> if you want to see everything that's included.</p>




<p>The&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2 Halo 3: ODST&nbsp;</em>Warbond will be available on August 26th, which is the same day the game launches on Xbox Series X|S. It's also currently available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/helldivers-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and you can read <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/helldivers-2-review-fighting-for-managed-democracy" rel="nofollow">our review of it right here</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Monster Hunter Wilds PC Optimizations Coming in Winter, Capcom Promises]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-optimizations-winter</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-optimizations-coming-in-winter-capcom-promises.1273599/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has revealed that PC optimizations are on their way to&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>later this year, likely in an attempt to combat the negative feedback the game has been receiving for its PC version in recent months.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1957473035885121806" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on social media, Capcom says that Title Update 4, which is on the way this winter (but which won't be the game's next major update, with Title Update 3 still yet to arrive), will bring "CPU and GPU related optimizations".</p>

<p>This round of improvements will be followed by "a second stage of mitigation measures afterwards". It's all part of what the developer and publisher calls a "multifaceted plan" to improve&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' PC performance.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-optimizations-winter-birds.jpg?itok=Qa2QenZK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-optimizations-winter-birds.jpg?itok=-iLU-It7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Presumably because the PC port could give up at any minute.</figcaption></figure><p>Capcom says it'll share more specifics about the optimizations in question "in the future", and that "gradual improvements" will also be implemented in the weeks ahead as part of other updates.</p>

<p>Just in case you need a reminder,&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>&nbsp;launched back in February to a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-8m" rel="nofollow">pretty rapturous</a> (or perhaps that should be "raptor"ous) sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-steam-player-record" rel="nofollow">reception</a>, but players bemoaned its PC performance, with many reporting serious issues even on high-end machines.</p>

<p>In the last couple of months, those criticisms have become even louder, with&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>dipping to a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Mostly Negative rating</a> on Steam. A quick glance at the negative reviews accruing on the game's page shows that PC performance is still a huge point of contention.</p>

<p>Still, there's reason to be optimistic that Capcom will fix&nbsp;<em>Wilds</em>' PC problems. Another big problem players brought up was the game's lack of endgame content, and Capcom <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-update-1021-patch-notes" rel="nofollow">recently released an update</a> to address that issue, so hopefully, Title Update 4 will do the same for players' PC woes.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Safe In Our World Launches Industry-First Gaming Mental Health Accreditation]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/safe-in-our-world-mental-health-star-accreditation</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/safe-in-our-world-launches-industry-first-gaming-mental-health-accreditation.1273554/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Gaming mental health charity Safe In Our World has launched the Mental Health Star Accreditation, an industry-first method to help gaming industry companies and studios shore up their efforts when it comes to employee mental health.</p>

<p>As revealed in a press release, the Mental Health Star Accreditation is "designed to provide companies with the opportunity to achieve a mark of excellence in workplace wellbeing", something that's sorely needed in today's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/spiders-layoffs" rel="nofollow">uncertain</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/supermassive-games-layoffs-directive-8020-delayed" rel="nofollow">volatile</a>, and often <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-revenue-up-microsoft-2025" rel="nofollow">seemingly cruel</a> industry.</p>

<p>If a company chooses to undergo the process of accreditation, it will first be audited by Safe In Our World; the charity says it'll carry out a "company-wide audit of mental health policies, practices, culture, and sentiment".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/safe-in-our-world-mental-health-accreditation-star.jpg?itok=ymPCBpfD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/safe-in-our-world-mental-health-accreditation-star.jpg?itok=ajXDgoBG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Safe In Our World's new Mental Health Star accreditation aims to bolster companies' efforts to support mental health initiatives.</figcaption></figure><p>Using the data gathered from that audit, Safe In Our World then puts together a report that will tell a company what it's doing well to support its employees' mental health, as well as what could be done better.</p>

<p>If a company successfully completes the accreditation, they'll be awarded with one of three tiers: Dedicated, Accomplished, or Outstanding, depending on how satisfied Safe In Our World is with the company's performance.</p>

<p>Each accreditation lasts three years and comes complete with "annual check-ins and support" from the charity, as well as badges and other media assets for companies to display on their platforms to show off their achievement.</p>

<p>Companies that don't succeed in attaining the accreditation will be provided with a "thorough and detailed report" regarding why they didn't make the cut, as well as "practical advice and resources to aid improvement". They'll also be able to re-apply whenever they like.</p>




<p>Mental health remains a serious issue when it comes to the gaming industry, especially when <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" rel="nofollow">even employees of massive gaming corporations</a> could find themselves in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/respawn-layoffs-ea-cuts-titanfall-game" rel="nofollow">layoff firing line</a> with very little warning.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see whether the Mental Health Star Accreditation is adopted en masse by the industry, but if you ask me, it's a much-needed step in the right direction for protecting employee mental health. Stay tuned for more.</p>
