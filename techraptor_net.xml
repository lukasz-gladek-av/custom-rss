            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tribe-nine-shutdown<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Akatsuki Games has announced that its free-to-play "brutal action RPG"&nbsp;<em>Tribe Nine&nbsp;</em>will be ending service, and the announcement comes just a few months after the game's initial release.</p>

<p>Following in the footsteps of other Japanese mobile-focused games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-brave-exvius-shutting-down" rel="nofollow">Final Fantasy Brave Exvius</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nier-reincarnation-shutting-down" rel="nofollow"><em>Nier Reincarnation</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Tribe Nine&nbsp;</em>will be shutting down in November, according to a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2376580/view/500572747038983820" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the game's official Steam page.</p>

<p>In the post, Akatsuki Games says that the decision to shut down&nbsp;<em>Tribe Nine&nbsp;</em>was taken after "careful consideration". The studio doesn't provide any more specific reason for the game's closure, but it does say that its development team worked hard to "provide excellent service and improve player experience".</p>

<p>Not only that, but all "new features, adjustments, and known-issue fixes previously announced" won't be implemented, so&nbsp;<em>Tribe Nine&nbsp;</em>will remain in its current state until November.</p>

<p>Additionally, new characters Ichinosuke Akiba and Saizo Akiba, who were both due to debut as part of&nbsp;<em>Tribe Nine</em>'s roadmap, will be canned, and any Paid Enigma Entities you've used in the game will be fully refunded. Naturally, in-game shop items won't be available to buy for real money either.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Tribe Nine&nbsp;</em>is, it's the flagship video game of an intended multimedia franchise masterminded by Akatsuki Games and Kazutaka Kodaka's Too Kyo Games, which is also responsible for&nbsp;<em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</em>.</p>

<p>In any case, you can still play&nbsp;<em>Tribe Nine&nbsp;</em>on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2376580/TRIBE_NINE/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and mobile devices for the time being. The game will shut down on November 27th.</p>
