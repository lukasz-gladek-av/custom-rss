            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hello-kitty-island-adventure-sales-500k<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Sunblink has announced that&nbsp;<em>Hello Kitty Island Adventure&nbsp;</em>sales have reached a major milestone just 30 days after the game's release on PC and Switch.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/03/hello-kitty-island-adventure-sales-top-500000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gematsu</a>, the cozy life sim has reached 500,000 sales, which isn't bad considering it's only been available as an individually-sold game for around a month.</p>

<p>If you need a reminder,&nbsp;<em>Hello Kitty Island Adventure&nbsp;</em>was actually released on iOS back in July 2023, but the game was part of the Apple Arcade subscription service (which will also be playing host to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/katamari-damacy-rolling-live-apple-arcade" rel="nofollow">first new&nbsp;<em>Katamari&nbsp;</em>game in almost eight years</a> come next month).</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Hello Kitty Island Adventure</em>, it's a life sim based on Sanrio's hugely popular&nbsp;<em>Hello Kitty&nbsp;</em>property. It bears similarities to&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing</em>; you'll be exploring and restoring a mysterious island, all while befriending its inhabitants (although this time around they are, of course, based on other <i>Hello Kitty&nbsp;</i>properties).</p>

<p>Unlike&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing</em>, you'll also find lots of different areas and biomes to explore in&nbsp;<em>Hello Kitty Island Adventure</em>, including a volcano, "the ocean's depths", and "an island in the clouds".</p>

<p>Of course, since the game is a life sim, you can also expect plenty of recipes to cook and craft, as well as the ability to renovate cabins on your island in order to attract new residents. You might even unlock new storylines involving those residents.</p>




<p>You can check out <i>Hello Kitty Island Adventure&nbsp;</i>right now on PC and Switch, and it's also available via Apple Arcade, with a PlayStation port on the way in the future as well.
