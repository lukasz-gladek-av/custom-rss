            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/next-planet-crafter-update-biggest-yet<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Miju Games has announced a brand new update for open-world survival-crafter&nbsp;<em>The Planet Crafter</em>, and the Moons Update is set to be the game's biggest yet, according to the developer.</p>

<p>Miju says that the "love" it received upon <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/planet-crafter-planet-humble-dlc-release-date" rel="nofollow">releasing</a> the game's recent&nbsp;<em>Planet Humble&nbsp;</em>DLC persuaded the studio to "continue to support&nbsp;<em>The Planet Crafter&nbsp;</em>for a long time", and that the Moons Update will "bring [the game] to the next level".</p>

<p>You'll be able to visit two new moons after you've finished terraforming your first planet, and once you're on a moon, you'll be able to terraform that as well. You'll keep all your blueprints, knowledge, and equipment, and you'll even be able to exchange resources between planets and moons.</p>

The changelog is temporary right now, though, so more could be added to the update as it nears its full release.</p>

<p>Right now, you can only check out the Moons Update on&nbsp;<em>The Planet Crafter</em>'s development branch. The update doesn't have a full release date yet, but if you want to see how to access the dev branch, you can check out <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1284190/announcements/detail/588390482275468569" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">this Steam post</a>.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>The Planet Crafter</em>, it's an open-world survival-crafting game based largely around terraforming planets. Your goal is to land on a planet and render its ecosystem habitable for humanity.</p>

<p>To that end, you'll have to gather resources from said planet in order to survive, and you'll need to find a way to generate oxygen and warmth to make sure you can live in your new environment as well.</p>




<p><em>The Planet Crafter&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1284190/The_Planet_Crafter/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>.
