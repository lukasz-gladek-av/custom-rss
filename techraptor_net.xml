            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Demonschool&nbsp;</em>developer Necrosoft says that it tried "something different" for the credits sequence in the game, opting to list the full duties carried out by staff rather than a brief description of each person's role.</p>

<p>Over on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/brandon.insertcredit.com/post/3m6fuipkh4k2u" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>, Necrosoft director Brandon Sheffield says the team used a format of "name, title, lengthy description of what they did" for each staff member's credit on&nbsp;<em>Demonschool</em>.</p>

<p>This means that, rather than simply reading "art lead", a credit might outline that a staff member "did most of the 3D modeling and rigging as well as creating most backgrounds", or that they "created most avatars and poses, all overlays and menu art, [and] the game logo".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/necrosoft-demonschool-credits.jpg?itok=cqBDsfge 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/necrosoft-demonschool-credits.jpg?itok=WQKF_MDr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Demonschool</em>'s credits are serious about giving staff members their due.</figcaption></figure><p>Sheffield says he wants to make sure that those who choose to watch&nbsp;<em>Demonschool</em>'s credits (which, he acknowledges, won't be everybody) will "come to understand how each person participated", and that doing things this way might help staff members to elucidate their roles during job interviews in future.</p>

<p>He also says that, in addition to&nbsp;<em>Demonschool</em>'s core team, Necrosoft credited "everyone who ever touched the game in any way". Sheffield acknowledges this means the credits for&nbsp;<em>Demonschool&nbsp;</em>are long for a small team, but to that, he says "why be stingy?".</p>

<p>It's refreshing to see an indie team being so upfront about its credits, especially in an era where specific studios and staff members often <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gaming-business-roundup-july-12th" rel="nofollow">aren't credited</a> in major <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/original-metroid-prime-developers-omitted-from-remastered-credits" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">releases</a> on which they worked. Whether or not this style gets adopted across the world of indie gaming remains to be seen, but I sure hope it does.</p>

<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Demonschool</em>, if you're unfamiliar with it, the game is a tactical RPG that combines the minutiae of school life with a strategic puzzle-style combat system in which you must battle demons between your own world and theirs.</p>




<p>The game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/demonschool-persona-inspired-tactics-rpg-announced" rel="nofollow">revealed back in 2022</a>, but was subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/demonschool-release-date-september-2025" rel="nofollow">delayed numerous times</a>, most recently due to Necrosoft wanting to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-indie-delays" rel="nofollow">avoid a clash</a> with then-hotly-anticipated Metroidvania&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>.</p>

<p>Happily, however,&nbsp;<em>Demonschool&nbsp;</em>is finally out, and you can take a look at it right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1900250/Demonschool/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10007754" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/demonschool/9p7d4xfj2xwf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/demonschool-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>
