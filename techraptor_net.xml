            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Schedule I </em>developer TVGS has announced an expansion thanks to the simulator's widespread success, rendering the outfit "an actual game studio", in TVGS' own words.</p><p>As revealed in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3164500/view/523111043238464175" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">a post on Steam</a>, TVGS now has a central office location in Sydney, and the studio has also been able to hire a new developer (whose name is Rob, if you're interested).&nbsp;</p><p>A new 3D and technical artist will also be recruited soon; TVGS says that by the end of 2026, there will "likely be four people working on <em>Schedule I</em>". That might not sound like much, but given that the game is essentially a solo effort right now, that's pretty impressive.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Schedule I </em>developer TVGS is doing pretty well for itself, it seems.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As well as revealing the new office, TVGS also says it's releasing a <em>Schedule I </em>patch next week, but don't get too excited; it'll mainly consist of "bug fixing and QoL improvements", in the studio's own words.</p><p>Following that update, the remainder of January will be spent "cleaning up the codebase" and bringing new developer Rob up to speed; TVGS says he's got to "catch up on 120k+ lines of code", so it's not going to be an easy job for him.</p><p>Once all of this is taken care of, TVGS says it will "get to work on the next update", but the studio says it's learned its lesson from prior update delays, so the next major patch for <em>Schedule I </em>won't be announced until TVGS is "confident we'll hit it on time".</p><p>If you're wondering exactly what <em>Schedule I </em>is, well, there's no easy way to say this: it's a drug-dealing simulator that lets you peddle illicit substances to all and sundry. Clutch your pearls as you will.</p>
<p><em>Schedule I </em>has indeed proven very successful; at last count, it had a 24-hour Steam <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3164500/charts/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">player peak</a> of over 30,000.

  </picture><h2>Second Place - Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector</h2><p>Developer: Jump Over the Age | Release Date: January 31st, 2025</p><p>Written by Andrew Otton</p><p>All games have some form of writing behind them, no matter how threadbare a narrative it may have. With <em>Citizen Sleeper 2</em>, the writing IS the game. Large swaths of the game is reading, learning about the world, about the way the world affects those that live there.</p><p>As beautiful and enjoyable as the prose may be throughout the game, its how gameplay mechanics enhance the emotions evoked by the narrative and plot that really elevate<em> Citizen Sleeper 2</em>. It is, after all, a game and it uses that to its advantage.</p><p>It's easy to see something so narrative and word-dense turning some people off, but this is the perfect game for those that love to sink their teeth into a well-written novel as they are to have a gaming session or two.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Winner - Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</h2><p>Developer: Sandfall Interactive | Release Date: April 24th, 2025</p><p>Written by Robert Scarpinito</p><p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> takes a lot of bold swings in its narrative. Every subsequent act reframes the previous, expanding your perspective of the world and its characters. What awaits at the end is a tragic choice that only the player can make—and there's convincing arguments on both sides.</p><p>From the first hour, it's clear that this game is operating on a different caliber. This world has operated with its own natural laws for years, and you're just trying to catch up and learn. The expeditions and their exploits show the desperation and ingenuity of the people of Lumiere, and their stories are just as compelling as the interpersonal drama that takes centerstage in act 3.</p><p><em>Clair Obscur </em>also does something few games do: The protagonist makes his own choices without any input from the player. In fact, the player doesn't have insights into his thought process either. It makes him feel more alive and like a real character rather than an avatar you're trying to min-max for the most optimal party.</p><p>For all its fantasy elements and weird paintbrush monsters, the game highlights simple, universal emotions and themes anyone can relate to. Grief, escapism, trauma responses, sibling rivalry—it's all there, brought to life in harrowing scenarios with simple but effective metaphors.</p><p>To this day, people debate which ending is the "correct" one, but the truth of the matter is, both are valid. The narrative tells such a human story, and like most tragic human stories, they're complicated. It just depends on your own perspective, and that perspective may change over time.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

Of course, as is usually the case for sales figures, that number includes all of the platforms on which the game is available (which is pretty much all of them).</p><p>Square Enix stops short of saying whether or not any further remaster plans are underway as a result of <em>The Ivalice Chronicles</em>' success, so we don't yet know whether <em>Final Fantasy Tactics Advance </em>could be next to receive the spruce-up treatment, but let's hope so.</p><figure role="group">

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For many, the whole reason they play games is that it brings them together with friends. Others, it's for the thrill of competition. Whatever the reason is, multiplayer games are often the throughline of most people's year with games. Here are our best of 2025.</p><p>Here are the nominees for TechRaptor's 2025 Best Multiplayer Award for exceptional multiplayer gameplay and design.</p><ul><li>Battlefield 6</li><li>Elden Ring Nightreign</li><li>Mario Kart World</li><li>Peak</li><li>Split Fiction</li></ul><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/awards" rel="nofollow">Check out here</a>&nbsp;for our other award categories.</p><hr><h2>Third Place - Split Fiction</h2><p>Developer: Hazelight Studios | Release Date: March 6th, 2025</p><p>Written by Robert Scarpinito</p><p>Josef Fares may forever be the man who publicly hated on the Oscars once, but let's not forget that he and his studio champion unique multiplayer experiences. <em>Split Fiction</em> is the latest of his games, and it's filled to the brim with gameplay that puts cooperation centerstage.</p><p>It starts off easy, with each player getting access to a couple unique mechanics. These mechanics compliment each other, often requiring a one-two punch to solve a puzzle or beat an enemy. It's simple, but the game layers on challenges to mix things up. These mechanics change every level and evolve over the course of each level, keeping things fresh.</p><p>Each stage swaps back and forth between fantasy and sci-fi for narrative reasons, and homages to other franchises are peppered throughout. It all culminates with a fantastic interdimensional setpiece that puts the marketing behind<em> Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</em> to shame.</p><p>That doesn't even scratch the surface of some of the more unique gameplay moments in <em>Split Fiction</em>. Everyone loves the motorcycle chase scene with the CAPTCHA mini game, but no one talks about when the game turns into pinball or <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> for a minute.</p><p>Few games go in this hard on a crafted two-player co-op experience, and <em>Split Fiction</em> is an easy recommendation for two people to enjoy each other's company over a game.</p><h2>Second Place - Battlefield 6</h2><p>Developer: Battlefield Studios | October 10th, 2025</p><p>Written by Austin Suther</p><p>In late 2021, <em>Battlefield </em>took a bit of a nosedive with the release of <em>Battlefield 2042</em>, which was widely considered one of, if not the worst entries in the series. Following that incident, Respawn developer Vince Zampella (whose legacy cannot be overstated enough) was called in to oversee the <em>Battlefield </em>series. Zampella unfortunately passed late last year, but there is no doubt in my mind he played a pivotal role in turning this series around with <em>Battlefield 6</em>.</p><p>With <em>Battlefield 6</em>, we’re met with a robust multiplayer experience comprising an absolute TON of guns and customizations, giving us some of the weightiest and most visceral combat in the series. Playing on a giant map with dozens of other players, or getting together with your own squad of friends to accomplish objectives, feels like the good ol’ days that made <em>Battlefield </em>such a coveted franchise.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Winner - Peak</h2><p>Developer: Aggro Crab, Landfall | Release Date: June 16th, 2025</p><p>Written by Robert Scarpinito</p><p>The term "friendslop" was coined recently to describe a game like <em>Peak</em>, but it undermines just how great of an experience <em>Peak</em> is. It's silly, challenging, and rewarding. Most games are generally better with friends, but <em>Peak </em>transforms into something that feels like lightning in a bottle.</p><p>Climbing the newly generated mountain every day requires a lot of effort, teamwork, and communication, which all can breed frustration and stress in multiplayer environments. But with its cartoony presentation and lighthearted atmosphere, the vibes stay relaxed.<br>Ingenious items keep the gameplay exciting, where every situation can be answered with the perfect item. The limiting inventory adds just enough tension to keep things engaging, especially with how it forces you to communicate—and opens the door for some mischievous item misuse.</p><p>Even failure is funny in <em>Peak</em>. Nothing beats hearing your friend fall as the spatial audio does its magic. Coming back as a ghost is great too, giving everyone the ability to participate and make color commentary, regardless of skill level.</p><p>For what feels like a silly joke, for what amounts to a "friendslop" game, <em>Peak</em> exemplifies what a perfect casual game night should be. This isn't for the sweaty leaderboard chasers; this is for the silly group of friends who love a good laugh.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
