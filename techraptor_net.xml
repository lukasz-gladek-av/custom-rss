            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's been a minute since we've had a good ol' Wild West game, and while&nbsp;<em>Outlaws + Handful of Missions: Remaster</em>&nbsp;technically isn't recent, this new port from <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/nightdive-studios" rel="nofollow">Nightdive Studios</a> comes with a number of improvements to revitalize this lesser-known FPS.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like many westerns, tragedy is at the heart of this tale. James Anderson, former lawman and current badass, is on a quest for revenge after his peaceful life in retirement is ruined. With his wife deceased at the hands of some outlaws, and his daughter kidnapped by the very same, it's time to put the "Wild" in Wild West.</p>



<h2>Another Great Remaster Treatment from Nightdive</h2>

<p>Like most games from 1997, there's always some jank to be expected. That's why we can always trust Nightdive Studios to do a good job to make games feel modern and revitalized, which is the case here with&nbsp;<em>Outlaws + Handful of Missions: Remaster.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>The most noticeable difference between the original and its remaster is a fresh coat of paint. Every aspect of this title gets an improvement, visually. Weapon and enemy models are touched up, textures (from the ground you're standing on to the skyboxes above) are expertly recreated, all the while retaining their retro charm.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other noticeable improvements can be found in its cutscenes. Now,&nbsp;<em>Outlaws + Handful of Missions: Remaster</em>&nbsp;stands out a bit with its cartoonish cutscenes, with the excellent animation of characters making the story feel more like a classic, animated movie. These cutscenes are also brushed up to look cleaner for the modern day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of these visual improvements are enhanced even further with support for high refresh rates and resolutions. If you're familiar with Nightdive remasters, none of this should be a surprise. What I&nbsp;<em>really</em>&nbsp;like about this remaster is that you can switch from the new graphics to the old seamlessly, so it's always fun to see how areas are improved over the original.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other quality of life improvements come in this package. Controller support, for example, feels great to use even if I much prefer keyboard and mouse. Still, I didn't need to fiddle with the keybindings for my Xbox controller, and I was able to adapt to the control scheme almost immediately, so it's good news for those who prefer gamepads.&nbsp;</p>

Now we're talkin'.</figcaption></figure><p>I didn't encounter many bugs, if any at all, though one issue I encountered might qualify. The height of my jump would be really inconsistent; for example, I encountered a tower I had to scale, but my character couldn't jump up the stair-like ledges. I took a break from&nbsp;<em>Outlaws</em>, came back the next day, and the jump worked.</p>

<p>This weird inconsistency was a source of great frustration since it could essentially softlock me in several areas, but it would somehow fix itself if I kept trying or came back later. I really can't tell if this is an error on my part or the game's, but it's worth noting that this might happen to you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another issue that isn't related to bugs or anything like that is visibility.&nbsp;<em>Outlaws</em>&nbsp;can be&nbsp;<em>very</em>&nbsp;dark in some areas, and if you run out of lamp oil, you'd better pray you're going the right way. Similarly, crucial objects like keys and crowbars to pry blocked doors felt practically invisible, so these were missed a lot. The pickup radius for these items is also extremely small.</p>

And directions.</figcaption></figure><h2>Where in Tarnation Do I Go?</h2>

<p>Although it is perhaps more narrative-focused than other FPS games from its time,&nbsp;<em>Outlaws</em>&nbsp;is still a classic shooter at its core. This particular FPS is created by the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/star-wars-dark-forces-remaster-review-return-of-kex" rel="nofollow"><em>Star Wars: Dark Forces</em></a>&nbsp;team, and that happens to be one of my favorite games of the genre.&nbsp;<em>Outlaws,</em>&nbsp;then, should be a slam dunk, right?</p>

<p>Well, I'm a bit mixed on this one. Let's start with the setting: It's the Wild West. I was never the biggest fan of westerns, and level design is usually my favorite aspect of boomer shooters. They do a decent job at creating a variety of stages, but I was never blown away by them, perhaps because of my personal biases.</p>

<p>Wild West towns, heavily armed forts, and even a moving train -- these are some of the levels you can expect in&nbsp;<em>Outlaws</em>. The train level is probably my favorite, as they usually are, because of their tight quarters and close-ranged combat. That, and I actually knew where to go (forward, obviously), whereas most levels are maze-like to the extreme.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/outlaws-handful-of-missions-remaster-fort.jpg?itok=coIxVkUK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/outlaws-handful-of-missions-remaster-fort.jpg?itok=IkvJWBBv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Plenty of things to hide, even in a single fort.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Star Wars: Dark Forces</em>' level design was also maze-like at times, but I never felt lost with the exception of a level or two. In&nbsp;<em>Outlaws</em>, the later levels continued to frustrate me as I bumbled around, looking for whatever the heck this game wanted me to do. Some of the solutions are puzzle-based, which require picking up certain items and interacting with specific objects.</p>

<p>The puzzle design in a number of levels here is obtuse and devoid of fun, and sometimes it was hard to find where you needed to place certain items. I'd wager half of my playtime with&nbsp;<em>Outlaws</em>&nbsp;was because I was lost, which is just so frustrating. The issue with keys being super hard to see in environments exacerbates this issue.</p>

<p>Some levels, particularly in the "Handful of Missions" portion (these are just extra missions separate from the story), feel more well-designed. The Civil War level is an exciting and enemy-heavy level with a fun theme around it, and the Marshal Training missions are shorter but more combat-focused as well -- bonus, you usually don't get lost in these ones.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The gunplay in&nbsp;<em>Outlaws</em>&nbsp;feels a bit different than your traditional boomer shooter. Weapons have high stopping power, often dropping enemies in one or two hits. Even the base pistol, your trusty revolver, can drop most enemies no problem. It's not super accurate at long range, but if you use your alt-fire to fan the gun's hammer, it's a force to be reckoned with.</p>

<p>The rifle with its scope attachment is crucial, and it's super satisfying to take out a bunch of enemies from afar like a sniper. This is pretty crucial to succeed in&nbsp;<em>Outlaws</em>, or else you'll end up dead, and fast.</p>

<p>Enemies are just as lethal as the player, with their guns dealing a large amount of damage any time you're hit. Walk into a room full of enemies without a plan and you'll get dropped in a second, and that makes for quite an exciting time, at least when you're not bumbling around looking for where to go next.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/outlaws-handful-of-missions-remaster-guns.jpg?itok=2OCwZKj9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/outlaws-handful-of-missions-remaster-guns.jpg?itok=JXmBCkMw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A shotgun can be useful&nbsp;<em>sometimes</em>.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>In terms of weapon variety, I find&nbsp;<em>Outlaws</em>&nbsp;to be lacking. There aren't all that many weapons to begin with, and three of them are shotguns. The shotguns all feel the same to use, and frankly, aren't all that viable when you have to reload after each shot. Most of my time was spent using the rifle and revolver, and their ammo is plentiful.</p>

<p>You have dynamite, which is a bit like grenades but more dangerous, and the throwing mechanics for it seem a bit clunky, as well as some knives that I also couldn't figure out how to throw well. If all else fails, you can use your fists and kill most enemies in one hit -- which is actually pretty funny -- but it's dangerous to get in close.</p>

<p><em>Outlaws + Handful of Missions: Remaster</em>&nbsp;was a FPS I wasn't all too familiar with, despite my quest to consume every boomer shooter ever invented. I was glad to have played this one, especially with Nightdive's improvements, but I don't see myself coming back. Level design is just a bit too obtuse. At this point,&nbsp;<em>Outlaws</em>&nbsp;is nearly 30 years old, so there's not much that can be done but to enjoy what is an adequate, if frustrating, shooter in this new remaster.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Level-5 has announced that&nbsp;<em>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road&nbsp;</em>sales have reached a major milestone within the game's first week on sale.</p>

<p>As announced on social media,&nbsp;<em>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road&nbsp;</em>has <a href="https://x.com/InazumaSeries/status/1991397741881356657" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">racked up 500,000 sales</a> across all of the platforms on which it's currently available. Given that it's a niche soccer RPG, that's a pretty impressive number for the game's first seven days.</p>

<p>The figure puts&nbsp;the latest&nbsp;<em>Inazuma Eleven&nbsp;</em>game in some pretty illustrious company as well; it's sold the same amount as indie hits like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-im-not-a-human-500k-sales" rel="nofollow">"anxiety horror"&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-im-not-a-human-500k-sales" rel="nofollow">No, I'm Not a Human</a>&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-sales-500k" rel="nofollow">cozy RPG&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em></a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-sales-500k-match.jpg?itok=NvsFBLDY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-sales-500k-match.jpg?itok=8TIT053i 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road&nbsp;</em>has sold half a million copies since launching last week.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road&nbsp;</em>is Level-5's second major hit this year, following the release of&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em>back in May.</p>

<p>That game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-switch-2-500k-sales" rel="nofollow">managed to pick up half a million sales</a> in its first week as well, and it went on to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-sales-1m-new-update" rel="nofollow">pass the million mark</a> before a month had elapsed, so here's hoping that the studio's latest will achieve the same result as well.</p>

<p>It's certainly been a long and strange journey for&nbsp;<em>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</em>. The game was announced all the way back in 2016 under the name&nbsp;<em>Inazuma Eleven Ares</em>,&nbsp;and in the years between then and now, it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/inazuma-eleven-heroes-great-road-delayed-until-2021" rel="nofollow">delayed numerous times</a>, receiving a couple of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-will-come-west-new-trailer-details-revealed" rel="nofollow">name changes</a> along the way.</p>

<p>This is the latest title in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Inazuma Eleven&nbsp;</em>series, and it follows the journey of new protagonists Destin Billows and Harper Evans, with a story taking place a quarter of a century after the events of the first game.</p>
