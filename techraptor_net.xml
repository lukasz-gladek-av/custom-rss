            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chivalry-2-torn-banner-layoffs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Chivalry 2&nbsp;</em>developer Torn Banner has become the latest studio to be hit by the ongoing wave of industry layoffs, following in the footsteps of both indie and major studios alike.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7269735996861091841/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on the official Torn Banner LinkedIn page, CEO Steve Piggott says his studio has made the "very difficult decision to undergo a restructure and reduce some of our talented workforce". Piggott doesn't state how many employees have been laid off.</p>

<p>He puts the layoffs down to Torn Banner being a "fully independent, self-funded developer" that is currently "up against many challenges", describing himself and his studio as "saddened to part ways with some of our incredible team".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/torn-banner-layoffs-chivalry-2-army.jpg?itok=_bgY0Mbz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/torn-banner-layoffs-chivalry-2-army.jpg?itok=GOA7c0Yc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Chivalry 2</em>'s Torn Banner is the latest studio to report layoffs.</figcaption></figure><p>With regards to the future of Torn Banner's games, Piggott says that&nbsp;<em>Chivalry 2&nbsp;</em>won't be affected by these layoffs; the game "is not impacted", and servers will remain up as normal. As a reminder,&nbsp;<em>Chivalry 2&nbsp;</em>received its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chivalry-2-content-complete" rel="nofollow">final major content update</a> earlier this year.</p>

<p>In addition, Piggott says he and Torn Banner are still committed to working on&nbsp;<em>No More Room in Hell 2</em>, which he says he still believes is "one of the most unique and incredible zombie experiences out there". He goes as far as to call&nbsp;<em>No More Room in Hell 2&nbsp;</em>"central to our goals as a studio".</p>

<p>At time of writing, however, it seems that players are divided on whether they agree with him or not.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>No More Room in Hell 2&nbsp;</em>is currently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/292000/No_More_Room_in_Hell_2/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sitting at a "Mixed" rating</a> on Steam across over 6,600 reviews, and its 24-hour player peak <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/292000/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">stands at just 228</a>, which isn't a great number for what is supposed to be one of a studio's cornerstone games.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/no-more-room-in-hell-2-torn-banner.jpg?itok=dp3ELhqy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/no-more-room-in-hell-2-torn-banner.jpg?itok=xl3FcFfx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>No More Room in Hell 2&nbsp;</em>may not quite be the success Torn Banner had hoped it would be.</figcaption></figure><p>Still, it's entirely possible that with the dedication Piggott seems determined to show to&nbsp;<em>No More Room in Hell 2</em>, the game can be turned around prior to its 1.0 release, which is currently scheduled for next year.</p>

<p>Torn Banner's layoffs are just the latest in a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-june-14th" rel="nofollow">sweeping wave</a> that has been consuming both major industry bodies and smaller studios alike, leading to mass layoffs, project <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tequila-works-rime-sexy-brutale-layoffs" rel="nofollow">cancellations</a>, and studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/piranha-bytes-shut-down-report" rel="nofollow">closures</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-console-sales<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Kinetic Games has revealed that&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>console sales have already hit a very impressive milestone, even though the game has only been out on consoles for just over a month.</p>

<p>In a press release, Kinetic marks 35 days since&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia</em>'s console launch, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-console-release" rel="nofollow">delayed</a> multiple <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-console-delay-halloween" rel="nofollow">times</a> before finally happening just before Halloween this year. Since that point,&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>has sold a million copies on consoles.</p>

<p>According to Kinetic, that figure brings&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia</em>'s total sales up to almost 22 million, which is a very impressive milestone indeed. That figure puts&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>ahead of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hazelight-josef-fares-new-ip-it-takes-two-sales" rel="nofollow">co-op platformer&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hazelight-josef-fares-new-ip-it-takes-two-sales" rel="nofollow">It Takes Two</a>&nbsp;</em>and remaster collection&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crash-bandicoot-n-sane-trilogy-sales" rel="nofollow"><em>Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy</em></a>&nbsp;at last count.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/phasmophobia-console-sales-camera.jpg?itok=NTlbRGC1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/phasmophobia-console-sales-camera.jpg?itok=QHjnA1_K 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Phasmophobia</em>'s console release has sold very well indeed for Kinetic Games.</figcaption></figure><p>Kinetic CEO and&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>lead developer Daniel Knight describes the sales milestone as "the best Christmas present we could have wished for", thanking the game's "wonderful, supportive, and engaged community".</p>

<p><em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>was originally released on PC via Steam Early Access back in September 2020. It's received a number of updates since then, with major patches bringing things like a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-ascension-update-release-date" rel="nofollow">progression overhaul</a>, new <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-update-0810-adds-insanity-difficulty-and-more" rel="nofollow">difficulty levels</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-update-adds-3-new-ghosts-truck-improvements" rel="nofollow">more ghosts to contend with</a>, among other things.</p>

<p>Technically speaking, the game remains in Early Access; Kinetic still says it's planning a full release in late 2024, but since we're in the early days of December, this is looking more and more unlikely.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia</em>, it's a multiplayer ghost-hunting horror game in which you must team up with your friends to find and document supernatural phenomena in a range of haunted locations.</p>

<p>You'll have access to a range of ghost-hunting equipment to help you do so, and each ghost behaves in a different way, so you'll need to have your wits about you in order to discover which ghost you've encountered and how to best deal with it.</p>

<p><em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/739630/Phasmophobia/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10005673" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/phasmophobia-game-preview/9N6D60SBZN05" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>
