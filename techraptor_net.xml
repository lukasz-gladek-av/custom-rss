            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hachette Boardgames USA has announced its <em>Tag Team</em> board game. This nostalgic board game, which will be featured at this year's Gen Con, is all about capturing the atmosphere and thrill of an old-school arcade brawler.</p>

<h2>The Tag Team Board Game Announcement</h2>

<p>According to a report <a href="https://icv2.com/articles/news/view/59938/hachette-boardgames-announces-tag-team" rel="nofollow">from ICV2</a>, the <em>Tag Team</em> board game is designed by Gricha German and Corentin Labrat. German's design credits include <em>Biomos</em>, the cozy puzzle game about biodiversity, and the bus route party game, <em>City Tour</em>. Labrat's body of work includes <em>Arkeis</em>, a story-driven narrative game set in a steampunk take on Ancient Egypt.</p>

Each deck starts with two cards, but as the game progresses, players will build the deck. These cards synergize with each fighter's special attacks and techniques for powerful combo attacks.</p>

<p>The <em>Tag Team</em> board game is an autobattler. Players select cards and flip them face-up one at a time, applying the card's effect. At the end of each round, you can reprogram your deck by strategically adding new cards without changing the order. If you can outthink your opponent by playing around, or perhaps doubling down, on your prior strategy, you can win.</p>

<p>Hachette Boardgames USA has a solid catalog of titles under its umbrella. Its work includes the Ancient Greek tile placement game, <em>Akropolis</em>, the party deduction game, <em>Decrypto</em>, and some acclaimed licensed work, including an official <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dead-cells" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dead Cells</em></a> board game, based on the indie game by Motion Twin, and an adaptation of <em>Gwent</em> from <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/witcher" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>The Witcher</em></a>.</p>

<p>If you are attending this year's Gen Con, you can pick up a copy of the <em>Tag Team</em> board game at Hachette Boardgames USA's booth. Otherwise, the game is available for pre-order. The game is being sold at an MSRP of $24.99 and is set for a retail release this September.</p>
