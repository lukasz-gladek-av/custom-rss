            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/en-publishings-level-up-pets-sidekicks-ttrpg-supplements-brings-enhanced-companions<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EN Publishing has announced a new <em>Level-Up</em> supplement for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>. The new supplement, <em>Level-Up Pets &amp; Sidekicks</em>, brings more complex rules and mechanics to both animal companions and support NPCs. It is coming to Kickstarter later this summer.</p>

<h2>The <em>Level-Up Pets &amp; Sidekicks</em> Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, <em>Level-Up Pets &amp; Sidekicks</em> expands on the heroic companion rules first introduced in Level-Up Monstrous Menagerie II. The supplement will contain new rules for companions alongside new player options. The supplement's contents are compatible with <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Fifth Edition, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-releasing-updated-dungeons-dragons-2024-srd-at-end-of-month" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024</em></a>, and EN's own <em>Level-Up Advanced Fifth Edition</em> system.</p>

Has your adventuring party adopted a creature for a pet and been underwhelmed by what it can do? This book includes ways they can track, herd, or guard the party. Additionally, the pet can earn heroic features as it levels up. This can be a tougher hide to help them in fights, or some spellcasting abilities.</p>

<p>As for companion NPCs, <em>Level-Up Pets &amp; Sidekicks</em> will include new rules for recruiting them. Alternatively, the book includes rules for recurring monsters and villain NPCs. Threats that grow powerful in parallel to your party whenever they pop up. Essentially, it's a villainous take on the rival party idea from the <em>D&amp;D</em> module, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/critical-role-call-of-netherdeep-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Critical Role: Call of the Netherdeep</em></a>.</p>

<p>Lastly, the player options continue the focus of pets. This includes new player backgrounds, such as Beast Friend, and feats like Bonded Companion and Ringleader. There are new companion-themed equipment like the collar of disguise or the saddle of recall. There are even new rules for evolving wildshapes, giving Druids even more options as they continue their career.</p>

<p>The Kickstarter campaign for <em>Level-Up Pets &amp; Sidekicks</em> will go live this July. Physical copies of the book are expected to ship next January.</p>
