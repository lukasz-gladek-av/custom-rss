Darrington Press' highly anticipated fantasy TTRPG, set to release sometime this year, will have the support of one of the industry's largest VTT platforms and professional GM services.</p>

<h2>The <em>Daggerheart</em> Launch Event Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, Roll20 and StartPlaying have put together an extensive <em>Daggerheart</em> launch event. StartPlaying has provided over 150 officially vetted Game Masters with advance copies of the <em>Daggerheart</em> Core Rulebook via the Demiplane Nexus. This means once the TTRPG launches, those wanting to experience it as intended can do so through StartPlaying.</p>

The entire launch month of Daggheart will be packed with exclusive online game sessions hosted by StartPlaying. Registration for these gaming tables are limited, so if you are a fan of Critical Role or have been enjoying the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/daggerheart-13-playtest-available-now" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">past playtests</a> of the game, it is best to register now while you can.</p>

<p>The press confirmed that the Daggerheart Demiplane Nexus will offer everything needed to play the game. This will include a digital reader, compendium, character builder, and GM tools. Furthermore, courtesy of the new <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/official-roll20-demiplane-integration-feature-is-now-in-beta" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">platform integration</a> feature, these tools will be completely compatible with Roll20.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“This is an incredible opportunity for fans who have been eagerly awaiting Daggerheart’s release," said Jayme Boucher, Senior Marketing Manager at Roll20, the parent company of Demiplane. "Being able to learn and enjoy a brand-new TTRPG on launch day with professional GMs is not a typical day one experience, but it’s one that Roll20, StartPlaying, and Darrington Press are delighted to offer the community.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Daggerheart is Darrington Press' latest TTRPG. The publishing arm of Critical Role has produced several high-quality TTRPG books and products. These include official supplements for the fantasy setting of Exandria like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/taldorei-campaign-setting-reborn-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Tal'Dorei Reborn</em></a> and its gaslamp fantasy TTRPG, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/candela-obscura-core-rulebook-review-comprehensive-guide-to-newfaire-and-horror" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Candela Obscura</em></a>.</p>

<p>TechRaptor was given an exclusive sneak peek at four of the Environments that will be available in the full rulebook when it releases physically and digitally at the end of the month. We also had a chance to talk about Environments (among other things that will be saved for a later date) with Lead Designers <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3b50b662-11ad-4fba-8903-ff76c59dea55" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/spenser-starke-is-bringing-cinematic-gming-to-candela-obscura-chapter-2" rel="nofollow">Spenser Starke</a> and Rowan Hall.</p>

<h2>Environments Help A GM Consider The World</h2>

<p>Environments are locations that a GM can put in play that will not only affect the story by posing potential challenges for the players to overcome, but also offer unique mechanical obstacles to engage in.</p>

<p>The four Environments that TechRaptor can exclusively reveal are the Cliffside Ascent, Local Tavern, Outpost Town, and Raging River. Each is a Tier 1 event, which means it's intended for a party of level 2-4. Set for a lower level of play we're able to see how each of these are able to impact the party, and how these can be scaled up.</p>

<p>Each Environment is comprises of the following features:</p>

<ul><li aria-level="1"><strong>Name:</strong> The name of the Environment</li>
	<li aria-level="1"><strong>Tier and Style of Environment: </strong>Here we see both Traversal and Social giving you fast information for where you might want to include it</li>
	<li aria-level="1"><strong>Impulses: </strong>Describing the way that you could provoke your players with the Environment to help them more readily engage</li>
	<li aria-level="1"><strong>Difficulty: </strong>This indicates the average difficulty check that the area would have, the GM can then further scale this up or down based on the relative safety or danger of the character's actions</li>
	<li aria-level="1"><strong>Potential Adversaries:</strong> A list of creatures or monsters that a party might find while exploring that area</li>
	<li aria-level="1"><strong>Features: </strong>Key gameplay elements tied to the Environment, these can be related to social interactions, rules for how to overcome an obstacle, but also can be related to ways things like combat may change</li>
</ul><blockquote>
<p>"We like Environments because they allow you to create a stat block, but for a place" - Spenser Starke</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Getting to talk with Starke and Hall they explained they wanted to create a way that you could have stats about a location, that were available for you next to Adversaries. In <em>Daggerheart</em>, as play moves back to the GM it's important that you're able to understand all of the moves you can make.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/daggerheart-environments-exclusive-page-spread.jpg?itok=3oE4lfMJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/daggerheart-environments-exclusive-page-spread.jpg?itok=kf9-RpNj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>How Environments Enhance <em>Daggerheart </em>Combat</h2>

<p>Hall gave an example of how an Environment could be used "say you're taking your players to a graveyard, you know there's a big bad evil Necromancer raising a bunch of zombies, you've got maybe a horde statted up, but you also want to have hands reach up from graves and grab your players and restrain them. It could be a lot of work to stat up a bunch of zombies, but if you have an Environment you can make an Environment Action where on a certain trigger hands restrain your players"</p>

<p>In <em>Daggerheart</em>, the combat isn't linear in that every character and adversary has a turn in order before it all resets. There's a player's turn and a GM's turn. For the players, this promotes playing collaboratively to strike together, for the GM, that means when it's your turn, any of the Adversaries at your command can go at any time. So many abilities at any point in time can be difficult to track, letting an Environment clearly be part of your list of actions is simply helping the GM have less to manage.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Being able to pair down and streamline [combat], we're always looking for ways to give GMs all of the support that they need and also open enough doors that they might expand with their own narrative, their own choices, and have flexibility" - Rowan Hall</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Starke did highlight that Environments shouldn't be used everywhere "but if there's a place where you're like 'I can see how this environment itself really impacts the narrative, let me write down what this place is really about."</p>

<h2>An Environment Doesn't Have To Be A Place</h2>

<p>While the four that TechRaptor has been able to reveal were specifically places, Starke expanded that there were also Environments that it may not be "a particular place, it isn't like, an outpost but it is an Ambush. That can be placed anywhere, but it can give you the framing of what mechanically an Ambush might look like in <em>Daggerheart </em>for a scene you're interested in running."</p>

<p>When I asked what kinds of GM tools would be available for crafting their own Environments Hall paused for a moment before saying "One of my favorite parts of the book is a section where we go through how we build different adversary types and why we make the choices we do."</p>

<p>Describing it as 'popping open the hood' Hall continued to explain "We hope it's a conversation with the designers, the goal there was to make it as approachable as possible with as many examples as possible to people can refer to it almost like a recipe book. We have all different ways that people can approach that."</p>

<p>It's these kinds of behind the scenes looks and conversational understandings about why things are designed the way that they are that Starke and Hall are hoping it will make GMs crafting their own Environments possible.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2340520/view/535474378243048018" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Steam,&nbsp;<em>Tales of Seikyu&nbsp;</em>will be arriving on PC via Steam Early Access on May 21st, and yes, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-vi-release-date-delay" rel="nofollow">unlike&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em></a>, that's May 21st this year, not next.</p>

<p>In&nbsp;<em>Tales of Seikyu</em>, you'll be building your dream farmhouse, all while shapeshifting into various yokai forms in order to make exploration and day-to-day life easier. Think&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/spirittea" rel="nofollow"><em>Spirittea</em></a>, but where you get to transform into the creatures, and you're not a million miles away.</p>

Together with your sister Kon, you'll build a life among these mythical beings.</p>

<p>Forms you can shapeshift into over the course of&nbsp;<em>Tales of Seikyu&nbsp;</em>include the Crow Tengu, which grants you flight, as well as the water-dwelling Slime and the farmland-tending Boar.</p>

<p>As you'd expect from a life sim like this, you can grow and tend to crops, raise livestock, and build your homestead, kitting it out with custom-crafted furniture to add that all-important personal touch. Of course, you can also cook meals from the ingredients you grow and source from the local area.</p>

<p>Naturally,&nbsp;<em>Tales of Seikyu&nbsp;</em>also features a romance system, with "a variety of romanceable partners" available, each of whom has "their own unique personalities and heartwarming stories". The game's "extraordinary" villagers will have a range of quests for you to complete as well.</p>




<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Tales of Seikyu&nbsp;</em>when it launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2340520/Tales_of_Seikyu/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on May 21st.
