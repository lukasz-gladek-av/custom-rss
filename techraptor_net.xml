            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Ghost of Yotei</em> has one of the strongest openings of any recent AAA game I've played this year. It starts in medias res with protagonist Atsu already on her quest for vengeance; the game's tutorial pulls double duty as the first major boss fight. For me, this was a mission statement by developer Sucker Punch.</p>

<p>This straightforward intro would be the benchmark for the game. That this sequel to <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Ghost of Tsushima</em></a> would be richer and more ambitious, committed to pushing things further.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it is the first game in Sony's long line of prestige in-house style (including titles like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/god-of-war-ragnarok-review-colossal-triumph-for-playstation" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>God of War: Ragnarok</em></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/until-dawn-2024-review-new-faces-old-blood" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Until Dawn 2024</em></a>) that left me disappointed. For all of the expertly crafted atmosphere, gameplay polish, and good character performances, there were gaffs in pacing, writing, and level design that kept me from fully embracing this samurai adventure.</p>

(Captured in Performance Mode)</em></figcaption></figure><h2>The Good, The Bad, and The&nbsp;Onryō</h2>

<p><em>Ghost of Yotei</em> is set in Ezo, Japan, in the early 1600s. Atsu is on a personal mission to find and slay the Yotei Six, a group of cutthroat warlords that have been subjugating the people. It's a regime that has led to wandering bands of ronin, displaced Ainu locals, and a slow response by the shogunate.</p>

<p>Generally, the story of <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> is a fairly predictable tale of revenge. In some ways, the plot echoes elements of old Hollywood Westerns. The integration of acoustic strings in the soundtrack. Overt narrative elements, like a lawless stretch of land full of opportunistic bounty hunters. An encroaching authority in an “untamed” frontier. A protagonist tracking down someone who murdered their family.</p>

<p>It's a narrative that Sucker Punch presents with style. The art direction paints absolutely breathtaking landscapes bursting with color. Lighting, blocking, and shot compositions in cutscenes are immaculate. The main cast completely commits to their material, with Erika Ishii turning in a captivating performance as Atsu.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-review-ainu-camp.jpg?itok=4nIJIvEl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-review-ainu-camp.jpg?itok=g64fuRMS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Need a break from the carnage? I understand. (Captured in Performance Mode)</em></figcaption></figure><p>Sadly, while the narrative nails visual design and delivers solid performances, the writing and pacing drag <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> down. Part of it comes down to awkward shifts in tone and a lack of commitment to greater themes.</p>

<p>The Yotei Six are framed as both irredeemable monstrous sociopaths and sympathetic, misunderstood lackeys. The rich potential for discussion regarding the real history of the Tokugawa Shogunate and the Ainu people of Ezo is barely explored. Atsu herself is a less compelling protagonist than Jin due to her one-note motivation of vengeance.</p>

<p>Lastly, there are narrative and story beats that attempt different perspectives on an event in the vein of <em>Rashomon</em>, but come off as awkward and haphazard in delivery.</p>

<p>The overall result is a narrative that barely sticks in my mind. I've seen these beats before. I've experienced this story before. I've seen better versions of this story told. As impressive as the visuals and performances are, they don't fully hide how paint-by-numbers the whole thing feels to experience.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-review-kitsune.jpg?itok=2tB-ck97 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-review-kitsune.jpg?itok=pFhY8dMI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Oh you'll see how strong I am. Several times in fact. (Captured in Performance Mode)</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Rails of Revenge</h2>

<p>As mentioned before, <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> starts with Atsu already on her mission. This was a refreshing change of pace, given the trend of high-profile games opening with a lot of preamble. This is because the unique selling point of the game was that you could tackle any member of the Yotei Six in any order you wish. It is a tantalizing approach to a game like this.</p>

<p>But this choice is pure illusion. Out of five opening story missions, three of them are complete story cul-de-sacs, making your ultimate decision of plot progression a matter of A or B. From there, the game falls into the same familiar open-world action game structure.</p>

<p>This wouldn't be a bad thing if the showdowns with the Yotei Six were satisfying, but they all feel interchangeable and padded. Outside of certain aesthetic and gameplay elements: the Kitsune using stealth, the Oni using fire, etc., every confrontation with the Yotei Six plays out the same. Atsu infiltrates a new region, fights the leader, the fight is interrupted, the leader escapes, Atsu regroups, tries again, and wins.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-onryo-rage-mode.jpg?itok=qLEm8DOK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-onryo-rage-mode.jpg?itok=m85B1f9q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Alright, where did they run to this time? (Captured in Performance Mode)</em></figcaption></figure><p>The first time it happened, I nodded along. These were the familiar beats of an action blockbuster. The second time around, I rolled my eyes in resignation. Then it happened a third time. And a fourth time. With increasingly convoluted plot contrivances.</p>

<p>The most blatant of which was where a major character, one that Atsu was right on the heels of in a chase sequence, essentially teleported onto a boat in the span of a quick fade to black.</p>

<p>If parts had been cut, these story missions would have flowed better. A massive combat setpiece removed. A boss fight repositioned. As it stands, <em>Ghost of Yotei's</em> central narrative starts with a bang, plateaus fast, then overstays its welcome.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-review-stealth-infiltration-gameplay.jpg?itok=rAYQlzUW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-review-stealth-infiltration-gameplay.jpg?itok=0Ay7kcVA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Alright, do I take him out or do I go for the gunpowder reserves first? (Captured in Performance Mode)</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Have Sword, Will Travel</h2>

<p>While Sucker Punch's story rang hollow, this studio remains undisputed with its core gameplay and open world design.</p>

<p>Much like its predecessor, <em>Ghost of Yotei's</em> Ezo region is packed with side stories and activities, all presented to you in a measured, deliberate fashion. Birds fly into view as you ride your horse, guiding you to a place of interest. Blowing wind gently draws your eye to your next destination. Fast-travel points are placed in key locations, reducing backtracking. All of these stylistic flourishes return for good reason.</p>

<p>My experience was at its best when I rode across Ezo, bathing in hot springs, completing bamboo strike challenges, taking apart enemy camps, and stumbling into strong, standalone side stories. For all of the criticisms I have with Atsu's personal journey, I have nothing but good things to say about everything around it. Even the most innocuous mission, like bounty hunting, had its moments.</p>

(Captured in Performance Mode)</em></figcaption></figure><p>It also helps that the core combat of <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> is still sharp and satisfying. Stealth returns unchanged from Ghost of Tsushima. You can still sneak into enemy camps and tactically take down enemies from the shadows with smoke bombs, kunai, and a quick knife in the back.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Swordplay is relatively untouched, emphasizing blocks, parries, and dodges against enemy attacks. Instead of sword stances, you swap between different melee weapons like a spear, dual swords, an odachi, and a kusari-gama.</p>

<p>Each of these weapons has a rock-paper-scissors function against certain enemy types. Odachis cut through brutes. Spears get through the kusari-gama. Kusari-gama can break enemy shields. Dual swords can break through spears. Your ranged options have also expanded from kunai and a bow to a pistol and musket.</p>

<p>The only major addition to this gameplay sandbox is a new wolf companion. It can show up in certain circumstances, like when Atsu is about to die or after you've stealth killed an enemy. It's a novel addition, but it doesn't really push the needle.</p>

<p><em>Ghost of Yotei</em> is a game full of brilliant visual design, strong character performances, and polished gameplay in service to an uninspired, padded tale of revenge. If you could not get enough of <em>Ghost of Tsushima's</em> stellar open-world design, this sequel will provide more. But if you expected this follow-up to innovate more than iterate, you will be disappointed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Ghost of Yotei</em> is one of the most fun and engaging open-world games I've played in the last decade. Building on its predecessor, <em>Ghost of Yotei </em>offers so much to do that it can feel overwhelming and even tedious to check off everything on your map.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This has been a criticism of many open-world games – how can you keep a tight narrative when the player is able to abscond to any part of the map they please at any time? My solution for dealing with <em>Ghost of Yotei</em>'s map: simply don't use it.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Ghost of Yotei</em>'s<em>&nbsp;</em>Map: Knowing When to Put It Away&nbsp;</h2>

<p>The map in&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yotei</em> is an excellent tool when trying to strategize which direction to head in. Once that direction is set, however, I found the most joy came to my play sessions when I just allowed myself to wander, riding my horse across the plains and forests and making discoveries that were genuinely surprising.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The world is filled with points of interest and collectables, from bounties to collect to armor sets to adorn yourself with. Completionists will run down these items like a checklist, but playing by just exploring the world will make completing these items feel so much more satisfying.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When I stopped treating <em>Ghost of Yotei </em>like a checklist and instead started playing it like a journey to discover, I found much more joy in those little moments. Fighting off a bear to save a traveler's horse, coming across a newlywed couple trying to set up a camp, discovering rumors of new armor set locations, and ascending mountains to discover shrines suddenly became memorable moments in an otherwise massive game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Taking inspiration from Japanese cinema,&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yotei</em>&nbsp;encourages the player to be in the moment as much as possible. From the tight aspect ratio that draws you into the action as you ride your horse across the colorful landscape to the different modes that give you direct control over the artistic experience, to even the standard UI that leaves no barrier between you and the world you're exploring,&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yotei</em>&nbsp;works tirelessly to keep you engaged through every mesmerizing second.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's these small touches that encouraged me to go off the beaten path and attempt as much of the adventure as I could without relying on the map telling me where to go. Once I unplugged from the navigation, I was able to fully relax into the experience and appreciate the surprises that came along the way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Playing <em>Ghost of Yotei </em>this way allowed me to explore Ezo in a more authentic way and kept the surprises a secret until I was right on top of them. It reminded me of playing <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-wild" rel="nofollow"><em>Breath of the Wild</em></a> where I'd eyeball a mountaintop or shrine from a fair distance and head off for it, getting distracted and sidetracked along the way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Playing <em>Ghost of Yotei </em>without a map required some rethinking in how I approach video games, and I'm better for it. There's no rush or stress, simply enjoying the beautiful scenery and accepting the challenges of the world as they come my way. This may not be the most efficient way to play a video game, but I'm OK with that.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Ghost of Yotei</em>: Embrace Inefficiency and Joy&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Leaning into inefficiency can be a challenge. Maybe it's because I'm so busy in my personal life or that my day job is so focused on scalability, but I'm always looking for the most efficient ways to accomplish my goals. I multitask constantly, often losing more focus than if I just took on tasks one at a time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This affects how I play video games, feeling an urge to check off every point of interest I pass along the way to my destination. This is the most efficient way to play, why would I want to backtrack and risk missing key upgrades?&nbsp;</p>

<p>When approaching playing <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> without a map, I had to let go of these anxieties and accept that it's OK that I don't do everything all at once. I spent $80 on the <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> deluxe edition, so getting more time out of this experience will only make that investment more worthwhile.&nbsp;</p>

<p>By accepting the inefficiency of organic exploration, I was able to settle in for my gaming sessions and just take my time enjoying the beautiful scenery and vast vistas of <em>Ghost of Yotei</em>. It allowed me to ignore the main story in favor of getting to know every inch of this gorgeous world, and when I did stumble onto story missions or new weapons, it was a pleasant surprise.</p>



<p>At one point, I came across a key ally and pulled on that story string until it snowballed into an incredible cinematic climax, bringing me from collecting flowers and fish in the open world to infiltrating a heavily fortified fortress. Games keep their secrets only as well as you don't go looking up the solution to every question. Exploring Ezo with only general direction brings this experience alive in a way that has me thinking about where to go next even when I'm not playing. It's addicting.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Ghost of Yotei </em>Is At Its Best When You Put the Map Away&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Playing <em>Ghost of Yotei </em>with minimal map interaction is motivating me to go back and revisit <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima" rel="nofollow"><em>Ghost of Tsushima</em></a>. When I played the predecessor in 2020, I relied heavily on the map, checking off every collectible as I went. I love that game, and playing it more organically would feel like an entirely new experience. By treating <i>Ghost of Yotei&nbsp;</i>more like a film that demands your attention instead of something that can be paused, it has allowed me to better enjoy the big and small moments that are spread so well across this world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As I continue to explore Ezo and its many varied lands, I'll check in with the map when needed, but primarily I'll be identifying points of interest with my spy glass and heading in that direction, discovering what adventures await along the way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you're in the midst of playing<em> Ghost of Yotei </em>or considering picking it up, try for an hour or two where you put the map away and just interact with the world. You might find that this method of playing makes the experience even more enjoyable. And if not? Your map is just a touchpad tap away.&nbsp;</p>
