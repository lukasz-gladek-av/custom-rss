            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Riot Games has announced that its&nbsp;<em>League of Legends</em>-themed fighting game&nbsp;<em>2XKO&nbsp;</em>is getting a closed beta later this year, and a new champion has been announced for the roster as well.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://2xko.riotgames.com/en-gb/news/game-updates/2xko-closedbeta-announcement/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on the game's official website, <i>2XKO</i>'s closed beta begins on September 9th, and Riot says that once the beta is online, its "goal is to keep the game online, outside of any necessary maintenance". That means there won't be any downtime; once you're in, you're in.</p>

<p>However, this does also mean that&nbsp;<em>2XKO</em>'s closed beta will only be available for PC, so if you're hoping to check the game out on consoles, you'll have to wait a while, unfortunately.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/2xko-closed-beta-vi-illaoi.jpg?itok=Ny8DU7MY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/2xko-closed-beta-vi-illaoi.jpg?itok=Ijwjn5Pd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>2XKO&nbsp;</em>is getting a closed beta later this year.</figcaption></figure><p>The silver lining here, however, is that&nbsp;<em>2XKO&nbsp;</em>will support cross-progression, so if you get started in the closed beta on PC, you'll still be able to transfer whatever progress you make to your preferred version when it launches.</p>

<p>To get a chance to check out the closed beta, you can <a href="https://2xko.riotgames.com/en-gb/beta/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sign up here</a>. If you participated in either of&nbsp;<em>2XKO</em>'s Alpha Lab tests, then you're already signed up for the closed beta and you can just wait for your confirmation email.</p>

<p>As well as announcing the closed beta, Riot also revealed a new champion for the game's roster in the form of the Piltover enforcer Vi. Given that she fights with a massive pair of gauntlets, she's pretty much a no-brainer for&nbsp;<em>2XKO</em>.</p>

<p>Vi's trailer reveals her to be a powerful and fearsome combatant, and her design looks like it's somewhere in between the original&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>look and the newer&nbsp;<em>Arcane&nbsp;</em>aesthetic. You can check out her trailer here.</p>




<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>2XKO&nbsp;</em>is, it's a&nbsp;<em>League of Legends</em>&nbsp;fighting game that features champions from the MOBA's roster duking it out in two-on-two combat.</p>

<p>Originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-project-l-gameplay-details-revealed-by-riot" rel="nofollow">designated&nbsp;<em>Project L</em></a>, the game was subsequently renamed to&nbsp;<em>2XKO&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/league-of-legends-fighting-game-officially-named-2xko-as-spectacular-new-gameplay-is" rel="nofollow">in February last year</a>. It doesn't have a release date yet, but its PC closed beta begins on September 9th, and it's also set to land on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S when it launches in full.</p>
