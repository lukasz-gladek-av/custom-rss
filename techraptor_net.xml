            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Workers at&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>studio ZA/UM have unionized in the form of the newly-created Workers' Alliance, becoming the first officially-recognized UK gaming union into the bargain.</p>

<p>As reported by the folks at <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/after-layoffs-cancellations-and-controversy-zaum-uk-staff-unionise-as-the-workers-alliance" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, the ZA/UM Workers' Alliance will legally represent only a portion of the studio's overall workforce, since it only applies to the UK arm of a company that also has offices in Portugal and Finland.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, marketing manager Poppy Ingham says the union was set up in order to give employees "a seat at the table in the big management meetings". She says ZA/UM workers "like being here" and "want to continue being here", and she wants the studio to be "a collaborative project between the workers and management".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disco-elysium-zaum-uk-union-cuno.jpg?itok=mXP00FAu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disco-elysium-zaum-uk-union-cuno.jpg?itok=pYHZ5Aoj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>ZA/UM's only game so far is anarchic RPG&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Although the new union only represents UK employees at the moment, Ingham says meetings are "completely open" to employees from other ZA/UM branches, and that those employees can "feed in" on the Workers' Alliance's activities.</p>

<p>According to Ingham, ZA/UM management has agreed to negotiate and consult with Workers' Alliance on issues that "ensure the general safety and care of employees", including pay rates, holiday time, and working hours.</p>

<p>The formation of the union at ZA/UM follows the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/disco-elysium-developer-zaum-confirms-game-cancellation-and-layoffs" rel="nofollow">cancellation of a project at the studio</a> back in early 2024, which was itself accompanied by a round of layoffs. Ingham says it's these layoffs, "unfortunate" though they were, that "spurred [the remaining workers] on" to create Workers' Alliance.</p>

<p>ZA/UM has been racked with controversy since key figures Robert Kurvitz and Aleksander Rostov <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ousted-disco-elysium-devs-claim-fraud-studio-says-they-were-fired-over-misconduct/1100-6509090/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">departed the studio</a> in 2022, with both claiming their departures were a result of being forced out by unscrupulous investors.</p>




<p>Since then, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/longdue-hopetown-kickstarter-disco-elysium" rel="nofollow">number</a> of key&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-disco-elysium-devs-new-studios-spiritual-successors" rel="nofollow">personnel</a> have announced their own spiritual successors to the critically-acclaimed RPG.</p>

<p>Additionally, ZA/UM itself has also unveiled&nbsp;<em>Zero Parades - For Dead Spies&nbsp;</em>(which was probably <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zaum-project-c4-disco-elysium" rel="nofollow">formerly known as <em>Project C4</em></a>), a game that looks very much to be in the same realm as&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Payday&nbsp;</em>developer Starbreeze has canceled&nbsp;<em>Project Baxter</em>, its in-development live-service&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;</em>game, and a number of employees are being laid off across the studio as well.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://corporate.starbreeze.com/en/press/press-releases/starbreeze-sharpens-focus-on-payday-franchise-baxter-discontinued-as-part-of-strategic-shift/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a>,&nbsp;<em>Project Baxter</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-dnd-game-2026" rel="nofollow">first announced back in December 2023</a>, has been shut down so that the studio can deploy its resources to "accelerate the growth" of its "flagship&nbsp;<em>Payday&nbsp;</em>franchise".</p>

<p>The cancellation will cost Starbreeze around SEK 255 million (roughly $27.2 million) in "non-cash impairment" form, and it'll also result in the laying off of around 44 employees. Both decisions will, according to Starbreeze, allow the studio to become "cash-flow positive" next year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/starbreeze-payday-focus-layoffs-project-baxter.jpg?itok=_fFjrSfj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/starbreeze-payday-focus-layoffs-project-baxter.jpg?itok=1g5K_QqN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Starbreeze's live-service&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>&nbsp;game&nbsp;<em>Project Baxter</em>&nbsp;is no more.</figcaption></figure><p>It's all part of a <a href="https://corporate.starbreeze.com/en/press/press-releases/starbreeze-presents-updated-strategy-doubles-down-on-payday-and-expanding-the-heisting-genre/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">corporate refocusing</a> on Starbreeze's part, with the studio looking to leverage its&nbsp;<em>Payday&nbsp;</em>franchise and "the heisting genre" as a whole much more in the future.</p>

<p>According to Starbreeze, the new strategy will revolve around "deepening player engagement, broadening platform reach, and diversifying revenue streams", and it'll include expanding&nbsp;<em>Payday&nbsp;</em>"across platforms and experiences".</p>

<p>As part of this new strategy, Starbreeze says it will create "new games and experiences that broaden the heisting genre" beyond the studio's "core projects". These will include "spin-offs, narrative-driven projects, and franchise expansion to new platforms".</p>

<p>Another pillar of the developer's new strategy is work-for-hire operations, through which Starbreeze will complete work on projects for other publishers and studios. That work could well cross over with&nbsp;<em>Payday&nbsp;</em>in future, as well, such as in the case of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/payday-pubg-crossover-starbreeze-krafton" rel="nofollow">upcoming&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>crossover</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/payday-3-starbreeze-layoffs-baxter-canceled.jpg?itok=GDPBlpeA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/payday-3-starbreeze-layoffs-baxter-canceled.jpg?itok=wEtxbbRp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Starbreeze wants to refocus its business around&nbsp;<em>Payday</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>News of Starbreeze's strategy shift comes just days after the company was widely pilloried for the introduction of a&nbsp;<em>Payday 2&nbsp;</em>DLC subscription, which itself was introduced following a price hike for a one-off purchase of all currently-available DLC for the game.</p>

<p>Starbreeze, however, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-we-dropped-the-ball-starbreeze-admits-it-botched-payday-2-subscription-rollout" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">says</a> that the price increase was unrelated to the introduction of the subscription model, although commercial exec Gustav Nisser admitted the studio "dropped the ball" with regards to the subscription's rollout.</p>

<p>The shift to a focus on<i>&nbsp;Payday&nbsp;</i>also follows a pretty dismal couple of years for&nbsp;<em>Payday 3</em>, the latest game in the series, with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-financials-2024-payday-3" rel="nofollow">plummeting sales</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/payday-3-game-director-steps-down" rel="nofollow">departing executives</a>&nbsp;not exactly contributing to an optimistic overall outlook for the game.</p>
