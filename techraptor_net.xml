            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The <em>Dragon Quest</em> series is on a bit of a roll lately, clearly laying the ground for the eventual release of <em>Dragon Quest XII</em> - whenever that decides to come out of hiding again. But before all that, Square Enix has been hard at work offering up remakes to several of the older games in the series.</p><p>First, we had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-review-all-that-glitters-are-pixels" rel="nofollow"><em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D</em></a>, followed by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/dragon-quest-1-2-hd-2d-remake-preview-pax-east-2025" rel="nofollow"><em>Dragon Quest I and II</em></a> released last year. Now things are skipping ahead a bit, with <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em> heading the lineup.</p><p>Unlike its contemporaries, <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em> is exactly that. It’s shed the more 2D look of the original PlayStation version and opted for a 3D diorama art direction. What this means is everything exists in a 3D environment - including the player characters.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined_20260110230511.jpg?itok=y0p_cx6Q 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined_20260110230511.jpg?itok=50n2tPS7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p>This isn’t even the first time <em>Dragon Quest VII</em> was redone in 3D. A 3DS remake had its own visual style, but <em>Reimagined</em> goes beyond that. With such a departure from both that and the original, I suppose the question at large is: does it work? And does it vibe with the other recent remakes?</p><p>At first glance, it’s easy to be wary - after all, Square Enix spent a lot of time getting people used to the HD 2D style. That doesn’t mean their 3D efforts have gone astray, however.</p><p>Digging into <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em> is like visiting an old friend I never got the chance to actually meet. That is to say, as someone who didn’t play the original, all of this was going to be delightfully fresh and without the burden of nostalgia goggles.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined_20260111233757.jpg?itok=-WVjVWDD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined_20260111233757.jpg?itok=QL_Yl391 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p>That said, it’s clear right away that <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em> is a love letter to the style of RPGs we got out of the PlayStation era.</p><p><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em> follows the series’ traditional silent protagonist as he makes his way as a young boy in the fishing town of Pilchard Bay, located on the world’s one and only island. After a short introduction to his family and his father’s discovery of a mysterious looking stone fragment, he meets up with his childhood friend Kiefer, who decides to do a little exploring.</p><p>The pair comes across a mysterious shrine and is convinced there’s something else out there. The fragments they’ve obtained seem to feature some sort of map, and soon enough, they’re able to gather enough that leads them to a new island in an unfamiliar world.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined_20260112165931.jpg?itok=mFx8OaKw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined_20260112165931.jpg?itok=DcyVTvS4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p>As it turns out, things aren’t what they seem, and it’s clear there’s a higher power at play here. These fragments of the past, as it is soon discovered, paint the picture of lands that were obscured for many years. The party at hand helps the people in need, vanquishes the foe behind it all, and then returns to the present, where it turns out that same island has just appeared in their own time.</p><p>This is just one of many cases, and the protagonist, along with Kiefer and their friend Maribel, will have to continue to collect fragments to uncover even more lost islands. Of course, they eventually discover even bigger forces at play as the party bulks up, but the meat of the story takes place in each of these island vignettes.</p><p>That is to say, while yes, there is an overarching plot, I found the individual quests held most of the emotional weight and narrative meat of the story. Tales of a whole village turned to stone, and tales of an island doomed to the flood, are just some examples out of many that fly in the face of a larger, looming darkness.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined_20260112183353.jpg?itok=vDjWaGOa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined_20260112183353.jpg?itok=4NekfaoR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p>Even though the time spent on each island isn’t particularly long, the characters in each of these stories have plenty of heart. <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em>’s core party is fairly stock standard, but that isn’t a bad thing when they become a vehicle to witness these other stories.</p><p>The biggest draw for me with the cast was how different they all were from each other. There’s the young protagonist, but Kiefer is an adventurous prince, Maribel is the fierce childhood friend, Ruff is a feral young boy with a wolf companion, and later on, characters like Aishe and Mervyn round out those with different worldly experiences.</p><p>This becomes especially apparent when taking them into battle. <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em> operates on a traditional turn-based system. That is to say that each party member and enemy takes turns making their move.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined_20260111223250.jpg?itok=SrZTZVyH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined_20260111223250.jpg?itok=YxAip_5d 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p>It’s all very much the classic turn-based battles with some additional twists. Firstly, battles can be initiated by approaching visible enemies on the field. Then, once in battle, tactics can be set to ease the flow of each turn. Characters can also fight using the CPU with the auto battle option.</p><p>On top of this, <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em> offers a full job system - that is characters have the ability to equip not just one, but two vocations with the Moonlighting system. What this does is offer up different abilities and stats that sort of combine with each other, and jobs can be swapped out on the regular to mix up gameplay.</p><p>For example, I found equipping Maribel with both Sage and Mage vocations doubled up her magic for powerful results. The same with focusing the protagonist as both a Fisherman and a Martial Artist. Truly, the combinations are endless, and it’s worth tinkering with different builds for each character.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined_20260111220650.jpg?itok=LBONewhE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined_20260111220650.jpg?itok=ItEJ49sP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p>Each job also allows for a specific Let Loose mechanic when characters become worked up. These special attacks can hit pretty hard and can offer a boost to the party when needed, which is why the ability to swap jobs whenever possible is so special.</p><p>Outside of battle, <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em> involves a lot of collecting. There’s a lot of going around and exploring for the fragments needed for the main scenario, but also side items like medals and gear, and along the way, there are environmental puzzles and the Lucky Panel minigame that involves a visual matching game and a battle arena.</p><p>While there’s not a lot of exterior content, there’s also some additional dungeons that provide more of a challenge in the late game, and being able to go back through after the main story is finished is certainly a plus. It’s helpful too for snagging any missed fragments - after a point, I did feel like I was more set on getting to the end with the copious amount of backtracking and pacing problems throughout the same areas involved.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined_20260112000059.jpg?itok=PiLmmgyG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined_20260112000059.jpg?itok=fa49wla8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p>But despite these hangups, <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em> is delightful in its visual presentation. With the 3D dioramas and character models in play, there’s a very specific charm that hasn’t quite been done in the series yet. Combined with the classic score done up for the modern age, the presentation leaves little to desire.</p><p>All said, <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em> is a solid outing in every sense of the word. If you’ve never played the original, like me, there are hours to dig into. If you’re a returning player, the additions to the job system might be the big thing that catches your eye.</p><p>Either way, and despite some tedium, Square Enix has done a solid job bringing <em>Dragon Quest VII</em> into the modern age. I’ll be very curious to see where the series goes next.</p><hr><p><em>TechRaptor reviewed <strong>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined </strong>on PlayStation 5 with a code provided by the publisher.

<p>Roger Jr. completes the three characters we know about so far, and he'll be making his <em>Tekken 8 </em>debut in fall. No more specific release timings were announced for any of the characters, but we'll probably learn exactly when they're due as their releases near.</p><p>Finally, there's one more mystery character due to debut in <em>Tekken 8 </em>as part of this third season pass, although Bandai Namco is keeping its cards close to its chest with regards to who exactly that fighter might be. Stay tuned for more on that!</p><p>A new stage will also be introduced in winter alongside said fighter, and if you pick up the <em>Tekken 8 </em>Season 3 Pass when it launches on February 9th (or 10th depending on your timezone), you'll get extra character costumes for some of <em>Tekken 8</em>'s most iconic fighters.</p><p>News of <em>Tekken 8</em>'s latest season pass comes just under two months after franchise legend Katsuhiro Harada <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/katsuhiro-harada-tekken-leaving-bandai-namco" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="06cf8166-bdf9-443a-b396-5dacadaa7eb4" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">announced his departure from Bandai Namco</a>, although he said at the time that he's been handing down his responsibilities to the <em>Tekken </em>team for the last "four to five years".</p>

</figure>
<p>Sharif goes on to say that after he resigned, "much of the senior leadership team" followed suit, and then Intrepid Studios' board decided to "proceed with a mass layoff".</p><p>In closing, Sharif says the development team "acted in good faith and deserved better than the uncertainty they are now facing", but that he can't elaborate any further "due to ongoing legal and governance matters".</p><p>Intrepid Studios itself hasn't commented on this situation, but just last week, the studio posted <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/4124950/view/512981748906197719" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">an update</a> to <em>Ashes of Creation</em>'s Steam page, promising a development update on February 13th and pledging to "outline Q1 plans and next steps".</p><p>That may not sound much like a game that has been canceled, and it's true that there's been no official word that <em>Ashes of Creation</em>'s development is ending, but it's hard to imagine how Intrepid could continue if its entire development team has indeed been let go.</p>
<p>If you need a reminder, <em>Ashes of Creation </em>is an MMO that was Kickstarted back in 2017, pledging to offer features like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ashes-of-creation-gameplay-video-shows-impressive-player-run-town" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="186760a2-cafa-435f-9785-d6ef92342282" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">player-run towns</a>, an innovative <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ashes-of-creation-features-innovative-story-arc-system-tower-of-carphin-in-new-gameplay" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4fbf13c0-770f-4e1e-a8c7-85bd1fa76b77" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">player-driven Story Arc system</a>, and an extensive range of combat archetypes to choose from.</p><p>The game was released in Early Access back in December following a number of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ashes-of-creation-shows-fighter-archetype-in-action-ahead-of-alpha-2" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6056f7a8-f458-478e-9379-ea63fef47ffb" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">alpha playtests</a>, which makes the idea of its cancellation doubly strange; after all, it hasn't even been two months since <em>Ashes of Creation </em>was released.</p><p>Still, the game's Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4124950/Ashes_of_Creation/#app_reviews_hash" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">reviews</a> have dropped to Mostly Negative in recent days, with players warning others off buying a game they consider "officially canceled" or "a scam" following its development team's departure.</p><p>You can check out <em>Ashes of Creation </em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4124950/Ashes_of_Creation/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC via Steam</a> if you'd like, although I'd caution against doing so until the situation is a little clearer.
