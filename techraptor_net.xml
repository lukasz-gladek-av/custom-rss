            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-a-life-20-gsc-game-world<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>developer GSC Game World has explained exactly what's happening with the game's much-touted A-Life 2.0 game AI system, including why mention of the system was removed from&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>'s Steam page and why the system itself doesn't seem to be working properly.</p>

<p>Speaking <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-dev-gsc-game-world-explains-for-the-first-time-what-went-wrong-with-a-life-20-and-why-it-was-removed-from-the-games-description-on-steam" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">to IGN</a>, GSC Game World creative director Maria Grygorovych and CEO Ievgen Grygorovych (a husband-and-wife duo) say that the A-Life 2.0 system is, in fact, in&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>, but that like much of the rest of the game, it's riddled with bugs.</p>

<p>First, it's worth explaining what A-Life 2.0 is supposed to be. The original&nbsp;<em>Stalker&nbsp;</em>included a system called A-Life, which would essentially dictate NPC behavior. It would simulate NPC movement through the game's world; in essence, NPCs didn't magically spawn around you in&nbsp;<em>Stalker</em>, but had their own paths and lives instead.</p>

GSC Game World <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/1g9od8x/alife_20_details_confirmed_by_gsc/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">talked up its inclusion</a> prior to release, but at launch,&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>seemed to tell a different story for many.</p>

<p>Fans pointed out that, contrary to the way A-Life 2.0 was supposed to create organic paths for NPCs, characters were instead simply <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/1gx7ja3/alife_20_in_action/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">spawning</a> around players, and the game's AI <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/1gvu079/there_is_no_alife/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">seemed prescriptive and scripted</a> to others.</p>

<p>In fact, the apparent failure of&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>'s A-Life 2.0 system to function was one of the sticking points for our very own Robert N. Adams. In <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/stalker-2-review" rel="nofollow">his review</a>, he talks about how the game's sudden NPC spawning "breaks immersion", describing&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>'s handling of enemy spawns as "downright clumsy".</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago,&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>players noticed that A-Life 2.0 had been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/1guf62t/alife_20_is_no_longer_mentioned_on_the_games/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">removed from the game's Steam description</a>, with mention of the system being replaced by a somewhat more generic promise of "advanced artificial intelligence systems".</p>

<p>Now, in the IGN interview, Maria Grygorovych says A-Life 2.0 was removed from&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>'s Steam page by a marketing staffer who felt the term wouldn't make sense to&nbsp;<em>Stalker&nbsp;</em>newcomers and wouldn't help to sell the game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stalker-2-a-life-2.0-explanation-bubble.jpg?itok=Fm05obZ7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stalker-2-a-life-2.0-explanation-bubble.jpg?itok=wwOTckEu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>GSC Game World's creative director says&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>'s A-Life 2.0 system was removed from the game's Steam description for marketing reasons.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Maria, this marketing staffer told her that "there will be a lot of new players who don't know what A-Life is" and that he removed the term "without any discussion or permission".</p>

<p>As for the A-Life 2.0 system itself, Ievgen says that optimization forced GSC Game World to reduce the spawn area for NPCs around the player, which is why some&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>players have noticed NPCs seemingly popping into existence around them.</p>

<p>A-Life 2.0 is supposed to work with a very wide spawn area for NPCs, but this area was reduced in order to free up memory for the game and improve its performance.</p>

<p>Ievgen is insistent that A-Life 2.0 will be fixed and that it will eventually work as intended, but for now, the focus seems to be on fixing&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>'s bugs, which is fairly understandable given just how many of them there seemed to be at launch.</p>

<p><em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>is available now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/stalker-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. It's also part of Xbox Game Pass, so if you've got an Ultimate or PC Game Pass subscription, you can enjoy it at no extra cost.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/terrible-influence-satirical-board-game-about-global-entertainment-debuts-at-pax<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The entertainment brand WatchMojo is stepping into the world of tabletop gaming at this year's PAX Unplugged. Their debut title, <em>Terrible Influence</em>, is described as a satirical board game with comedian Mark Cope as its lead designer.</p>



<p>According to an official press release, the first public demo for <em>Terrible Influence</em> will be made available at PAX Unplugged 2024 in the Forever Stoked booth at the Pennsylvania Convention Center. The convention begins Friday, December 6 and ends Sunday, December 8.</p>

The goal is to draw in an audience of passionate (and possibly deranged) fans and accrue as much wealth as possible, triggering juicy scandals along the way. You'll need that money and influence to avoid the consequences of Leaked DMs, Internet Trolls, and various Cancel cards. After all, if you're famous and rich enough consequences just go away.</p>

<p>The different online superstars in <em>Terrible Influence</em> include a funny podcaster, a vlogger with actual talent, a marketing-savvy reality TV show star, and many others. Players can gain valuable skill cards like Good Looking or Great Personality, and can role-play lucrative scenarios like sponsor ads or acceptance speeches to earn more money.</p>

To become President, naturally.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The game is a comedic and frankly cynical journey through our modern society, where players try to earn as much money and fame as possible in order to win the game and become President” said Mark Cope, Creator and Lead designer of Terrible Influence. “The real humor comes from the wild bonuses and absurd scandals throughout the game, and if I’m honest, those are pulled more from real life than satire.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cope has over 15 years of film and TV experience, including the stop-motion series <em>The Most Popular Girls in School</em> and <em>Dr. Havoc's Diary</em>. Cope has also helped create shows and branded campaigns for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-sales-30m" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Harry Potter</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/mattel-committing-to-board-game-accessibility-going-forward" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Mattel</a>, and TruTV.</p>

<p><em>Terrible Influence</em> will launch on Kickstarter in 2025.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-2-not-happening-any-time-soon-says-fromsoftware.1050618/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-2-not-happening-fromsoftware<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>FromSoftware has confirmed that&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring 2&nbsp;</em>isn't currently in development, but the possibility of expanding the&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>IP in some way in the future isn't being discounted either.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://jp.ign.com/elden-ring/77553/news/elden-ring" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">IGN Japan</a> (with additional reporting by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/fromsoftware-has-no-plans-for-elden-ring-2-but-they-have-several-new-titles-in-the-works-according-to-miyazaki/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Automaton</a>), journalists at a PlayStation Partner Awards show held today asked FromSoftware head Hidetaka Miyazaki what lay in store for the studio's future, especially with regards to the&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>IP.</p>

<p>Miyazaki responded by confirming that his studio is "not really considering developments" like&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring 2</em>, but that&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>may return "in some form in the future", although that could obviously mean anything from a fully-fledged sequel to a spinoff game, a comic, or even just tie-in merchandise.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-2-not-happening-cliff.jpg?itok=IMdkSx3R 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-2-not-happening-cliff.jpg?itok=tDXNjai9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>"Look there! Is that&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring 2</em>?" "I fear not, friend."</figcaption></figure><p>While <i>Elden Ring 2&nbsp;</i>may not currently be in development, Miyazaki does confirm that FromSoftware is currently working on several new projects across different genres.</p>

<p>Some of these projects are being directed by Miyazaki, while others are being headed up by other FromSoftware staffers. Miyazaki has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/jun/26/pushing-buttons-meeting-hidetaka-miyazaki" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">previously discussed</a> wanting to see FromSoftware games being directed by others besides himself.</p>

<p>Miyazaki doesn't go into any detail regarding what these projects might be, so it's technically possible that some of them could be sequels to existing FromSoftware IPs. After all, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/armored-core-vi-fires-of-rubicon" rel="nofollow">new&nbsp;<em>Armored Core&nbsp;</em>game</a> was released last year, and FromSoftware does have other franchises besides the&nbsp;<em>Souls&nbsp;</em>series and its cousins.</p>

<p>Still, given that we don't have any information about exactly what FromSoftware is currently working on, it may be some time before Miyazaki and his fellow directors are ready to reveal the fruits of their labors.</p>

<p>However, with the studio's parent company Kadokawa <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-kadokawa-purchase-report" rel="nofollow">currently in talks with Sony</a> for an outright purchase, it's possible that any decisions to be made regarding FromSoftware's future direction may well involve said Japanese gaming giant. We'll have to wait and see.</p>
