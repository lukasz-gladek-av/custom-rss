            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Games Workshop has announced its new <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000</em></a> Drukhari codex. This codex provides new rules and updates to an army that has been starved of support for a while. It also introduces new units for that army.</p>

<h2>The <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> Drukhari Codex Announcement</h2>

<p>In an official <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/5jk5xmlb/lady-malys-stands-tall-over-the-new-codex-drukhari/" rel="nofollow">Warhammer-Community</a> post, Games Workshop gave a preview of the <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> Drukhari Codex. The first major draw is the introduction of a new named unit. Lady Malys, the Archon of the Poisoned Tongue, as the name implies, brings swift and deadly swordplay to the battlefield alongside deadly poison. Poison that improves not just Malys' lethality, but the effectiveness of units under her.</p>

These miniatures will have new wargear options and alternate heads and bodies. These new archons will be featured in the new Realspace Raiders Battleforce box, which will contain a new archon, 10 Wyches, 10 Kabalite Warriors, 5 Hellions, 5 Scourges, 5 Incubi, and a Venom transport.</p>

<p>As for the quality-of-life improvements in the <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> Drukhari Codex, a few are highlighted. The book contains rules on five new detachments and a new Power from Pain army rule, which aligns with the Drukhari's sadomasochistic methods. The army rule will add new pain abilities to every unit's datasheet, which can be activated by spending pain points.</p>

<p>In addition, one of the new detachments features the body horror constructs known as the Haemonculi. The aptly named Coven of Agonies detachment includes a Talos, Cronos, 10 Wracks, and a Haemonculus unit, all dedicated to dangerous close-quarters combat.</p>

<p>The announcement of this new codex is a huge relief to Drukhari players since the army hasn't been updated since the announcement of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/warhammer-40k-guide" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000</em> Tenth Edition</a> back in the Summer of 2023. That is more than two years of new substantive updates or changes.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/charting-the-stars-the-spaceships-that-inspired-magic%E2%80%99s-edge-of-eternities.1291752/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We've been having a ton of fun with the latest <i>Magic: The Gathering</i>&nbsp;set, <em>Edge of Eternities</em>, and I've been especially enjoying the new Spacecraft card type, which sees massive ships, stealthy fighters, and powerful stations enter the game. This got me thinking about how the set's been influenced by sci-fi and pop-culture, so I reached out to Andrew Brown, a Game Design Architect from Wizards of the Coast who worked on the set, to learn more.</p>

<p>To begin our conversation, I wanted to know how Andrew's favorite sci-fi ships shaped the design for Spacecraft in <em>Edge of Eternities.&nbsp;</em>"This has&nbsp;to be the Eternity Elevator," Brown explains. "The infinite elevator has been a staple of many IPs and porting it into&nbsp;the vastness of&nbsp;space&nbsp;is charming to me. I&nbsp;can’t&nbsp;help but think of what kind of music they play in the elevator that lasts forever."</p>

<p>I really like the Eternity Elevator, and agree with Andrew that I've always found that idea of an Elevator from Earth to a space station or the moon really thought-provoking, especially when used as a focal point to the story ala&nbsp;<em>The Fountains of Paradise</em>&nbsp;by Arthur C. Clarke or&nbsp;<em>Old Man's War</em>&nbsp;by John Scalzi. Heck, there's even the Umbilicus used to exchange inventions with the Mads in&nbsp;<em>Mystery Science Theater 3000</em>!</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/edge-of-eternities-spaceships-elevator.jpg?itok=YNmbAm58 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/edge-of-eternities-spaceships-elevator.jpg?itok=qQLUlSb8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Next I wanted to know from Andrew which spaceship he thought would make the best Commander if it were a Magic card,&nbsp; What would its mechanics be? Deftly avoiding naming other IP's, Brown still provides a truly thought-provoking answer. "For me," he says, "it&nbsp;has to&nbsp;be the International Space Station.&nbsp;I am a sucker for 5 color commander decks and to me that captures the exact flavor of it.&nbsp;People from all over the world banding together to search the final frontier is poetic and full of hope."</p>

<p>I like the idea of the ISS as a Commander,&nbsp; which feels like it would have Convoke to help get that message of universal cooperation through. Maybe we need a set of real-world spaceships in a future Secret Lair. I mean, <em>Assassin's Creed</em> got <a href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/ACR/en-us/193/leonardo-da-vinci" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Leonardo da Vinci</a>, why can't we get Apollo 11?</p>

Image: NASA</figcaption></figure><p>Many spaceships in pop culture seem to take on a life and personality of their own (sometimes literally, in the case of <em>Alien</em>, <em>2001</em>, and many more). So I wanted to know from Andrew, which&nbsp;<em>EoE</em>&nbsp;Spacecraft, in his opinion, has the biggest personality of the set?&nbsp;</p>

<p>"<a href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/EOE/en-us/238/dawnsire-sunstar-dreadnought" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Dawnsire, Sunstar Dreadnought</a> easily has the most personality," Brown answers. "It knows&nbsp;it's&nbsp;the&nbsp;biggest,&nbsp;baddest&nbsp;and strongest around. No need&nbsp;to&nbsp;tell&nbsp;anyone!&nbsp;They know.&nbsp;20/20? Check. 100 damage? Check. The queen of the runway."</p>

<p>He'll find no argument from me on that one. My first encounter with Dawnsire was during the pre-release, where my opponent blasted that 100 damage at his own creature enchanted with&nbsp;<a href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/EOE/en-us/151/pain-for-all" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Pain for All</a>, smoking me for 100 to the dome.</p>

Which ship would he choose, and&nbsp;who’s&nbsp;in charge of the navigation?&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We would live on the&nbsp;<a href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/EOE/en-us/35/the-seriema" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Seriema</a>," Brown answers.&nbsp;"Magic design is a rag tag group of&nbsp;individuals&nbsp;from a ton of&nbsp;different&nbsp;backgrounds, so&nbsp;it's&nbsp;only fitting that we fly in the ship that embodies that&nbsp;mantra.&nbsp;Not to brag, but I would&nbsp;be in charge of&nbsp;navigation. I always remember which floor my car is&nbsp;parked in the parking lot."</p>

<p>"I can&nbsp;also&nbsp;intuit&nbsp;where every&nbsp;Starbucks&nbsp;is in any city with no map!" That's no easy feat for a company headquartered in Seattle, and will serve the MTG design crew well in their journeys across the Eternities.</p>

What are they sleeping on, and why does it deserve more love?&nbsp;</p>

<p>"<a href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/EOE/en-us/242/extinguisher-battleship" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Extinguisher Battleship</a> deserves more love," says Brown. "It's&nbsp;a ship with one goal, destroy. How can you not fall in love with something so simple, compelling, and terrifying?"</p>
