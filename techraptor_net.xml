            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Powerwashers, it's time to suit up, as the citizens of Caldera County require your cleaning expertise once again for ample soapy adventures. Developer FuturLab <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/powerwash-simulator-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">returns with <em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em></a>, the direct sequel to their 2021 bubbly simulation game, bringing forth new jobs to take on, more equipment to acquire, and new interiors and exteriors in need of a clean.</p>

<p>Following <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/powerwash-simulator-review" rel="nofollow">the release of <em>PowerWash Simulator</em></a>, FuturLab laid out the blueprint for its sequel, which should make way for a host of new content to explore and new adjustments and optimizations for a more squeaky-clean gameplay. As for whether <em>Powerwash Simulator 2</em> sets itself apart from its predecessor or is more of the same, it's up to the players to decide, but what they can anticipate is plenty of time spent blasting the dirt away, as we did!</p>

<h2>Time For A Spring Clean</h2>

<p>Let's be honest, as it pertains to the previous sentence: FuturLab doesn't do much to innovate the formula they have set out with <em>PowerWash Simulator </em>in 2021 by comparison. Instead, the developers set out to build upon their sudsy creation by improving the game's graphics and controls, retooling its tools and equipment, and better structuring their maps for a smooth gameplay experience.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/powerwash-simulator-2-screenshot-907.jpg?itok=WnVpJauq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/powerwash-simulator-2-screenshot-907.jpg?itok=1AFCp2Ro 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>We have a powerwashing office building to conduct our cleaning business.&nbsp;(Picture: FuturLab / Ashleigh Klein)&nbsp;</em></figcaption></figure><p>As the owner of a powerwashing company in Caldera County, players will lend their hand to fellow residents through various jobs they'll undertake by cleaning multiple objects and buildings from a shooting gallery, a road sweeper, a few houses, and yes, even a public toilet. Luckily, they'll have a few things to help them on these jobs to make accessibility more seamless and guide them in completing them for their clients.</p>

<p>There's also a story in play whose foundations were laid in the first game, with an Ancient Statue, and it continues in its sequel, as it has some paranormal origins. Players will gain insight into this mystery through character dialogue in text messages and article clippings, which will help them piece it together.</p>

<h2>"Boom And The Dirt Is Gone"</h2>

<p>Admittedly, every player will have a method for cleaning objects and structures in <em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em>, and mine was to clean from top to bottom and in a clockwise direction, for my OCD's sake. While my approach may be rather meticulous, perhaps bordering on obsessive, cleaning, or in this case, power washing, is cathartic and helps unwind or unpack the mind.</p>

<p>As relaxing as it is to blast away the dirt from the rooftops to the walls and on the ground, from a gameplay perspective, the maps that feature in every story job that players will undertake have been structured similarly to the first game, where, upon accepting a job, players blast away the dirt and grime from all surfaces. However, there are a few areas that are rather tricky to clean, like between joints, handles, drains, and the underside of vehicles, which will demand plenty of time for players to get clean.</p>

<p>While as frustrating as it may be when trying to determine which areas were amiss, a tracker can be accessed where players can mark which areas have not been thoroughly cleaned. Likewise, hitting a button or key can reveal the remaining dirt spots or unclean areas before aiming our power washer tool to wash the dirt away.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/powerwash-simulator-2-screenshot-878.jpg?itok=0iqyAD0_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/powerwash-simulator-2-screenshot-878.jpg?itok=5Gy4XDqO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Don't mind us. We're just cleaning the side body of the Airship's gondola. (Picture: FuturLab / Ashleigh Klein)</em></figcaption></figure><p>Meanwhile, buildings and other structures will be a much easier feat to accomplish, especially when utilizing various equipment pieces, such as jumping atop platforms, climbing ladders, and the new scissor lift, to reach and clean the rooftops, thus making our time on the job well spent. For floors and rooftops, perhaps the most useful tool of them all, the SwirlForce Surf Ace surface cleaner and its attachments ensure that the surfaces are cleaned extremely well and in a quicker time, too.</p>

<p>Although players will have to spend their hard-earned money to splash on the SwirlForce Surf Ace surface cleaner and other cleaners with their attachments over time, players can find their favorite tools of the trade. The tool wheel allows players to access all acquired cleaners and their attachments to find the best tool for the job or for the task at hand, whether it be for flat surfaces or cleaning the tricky nooks and crannies.</p>

<p>On the latter, not every job will go smoothly, as there will be some challenging jobs to tackle, like the shooting gallery, a literal billboard, a cement truck, and a shopping mall, which will throw players for a loop. While the task at hand may be daunting, having a plan of action and the right tools will make these jobs less intimidating while cleaning these precarious surfaces less arduous.</p>

<p>Despite the frustrations one may have with these complicated surfaces, which can be time-consuming, there is fun to be had, such as on the billboard map, where players can use a new piece of equipment, the abseiling apparatus. While high up in the sky, players can move up and down and left to right while being seated; however, the only restriction is that trying to clean the platform below will force you to disembark, so it's slightly limiting in its utility.</p>

<p>One of the welcoming changes to the washers and their attachments is that once they've surpassed their functionality, they can be sold, which wasn't possible in the first game. This, in turn, will allow players to recover funds to purchase more effective and powerful washers for more challenging jobs as they progress in the story.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/powerwash-simulator-2-screenshot-905.jpg?itok=UBBTPbvJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/powerwash-simulator-2-screenshot-905.jpg?itok=2hwYKR_5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Players can customize their office building by purchasing furniture pieces from the in-game shop! (Picture: FuturLab / Ashleigh Klein)</em></figcaption></figure><p>Another new change, or rather addition, is customization according to the sequel's story, and the expansion of their cleaning business; they'll move into new premises that can be personalized. You reorganize the shop where players can purchase furniture, which must also be cleaned before using the Placement Mode to reposition and place them within their business space.</p>

<p>And for the best possible experience, players have the option to choose between Classic and Modern controls, which have just a few differences between them, but for experienced washers, the Classic controls will be more akin to their experiences with the first <em>PowerWash Simulator</em> game. Likewise, the Free Play and split-screen co-op modes return, allowing players to revisit completed maps and team up with another player for the ultimate couch co-op experience.</p>

<h2>Not Entirely Spotless...</h2>

<p>One desire for the sequel was to up the ante, but unfortunately, it follows the same formula as the first game, and its gameplay can feel repetitive at times, almost in a loop of doing the same things over and over again. While it stays true to its formula and boasts a few new additions along with new adjustments and optimizations that change the formula ever so slightly, <em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em> is more of a continuation of the first game rather than a sequel.</p>

<p>Mind you, there are some long-awaited adjustments and optimizations, such as soap retooling, reselling of washers and attachments, new tools and equipment, improved controls and graphics, alongside the new maps and customization, gameplay is much the same. Yes, it's very much <em>PowerWash Simulator,</em> but with a fresh coat of paint, it's still plenty of fun engaging with the content, blasting all the dirt and grime off surfaces, and having a variety of tools at our disposal.</p>

<p>Sure, the details are in the small things that give <em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em> quite the upgrade from its predecessor. The developer didn't do much to evolve the game completely, but they have done enough to make it a standout release in the <em>PowerWash Simulator</em> series. And players won't be disappointed with this latest offering, with plenty of new content and a host of changes that will keep them engulfed in bubbly fun for hours on end.</p>

<h2><em>PowerWash Simulator 2 </em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/powerwash-simulator-2-screenshot-904.jpg?itok=pZTs6w_8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/powerwash-simulator-2-screenshot-904.jpg?itok=GKXSgMSu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Players can replay their favorite jobs in Free Play mode when accessing the Mementos Shelf.&nbsp;(Picture: FuturLab / Ashleigh Klein)&nbsp;</em></figcaption></figure><p>With tens of hours invested in <em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em>, one will certainly continue their soapy adventures and expand their powerwashing business in Caldera County. Having spent hours and hours in the first game and enjoying all the DLCs that were added post-launch, suffice to say, that there is an excitement towards the sequel, and I was genuinely surprised with what the developers offered in the sequel, even if it doesn't appear to be a sequel in the traditional sense.</p>

<p>Quite simply, FuturLab took the formula and the best parts from the first game, adding much-needed new content, adjustments, and optimizations for a more complete power-washing experience. What many are most looking forward to once they've rolled the credits is whether they'll follow a similar post-launch roadmap in adding free and paid content to the game in the form of DLCs, adding more variety to the game, and continued investment from the players.</p>

<p>It will certainly be interesting to see where <em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em> will be in the future, both short-term and long-term, and if the developers are following the success story of its predecessor. The future is undoubtedly bright and bubbly. Now, if only a particular achievement didn't get bugged, preventing me from unlocking it, but for once, we'll blame the gnomes for this!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With <em>Battlefield 6</em> out now and doing quite well for itself in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/battlefield-6-multiplayer-preview-all-out-warfare-in-mirak-valley-and-operation" rel="nofollow">multiplayer</a> action sphere – as we detailed in our <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/battlefield-6-review-war-on-unprecedented-scale" rel="nofollow">full review</a> – it’s time to turn our attention towards what’s next for EA’s biggest game of the year. We’re just under a week away from Season 1. Launching on October 28 and across three phases over time in an effort to bring high-quality content to players at regular intervals.</p>

<p>The first phase of content will open with Rogue Ops, which includes a new map known as Blackwell Fields, and a new 4v4 mode called Strikepoint. In the second phase, starting on November 18, we’ll see California Resistance and the addition of another new map called Eastwood.</p>

<p>Then, on December 9, Winter Offensive will begin with a seasonal update to the existing Empire State map.</p>

All of this content is being promised for free from the start, or is earnable on free tiers in the Battle Pass.</p>

<p>Digging into Rogue Ops specifically, it’s themed around high-stakes ops in pursuit of military secrets in the first all-new map: Blackwell Fields. While it’s a large map set in the Californian Chaparral and built for all-out warfare, there’s a good amount of structures that lean heavily into standoff with outdoor combat.</p>

<p>We got to try out this map in the Close-Quarters Battle mode, which meant smaller team sizes and up close and personal fights. Right away, it’s easy to see why this map is ideal for the selected mode.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can duck in and out of military installations and homesteads scattered across the land. Everything is dusty and dirty, and fires scatter the area, which makes it harder to see clearly in some aspects.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/20251021201408_1.jpg?itok=4h8jDo8g 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/20251021201408_1.jpg?itok=Iq-2VO-3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>New weapons available during this phase include the SCAR SC .300, which excels at close-quarters combat. There’s also the Glock 22 and the Mini Fix Bolt-Action rifle for long-distance attacks.</p>

<p>There’s also a new vehicle available – an APC called the Traverser Mark 2, which operates as an Infantry Support vehicle that offers up a spawn point and a supply station or other vehicles on your team. Rogue Ops and the Blackwell Fields map will run from October 28 to November 11, with Phase 2 to follow.</p>

<p>California Resistance is an apt name for the next round of Season 1 because it further explores another area of the region where both NATO and the local militia are trying to defend California from PAX’s incursion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The map coming up here is called Eastwood, is set in a quiet and upscale Southern California neighborhood – well, formerly quiet because now there’s a warzone running through it, and every part of it can be chaotic but also used to your advantage.</p>

<p>Trying out the All-Out-Warfare mode, it’s easy to see how this area has become a complete battlefield, and you’ll be fighting in and around houses, blowing them apart, and riding around in tanks and other vehicles to add to the destruction.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/20251021181509_1.jpg?itok=SEcq-bGQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/20251021181509_1.jpg?itok=8AJ9J0GV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This phase will also introduce a limited-time mode to<em> Battlefield 6</em> called Sabotage, in which two teams of eight attack and defend supply caches on the map. Attackers and defenders will swap sides after each round to mix things up, and destroying the most caches will net a win for the match.</p>

<p>Battle Pickups will also debut during this phase, which are high-value, rare weapons with limited ammunition but can do major damage to enemies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>New weapons will include the DP-12 shotgun, which has different ammo types in each of its tubes, and the 8-shot S&amp;W M327 revolver.</p>

<p>Phase 3 of the season will turn towards winter, and while details remain sparse for now, it’ll launch ahead of the holidays with a winter-themed Empire State map. Following that, players can expect Season 2 to drop within the new year.</p>
