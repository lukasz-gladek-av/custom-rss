            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-third-party-game-launch-sales-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report claims that launch numbers for third-party games available on the newly-released Nintendo Switch 2 aren't great, and that customers seem to be favoring Nintendo's own games rather than those by publishers like Capcom, CD Projekt, and Sega.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/it-was-the-biggest-console-launch" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">The Game Business</a>, around 62% of physical Switch 2 game sales in the US during the console's launch week were for first-party games, and that doesn't include the&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>console bundle, which comes complete with a digital copy of the racer.</p>

<p>The Game Business notes that "one third-party publisher" (who the publication doesn't name) referred to Switch 2 launch sales as "below our lowest estimates", so it sounds like non-Nintendo publishers releasing games on the Switch 2 aren't happy with sales so far.</p>

<p>More third-party games launched alongside the Switch 2 - thirteen versus the original console's five - and the Switch 2 has also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-fastest-selling-nintendo-console" rel="nofollow">sold more consoles than the original machine did</a> during the same time period, so the higher percentage doesn't tell the whole story.</p>

<p>It's difficult to know what, if anything, these figures portend. Many of the Switch 2's third-party titles are several years old, meaning a lot of people will probably already have had their fill of them.</p>

<p>Additionally, the Switch 2's strange Game Key Card system, which means that many publishers don't actually include full game files on their Switch 2 carts, may have put off buyers from picking up games on Nintendo's platform. It's difficult to say without more in-depth qualitative data, of course.</p>

<p>Still, Nintendo probably isn't too worried; it's always the company's first-party releases that do the best on Nintendo hardware, and as long as games like<i>&nbsp;Mario Kart World</i>, the two&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>Switch 2 Editions, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2" rel="nofollow">the upcoming&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2" rel="nofollow">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>&nbsp;</em>enjoy strong sales, Nintendo probably won't sweat too much.</p>
