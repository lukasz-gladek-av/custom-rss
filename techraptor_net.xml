            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-flop-warner-bros-100m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Warner Bros. has admitted that platform fighter&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus&nbsp;</em>was a flop, adding yet more to the losses the company has sustained in what is becoming a disastrous year for its interactive branch.</p>

<p>In a recent earnings call (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-admits-multiversus-underperformed-contributing-to-another-100-million-hit-to-revenue-in-its-games-business" rel="noopener" target="_blank">IGN</a>), Warner Bros. CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels said&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus&nbsp;</em>contributed to "another $100 million plus impairment" due to its underperformance, meaning WB's overall gaming writedown on a year-to-date basis is over $300 million.</p>

<p>If you're wondering where the other $200 million of that writedown came from, it was contributed by February's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-kill-justice-leagues-sales-disappointed-hogwarts-legacy-is-big-win"><em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&nbsp;</em>massively underperforming</a>.&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus&nbsp;</em>isn't quite on the same catastrophic level, but that's two live-service experiments that appear to have failed for WB this year.</p>

<p>After being <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-open-beta-will-close-in-june-full-release-coming-in-early-2024">taken offline last year</a> following a lengthy open beta period,&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-release-date-full">released in full</a> as a free-to-play fighting game earlier this year. Its character roster includes the likes of&nbsp;<em>Scooby-Doo!</em>'s Shaggy, DC's Superman and Batman, and&nbsp;<em>Adventure Time</em>'s Jake and Finn, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-jason-agent-smith">other familiar faces</a>.</p>

<p>A quick look at&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus</em>' <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1818750/charts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB page</a>&nbsp;might give a good indication as to the scale of the game's failure; it's currently got just 1,121 players (at time of writing), with a 24-hour peak of 1,741. That's compared to its all-time peak of over 150,000 when it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-beta-and-new-characters-announced">launched in open beta in 2022</a>.</p>

<p>Despite its disappointment in&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus</em>, WB has a plan. Per the earnings call, it's focusing on four core franchises:&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat</em>,&nbsp;the DC universe,&nbsp;<em>Game of Thrones</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-sales-30m">a sequel</a> and a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-directors-cut-report">Director's Cut</a> apparently already in the pipeline for the latter.</p>

<p>Hey, who knows? Perhaps the single-player game on which Rocksteady is apparently working is a new&nbsp;<em>Batman&nbsp;</em>game. Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on your movie preferences), we do, however, know that it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/james-gunn-the-batman-rumors">won't be a game based on the 2022 movie&nbsp;<em>The Batman</em></a>.</p>
