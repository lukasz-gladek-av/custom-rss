            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Toshiyuki Itahana, the man behind <em>Final Fantasy IX</em>'s iconic character designs, has departed Square Enix in order to become a freelance artist and illustrator.</p><p>In <a href="https://note.com/itahana/n/n277aa9cc7148" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">a post on Japanese platform Note</a> (which is in both Japanese and English and which was spotted by <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/toshiyuki-itahana-ffix-character-designer-has-left-square-enix.1397110/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">ResetEra user Xenosaga</a>), Itahana says he left Square Enix following a period of "thinking seriously about preparing [himself] to continue drawing for many years to come". His departure actually came at the end of 2025.</p><p>Itahana goes on to say that while he feels "deeply grateful" towards those who celebrated <em>Final Fantasy IX</em> for the JRPG's 25th anniversary last year, completing the "illustration work and supervision" for the occasion led him to "draw a line under this chapter and take on new challenges".</p><figure role="group">

<p>In conclusion to his post, Itahana says he's hoping to "continue creating a wide variety of new artwork" as a freelancer and expresses his "heartfelt gratitude" to former colleagues both at Square Enix and elsewhere.</p><p>As well as <em>Final Fantasy IX</em>, Itahana has worked on a number of other Square Enix projects, including the likes of <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>'s <em>Dawntrail </em>expansion, where he provided character concept art (but nothing beyond that, so I <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-review-inconsistent-vacation" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d75083ba-0c32-43b2-b2b6-430355d89eb0" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">won't blame <em>Dawntrail </em>on him</a>).</p><p>He's also worked on the <em>Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles </em>games, as well as projects like <em>Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition </em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/chocobo-gp" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="979e8964-98c5-46aa-9190-d7479f9d3832" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">2022 racer <em>Chocobo GP</em></a>. Hopefully, we'll get to see his art in many more games to come.</p><p>As for <em>Final Fantasy IX</em>, the RPG's anniversary has come and gone with nary a mention of the long-rumored remake. It is, of course, still possible that the project is on the way, but the 25th anniversary would have been the perfect time to reveal it if so. I wouldn't hold my breath, personally.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see what lies in Itahana's future, but whatever it is, it'll probably be outside of Square Enix's purview. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Limited Run Games has shadowdropped a version of remastered platformer <em>Tomba! Special Edition </em>on Switch 2, and it comes complete with a host of improvements specific to the platform as well.</p><p>As revealed by Limited Run on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/limitedrungames.com/post/3mboiujxgzj2x" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Bluesky</a>, <em>Tomba! Special Edition</em>'s Switch 2 version features "increased resolution", "improved performance", and "higher quality assets", as well as a "downsampled display mode". If you've got a Switch 2, this sounds like the perfect way to experience the game.</p><p>Unfortunately, it doesn't look like owners of the game on Switch 1 will get any kind of upgrade or even a discount, at least according to a <a href="https://x.com/Senator_Cthulu/status/2008168415274385672" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">couple</a> of <a href="https://x.com/TheOnlyGamerLP/status/2008168668165734542" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">users</a> in Limited Run's replies on X. Limited Run itself has been quiet about whether there's an upgrade or not, so it's safe to assume you'll have to buy this one again.</p><figure role="group">

<p>If you're not familiar with <em>Tomba!</em>, it's a rather curious game from the halcyon days of the original PlayStation, having launched in Japan in 1997, followed by a release in America and Europe the following year.</p><p>The game is essentially a Metroidvania platformer that follows the titular Tomba, a feral child who must defeat a battalion of pigs in order to recover a sacred bracelet belonging to his grandfather.</p><p>To do so, he'll have to explore a large non-linear map filled with areas to explore in both the foreground and background, as well as quests to complete in the course of exploration.</p><p>Since release, <em>Tomba!</em>, which was released as <em>Tombi! </em>in Europe, has attracted a cult following, leading to the launch of a sequel, <em>Tomba! 2: The Evil Swine Return</em>, in 1999. The sequel netted itself a release for modern systems, including the Switch 2, in December last year.</p>
<p>You can check out <em>Tomba! Special Edition </em><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/tomba-special-edition-switch-2/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">right now on Switch 2</a>. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
