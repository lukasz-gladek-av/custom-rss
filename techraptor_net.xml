            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After two years, the <em>Disney Lorcana</em> lawsuit between Ravensburger and Upper Deck is coming to a close. Yet, after winning its cases, Ravensburger is pushing Upper Deck to pay the legal fees for its defense.</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://boardgamewire.com/index.php/2025/11/08/ravensburger-pushes-for-upper-deck-to-pay-3-8m-legal-fees-it-racked-up-defeating-groundless-but-unrelenting-disney-lorcana-lawsuit/" rel="nofollow">Board Game Wire</a>, a US federal judge ruled in favor of Ravensburger in all of Upper Deck's claims against the company. Those claims included copyright infringement, fraudulent misrepresentation and concealment, and unfair competition.</p>

Basically, Upper Deck sued&nbsp; <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/disney-lorcana" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Disney Lorcana's</em></a> lead designer, Ryan Miller, and Ravensburger for allegedly stealing and repackaging one of their in-development card games, <em>Rush of Ikorr</em>, into the popular Disney-themed TCG. These alleged copyright damages, according to Upper Deck's legal expert, were worth around $240 million.</p>

<p>Upper Deck argued that Miller was working for Upper Deck at the time, spending a year working on <em>Rush of Ikorr</em>, and that Disney Lorcana had "remarkable, uncanny similarities" to that game..</p>

<p>In fact, Ravensburger stated that Upper Deck should pay Ravensburger's legal fees for wasting their time with the Disney Lorcana lawsuit, requesting $3.8 billion in legal fees. The claim states,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"A complete defence verdict on an objectively meritless case warrants a full fee award.&nbsp;Upper Deck’s case was frivolous in conception, objectively unreasonable in prosecution and pursued in a manner that multiplied costs while consuming vast judicial resources."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For context, Upper Deck alleged copyright infringement on 43 separate game elements in Disney Lorcana. One of these mechanics included "taking alternate turns." The defense of these claims involved the exchange of 7,000 documents, and extended quizzing on all witnesses present for those 43 potentially infringing elements.</p>

<p>Given the fact that gameplay mechanics cannot be copyrighted, plus the extended procedures involved, Ravensburger's statements of this case being meritless does hold significance.</p>

<p>Upper Deck is continuing their legal fight against Ravensburger, filing an additional lawsuit in the Netherlands.&nbsp;</p>
