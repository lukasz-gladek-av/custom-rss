            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/apple-games-revealed-fall<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Apple has officially revealed its new Apple Games app, which the Cupertino tech giant says is intended to become "a dedicated destination for people who love playing games on their Apple devices".</p>

<p>The app was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/apple-gaming-acquisition-rac7" rel="nofollow">reported to be in development by Bloomberg</a> earlier this year, but in a new <a href="https://developer.apple.com/games-app/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>, Apple confirms that the Apple Games app is available now in developer beta, with all iOS, iPadOS, and macOS users getting the new app this fall.</p>

<p>Apple Games will consist of five distinct tabs: Home, Play Together, Arcade, Library, and Search. Home shows things like highlights, "personalized recommendations", and "editorial selections", as well as friend activity and other game-related info.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/apple-games-app-what-the-clash.jpg?itok=hyXJVi5C 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/apple-games-app-what-the-clash.jpg?itok=CTbpJOGQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Apple's new Apple Games app is coming this fall.</figcaption></figure><p>Play Together is, as you've probably guessed, a tab that shows you what your friends are up to, while Arcade is the place to go if you're a subscriber to the Apple Arcade service.</p>

<p>Finally, your Library tab collects all of your games in one place, and the Search tab lets you look for specific games, collections, or charts. It's all pretty self-explanatory stuff, really.</p>

<p>With Apple Games, it looks as though Apple wants to create a unified hub for all things gaming on your iOS or macOS device, so if you're the kind of person who routinely whips out your phone for a quick go on an Apple Arcade game, this app is for you.</p>

<p>We don't have a release date for Apple Games yet, but it's likely that it'll roll out alongside iOS, macOS, and iPadOS 26, so whenever that major update for your device's operating system arrives, that's also when you'll be able to check out Apple Games.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/apple-games-ios-26.jpg?itok=sN__kk2l 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/apple-games-ios-26.jpg?itok=-KL3HeXM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Apple Games will likely roll out alongside iOS 26 this fall.</figcaption></figure><p>Alongside Apple's acquisition of&nbsp;<em>Sneaky Sasquatch&nbsp;</em>developer RAC7 last month, it seems that this new app is part of a wider push towards gaming. Could this all culminate in the release of a dedicated Apple gaming console? Probably not, but we can dream, right?</p>

<p>In other Apple-related gaming news, Epic's battle royale game&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-ios-app-store-returns" rel="nofollow">finally restored to iOS devices</a> last month following a protracted spat between the two companies. Epic previously alleged that Apple blocked the release of&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>on its devices, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-offline-worldwide-ios-apple-block" rel="nofollow">causing a worldwide outage</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splatoon-raiders-splatoon-3-switch-2</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/splatoon-spinoff-splatoon-raiders-and-splatoon-3-switch-2-update-announced.1214349/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splatoon-raiders-splatoon-3-switch-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The first ever&nbsp;<em>Splatoon&nbsp;</em>spinoff,&nbsp;<em>Splatoon Raiders</em>, has been revealed for Switch 2, and what's more,&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 3&nbsp;</em>will also be getting an update for the new machine in the next couple of days.</p>

<p>Over on the Nintendo Today app, Nintendo revealed&nbsp;<em>Splatoon Raiders&nbsp;</em>with a brand new trailer that shows Deep Cut members Shiver, Big Man, and Frye en route to a new location known as the Spirhalite Islands.</p>

<p>Of course, their helicopter crash-lands on the islands, presumably along with the player character, so it sounds like it'll be up to you to get yourself and Deep Cut off the Spirhalite Islands, presumably while fending off threats.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/splatoon-raiders-announced-big-man.jpg?itok=YuJQYWGI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/splatoon-raiders-announced-big-man.jpg?itok=bfecjgXE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Splatoon Raiders&nbsp;</em>is a brand new&nbsp;<em>Splatoon&nbsp;</em>spinoff coming to Switch 2.</figcaption></figure><p>We don't know too much more about&nbsp;<em>Splatoon Raiders&nbsp;</em>than that right now. Nintendo says it will be an "adventure" in which you'll play as a mechanic, and that Deep Cut will be joining you for your adventure, but we didn't get to learn exactly what kind of game&nbsp;<em>Raiders&nbsp;</em>will be.</p>

<p>We do, however, know that&nbsp;<em>Splatoon Raiders&nbsp;</em>will be a Switch 2 exclusive, so you won't be able to play it on the original Switch, unfortunately. Nintendo says more info will be shared later down the line.</p>

<h2><em>Splatoon 3&nbsp;</em>is also getting a Switch 2 update</h2>

<p>Happily,&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 3&nbsp;</em>is also getting some love for the Switch 2. The game will be getting an update later this week that smooths out some perfomance issues and brings improved visuals as well.</p>

<p>Despite major updates for&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 3&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splatoon-3-updates-ending" rel="nofollow">coming to an end in September last year</a>,&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 3&nbsp;</em>Version 10.0.0 will also be getting new weapons as part of the Splatlands Collection. They'll be based on previous weapons, but will sport "fresh new looks".</p>




<p>If you're worried about not being able to splat with your Switch friends, fret not: you'll still be able to enjoy crossplay between Switch 2 and original Switch.</p>

<p>We don't have a release window for&nbsp;<em>Splatoon Raiders&nbsp;</em>yet, but the&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 3&nbsp;</em>Switch 2 update launches on June 12th. Stay tuned for more.</p>
