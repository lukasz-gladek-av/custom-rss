The game managed to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-sales-500k" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="60aad754-fdd9-4d60-bb74-1251bf703db7" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">hit 500,000 sales in its first week</a>, so that means it's picked up another 300,000 since then.</p><p>In addition to revealing the new sales milestone, Level-5 has also announced that a second major update is on the way for <em>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</em>, following on from the game's first big update in December. It's bringing "the opening of the Ares Route, among other features".</p><figure role="group">

<p>Level-5 will no doubt be pleased with <em>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</em>'s performance, especially given what a long road it's been to get here (and not one with a guaranteed chance of victory, either).</p><p>Originally known as <em>Inazuma Eleven: Heroes' Great Road</em>, the game has been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/inazuma-eleven-heroes-great-road-delayed-until-2021" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="291efc63-1f35-4892-bcb7-01502230543a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">delayed</a> numerous times, and a Western release was by no means guaranteed until Level-5 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-will-come-west-new-trailer-details-revealed" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c93004cd-65c8-4edc-afb5-782c92344e4c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">announced one in 2023</a>.</p><p>Just like its predecessors, <em>Victory Road </em>is an RPG that combines tactical soccer battles with overworld exploration. It takes place around 25 years after the original <em>Inazuma Eleven </em>and follows a new protagonist, Dustin Billows (Sasanami Unmei in the Japanese version).</p><p>Billows isn't capable of hitting the field himself, but he can recruit other students to join his team, and so he serves as their commander, building a team of unconventional soccer heroes to take on all comers.</p>
<p><em>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road </em>forms part of what is arguably a big comeback for Level-5, with cozy RPG <em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time </em>also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-girl-who-steals-time-sales-1-5m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4638dd4a-d2d1-40e8-b386-03f485297eeb" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">doing pretty well in the sales stakes</a>.</p><p>You can check out <em>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road </em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2799860/INAZUMA_ELEVEN_Victory_Road/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/inazuma-eleven-victory-road/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/inazuma-eleven-victory-road/9NVX87ZG7WSC" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and both <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/INAZUMA-ELEVEN-Victory-Road-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2950552.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Switch 2</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/INAZUMA-ELEVEN-Victory-Road-2950387.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Switch</a> right now.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
