            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Jackalyptic Games, the studio purportedly responsible for developing an unannounced&nbsp;<em>Warhammer&nbsp;</em>MMO, has become yet another casualty of parent company NetEase.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jackalyptic-games_im-here-to-share-a-note-that-after-nearly-activity-7392684257858494464-6uB8/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post on LinkedIn</a>, CEO Jack Emmert said that his studio's "partnership" with NetEase is "coming to an end", and that Jackalyptic's "talented team members will be exploring new opportunities", so it sounds like the studio is shutting down completely.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Warhammer&nbsp;</em>MMO on which Jackalyptic Games (formerly Jackalope Games) was reportedly working was never officially revealed, but it was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-21/netease-s-billionaire-ceo-slashes-jobs-and-games-in-profit-push" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reported back in February</a> that the studio was seeking funding for the project following a slew of NetEase studio closures and funding pulls.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/jackalyptic-games-netease-warhammer-mmo-shutdown.jpg?itok=lj7nJz4D 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/jackalyptic-games-netease-warhammer-mmo-shutdown.jpg?itok=vTTCLAgY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Jackalyptic's purported&nbsp;<em>Warhammer&nbsp;</em>MMO almost certainly won't be happening now.</figcaption></figure><p>Ben Dahl, who was working with Jackalyptic as one of the studio's sound designers, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bendahlmusic_i-suppose-the-news-is-out-with-netease-stepping-activity-7392709898251268096-cS1B/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">confirmed</a> the company's shutdown, saying that NetEase is "stepping back from their involvement in Jackalyptic". It sounds like the developer wasn't successful in securing alternative funding for the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer&nbsp;</em>MMO.</p>

<p>Jackalyptic Games was founded as Jackalope Games by Jack Emmert in May 2022, at which point it was also revealed that the studio was teaming up with Games Workshop on its first project (thus virtually guaranteeing it was based on&nbsp;<em>Warhammer</em>).</p>

<p>The studio was NetEase's first US-based gaming studio, and it was part of a major expansion into studio acquisition, with major figures like ex-Ubisoft producer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-netease-studio-bad-brain" rel="nofollow">Sean Crooks</a>,&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netease-launches-new-studio-pincool-led-by-former-dragon-quest-producer-will-work-on" rel="nofollow">Ryutaro Ichimura</a>, and BioWare's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mac-walters-worlds-untold-netease" rel="nofollow">Mac Walters</a> teaming up with NetEase for their own ventures.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it would prove to be a short honeymoon. Both Crooks' and Walters' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bad-brain-game-studios-netease-shut-down" rel="nofollow">studios</a> have been&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/worlds-untold-netease-pause-shutdown" rel="nofollow">shut down</a>&nbsp;in the past twelve months, along with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rich-vogel-t-minus-zero-entertainment-netease-shut-down" rel="nofollow">T-Minus Zero Entertainment</a>, which was founded by another BioWare veteran, and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-studio-shockingly-closed-by-netease-laying-off-everyone" rel="nofollow">Seattle development team of&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em></a>.</p>

Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-exoskeleton</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/real-life-death-stranding-2-exoskeleton-aims-to-boost-your-movement-in-december.1348723/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Kojima Productions and exoskeleton maker Dnsys have teamed up to create a&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2</em>-themed exoskeleton, and you'll be able to buy one in early December, albeit in a "very limited run".</p>

<p>The exoskeleton is a special&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2</em>-branded version of Dnsys' Z1 Pro model, and it'll be released on December 2nd, according to a Dnsys <a href="https://dnsys.ai/blogs/dnsys-and-kojima-productions-launch/death-stranding-2-x-dnsys-inspired-by-the-game-engineered-for-reality" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a>.</p>

<p>The cost of the unit hasn't been revealed, but the company's X1 Lite exoskeleton costs around $700, and since that's on the bottom end of Dnsys' pricing range, you can probably expect to be paying quite a lot more for the&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>Z1 Pro. Pricing will be revealed on release day, Dnsys says.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dnsys-death-stranding-2-exoskeleton.jpg?itok=bgUSURcq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dnsys-death-stranding-2-exoskeleton.jpg?itok=NItxKLj1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>is getting its own branded exoskeleton.</figcaption></figure><p>To create the new exoskeleton (which is launching ahead of the mass production of the Z1 model proper), Dnsys worked with&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>artist Yoji Shinkawa, who's also known for his work on Hideo Kojima's&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear&nbsp;</em>series.</p>

<p>Shinkawa says he and Dnsys "designed this exoskeleton with the same passion and precision as if it were built for the world of&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding</em>", and that the device is "something Sam Porter Bridges himself might wear".</p>

<p>According to Dnsys, the&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>Z1 Pro will offer "50% extra power to steps", as well as joint protection through "offload[ing] up to 200% of body weight from the knees". You can also expect extended hiking and vertical climbing ranges.</p>

<p>If you'd like to be in with a chance of winning yourself a&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>exoskeleton, you can take part in the new Share Your Journey campaign, which asks you to tell Dnsys how an exoskeleton would help you in your day-to-day life. You can find details <a href="https://dnsys.ai/pages/z1-exoskeleton-death-stranding2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>.</p>




<p>As for <i>Death Stranding 2</i>'s creator Hideo Kojima, he's currently hard at work on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kojima-productions-10th-od-physint" rel="nofollow">new projects&nbsp;<em>OD&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Physint</em></a>, although it's probably going to be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kojima-physint-five-six-years" rel="nofollow">quite some time indeed</a> before the latter sees the light of day, at least.</p>

<p>Dnsys'&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2</em>-themed Z1 Pro exoskeleton launches on December 2nd, and as a reminder, it'll be arriving in very limited quantities. Be sure to sign up to the mailing list via the official website to get the best chance of grabbing yours.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sony State of Play Japan Revealed for Later This Week]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-state-of-play-japan-november-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-state-of-play-japan-revealed-for-later-this-week.1348720/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has announced a brand new PlayStation State of Play show for this week, and it'll focus on games from Japan and the wider Asia region.</p>

<p>As outlined in a PlayStation Blog <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/10/state-of-play-japan-airs-this-tuesday-november-11/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, the State of Play show will air tomorrow at 2pm Pacific (that's 5pm Eastern and around 10pm GMT). It'll feature "great games, interviews, and new looks at anticipated titles", according to Sony.</p>

<p>The presentation will be aired in Japanese, but it'll feature full English subtitles, so you'll be able to watch it even if you don't speak the language. You will need to watch on the Western PlayStation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/PLAYSTATION" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>, though, because the Japanese channel's show won't feature subtitles.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-state-of-play-japan.jpg?itok=28YjJb5k 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-state-of-play-japan.jpg?itok=FZOFXEtH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Expect to see Japan-centric Sony games featured during this week's show.</figcaption></figure><p>The new State of Play will last "more than 40 minutes", Sony says, and it'll be hosted by voice actor Yuki Kaji, who you might know as the Japanese voice of the&nbsp;<em>Ys&nbsp;</em>series' protagonist Adol Christin, as well as his work on anime like&nbsp;<em>My Hero Academia&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</em>.</p>

<p>Sony hasn't revealed what kind of games we can expect to see during the show, but since it's focusing on the studio's Asian development efforts, don't hold your breath for updates on titles like&nbsp;<em>Saros&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Marvel's Wolverine</em>.</p>

<p>Instead, games like Arc System Works' upcoming&nbsp;<em>Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</em>, as well as Hero Project efforts like&nbsp;<em>Exiledge&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-to-invest-in-china-hero-project-convallaria-to-shore-up-efforts-in-china" rel="nofollow"><em>Convallaria</em></a>, are more likely. I'd imagine we'll see a few new titles announced during the show as well.</p>

<p>News of the new State of Play comes after Sony reaffirmed its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-financials-q1-2025" rel="nofollow">commitment to its live-service agenda</a> back in August, despite the high-profile failure of&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shocking-no-one-bungies-marathon-delayed" rel="nofollow">delay to Bungie's upcoming extraction shooter&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em></a>.</p>

<p>The State of Play Japan presentation for November 2025 airs tomorrow at 2pm Pacific/5pm Eastern/10pm GMT. Stay tuned for more.</p>
