Doing so nets you a number of goodies, including extra cars and access to two "premium expansions".</p><p>Perhaps more interestingly for our purposes, however, a pre-order also advertises the possibility of playing <em>Forza Horizon 6 </em>"four days early starting May 15th", which would seem to point to an official release date of May 19th.</p><figure role="group">

<p>As a reminder, <em>Forza Horizon 6 </em>was officially unveiled by Xbox <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/forza-horizon-6-revealed-ps5" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7ede297d-3bdf-4de5-b00a-3479b4a33aab" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">during the Tokyo Game Show last year</a>. It'll be coming to PS5, just like its predecessor, although that release will be happening later than the game's PC and Xbox Series X|S arrival.</p><p>We don't know a great deal about <em>Forza Horizon 6 </em>yet, although we do know the game will be taking place in Japan, and that it'll feature a number of real-world locations, including Tokyo, Hokkaido, and the imposing Mt. Fuji.</p><p>We also know that <em>Forza Horizon 6 </em>is one of the reasons that Turn 10 Studios decided to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/forza-motorsport-updates-ending" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="28526b82-2c26-415e-b595-273f31c08d2e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">can further content updates</a> for the more hardcore <em>Forza Motorsport</em>, since the studio is assisting Playground Games with development on the simcade racer.</p><p>It's likely the release date for <em>Forza Horizon 6 </em>will be revealed during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-developer-direct-january-22nd-2026" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2c8e5f78-4ad9-43f4-bd6b-54b81360f376" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">next week's Xbox Developer Direct</a>, where we'll also get more information about the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fable-reboot-delayed-2026" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="48a951d3-c822-4051-88a7-e27a8ee10808" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">long-delayed <em>Fable </em>reboot</a> and Game Freak's <em>Beast of Reincarnation</em>.</p>
<p>Assuming this info is correct, then <em>Forza Horizon 6 </em>will be launching on May 19th on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2483190/Forza_Horizon_6/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/forza-horizon-6" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a>, with a PS5 launch to follow later in 2026. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
