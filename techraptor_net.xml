            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dauntless-shutting-down-in-may<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Phoenix Labs has announced that multiplayer monster-hunting action RPG&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>will shut down in May, and while the studio hasn't given a concrete reason for the game shutting down, it's easy to guess why it's happening.</p>

<p>In a rather terse&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/331370/view/503943474819631342" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message</a> on Steam, Phoenix Labs simply says that&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>will shut down on May 29th and that it will receive "no additional content or updates". From May 29th, you'll no longer be able to play&nbsp;<em>Dauntless</em>.</p>

<p>It sounds like not only will there be no new content after the shutdown (naturally), but that the game won't be getting any major updates before then, either. In short,&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>is basically a dead game walking at this point.</p>

Well, while Phoenix Labs doesn't give a reason (in either the official announcement or in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dauntless/comments/1ix9232/its_finally_over/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a Discord message</a> sent to players, apparently), we can make a very strong educated guess.</p>

<p>A quick look at&nbsp;<em>Dauntless</em>' Steam numbers (via <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/331370/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, as usual) shows an active player count of just 61, with 107 players checking into the game over the last 24 hours. It's clear players aren't exactly flocking to&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>right now.</p>

<p>A major reason for that is likely the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dauntless-awakening-update-apology" rel="nofollow">controversial Awakening update</a>, which was released in December and which quickly drew the ire of players.&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>fans criticized the update's approach to monetization and progression, among other things.</p>

<p>Following the Awakening update's poor reception, Phoenix Labs <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dauntless-developer-phoenix-labs-more-layoffs" rel="nofollow">laid off "the majority" of its staff</a>, leaving the future of games like&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm&nbsp;</em>uncertain. Now, the future of at least one of those games is a lot clearer.</p>




<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm</em>, it's unclear whether support will continue for the cozy farming sim. Phoenix Labs isn't shutting down just yet, after all, although things aren't looking good for the studio.</p>

<p>In the meantime, if you need a monster hunting fix, you might want to check in with Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, which launches later this week. Our own Tyler <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/monster-hunter-wilds-review-new-frontier" rel="nofollow">was impressed with the game</a>, so it might well fill that&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>hole for you.</p>
