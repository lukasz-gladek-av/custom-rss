            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Dust To Damnation is a new mini-campaign from the team at <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6d404c6b-162e-45bc-be64-2ca3cd9efba5" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/crooked-moon-review-incredibly-spooky-adventure-that-dms-will-love" rel="nofollow">Legends of Avantris</a>. Stepping into <em>Daggerheart </em>this wild-west themed campaign brings with it the deep story and the deeply funny that you'd come to expect from this group. As the campaign has been releasing I got to sit down with DM Mikey Gilder to understand how he built the world and get his thoughts on <em>Daggerheart</em>.</p>

<p>"Dust To Damnation is our three part (six episode) <em>Daggerheart </em>mini-campaign. It's a campaign in the Colossus of the Drylands campaign frame. It follows the folk of a town called Eden." Gilder introduced me to the plot. The Colossus of the Drylands campaign frame is one that the <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="951117a2-07e4-403b-b1c3-26041d599e45" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/daggerheart-review-narrative-forward-yes-and-ttrpg-that-is-force-to-be-reckoned" rel="nofollow">Daggerheart Core Rulebook</a></em> describes as a mix between Red Dead Redemption and Shadow of the Colossus or Attack On Titan.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In <em>Daggerheart,&nbsp;</em>a Campaign Frame is a setting that an adventure might take place in. You can play <em>Daggerheart </em>in a traditional high-fantasy setting, but there are also pre-made Campaign Frames that lean into grimmdark concepts, the weird west, or a setting where your party will cook the monsters you kill.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"It starts with the Sheriff returning after a long time away. [Shephard] is coming back to the town and a lot has changed and he finds out as soon as he is back that his deputy has been murdered and that kicks off the primary action."</p>

<p>There are a number of campaign frames included in the <em>Daggerheart </em>Core rules so I was interested to know if this had been picked for them as they were partnering with Darrington Press, or if there was something in particular about the setting that really spoke to him. Gilder revealed that he hadn't always been the planned DM for this adventure.</p>
<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed//LBZciFpxQNk"></iframe></p>

<p>"We knew the general scope, three sessions as a mini-campaign, but I wasn't originally going to GM it. Either Andy or Derek was going to GM it. Then we were reading through the Campaign frames, and I haven't GM'd in a very long time and so I decided to come out of my pseudo-retirement because the Campaing Frame was just so compelling."</p>

<p>This production was a combined effort of Darrington Press, publisher of <em>Daggerheart</em>, and Legends of Avantris. Talking on how the partnership came up Gilder explained that this has been a long time coming.</p>

<p>"We have been talking to the folks at Darrington and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d74413d3-67d3-4bdf-af02-6270f155a945" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/critical-role-campaign-4-cast-interview-character-creation-incorrect-fan-collages" rel="nofollow">Critical Role</a> for a while now, and we always knew we were going to partner together," Gilder alluded to different meetings at conventions that had been going on. "Once <em>Daggerheart </em>was officially out there we decided a sponsored mini-campaign was the best place to start."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"We told [Critical Role] we can tell tight storied in 3-5 sessions, it was pretty much a no brainer"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Speaking to his love of the Wild West Gilder highlighted classic movies as well as series like Deadwood. "That [love of Western's] combined with the giant colossi, it was a pretty obvious choice for me to do it. I read through it once and I immediately knew what I wanted to do and that really goes to show the strength of the Campaign Frame."</p>

<p>Having reviewed and played <em>Daggerheart </em>when it released earlier this year I was clue'd in to the colossus that roam this setting but watching the mini-campaign an unaware viewer might not know what to expect. "I decided to not go really super hard into the whole colossus stuff, and then build up into it. So we could focus on a smaller human story and then build up towards the colossus and the massive stakes that are part of the campaign frame."</p>

<p>Gilder also commented that they weren't entirely sure how their group would get along with the system but they wanted to create an experience for viewers that might be shared with their table's first time playing <em>Daggerheart</em>. "It was very deliberate that we didn't spend a lot of time studying."</p>

We've gotten into some systems, and not cared for others." Gilder spoke about the group's history "<em>Daggerheart </em>really clicked with us extremely quickly, three of us had gotten a demo [...] then when we sat down and all of the extra addons, the cheat sheet and the cards made it easier to play the game."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"We were very surprised at how useful the peripherals were and how easy it is to just dive in"</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Building The Town Of Eden</h2>

<p>Throughout the exploration of the starting town of the adventure, Eden, I immediately fell in love with the different characters. Each exactly as you'd expect from Western movies, but with a <em>Daggerheart </em>twist. I was interested to learn more about how Gilder populated the world.</p>

<p>"This is, in part, a huge loveletter to David Milch who is the creator of Deadwood and the actors and writers involved in that show and I think that's a huge reason why I got into storytelling and narrative." Gilder explained "The way that I approach story is very archetypical. The tropes that you expect in a genre I think are really important."</p>

<p>"It was me getting to pick the fun archetypes and tropes, and characters from Deadwood that I loved that I could plug in and do my version of a rough impression. When I don't have an impression it's still going to the archetype of a school teacher and really making sure that I approach the theme and turn it up to 11 so you IMMEDIATELY felt like you were in a weird west setting."</p>

<p>Diving deeper into some of the mechanics of <em>Daggerheart,&nbsp;</em>I spoke with Gilder about the different outcomes of checks in <em>Daggerheart</em>, not just being pass/fail but that you can have a success where you don't get everything you want, and a failure where something good can happen. I wanted to get Gilder's thoughts on this different approach to rolling outcomes.</p>

<p>"It is certainly more cognitive load, I will say, that general thrust of complications and varying degrees of success is an aspect that I bounced off of on other systems like PBTA but I think that <em>Daggerheart </em>does it in a way where the GM is still equipped to adjust and tweak."</p>

<p>Gilder spoke highly of the options given not only to the player but also the GM "It equipped me to be like 'oh wait, you succeeded with hope, I have GM fiat to then really make this awesome victory that you had'" Gilder jokes that a lot of other systems try to take those overly large victories away with additional rules.</p>

<p>On the flip side a success with fear does a lot to empower the GM too. "Even if they hit the bad guy, then I get a fear and the spotlight shifts to me and I can spend that Fear on something else. That was one of the bigger aspects of the system, especially if you've only played Dungeons &amp; Dragons."</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avantris-daggerheart-dust-to-damnation01.jpg?itok=GipisK_u 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avantris-daggerheart-dust-to-damnation01.jpg?itok=6cpPhRWb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Gilder did highlight that his use for fear, joking that it might not be the 'right' way to GM <em>Daggerheart </em>was to "not use Fear in non-combat scenarios. When it comes to roleplay that's where it's very natural for us. For me building up the fear and having really brutal and terrifying combat, spending as much as I can at the beginning to make it scary. Then if I don't generate anymore and the players come and wipe out the adversary that's narratively valid."</p>

<h2>The Key To A Strong One-Shot Start</h2>

<p>Watching along with the stream I was enthralled from the getgo, I was interested to hear from Gilder what his guiding principal was when creating a mini-campaign or one-shot that hits the ground running.</p>

<p>"My secret to success is effectively the buy in from the players, basically this is the scene and you're introduced, and you're introduced, and you're introduced," Gilder explained counting off his castmates. "Nikki and Derek, who play Quibly and Portia Bella, they sat there for like an hour and a half while we introduced them."</p>

<p>"If they're meeting for the first time you need to have a plan of how you're going to drive the story forward. In a one-shot, when you have less time, it needs to be GM driven and you need to keep your foot on the gas. You're drawn into the call to action so there's no debate as to what to do and there's no back and forth which can eat up a lot of time at the table."</p>

<p>Every good campaign needs a good villain so I was also eager to have Gilder explain his philosophy behind creating one. "That is my favorite part of GMing, it's the villains. I think when it comes to creating a good villain I've never been a fan of the dark lord in the tower."</p>

<p>"I think that having that human connection is really important. You don't need a ton, but I think it's really important when you only have one scene before the final confrontation and I think as long as you make sure you tie into the antagonist into what they represent and you present that very clearly and present the direct conflict it feels very personal."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Even if you have one scene that builds up 'bad guy must pay' that does so much for building that investment for players."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Being a fan of TTRPGs I know what I like behind my GM screen and I know there's hundreds of different ways to approach what tools you use. I was interested to hear what it was that Gilder keeps behind his GM screen to run Dust To Damnation.</p>

<p>"I have a very ramshackle vibe behind the screen, I really just have the PDF open, and what I do is I have a google drive with screenshots of relevant sections that I might need." Gilder waved a finger in the air pointing to imaginary reference material "Then I have printed out a GM cheat sheet. Then just having your stat blocks where you can get them and scrap paper and a pen."</p>

<p>"Our production, despite how much we've grown, it isn't super polished," Gilder joked, "We don't have all of these miniatures or terrain; we have a Chessex Battle Map and bottle caps with tokens that are highly readable."</p>

<p>Explaining further Gilder likes the idea of putting the basics out on the table, for the players and fans at home to be able to fill in the finer details of any encounter.</p>
