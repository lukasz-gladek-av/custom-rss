            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-1m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Warhorse Studios has announced that&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>sales have already topped a major milestone, even though the game has only been available for a day.</p>

<p>The Czech developer's latest action RPG <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-moved-forward" rel="nofollow">launched yesterday</a> across PC and consoles, but it's already managed to hit a million sales, according to a <a href="https://x.com/WarhorseStudios/status/1887155255130866099" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the official Warhorse X account.</p>

<p>In the post, Warhorse thanks&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>players for "stepp[ing] into our world" and says it's "beyond grateful" for the support it's received so far, calling its game a "triumph". With sales numbers like that, it's hard to disagree.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-1m-artwork.jpg?itok=rmcvlmQ3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-1m-artwork.jpg?itok=-nUN7D57 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>has already sold a million copies.</figcaption></figure><p>The popularity of&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>probably shouldn't come as much of a surprise; Warhorse has clearly put a lot of effort into the game, especially if the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-script-words" rel="nofollow">sheer size and density of its script</a> is anything to go by.</p>

<p>Despite its impressive sales figures, <i>Deliverance 2&nbsp;</i>hasn't been without its fair share of controversy. Prior to release, the game was subject to rumors that it would be banned in Saudi Arabia due to "unskippable" gay romance scenes, claims that game director&nbsp;Daniel Vávra <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-rumors-director" rel="nofollow">shot down in no uncertain terms</a>.</p>

<p>Nevertheless,&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>has attracted a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1771300/Kingdom_Come_Deliverance_II/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Very Positive rating</a> on Steam so far across 5,660 reviews (at time of writing), with players praising the game's presentation, narrative, and improvements over its predecessor.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>is, it's the sequel to 2018's medieval action RPG&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em>. Like its predecessor, the game is an open-ended RPG set in 15th-century Bohemia.</p>




<p>You'll once again play as blacksmith's son Henry of Skalitz, navigating a (relatively) historically accurate world of political intrigue. Since&nbsp;<em>Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>emphasizes realism and historical detail, don't expect to see any dragons or goblins around Bohemia.</p>

<p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1771300/Kingdom_Come_Deliverance_II/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/9n4w31hsmvvd" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-the-veilguard-shared-world-elements<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has released a new financial earnings call for the third quarter of the 2024-25 fiscal year, and in the call, CEO Andrew Wilson expresses what appears to be a theory as to why&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>flopped.</p>

<p>Recently, EA <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-ea-sports-fc-25-underperformed" rel="nofollow">admitted</a> that <i>Veilguard&nbsp;</i>and flagship sports game&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC 25&nbsp;</em>had both "underperformed", and in the new <a href="https://s204.q4cdn.com/701424631/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/Q3-FY25-Earnings-Call-Transcript-FINAL.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">call</a>, Wilson seems to draw a link between&nbsp;<em>Veilguard</em>'s failure and its lack of "shared world elements".</p>

<p>He says EA's games need to "directly connect" to players, who he says "increasingly seek shared world features and deeper engagement". That's likely a reference to&nbsp;<em>Veilguard</em>'s nature as a single-player-only title, rather than a game with multiplayer elements.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-flop-live-service-ea-archery.jpg?itok=2SNx5ha0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-flop-live-service-ea-archery.jpg?itok=Hahr8U2D 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>EA seems to think&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>flopped because it had no "shared world elements".</figcaption></figure><p>At one stage, it was <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-past-and-present-of-dragon-age-4-1833913351" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reported</a>&nbsp;that a version of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>(which didn't have its name yet at this point) which would incorporate live service elements was in development.</p>

<p>However, this version was subsequently scrapped (assuming the reports of its existence are correct), leading to&nbsp;<em>The Veilguard</em>'s single-player focus. It seems that EA's management now regrets getting rid of those live service elements.</p>

<p>There is, of course, no guarantee that&nbsp;<em>Veilguard&nbsp;</em>would have performed any better if it did have the "shared world" elements EA seems so wistful about. After all,&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC 25&nbsp;</em>is undeniably a live service title, and it, too, underperformed.</p>

<p>Wilson, however, puts this down to people sticking with previous&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC&nbsp;</em>titles and not buying the new one, as well as "lower-than-expected engagement" due to "specific issues with balance".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ea-sports-fc-25-underperformed-play.jpg?itok=aO4FZa9y 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ea-sports-fc-25-underperformed-play.jpg?itok=T3jxwU9x 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>EA Sports FC 25</em>'s underperformance had nothing to do with live service, but&nbsp;<em>Veilguard</em>'s apparently did. Hmm.</figcaption></figure><p>I can't imagine that many of the people who felt dissatisfied with&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>would have been happier if the game had featured the "shared world elements" EA regrets not putting in, honestly.</p>

<p>It's hard to imagine that direction would have prevented the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioware-layoffs-veilguard-failure" rel="nofollow">BioWare layoffs that followed</a>, nor the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/veilguard-director-corinne-busche-leaving-bioware" rel="nofollow">departure</a> of <i>Veilguard&nbsp;</i>director Corinne Busche from the studio.</p>

<p>In any case, EA is probably looking very carefully at the next&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect&nbsp;</em>game now. I'd be very surprised indeed if the publisher didn't try to ensure that some sort of "shared world elements" are present in that game, so we'll have to see how&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect 4&nbsp;</em>(name obviously not final) performs.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the call, EA confirms that the next&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>game will be launching in 2026 and reaffirms that you can sign up to get a chance to test it right now via the new <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-labs-announced-ea" rel="nofollow">Battlefield Labs initiative</a>.</p>

<p>The company also commits to a new $1 billion share buyback scheme, which feels like exactly the kind of thing you'd expect from a studio that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-ceo-25-million-income-layoffs" rel="nofollow">paid its CEO $25 million in 2023</a> despite hundreds of layoffs. Stay tuned for more.</p>
