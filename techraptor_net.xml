            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-marine-2-2025-outline-pvp<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>publisher Focus Entertainment has shared what's coming to the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k&nbsp;</em>shooter in 2025, and if you're a fan of the PvP game modes, you'll be pleased with the roadmap.</p>

<p>In a new <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/135-december-community-update" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">December community update</a>, Focus first looks at the last few months for&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>, highlighting things like major updates and the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-player-count-5m" rel="nofollow">rather impressive sales figures</a>.</p>

<p>Following the 2024 recap, Focus then moves onto highlighting what you can expect from next year in&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>, and the first thing on the agenda is more PvP content. The publisher says it knows PvP fans feel "left out", and so next year will bring a new map, custom lobbies, and more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/space-marine-2-pvp-content-roadmap-2025-fight.jpg?itok=dtcfyyLb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/space-marine-2-pvp-content-roadmap-2025-fight.jpg?itok=Zq_a15T3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Focus Entertainment knows&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>PvP fans feel "left out" right now.</figcaption></figure><p>New PvE stuff is also coming next year, starting with the Horde mode, which was teased back when&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>'s first post-launch roadmap was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-roadmap" rel="nofollow">revealed in late August</a>. New Operations and enemies are also on the way for you to tackle.</p>

<p>We also got a look at the next champion making his way to&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>, and it's a Salamander sniper. Focus acknowledges that the Raven Guard Chapter would have been "an obvious choice" for a sniper, but that the studio has "different plans" for the Raven Guard.</p>

<p>More customization options are also coming, alongside a new Datavault option on the Battle Barge. It'll allow you to read "unlockable information on most elements from the game", in case you want to brush up on your&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>lore.</p>




<p>In case you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>, it's a third-person shooter set in the grim darkness of the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k&nbsp;</em>universe.</p>

<p>The game sees protagonist Demetrian Titus returning from the first game. Having spent time with the Deathwatch in order to prove himself free of heresy, Titus is re-inducted into the Ultramarines and tasked with eradicating a Tyrannid infestation on the planet Kadaku.</p>

<p>Like its predecessor,&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>emphasizes both close-quarters combat and ranged weaponry, and it's also got a renewed focus on co-op play. Fittingly enough, its credits also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-credits-totalbiscuit" rel="nofollow">feature a rather touching tribute</a> to a man who championed the original title.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Item Shop Management Sim Recettear Is Getting an HD Remaster Next Year]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/recettear-hd-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/item-shop-management-sim-recettear-is-getting-an-hd-remaster-next-year.1071294/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/recettear-hd-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EasyGameStation has announced&nbsp;<em>Recettear HD</em>, a remastered version of the cult classic 2007 item shop management sim that's coming next year.</p>

<p>Right now, we don't know a lot about the project. In <a href="https://x.com/Recettear_EGS/status/1873564667366506965" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an announcement post</a> on social media platform X (for which we're using machine translation), EasyGameStation simply says "we will open an item shop again in 2025", ending the post with the hashtag #RecettearHD.</p>

<p>Given the project's name, we're assuming it's not a ground-up remake of the game, but rather a remastered version for modern systems. Presumably, that also means we'll be seeing it on consoles, although it's difficult to say at this early stage.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/recettear-hd-remaster-2025-dungeon.jpg?itok=RTTQRLD5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/recettear-hd-remaster-2025-dungeon.jpg?itok=5v_BVVSw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Recettear HD&nbsp;</em>is coming sometime next year.</figcaption></figure><p>The screenshots released so far for the game include a shot of Recette standing in her item shop, as well as an adventurer exploring a dungeon and battling slimes.</p>

<p>In the first shot, we can see controller glyphs that somewhat resemble those of the Nintendo Switch, although all we've got to go on right now are an "A" and a "Y", which could also easily refer to Xbox controller glyphs.</p>

<p>We also don't yet know whether this version of the game will be localized outside of Japan, although one social media post seems to suggest that this will indeed be the case.</p>

<p>Andrew Dice, the founder of&nbsp;<em>Recettear&nbsp;</em>localization studio Carpe Fulgur, noted&nbsp;<em>Recettear HD</em>'s <a href="https://x.com/SpaceDrakeCF/status/1873584405652062392" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement on X</a>, promising more info "in the year to come". If Carpe Fulgur is involved, then it's very likely we will be seeing&nbsp;<em>Recettear HD&nbsp;</em>in the West.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/recettear-hd-remaster-2025-shop.jpg?itok=iq_StUKf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/recettear-hd-remaster-2025-shop.jpg?itok=wPFfYfby 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Recettear HD&nbsp;</em>looks like it'll be coming to the West, and probably to consoles as well.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with the original&nbsp;<em>Recettear</em>, it's an item shop management sim-slash-dungeon crawler along the lines of&nbsp;<em>Moonlighter&nbsp;</em>(which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/moonlighter-2-announced-2025" rel="nofollow">is itself getting a sequel next year</a>), although it's much more light-hearted and satirical than Digital Sun's game.</p>

<p><em>Recettear&nbsp;</em>revolves around Recette Lemongrass, a girl who must pay back a loan on behalf of her father by running an item shop. She must haggle with customers, send adventurers out on epic quests to retrieve loot, and generally deal with the vagaries of JRPG capitalism.</p>

<p><em>Recettear HD&nbsp;</em>lands sometime next year, although we don't know when or where yet. The original version is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/70400/Recettear_An_Item_Shops_Tale/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, and it's currently up for grabs at a tidy discount as well.</p>
