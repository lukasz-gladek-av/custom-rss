            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/terminator-2d-no-fate-sidescroller-september<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Reef Entertainment and developer Bitmap Bureau have announced&nbsp;<em>Terminator 2D: No Fate</em>, a gritty sidescroller in which you must put a stop to the T-1000 and foil Skynet's plans before the human race is destroyed.</p>

<p>The game will allow you to play as either Sarah Connor or Arnold Schwarzenegger's T-800 as you fight to stop the shapeshifting android, memorably played by Robert Patrick in&nbsp;<em>Terminator 2: Judgment Day</em> (and in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortal-kombat-1-t-1000-dlc-release-date" rel="nofollow">upcoming&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1&nbsp;</em>DLC</a>).</p>

<p><em>Terminator 2D: No Fate</em>'s story will blend "iconic scenes" from the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Terminator 2&nbsp;</em>with "original scenarios and multiple endings", which sounds like a rather unique mixture.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/terminator-2d-no-fate-truck-chase.jpg?itok=QITciBWm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/terminator-2d-no-fate-truck-chase.jpg?itok=nA9hX4xL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Several iconic&nbsp;<em>Terminator 2&nbsp;</em>scenes are recreated in&nbsp;<em>Terminator 2D: No Fate</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>In the trailer, we can see&nbsp;<em>Terminator 2&nbsp;</em>scenes like Sarah Connor working out in her hospital room, Arnie's T-800 duking it out with thugs in a dingy bar, and, of course, that iconic truck chase sequence.</p>

<p>We also see how the gameplay will work, and it looks like&nbsp;<em>Terminator 2D: No Fate&nbsp;</em>will take on a sort of&nbsp;<em>Contra</em>-style run-and-gun feel; we can see Connor snap-aiming in various directions,&nbsp;<em>Contra</em>-style, as well as lots of fast-paced action rendered in crisp pixel art.</p>

<p>Overall,&nbsp;<em>Terminator 2D: No Fate&nbsp;</em>has a pretty pleasing SNES and Genesis-era feel to it, right down to the continue screen, which feels like exactly the kind of thing a licensed&nbsp;<em>Terminator&nbsp;</em>game would have sported back in the 90s.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Terminator 2D: No Fate&nbsp;</em>here. It's even got a fun reworked version of the classic&nbsp;<em>Terminator&nbsp;</em>theme for you to enjoy. Good luck getting that one out of your head once it's in there.</p>




<p><em>Terminator 2D: No Fate&nbsp;</em>isn't the only video game based on the&nbsp;<em>Terminator&nbsp;</em>series that's set to launch in the (hopefully near!) future.</p>

<p>There's also Nacon's&nbsp;<em>Terminator: Survivors</em>, which, as its name suggests, is a survival game in which you must make sense of humanity's near-extinction at the hands of Skynet, scavenging for resources and navigating an irrevocably changed world.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we don't know when that one's coming out; it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/terminator-survivors-early-access-release" rel="nofollow">delayed to an unspecified point in 2025</a> back in August, although it's more than possible we'll hear something about it during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nacon-connect-2025-announced" rel="nofollow">next week's Nacon Connect presentation</a>.</p>

<p>In the meantime,&nbsp;<em>Terminator 2D: No Fate&nbsp;</em>launches across PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch on September 5th. Stay tuned for more.</p>
