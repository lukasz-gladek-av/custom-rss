            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Amazon has announced that it's introducing a major rework for its Luna streaming service later this year, including a brand new focus on social gaming and more.</p>

<p>Per a press release, the new Luna will focus more on the casual crowd; Amazon says Prime members have told it that "they want games to be a way to bring friends and family together", and so the multinational giant decided to "reimagine Luna".</p>

<p>The new version of the service will "combine innovative social party games with amazing blockbusters", and it's all built around a new feature Amazon is calling GameNight, which will be displayed when you boot up Luna on your smart device.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/amazon-luna-rework-family.jpg?itok=n0CxVtY3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/amazon-luna-rework-family.jpg?itok=ElURt_K_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Amazon Luna is rebuilding itself to be more family-oriented.</figcaption></figure><p>GameNight is essentially Amazon's version of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/jackbox-games-10-years-of-laughing-quipping-and-fibbing" rel="nofollow">the&nbsp;<em>Jackbox&nbsp;</em>series</a>; it'll launch with "more than 25 approachable multiplayer games", including adaptations of existing titles and "GameNight-optimized takes on favorites like&nbsp;<em>Angry Birds</em>,&nbsp;<em>Draw &amp; Guess</em>,&nbsp;<em>Exploding Kittens</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Flappy Golf Party</em>".</p>

<p>In addition, the service will arrive with a new exclusive game featuring none other than Snoop Dogg himself.&nbsp;<em>Courtroom Chaos: Starring Snoop Dogg&nbsp;</em>is described as a "human-built, AI-powered improv courtroom game" in which you must defend your testimony before the Doggfather.</p>

<p>If you're concerned that Luna will be losing its library of more core audience-focused games, you needn't be. Amazon says the reworked Luna will also include "more than 50 popular classic, indie, and blockbuster games".</p>

<p>The likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hogwarts-legacy" rel="nofollow"><em>Hogwarts Legacy</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/indiana-jones-and-great-circle" rel="nofollow"><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em></a>, and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii" rel="nofollow">Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</a>&nbsp;</em>will be available at launch, and a "rotating library" of games will be introduced to the service as time goes on as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-reworked-amazon-luna.jpg?itok=mezYAp6I 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-reworked-amazon-luna.jpg?itok=B1gOVq5Y 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II&nbsp;</em>is one of more than 50 games that will be included with the reworked Amazon Luna.</figcaption></figure><p>All of this comes with a Prime membership at no extra cost, but you can also specifically pony up a little bit more for Luna Premium, granting you access to "more blockbuster titles".</p>

<p>You'll need a controller to play the aforementioned core titles, but the GameNight lineup can be enjoyed without one; you'll be using your smartphone to play those games, so you won't need to buy anything extra.</p>

<p>Amazon's Luna rework launches sometime later this year. We don't have a release date for it yet, so stay tuned for more on this one.</p>
