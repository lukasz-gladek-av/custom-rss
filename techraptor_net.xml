<p>The aptly-named&nbsp;Americas Animal Pack<em>&nbsp;</em>follows on from previous&nbsp;<em>Planet Zoo&nbsp;</em>DLCs focused around various other <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-planet-zoo-expansion" rel="nofollow">regions</a> of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/planet-zoo-dlc-pack-adds-southeast-asian-animals-aplenty" rel="nofollow">world</a>, adding seven new animals for you to put in your zoo, as well as lots of new scenery items and more.</p>

<p>First up, this DLC brings what is perhaps the most iconic American animal of all time in the form of the coyote, which "can run up to 40 miles per hour", according to Frontier. Hopefully, it'll find a happy home in your zoo.</p>

<p>Five more animals are included as part of this pack as well: the greater rhea, the white-faced saki, the American flamingo, the bush dog, and the Bighorn sheep. As Frontier says, these animals "showcase some of the diverse and rich wildlife that makes the Americas so unique".</p>

<p>As well as the above animals, you'll also find more than 80 new scenery pieces to put in your zoo to help your guests feel more at home, including new fabric flags, ironwork lamps, and paper fans.</p>

<p>A brand new campaign scenario will also be made available in which you'll be able to learn about the animals included as part of the DLC. You'll be helping "the notorious Dominic Myers" transform his public image and build a successful zoo in Central America.</p>




<p><em>Planet Zoo</em>'s&nbsp;Americas Animal Pack DLC will be available on April 15th <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3473820/Planet_Zoo_Americas_Animal_Pack/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on Steam</a>, although no release date has yet been revealed for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/planet-zoo-ps5-xbox-announcement" rel="nofollow">console versions</a> of the game. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sonic Rumble Release Date Revealed for May]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-rumble-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sonic-rumble-release-date-revealed-for-may.1158228/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-rumble-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega has announced the release date for upcoming free-to-play party game&nbsp;<em>Sonic Rumble</em>, which is due to hit Steam and mobile devices next month.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/04/sonic-rumble-launches-may-8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gematsu</a>,&nbsp;<em>Sonic Rumble&nbsp;</em>will be arriving on May 8th, and pre-registrations are open right now on mobile platforms. You'll unlock more rewards the more pre-registrations Sega gets, so if you want some&nbsp;<em>Sonic Rumble&nbsp;</em>goodies, be sure to add your name to your platform's list.</p>

<p>Pre-registration rewards include bonus rings, a Chao sticker, and skins for various characters, including a crystallized "Garnet Knuckles" skin and a look for Sonic himself based on the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-the-hedgehog-movies-1b-box-office" rel="nofollow">hugely successful Paramount movies</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sonic-rumble-release-date-death-egg.jpg?itok=TWU7rMKo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sonic-rumble-release-date-death-egg.jpg?itok=nFOAhjkL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Sonic Rumble&nbsp;</em>is officially coming in May.</figcaption></figure><p>In case you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Sonic Rumble&nbsp;</em>is, it's essentially the&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog&nbsp;</em>franchise's take on the likes of&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys</em>; it's a 32-player battle royale in which you and your fellow players must take part in "chaotic survival battles".</p>

<p>Several game modes will be available in&nbsp;<em>Sonic Rumble</em>. As you'd expect, there's a Run mode in which you must race against your opponents to win, and you'll also be able to battle against your rivals in Survival mode.</p>

<p>Sega says the idea behind&nbsp;<em>Sonic Rumble&nbsp;</em>is that matches are "short, so anyone can pick [the game] up and play in their spare time".</p>

<p>Playable characters include Sonic (of course), Tails, Knuckles, and Amy Rose, as well as Shadow and Dr. Eggman. Several other characters from across the&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>series will also be available for you to play as.</p>




<p><em>Sonic Rumble</em>'s release comes after what has been a pretty successful year for Sonic. A fourth&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>movie has already been greenlit and is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-hedgehog-4-movie-march-2027" rel="nofollow">set for a 2027 release</a>, and latest mainline entry&nbsp;<em>Sonic x Shadow Generations&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-x-shadow-generations-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">crossed two million sales</a> back in January.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Sonic Rumble&nbsp;</em>when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2951690/Sonic_Rumble/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and mobile devices on May 8th.</p>
