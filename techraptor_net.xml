            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/esa-trump-tariffs-comments<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Entertainment Software Association (ESA), the gaming industry's major trade body in the US, has urged the Trump administration to "consult with the private sector" regarding incoming tariffs on foreign-imported goods.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/ethangach/status/1886390949091123378" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">statement</a> shared with Kotaku's Ethan Gach, the ESA says that tariffs on gaming hardware and products would "impact Americans of all ages" and that they could cause "significant harm to everyday Americans", as well as to the gaming industry itself.</p>

<p>The ESA goes on to urge Trump and his administration to "consult with the private sector in a transparent process" to avoid causing such harm to both Americans and "one of the fastest-growing entertainment sectors in the US".</p>

<p>Specifically, Trump will impose a 25% tariff on Mexican- and Canadian-made goods, with a 10% tariff being slapped on Chinese-made products. This is, of course, a problem for companies that import their goods from those countries.</p>

<p>Many gaming consoles and peripherals are made in China, and as the BBC points out in the above-linked story, economists say that import hikes for companies are usually passed on to consumers in the form of increased prices.</p>

<p>This means that for a console as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-pro-announced-november" rel="nofollow">eye-wateringly expensive as the PS5 Pro</a>, for instance, you could expect to pay significantly more in future, which could in turn lead to fewer consoles and accessories being purchased on the whole.</p>

<p>Of course, that would also probably mean a price hike for digital games in order to ensure parity between the two media types.</p>

<p>It's impossible to predict exactly what's going to happen at this stage, but the ESA is spooked enough to call on Trump and his administration to discuss the matter further with the gaming sector. Whether they do or not is another matter entirely. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvelous-story-of-seasons-leadership-change<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Marvelous, the studio behind franchises like&nbsp;<em>Story of Seasons&nbsp;</em>(formerly&nbsp;<em>Harvest Moon</em>) and&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory</em>, has announced a change in leadership owing to its poor financial performance over the last nine months.</p>

<p>Per an Automaton Media <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/rune-factory-developer-marvelous-announces-change-in-leadership-and-executive-pay-cuts-due-to-companys-recent-weak-performance/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, the studio recently published its financial results for the first three quarters of the 2024-25 fiscal year, and sales and net profit are both down (by 4.8% and 12.4% respectively) when compared to the same period last year.</p>

<p>As a result, current CEO Sato Suminobu will step down from his position in March, although he'll remain a director at the company. He'll be replaced as company CEO by Shinichi Terui, who's currently serving as an executive director at Marvelous.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvelous-leadership-change-poor-performance-farmagia.jpg?itok=lLnr2z0q 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvelous-leadership-change-poor-performance-farmagia.jpg?itok=FshC_X8D 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Games like November's&nbsp;<em>Farmagia&nbsp;</em>failed to make enough of a dent to improve Marvelous' finances, it seems.</figcaption></figure><p>In the <a href="https://gamebiz.jp/news/400065" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gamebiz</a> report that Automaton cites (for which we're using machine translation), it also sounds as though both Sato and Terui will receive 10% pay cuts, although Automaton says these cuts will apply to "two full-time executives" rather than the two named employees.</p>

<p>As Automaton points out, Marvelous released two major projects in the nine-month period between April and December 2024, namely farming RPG&nbsp;<em>Farmagia&nbsp;</em>and a re-release of the remake of&nbsp;<em>Story of Seasons: Friends of Mineral Town</em>.</p>

<p>The latter, according to Marvelous, performed "steadily", but there's no indication as to how the former did. Given the change in leadership and&nbsp;<em>Farmagia</em>'s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2508770/Farmagia/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">terminally low Steam review count</a>, however, it's unlikely the game sold particularly well.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that a new&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory&nbsp;</em>game,&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em>, is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-release-date" rel="nofollow">coming in May</a>, but since Marvelous' financial year ends in March, the game won't be released in time for it to affect the studio's 2024-25 fiscals.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-marvelous.jpg?itok=iFi4KA4E 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-marvelous.jpg?itok=1Dld7TmK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Marvelous is gearing up to release&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma&nbsp;</em>in March.</figcaption></figure><p>It remains to be seen whether Marvelous' change in leadership will affect how the company operates, as well as whether it'll turn the studio's fortunes around. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things Marvelous.</p>
