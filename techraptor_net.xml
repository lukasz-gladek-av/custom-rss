            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has officially announced a new <em>Life Is Strange </em>game, <em>Life Is Strange: Reunion</em>, and it will (as the name suggests) reunite Chloe and Max when it launches in just a couple of months.</p><p>Ahead of a livestream, Xbox officially unveiled the name, direction, and release date for <em>Life Is Strange: Reunion </em>in an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/20/life-is-strange-reunion-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Wire blog post</a>. It's coming to PC and Xbox Series X|S (and, presumably, other platforms) on March 26th.</p><p>The goal, according to the <em>Life Is Strange </em>team, is to give Chloe and Max "the ending they deserve" and to provide a "thrilling finale" to the stories of both characters in a reunion "thought impossible". Be aware that spoilers for <em>Life Is Strange </em>and its sequels may follow.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Life Is Strange: Reunion </em>serves as a...well...you get the gist.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If you're wondering how Chloe was able to return after the events of the original <em>Life Is Strange</em>, well, the team says it "may be due to Max's power", making reference to the conclusion of 2024's episodic<em> Double Exposure</em>, in which Max merged parallel timelines and recovered her Rewind ability.</p><p>Chloe, however, is "no prize to be won", as the <em>Life Is Strange </em>folks say; she's her own woman, which is why she'll be the co-protagonist of this game alongside Max.</p><p>They'll be trying to find their way back to each other over the course of <em>Reunion</em>, each offering "alternating views of the world" and "different-but-complementary perspectives" on the events of the story.</p><p>Once again, Max is able to rewind time, a power she'll be using to both escape and get herself into some pretty tricky situations. Chloe's Backtalk ability returns, too, allowing her to smart-talk her conversation partners.</p><figure role="group">

Well, Wizards of the Coast certainly hopes you are, although the new crossover between the two may not be what you're expecting.</p><p>In a press release, the two companies reveal that the collaboration, which brings on board top <em>Fortnite </em>creators Chartis and Teravision Games, consists of a series of officially-licensed user-made islands.</p><p>There are five in total, and Wizards of the Coast says they're the beginning of a so-called "launch and learn" initiative designed to "explore how <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons </em>can connect with a diverse range of <em>Fortnite </em>players in fun and meaningful ways".</p><figure role="group">

<p>You can find a range of diverse <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons </em>experiences here, so if you were looking for something less harrowing than, say, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-crossovers-spinoffs" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="13a381b8-0cb3-4fe5-b193-19ba434b7ab9" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Vecna's appearance in <em>Dead by Daylight</em></a>, these may well be for you. Here's a list of them, plus their codes!</p><ul><li data-list-item-id="e22a3012bb2aa620cbec7144df123e76f">DnD Boxfights (PvP arena): 1190-4691-0255</li><li data-list-item-id="efb570c8173f37198a08693ef5fcfaa93">DnD Treasure RNG (social hub): 4958-2624-5634</li><li data-list-item-id="e606bdfbcf8ccba88de776d606d7c9d0b">DnD Dungeon Deathrun (platforming challenge): 5806-6430-0158</li><li data-list-item-id="e54ae1dd40c6d6e6424d65317a49c4a66">DnD Bossfight (co-op boss encounter): 2218-1049-5866</li><li data-list-item-id="eda5c8e1f4f418264159d3a4c8d68b8d4">DnD Zombie Dragon Adventure (early access co-op roguelike): 2525-9596-3235</li></ul><p>In particular, you may want to try out the latter, because Wizards of the Coast says it's "the largest co-op roguelike in <em>Fortnite </em>history". Not that the studio is bragging or anything.</p><p>Technically speaking, this <em>Fortnite Dungeons &amp; Dragons </em>crossover isn't quite on the same level as some of the behemoth's other collaborations; it's not a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-fortnite-may-2024" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="257a0f0d-29e5-4ad1-8c08-740ddedb88e6" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">full map transformation</a>, and there aren't any official <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons </em>skins coming to the game (just yet, at any rate).</p><figure role="group">

<p>This also isn't the first Hasbro property to make its way to Epic's hugely popular battle royale (and, well, everything else) game; back in 2024, the tabletop giant <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hasbro-board-games-fortnite-clue" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1172df2b-621c-4c83-929c-3dd478063be8" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">introduced the world of <em>Clue</em></a><em> </em>to <em>Fortnite</em>, with other Hasbro properties on the slate as well.</p><p>Whether a full-scale <em>Fortnite </em>crossover with <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons </em>is on the way remains to be seen, but for now, why not check out these islands if you're in the mood for some fantasy fun?
