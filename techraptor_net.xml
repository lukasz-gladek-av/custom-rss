            <title><![CDATA[Xbox Hardware Revenue Still in Freefall, Microsoft Reveals]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft has released its first-quarter fiscal results for the 2025-26 financial year, and Xbox consoles appear to be continuing their sales freefall, although "content and services" revenue is up.</p>

<p>In the company's latest <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2026-Q1/more-personal-computing-performance" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">financial release</a>, Microsoft says its Xbox hardware revenue has dropped by 29% when compared to the same period last year, and given that Xbox hardware sales have been in decline for a while now, that's not good news for the gaming division.</p>

<p>There's a silver lining for Microsoft, though, albeit a very small one; content and services revenue, which includes the company's Game Pass service as well as gaming-related software, increased by (an admittedly paltry) 1%, driven by "growth in Xbox Game Pass and third-party content".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-game-pass-xbox-hardware-revenue-decline.jpg?itok=Nf1aQZo1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-game-pass-xbox-hardware-revenue-decline.jpg?itok=KeapOShe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Game Pass continues to grow, albeit slowly.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that the first quarter of Microsoft's fiscal year covers the period between June and September, so it doesn't take into account the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-tiers-reworked-2025" rel="nofollow">controversial Game Pass changes</a> introduced earlier this month, which saw the price of top tier Ultimate jump to $30 per month.</p>

<p>The data also won't include major Xbox releases for the end of the year, like&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>, the latter of which will almost certainly boost sales in the coming second quarter.</p>

<p>Still, Xbox's continuing console woes don't appear to be deterring the company from continuing to pursue hardware development, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-console-hardware-rumors" rel="nofollow">at least not officially</a>; it's been confirmed that there will be a next-generation Xbox console, and that it's being developed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/next-gen-xbox-hardware-sneak-peek" rel="nofollow">in conjunction with tech company AMD</a>.</p>

<p>Despite that, Xbox is currently chasing a multi-platform strategy, with major releases like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/halo-campaign-evolved-announced-for-2026-coming-to-xbox-series-pc-and-playsation-5" rel="nofollow">Halo</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gears-of-war-reloaded-announced" rel="nofollow">Gears of War</a>&nbsp;</em>no longer confined to Xbox consoles. That's unlikely to change, even when Xbox does eventually release its next machine.</p>




<p>This data also doesn't take into account the newly-released ROG Xbox Ally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rog-xbox-ally-release-date" rel="nofollow">handhelds</a>, although whether they'll be enough to tip the scales and reverse the company's woeful hardware performance is unclear.</p>

<p>Things are looking a little rosier for Microsoft as a whole, however; the software giant <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/fy-2026-q1/press-release-webcast" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reported</a> a revenue increase of 18%, which I'm sure will soothe the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" rel="nofollow">thousands of employees who lost their jobs</a> during the company's latest round of layoffs.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Chief Rebel and publisher Arc Games have revealed The Haunting of Stronghold, the first seasonal event for dungeoneering MMO&nbsp;<em>Fellowship</em>, and it brings spooky cosmetics and more through November.</p>

<p>As revealed in a press release, The Haunting of Stronghold is&nbsp;<em>Fellowship</em>'s first seasonal event, and it'll be available in-game from now until November 13th, transforming the game's Stronghold hub into "a haunted wonderland".</p>

<p>You can look forward to "hauntingly beautiful hero cosmetics" exclusive to this season, as well as "spooky new visual elements" to enjoy in the Stronghold, an "otherworldly" rework of&nbsp;<em>Fellowship</em>'s main hub theme, and new audio elements to celebrate spooky season.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fellowship-the-haunting-of-stronghold-event-hub.jpg?itok=EY-vwW56 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fellowship-the-haunting-of-stronghold-event-hub.jpg?itok=78tWoBQF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fellowship</em>'s Stronghold is getting decked out in spooky accouterments for Halloween.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as cosmetics and a newly-decorated hub, you can also look forward to new mounts courtesy of the Caretaker of Fallen Heroes vendor, who will give you "plenty of treats" appropriate to the season.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Fellowship</em>, Chief Rebel describes it as a "multiplayer online dungeon adventure" that features "endlessly scaling dungeon runs". It's essentially&nbsp;<em>World of Warcraft</em>, but if everything except the dungeons was cut out or scaled back.</p>

<p><em>Fellowship</em>'s dungeons feature "an emphasis on skill, co-operation, and strategy" for boss battles, so you'll need to work together with your team as a unit if you want to surmount the game's many challenges.</p>

<p>Chief Rebel and Arc Games promise a "large pool of tank, healer, and DPS roles", each of which has "unique kits" to help you balance your team of four. Each run will also award you and your team with loot, and tackling tougher dungeons will grant better rewards. You know how this works.</p>




<p>You can check out <i>Fellowship&nbsp;</i>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2352620/Fellowship/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>, and you can read <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/fellowship-preview-familiar-yet-fresh-take-on-mmo-dungeons" rel="nofollow">our very own Austin's preview here</a> to find out what he thought of this new take on MMO dungeon-delving gameplay.</p>
