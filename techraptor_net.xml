            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-gold-kojima-daruma-doll<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hideo Kojima and his studio Kojima Productions have announced that upcoming open-world epic&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach&nbsp;</em>has gone gold, and Kojima is celebrating with a time-honored Japanese custom.</p>

<p>Over on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hideokojimaen.bsky.kojimaproductions.jp/post/3lopyu7eyrk2u" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>, Kojima posted a picture of the&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach&nbsp;</em>gold master disk. In case you're unaware, a gold master disk is the version of the game from which other copies are pressed, so Kojima's post essentially means&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>is ready to ship.</p>

<p>Alongside the shot of the disk, Kojima also posted a picture of himself filling in the right eye of a Japanese daruma doll. Again, in case you're not familiar with the custom, a daruma doll's left eye is filled in when a goal is decided on, and the right eye is filled in when the goal is completed.</p>

<p>While a number of trailers have been released for&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2</em>, the game's plot is characteristically abstract. It'll pick up after the events of the first game and will ask the question "should we have connected?", but the specifics and minutiae of the story are still unknown at the moment.</p>

<p>We also know that a number of characters will be returning from the first game, including&nbsp;Léa Seydoux's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideo-kojima-explains-additional-hands-on-fragiles-shoulders-in-death-stranding-2-on" rel="nofollow">Fragile</a>, Troy Baker's Higgs, and, of course, protagonist Sam Porter-Bridges, portrayed by the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-confirmed-by-norman-reedus" rel="nofollow">rather loose-lipped</a> Norman Reedus.</p>

<p>They'll join new additions to the cast like George Miller's Tarman, Debra Wilson's Doctor, and Luca Marinelli's Neil, and we'll get to find out how they fit into the story when&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>launches (although even then, given Kojima's past form, that isn't guaranteed).</p>




<p><em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>launches exclusively for <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a> on June 26th (although a version for PC will almost certainly arrive afterwards, if <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-is-coming-to-pc-after-all" rel="nofollow">the first game</a> is anything to go by).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-33-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has announced the release date for&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.3, with the latest update for the turn-based gacha RPG landing later this month.</p>

<p>Following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-32-release-date" rel="nofollow">last month's</a> Version 3.2,&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.3, also known as "The Fall at Dawn's Rise", will be arriving across all platforms on May 21st. As you'd expect, it'll bring a chunk of new story, plus two new characters for your team and more.</p>

<p>In story terms, you'll be taking part in the "final battle of Flame-Chase Journey", standing against the Sky Titan Aquila, which "controls the cycles of dawn and dusk" thanks to having "the sky as its eyelids". Good luck with that.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/honkai-star-rail-version-3.3-release-date-hyacine.jpg?itok=ysPR7mAg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/honkai-star-rail-version-3.3-release-date-hyacine.jpg?itok=j73OYLem 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Two new characters will be available in&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.3.</figcaption></figure><p>As is often the case, two new five-star playable characters will debut as part of the latest&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>update. The first, Hyacine, is a healer who can restore her team's HP and boost "overall survivability" thanks to her Ultimate.</p>

<p>Joining Hyacine is Cipher, a Quantum character on the Path of Nihility. She's a damage-dealer who can analyse enemies in order to dish out additional damage based on punishment they've already taken.</p>

<p>Alongside these two, five-star limited fighters The Herta and Aglaea will be returning in the first and second halves of Version 3.3's event cycle, so if you missed your chance to grab them the first time around, be sure to seize this opportunity.</p>

<p>As well as the story,&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.3 also adds minigames like the new "Penacony Speed Cup Spheroid Racing Tournament" event, which gives you the chance to race your Spheroid Racer against opponents in "high-stakes showdowns".</p>




<p><em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>is available to play for free right now on <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices</a>. Version 3.3, "The Fall at Dawn's Rise", launches across all of these platforms on May 21st.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Killing Floor 3 Release Date Now Set for July]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/killing-floor-3-release-date-july-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/killing-floor-3-release-date-now-set-for-july.1185207/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/killing-floor-3-release-date-july-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Tripwire Interactive has announced a brand new&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</em>release date, with the multiplayer-focused zed-slaying shooter now set to release in the summer.</p>

<p>Back in March (which is also when the game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/killing-floor-3-release-date" rel="nofollow">originally intended to launch</a>), Tripwire <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/killing-floor-3-delayed-2025" rel="nofollow">delayed</a>&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3</em>, citing a need to implement changes suggested by user feedback from the game's closed beta test.</p>

<p>In a new press release, Tripwire says that its development team has been using the extra time from the delay to address that feedback, and so a new release date of July 24th has been set. In the interim, Tripwire says it will release more dev diaries showing off the ways in which it's implementing player suggestions.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/killing-floor-3-release-date-2025-sewer.jpg?itok=8xGqch3e 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/killing-floor-3-release-date-2025-sewer.jpg?itok=6wE4ABx3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</em>now has a July release date.</figcaption></figure><p>Tripwire creative director Bryan Wynia says the studio has been taking the additional time to ensure&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</em>"lives up to our shared vision", i.e. the one shared by the studio and the fans.</p>

<p>The new release date also means that pre-orders for the three different versions of&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3</em>&nbsp;- Standard, Deluxe, and Elite - are once again live.</p>

<p>In case you're wondering, pre-ordering the Standard version nets you the game, plus a weapon skin set, a weapon trinket, and a player card. The Deluxe edition gets you all of that plus two extra Shadow Agent skin sets, a Nightfall Supply Pass, and 1000 Nightfall Creds.</p>

<p>Finally, the Elite edition includes everything outlined above, but ups the Nightfall Supply Pass total to four and the Creds total to 3000. Pre-orders for all three editions are available across PC and consoles right now.</p>




<p>If you're wondering what&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</em>is, it's the third mainline installment in the&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor&nbsp;</em>series of multiplayer-focused first-person shooters. Taking place 70 years after&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 2</em>, it sees you and your buddies teaming up to take down an army of slavering monsters known as Zeds.</p>

<p><em>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1430190/Killing_Floor_3/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/killing-floor-3/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/killing-floor-3/9pfzlckhc1vm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on July 24th.</p>
