            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP&nbsp;</em>developer Dragami Games has announced it's signed an agreement with Taiwanese "IP investment and development" company Nada Holdings to develop new projects based on the aforementioned hack-and-slash property.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://nadaholdings.com/nada-holdings-and-dragami-games-launch-new-ip-development-for-lollipop-chainsaw/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on the official Nada Holdings website, the company says "multiple new projects" based on&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw</em>&nbsp;will be launched as a collaboration between Nada and Dragami, although the company stops short of saying exactly what those projects will be.</p>

<p>Nada does, however, say that "cumulative sales" of&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw&nbsp;</em>have reached 1.5 million. That figure presumably includes both the original&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-release-date" rel="nofollow">last year's remaster</a>, since the company makes reference to "13 years of continued fan support".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lollipop-chainsaw-new-projects-combat.jpg?itok=tjF6mMgJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lollipop-chainsaw-new-projects-combat.jpg?itok=uSgYR-QP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>More&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw&nbsp;</em>is on the way.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Nada, the new collaboration between itself and Dragami aims to expand <i>Lollipop Chainsaw&nbsp;</i>through "multifaceted projects and cross-industry collaborations", so presumably, it's not just new games the two are working on.</p>

<p>Dragami CEO Shohei Sato says the new projects will "carry on the spirit and charm of the original while bringing fresh value to the franchise", while Nada Holdings chairman Joe Teng says his company will "devote itself wholeheartedly to preserving the spirit of the original work and meeting the expectations of its fans".</p>

<p>Teng also says the collaboration will result in a "wide range of new projects", which, again, indicates that we're not just in for a&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw&nbsp;</em>sequel. I'd be surprised if there isn't some kind of anime series or streaming show in the works, as well as a spinoff or two.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw</em>, it's a hack-and-slash action game that was originally released way back in the mists of 2012 for seventh-gen machines. The original game was the result of a collaboration between&nbsp;<em>Killer7</em>'s Suda51 and James Gunn, who's currently helming the latest&nbsp;<em>Superman&nbsp;</em>movie.</p>

<p>In 2022, a remake of&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lollipop-chainsaw-remake-as-close-as-possible-to-original-say-devs" rel="nofollow">was announced</a>, but following requests from fans, the remake was subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-remaster-remake" rel="nofollow">scaled back to a remaster</a>, likely to stick to the developers' intentions of making the new version "as close as possible" to the original.</p>

<p>In any case, <i>Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP&nbsp;</i>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2658450/LOLLIPOP_CHAINSAW_RePOP/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010519" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/lollipop-chainsaw-repop/9ntpb0c2028v" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>&nbsp;(as well as Switch 2 via backwards compatibility).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The long-awaited live-action&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>series is finally moving forward at Netflix, if a new report is to be believed.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/assassins-creed-live-action-series-netflix-1236463572/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Variety</a>, the series, which will be helmed by showrunners and co-creators Roberto Patino and David Wiener, has been given the green light, although there's no word of a release date or even a release window yet.</p>

<p>Patino says the goal with the&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>series is to create "something undeniable for fans all over the planet", promising to highlight the franchise's focus on "people searching for purpose, struggling with questions of identity and destiny and faith" underneath the "scope, the spectacle, the parkour, and the thrills".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-live-action-series-ezio.jpg?itok=BwAgjaLi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-live-action-series-ezio.jpg?itok=So66-Csq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>We don't yet know who the&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>live-action series will focus on, but my money's on Ezio.</figcaption></figure><p>Netflix scripted series VP Peter Friedlander, meanwhile, says the&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>series is an "epic adventure" that will honor the franchise's legacy while also inviting "longtime fans and newcomers alike to experience the thrill of the Brotherhood as never before".</p>

<p>It isn't yet clear which of&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed</em>'s many time periods the show will focus on. According to its official logline, the show "follows its characters across pivotal historical events as they battle to shape humanity's destiny", so it's very possible we'll be seeing multiple historical periods, which would be interesting.</p>

<p>If the&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>series focuses on just one period, though, my money's on Renaissance-era Italy and the story of Ezio, since he's probably the franchise's most popular protagonist.</p>

<p>Of course, given that&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-steam-player-count" rel="nofollow">set a new Steam record for the franchise</a>&nbsp;and that sales for the modern action-RPG titles are strong across the board, we could well see&nbsp;<em>Shadows</em>, or perhaps&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/assassins-creed-origins" rel="nofollow"><em>Origins</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/assassins-creed-odyssey" rel="nofollow"><em>Odyssey</em></a>, or&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/assassins-creed-valhalla" rel="nofollow">Valhalla</a></em>,&nbsp;adapted instead.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-live-action-series-valhalla.jpg?itok=g5ER1Gok 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-live-action-series-valhalla.jpg?itok=Fv7O9PNs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Could&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Valhalla&nbsp;</em>serve as the basis for the upcoming live-action series?</figcaption></figure><p>The&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>Netflix series was first revealed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-netflix-series-in-development" rel="nofollow">all the way back in 2020</a>, so presumably, it's essentially been stuck in something akin to development hell since then, although the series has obviously clawed its way out of that blighted land now.</p>

<p>It will find a landscape newly receptive towards streaming adaptations of gaming properties, with shows based on the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/hbos-last-of-us-season-2-review-skeleton-of-story-no-heart" rel="nofollow"><em>The Last of Us</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/fallout-tv-show-proves-last-of-us-wasnt-fluke" rel="nofollow"><em>Fallout</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/secret-level-brings-videogame-anthology-to-prime-video" rel="nofollow">various other properties</a>&nbsp;making their way to streaming services in recent years.</p>

<p>Whether the series turns out better than the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/assassins-creed/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">somewhat ambivalently-received</a> movie remains to be seen, and since we don't know when the&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>Netflix show will air, it might be a while before we find out. Watch this space for more.</p>
