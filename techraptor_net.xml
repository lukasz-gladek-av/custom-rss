            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideki-kamiya-platinumgames-execs-leaving<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>PlatinumGames founder and former CEO Hideki Kamiya has revealed that at least four more high-profile execs have quit the company, including the directors of hits like&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 3</em>.</p>

<p>In a recent video on his YouTube channel (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/hideki-kamiya-video-reveals-five-more-leads-have-quit-platinum-including-bayonetta-3s-director/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">VGC</a>), Kamiya includes a photograph of himself and five other individuals, labeling the picture as a "former PlatinumGames directors' drinking party".</p>

<p>As well as Kamiya himself, the photo also includes Yusuke Miyata, Kenji Saito, and Takahisa Taura, the directors of <i>Bayonetta 3</i>,&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Rising</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Astral Chain</em>, respectively. You can also spot&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta Origins</em>' Abebe Tinari, as well as character artist Masaki Yamanaka.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hideki-kamiya-platinumgames-directors-photo.jpg?itok=hhKATQvb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hideki-kamiya-platinumgames-directors-photo.jpg?itok=ygdronBD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Several more folks appear to have left PlatinumGames.</figcaption></figure><p>As VGC points out, Tinari already revealed his departure from PlatinumGames last month, but to the best of my knowledge, the departure of the other four from PlatinumGames is new.</p>

<p>Kamiya doesn't state in the video whether any of the folks in the photo have joined his new studio Clovers or whether they'll be moving on to other ventures within the gaming industry, although at the very least, it seems plausible that&nbsp;<em>Astral Chain</em>'s Taura is <a href="https://x.com/NSK29_0916/status/1869213824198599053" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">starting his own studio</a>.</p>

<p>In any case, these departures follow some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platinumgames-quietly-removes-all-mentions-of-project-gg-from-website" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">rather odd changes</a> to PlatinumGames' website. A number of games, including titles like&nbsp;<em>Transformers: Devastation</em>, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/world-of-demons-delisted" rel="nofollow">now-delisted</a>&nbsp;<em>World of Demons</em>, and the previously-teased&nbsp;<em>Project G.G.</em>, have all been removed from the site's listings.</p>

<p>It seems the studio has removed games that are no longer available, which presumably also means&nbsp;<em>Project G.G.&nbsp;</em>has been canceled, although the fact that they're completely gone from PlatinumGames' list feels a touch like revisionist history.</p>

<p>The sequel is likely some way away from being released, but it's nice to know that Kamiya is getting to work on a project in which he'd <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideki-kamiya-would-like-to-make-new-viewtiful-joe-and-okami-games-comments-on" rel="nofollow">previously expressed interest</a>. Maybe now we can hope for that new&nbsp;<em>Viewtiful Joe&nbsp;</em>game.</p>

<p>PlatinumGames, meanwhile, is currently working on&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 4&nbsp;</em>alongside Team Ninja. The game was revealed during last month's Xbox Developer Direct and is set to launch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2627260/NINJA_GAIDEN_4/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012110" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/ninja-gaiden-4/9p0sq1s72g4j" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> later this year.</p>
