            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-playstation-handheld-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony is reportedly in the early stages of developing a brand new PlayStation handheld intended to challenge Nintendo's current dominance of the market.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-25/sony-working-on-new-handheld-console-for-ps5-games-to-rival-nintendo-s-switch" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bloomberg report</a>, which cites the usual "people familiar with its development", Sony is looking to both take on Nintendo's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-has-sold-13936-million-units-super-mario-bros-wonder-sold-1196-million" rel="nofollow">hugely popular Switch</a> and to head off competition from a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-handheld-confirmed-but-years-away" rel="nofollow">potential Xbox handheld</a> as well.</p>

<p>Much like said Xbox handheld, however, the PlayStation device is likely many years away from release, and Bloomberg's reporters say that Sony "could still decide against bringing it to market", so we're very much still in the early stages of development.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/playstation-vita-new-playstation-handheld.jpg?itok=v3T5njU- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/playstation-vita-new-playstation-handheld.jpg?itok=MOWL6QRz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sony's last true foray into the handheld market was the ill-fated PlayStation Vita.</figcaption></figure><p>According to the Bloomberg report, the PlayStation handheld would be designed to play PS5 games on the move, although it's unclear exactly how the device would work in this regard.</p>

<p>It's likely, however, that the handheld - if, indeed, it ever comes to market - won't predominantly use cloud streaming, because that would put it in direct competition with the PlayStation Portal, a handheld device <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonys-playstation-portal-gets-release-date-while-fans-keep-asking-for-real-portable" rel="nofollow">designed to play PS5 games</a> when linked to a console <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-portal-cloud-streaming-update" rel="nofollow">or via the cloud</a>.</p>

<p>Bloomberg says that the Portal was originally intended to function as a standalone device, much like Valve's Steam Deck. Presumably, however, that scope got cut down during the device's development.</p>

<p>As it stands, the PlayStation Portal is capable of streaming PS5 games, but it doesn't have any native capability to play them. It's likely the new PlayStation handheld would feature hardware capable of playing PS5 games natively, although it's very unlikely it would support physical media.</p>

<p>Nintendo has promised to share news regarding the Switch's successor <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation" rel="nofollow">sometime before April next year</a>, but the company hasn't specified exactly when we can expect the device to arrive.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/more-league-of-legends-shows-on-way<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Arcane&nbsp;</em>showrunner Christian Linke has revealed that the show, which recently ended on its second season, won't be the last&nbsp;<em>League of Legends</em>-based streaming series you'll see.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2309678052" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">interview on Twitch</a> with popular&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>streamer and content creator Necrit (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/arcane-showrunner-confirms-noxus-ionia-demacia-league-of-legends-shows/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">TheGamer</a>), Linke revealed that&nbsp;<em>Arcane&nbsp;</em>will be part of a "cinematic universe", so although Jinx and Vi's story may be over, the story of&nbsp;<em>Arcane</em>'s wider world is just beginning.</p>

<p>According to Linke, the next shows to arrive as part of this universe will be based in the nations of Demacia, Noxus, and Ionia, all of which are very important powers in&nbsp;<em>League of Legends</em>' world.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/arcane-showrunner-league-of-legends-shows-jinx-vi.jpg?itok=PhaGGNgd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/arcane-showrunner-league-of-legends-shows-jinx-vi.jpg?itok=yhgo3Y9G 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Arcane&nbsp;</em>may be over, but the wider world of&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>shows is just beginning.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not up on&nbsp;your&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>lore, here's a quick primer. Many of the game's most upstanding characters, like Garen, Lux, and Fiora, come from Demacia, but the nation has a dark side as well; it's an isolationist fortress that does not treat its mages well.</p>

<p>Noxus, by contrast, is a brutal nation of military conquest and dog-eat-dog philosophy. Its leader, Jericho Swain, is a sinister general aided in his conquests by a demon, and its ruthless warriors include the likes of Darius, Draven, and the colossal undead Sion.</p>

<p>Finally, Ionia is a magical nation that has tried to maintain its neutrality in the many conflicts between Demacia and Noxus over the years. Its most famous inhabitants include the operatic serial killer Jhin, the martial arts legend Master Yi, and&nbsp;<em>League of Legends</em>' version of the trickster hero Wukong.</p>

<p>It makes a lot of sense to expand&nbsp;<em>Arcane</em>'s world; the show has proven popular with both&nbsp;<em>League&nbsp;</em>fans and non-fans alike, and one of its principal characters has even <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/league-of-legends-ambessa-revealed" rel="nofollow">found her way into&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>as a new champion</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/jhin-league-of-legends-arcane.jpg?itok=Gum57RGT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/jhin-league-of-legends-arcane.jpg?itok=wIxlsDxy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Could theatrical serial killer Jhin be one of the characters we'll see in the upcoming&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>Ionia show?</figcaption></figure><p>Linke says the next&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>show is already in development, but he doesn't go into detail regarding which of the three nations the show will focus on (assuming it's just one, of course).</p>

<p>In any case, all nine episodes of the second season of&nbsp;<em>Arcane&nbsp;</em>are currently available to stream on Netflix, which, naturally, is also where you'll find the show's first season if you're yet to catch up on it.</p>
