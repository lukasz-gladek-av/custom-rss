            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-engineers-2-steam-workshop-confirmed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Keen Software House has announced that&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>will, in fact, be using Steam Workshop as its main user-generated content platform.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1133870/view/527583567913419118" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Steam, Keen Software House CEO Marek Rosa says that the decision to switch to Steam Workshop came from "listening to our community, particularly our content creators, who have expressed a strong preference" for the platform.</p>

<p>The original plan, according to Rosa, was to use Mod.io, which Rosa says was "driven by the goal of providing a unified backend" for&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2</em>'s PC and console versions. However, user feedback subsequently "made it clear" that Steam Workshop was the preferred direction.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/space-engineers-2-steam-workshop-astronauts.jpg?itok=p7SAGgLS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/space-engineers-2-steam-workshop-astronauts.jpg?itok=xTKQW9up 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Space Engineers 2</em>'s user-generated content will primarily use Steam Workshop, it's been announced.</figcaption></figure><p>Rosa goes on to say that Steam Workshop support will be added for&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2</em>'s user-generated content in the game's first major post-launch patch, which will arrive after the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-engineers-2-early-access-release-date" rel="nofollow">planned Early Access launch on January 27th</a>.</p>

<p>As for console players, Rosa says he and Keen Software House are currently "evaluating the best approach" when it comes to console-based user-generated content, and that the studio will "share more details as we progress".</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://2.spaceengineersgame.com/roadmap-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">roadmap</a> has also been updated to reflect the Steam Workshop decision, with Vertical Slice 1.1 now connecting the in-game workshop to Steam Workshop rather than Mod.io.</p>

<p>Future Vertical Slices for&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>will bring the likes of improved gameplay mechanics, support for modding via the VRAGE Editor, and the opportunity to explore individual planets, plus lots more.</p>




<p>As you can probably guess,&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>is the sequel to the original&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers</em>. It expands the original's sandbox gameplay with new blueprint tools, new gameplay systems, and plenty more.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>when it launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1133870/Space_Engineers_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on January 27th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-update-4</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/manor-lords-update-4-brings-bridge-building-new-maps-and-more.1079043/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-update-4<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Slavic Magic and publisher Hooded Horse have released a brand new&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>update, and it's packing a new bridge-building mechanic, new maps to check out, and more.</p>

<p>Previous <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-update-beta-none-glitch" rel="nofollow">updates</a> for the medieval city-builder have brought the likes of bug fixes and gameplay improvements, but as the name implies, Update 4 is a bigger patch that introduces some major new features.</p>

<p>First up, you're getting two new maps, High Peaks and Winding River. No prizes for which one of those includes "a huge river", as Hooded Horse and Slavic Magic say. Naturally, that river leads on to the new bridge-building mechanic, which is also included in Update 4.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/manor-lords-update-4-town.jpg?itok=ZE_PPcfh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/manor-lords-update-4-town.jpg?itok=nYPQSCuR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Manor Lords</em>' latest update brings tons of new features with it.</figcaption></figure><p>That's right: you can now use&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords</em>' Road tool to build yourself bridges, which can be used to cross things like the aforementioned "huge river" included in the Winding River map.</p>

<p>Additionally, Update 4 brings with it new gameplay tweaks like an Overstock setting for taverns and marketplaces, an upgrade to the Stone Well, and a level 2 Tavern upgrade, as well as a new visual for the Tavern's first level.</p>

<p>All of this is in addition to an absolute onslaught of bug fixes, gameplay improvements, and other changes. You can check out the full patch notes for&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>Update 4 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1363080/view/534338967351329253" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>, but you might want to grab a coffee before you do, as it's pretty long.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords</em>, it's a medieval city-builder-slash-strategy game that emphasizes realism in its simulation. You'll build and maintain a village, see to the needs of its citizens, and even grow your empire through conquest of neighboring lands.</p>




<p>The game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-price-player-count" rel="nofollow">released back in April</a>, attracting over 100,000 players on Steam within just a few hours of its launch (which is particularly impressive given that it's also available on Game Pass).</p>

<p>In just a few days,&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-sales-player-count" rel="nofollow">broke a million</a>. They would go on to hit&nbsp;two million in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-sales-two-million" rel="nofollow">under three weeks</a>. It's safe to say Hooded Horse has a hit on its hands with this one.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1363080/Manor_Lords/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/manor-lords-game-preview/9p5f966564fs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>. It's also available as part of Game Pass Ultimate or PC Game Pass.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-version-1-5-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/zenless-zone-zero-version-1-5-brings-an-in-game-concert-and-more-this-month.1078998/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-version-1-5-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has announced the release date for&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 1.5, and it'll include an in-game concert for you to attend, plus two new S-rank characters to recruit and more.</p>

<p>The concert will take place to mark the new year and will see Astra Yao performing at the "iconic" Starloop landmark in New Eridu. However, all is not as it seems, and there's a conspiracy brewing that may threaten Astra.</p>

<p>Naturally, Astra Yao is one of the two new S-rank Agents you can recruit in&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 1.5. She's an Ether Support Agent who can provide damage bonuses to your squad, and she's also the game's "first healing character", with her Ultimate restoring HP to your team.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zenless-zone-zero-version-1.5-new-characters.jpg?itok=j7tAOTf4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zenless-zone-zero-version-1.5-new-characters.jpg?itok=MUaP8O4f 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 1.5 will bring two new characters for you to recruit.</figcaption></figure><p>Your second new character in this update is Evelyn, Astra Yao's "trusted guardian". She's a Fire Attack Agent who can unleash a Chain Attack by herself, so she's a pretty powerful addition to your lineup.</p>

<p>In addition to the above two characters, you can also expect reruns of Ellen and Qingyi in Version 1.5's banners, as well as a new S-rank Banbgoo in the form of Snap, which comes complete with a camera.</p>

<p>Version 1.5 also brings with it new minigames, including a new parkour-based arcade game by the name of Mach 25, which allows you to "race with various vehicles". Plenty of other new gameplay changes and features are coming in Version 1.5 too, so make sure you add January 22nd to your calendar.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero</em>, it's part of HoYoverse's live-service gacha RPG lineup, alongside&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/genshin-impact" rel="nofollow">Genshin Impact</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/honkai-star-rail" rel="nofollow">Honkai: Star Rail</a>&nbsp;</em>(and also&nbsp;<em>Honkai Impact 3rd</em>).</p>

<p>The game is more overtly action-oriented than its stablemates, and it's less fantasy-inspired too, taking place in an urban setting reminiscent of the likes of&nbsp;<em>Persona&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Jet Set Radio</em>.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>right now for free on <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/en-us/main" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices</a>. Version 1.5 lands on January 22nd.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-sales-200k</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-sales-pass-200k.1078953/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-sales-200k<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Dragami Games has announced that&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw RePop&nbsp;</em>sales have passed a new milestone almost four months after the remaster's initial release.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Dragami_Games/status/1877626459386212769" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on social media platform X (for which we're using machine translation), Dragami confirms that&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw RePop&nbsp;</em>has sold over 200,000 copies worldwide since its release on September 12th.</p>

<p>While it's true those aren't exactly sales on the level of triple-A hits like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-9m" rel="nofollow">Resident Evil 4</a>&nbsp;</em>or indie smashes like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-hit-3-5m" rel="nofollow"><em>Balatro</em></a>, <i>Lollipop Chainsaw RePop&nbsp;</i>is a remastered version of an already-niche action game from 2012, so 200,000 isn't a bad figure at all to reach.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-sales-combat.jpg?itok=0zu3GJbv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-sales-combat.jpg?itok=Lku5SkXH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Lollipop Chainsaw RePop&nbsp;</em>has hit the 200,000 sales mark.</figcaption></figure><p>The&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw&nbsp;</em>remaster was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lollipop-chainsaw-remake-as-close-as-possible-to-original-say-devs" rel="nofollow">announced as a remake</a> back in 2022, with producer Yoshimi Yasuda assuring fans at that point that the game would remain "as close as possible" to the original.</p>

<p>It was officially named&nbsp;<em>Lollipop Chainsaw RePop&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lollipop-chainsaw-remake-officially-titled-lollipop-chainsaw-repop-delayed-to-2024" rel="nofollow">the following year</a>, at which point its release was also pushed back to 2024. Following that, Yasuda proved himself true to his word when it turned out that&nbsp;<em>RePop&nbsp;</em>would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-remaster-remake" rel="nofollow">serve as a remaster</a> rather than a full remake.</p>

<p>Back in June, the remaster's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-release-date" rel="nofollow">release date was set for September</a>. It's one of two 2012 action-adventure games involving auteur Goichi Suda, otherwise known as Suda51, to get itself a remaster this year, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shadows-of-damned-hella-remastered-release-date" rel="nofollow">the other being&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned</em></a>.</p>




<p><em>Lollipop Chainsaw RePop&nbsp;</em>is a remastered version of the 2012 action game, which was originally developed by Suda51's company Grasshopper Manufacture.</p>

<p>Maintaining the original game's story and atmosphere,&nbsp;<em>RePop&nbsp;</em>features upgraded visuals, "faster action", and plenty of other quality-of-life improvements to bring cheerleader Juliet Starling's zombie-slaying adventure into the modern era.</p>

<p>You can check out <i>Lollipop Chainsaw RePop&nbsp;</i>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2658450/LOLLIPOP_CHAINSAW_RePOP/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010519" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/lollipop-chainsaw-repop/9NTPB0C2028V/0010" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>. Here's hoping all this renewed interest in 2012 action games leads to some kind of remaster for&nbsp;<em>Binary Domain</em>. Come on, Sega.</p>
