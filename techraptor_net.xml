            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, Nintendo released the very first trailer for upcoming cinematic sequel&nbsp;<em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em>, as well as introducing a couple of new characters who will be voiced by some pretty big names.</p>

<p>As part of a (rather short) Nintendo Direct presentation, Nintendo legend Shigeru Miyamoto, along with Illumination's Chris Meledandri, provided a first look at the movie, which will be released on April 3rd around the world.</p>

<p>Naturally, the movie's chief inspiration is 2007's classic&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Galaxy</em>, and so one of that game's biggest characters will be joining the cast; it's none other than cosmic Princess Rosalina, who will be voiced by "Nintendo superfan" Brie Larson.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-mario-luigi.jpg?itok=k16Tc0aC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-mario-luigi.jpg?itok=ww1jr9su 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie&nbsp;</em>will seemingly pick up right where its predecessor left off.</figcaption></figure><p>Rosalina's introduction comes as she reads a story to her adorable Lumas, who begins telling them about "a brave and noble Princess named Peach" before the Lumas request "the one about the plumbers".</p>

<p>It doesn't seem like she'll be a helpless damsel, though; we also get to see her do battle with a giant mech, and she's got some serious combat prowess, although this being Rosalina, her fighting style is very graceful.</p>

<p>Also joining the cast of&nbsp;<em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie&nbsp;</em>is Bowser Jr., who appears to be out for revenge against the Mario brothers for what they did to his father in the first movie. He's voiced by cinema auteur Benny Safdie.</p>

<p>During the course of the trailer, we get to see Bowser Jr. suit up in his&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Sunshine&nbsp;</em>mask, and he's wielding his paintbrush from that game as well, so it looks like the movie will roll in more influences than just the&nbsp;<em>Galaxy&nbsp;</em>games.</p>




<p>If the first movie's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/super-mario-bros-movie-stats" rel="nofollow">box office performance</a> is anything to go by,&nbsp;<em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie&nbsp;</em>will almost certainly be a cinematic hit. Nintendo has promised more info about the movie in the coming weeks, so stay tuned for that.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Gran Turismo 7 Power Pack DLC Brings 24-Hour Races and More in December]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-power-pack-dlc</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gran-turismo-7-power-pack-dlc-brings-24-hour-races-and-more-in-december.1351210/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and Polyphony Digital have announced the&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>Power Pack DLC, which brings 24-hour endurance races, a huge credit injection, and more next month.</p>

<p>It turns out that&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-forsaken-hollows-dlc" rel="nofollow">isn't the only game</a> getting a big DLC pack on December 4th, as that's also when&nbsp;Power Pack <a href="https://www.gran-turismo.com/gb/news/00_1147434.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">launches</a>. If you're playing&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>on PS4, though, you won't get access to this DLC, unfortunately.</p>

<p>PS5 players can look forward to "50 new races across 20 categories", according to Polyphony Digital, including "24-hour endurance racing" and more. The ability to play through a full race session, including practice, qualifying, and the race itself, will also be added.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gran-turismo-7-dlc-power-pack-nurburgring.jpg?itok=Chm56toR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gran-turismo-7-dlc-power-pack-nurburgring.jpg?itok=2KR1UFbC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>is getting a round of paid DLC in December, bringing new races and more.</figcaption></figure><p>The Power Pack will also bring the latest version of&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7</em>'s proprietary Sophy AI system, which can now offer "nail-biting close quarters tail-to-nose racing" (but only if you pick up the DLC; otherwise, you'll be stuck with the previous version of the AI).</p>

<p>As well as all of the above, you can look forward to a huge bonus of five million in-game credits if you pick up the Power Pack. That should help you pick up a fair few of the cars that have been introduced in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-update-162" rel="nofollow">previous</a> free <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-update-161" rel="nofollow">updates</a> for the game.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7</em>, it is, as the name suggests, the seventh mainline installment in the&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo&nbsp;</em>series of simcade racers (which essentially means it's somewhere between a real gearhead's racing sim and a more arcade-y offering).</p>

<p>The game, which was released back in 2022, allows players to race across a variety of real-world tracks using cars from huge name brands like Aston Martin, Ferrari, and Maserati, among many others.</p>




<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7</em>'s Power Pack DLC when it launches exclusively for PlayStation 5 on December 4th. The game, unlike its DLC, is available for <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/gran-turismo-7/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">both PS5 and PS4</a> right now.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-forsaken-hollows-dlc</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-nightreign-the-forsaken-hollows-dlc-coming-in-december.1351207/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer FromSoftware and publisher Bandai Namco have announced&nbsp;<em>The Forsaken Hollows</em>, the first major DLC expansion for multiplayer Soulslike&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, and it's heading your way in December.</p>

<p>As outlined in a <a href="https://www.bandainamcoent.com/news/elden-ring-nightreign-reveals-the-forsaken-hollows-dlc-launching-december-4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a>,&nbsp;<em>The Forsaken Hollows</em>, which launches on December 4th, will add two brand new Nightfarers for you to play as, plus new bosses, a new shifting earth condition, and more.</p>

<p>Specifically, you can look forward to two new third-day Nightlord bosses, as well as more iconic bosses from across both&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls&nbsp;</em>making their appearance in&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>when&nbsp;<em>The Forsaken Hollows&nbsp;</em>launches.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-the-forsaken-hollows-lion.jpg?itok=IxQmIQyd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-the-forsaken-hollows-lion.jpg?itok=vzYzLqAd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Divine Beast Dancing Lion is just one of the new bosses you'll face in&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>'s&nbsp;<em>The Forsaken Hollows&nbsp;</em>DLC.</figcaption></figure><p>Returning bosses include&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>'s Divine Beast Dancing Lion,&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls</em>' Knight Artorias, and&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s Astel, Naturalborn of the Void, and it looks like there may be some new mid-bosses for you to tackle as well.</p>

<p>We don't yet know what the two new Nightfarers will be, but it looks like one will use a spellbook to attack enemies, while the other will buff itself with what looks like some kind of dark magic during combat. We'll likely find out more about these new classes in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, it's a multiplayer-focused&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>spinoff that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-2-not-happening-fromsoftware" rel="nofollow">definitely isn't</a>&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring 2</em>; rather, it's a&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>-inspired roguelite in which your goal is to explore a shrinking map, looting supplies and battling bosses.</p>

<p>Each run takes place over three nights, and at the conclusion of each night, you'll fight a miniboss, with the third night culminating in an encounter with that run's chosen Nightlord boss.</p>




<p>The game was released back in May to a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-nightreign-sales" rel="nofollow">strong sales reception</a>, and since launch, it's received a number of updates, adding features like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-update-release-date" rel="nofollow">a two-player mode</a>&nbsp;and a new <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-deep-of-night-difficulty" rel="nofollow">difficulty level</a> for truly dedicated players.</p>

<p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>'s&nbsp;<em>The Forsaken Hollows&nbsp;</em>DLC will arrive on December 4th. The base game is available now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2622380/ELDEN_RING_NIGHTREIGN/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/elden-ring-nightreign/9PJ22QNVCZ3G" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and you can read my <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/elden-ring-nightreign-review-fort-night" rel="nofollow">review of it here</a>.</p>
