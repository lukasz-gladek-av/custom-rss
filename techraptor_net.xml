            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/giant-skull-wizards-of-the-coast-dungeons-and-dragons<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has announced that it will publish a&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;</em>game currently in the works at&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor&nbsp;</em>director Stig Asmussen's studio Giant Skull.</p>

<p>Per a VentureBeat <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/wizards-of-the-coast-signs-publishing-agreement-with-giant-skull/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, the game is a "single-player action-adventure game with an immersive story set in the&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;</em>universe". Asmussen and Giant Skull haven't revealed more details about the project yet.</p>

<p>In a statement to VentureBeat, Asmussen says the goal with the studio's&nbsp;<em>D&amp;D&nbsp;</em>game is to "craft a rich new&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;</em>universe filled with immersive storytelling, heroic combat, and exhilarating traversal that players will fully embrace".</p>

<p>The description of the&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;</em>game in the works at Giant Skull isn't particularly specific, but it does rather sound like Asmussen's M.O.; he's previously served as the director on games like&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;God of War III</i>.</p>

<p>Asmussen first announced the founding of Giant Skull <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stig-asmussen-giant-skull-star-wars-jedi" rel="nofollow">in March last year</a>, following his departure from Respawn and its parent company EA in late 2023. At the time of Giant Skull's founding, Asmussen said his philosophy was simple: the world "need[s] video games, and [it needs] people to make them".</p>

<p>At the time, Giant Skull simply said that development on its first project was underway, but now, it looks like we know what that project is going to be (unless there's a second game in development at Giant Skull, which is perhaps unlikely).</p>

There's also a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gameloft-dungeons-dragons-game" rel="nofollow">life sim-survival hybrid</a> in the works at&nbsp;<em>Disney Dreamlight Valley&nbsp;</em>studio Gameloft, as well as a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-dnd-game-2026" rel="nofollow">live-service multiplayer game</a> from&nbsp;<em>Payday&nbsp;</em>developer Starbreeze.</p>

<p>If you want solo thrills, though, it sounds like Giant Skull's game will be your jam. Stay tuned for more info on this one as and when we get it.</p>
