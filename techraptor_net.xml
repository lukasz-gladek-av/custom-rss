            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Grandfather Nurgle, the Chaos god of plagues, disease, rot, and rebirth, gets a new Battletome for <em>Age of Sigmar</em> 4th Edition, along with a whole host of new units to share Nurgle's gifts with the realms. In this article, we take a look at some of the brand new units and a new Regiment of Renown.</p><p>We've been covering <em>Age of Sigmar</em> for a while, and you can read our review of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-skaventide-review-perfect-starter-set" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Skaventide</a>, the launch box for <em>AoS</em> 4th edition, along with our guide to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/how-to-get-started-with-age-of-sigmar-4th-edition-with-spearhead" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Spearhead</a> <em>AoS</em> gameplay format. We also recently reviewed <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-quest-darkwater-review-cant-stop-rot" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Warhammer Quest Darkwater</a>, which features several of the new units in the new battletome.</p>
<p>The Maggotkin of Nurgle all serve the Chaos god Nurgle, the god of disease, decay, despair, destruction, death, and rebirth. Their units usually appear covered in rot and decay, but also show signs of rebirth, and have new things growing out of them. This decay and rebirth, as part of the circle of life, make the Maggotkin extremely durable with high health and extra saves, but at the cost of mobility, as they plod slowly forward, relying on their resilience to get them into the fight, rather than speed.</p><p>The Maggotkin's new Battletome includes background for the Plaguefather's forces, warscrolls for returning and new units, a brand new Spearhead force, Path to Glory rules for creating your own hero, 2 armies of renown, and 2 regiments of renown (and we discuss one of them, The Pustules below).</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Festus The Leechlord</h2><p>Festus the Leechlord is a new daemon prince for the Maggotkin. This former healer fell into Nurlge's clutches because he was obsessed with research, which led the Chaos god himself to train Festus. He rides a massive slug, Gathoblyt, into battle, which also keeps his workshop within reach so that he can create new poisons to use against his foes.</p><p>Festus can cast The Leechlord's Curse on an enemy, which has a chance to deal mortal wounds and heal Festus for each wound dealt, every time that unit uses a core ability or command. He can also poison units he is in combat with, dealing wounds to heroes and monsters, or simply slaying a model in a unit outright on a command roll off, and if any units in combat with Festus are slain, he gains D3 Leech points, which boost his command stat by the number he has.</p><p>Festus' model isn't particularly imposing, not when compared to the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/helsmiths-of-hashut-army-units-review-infernal-reinforcements" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Urak Taar</a>, but it is a solid miniature, full of thematic detail that captures the mobile tainted apothecary.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Rotswords</h2><p>The Rotswords suffer from a constant fever, leaving them constantly sweating and hot to the touch. This gives them a sweat-soaked and reeking ability, which stops units that have charged and are in combat with them from using commands on a 3+. The Rotswords come armed with Ruined Master Crafted weapons that have 2 attacks and deal 2 hits on a crit.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>The Maggotkin of Nurgle Rotswords Musician is my favorite miniature of the wave of releases. Those overlapping bells would make an insane noise.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The Rotwords come boxed in a unit of 10 models with 3 sprues of unique builds, with interchangeable shields, weapons, and heads. There are also options for a Champion, Standard Bearer, and Musician (the Musician is my favourite sculpt of this entire release wave).</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Sloven Knights</h2><p>The Sloven Knights were once regal mounted knights, but now fallen to Chaos they are a shadow of their former selves. Still mounted on their now corrupted steeds, they have 2 attacks dealing 3 damage on the charge, and their Pall of Exhaustion ability can give a unit they're in combat with Strike Last on a 3+.</p><p>The Sloven Knights come in a box of 3 fixed builds with different head options. The Knights' sculpts look like absolute units atop their rotten steeds.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Putrid Blightkings</h2><p>The bloated Putrid Blightkings are some of the most devoted of Nurgle. They're extremely effective against wizards and priests, with their Discomforting Stench ability, which can make it more difficult for a targeting wizard or priest to use their spells and blessings by rolling over their power level. They're also armed with Pox-blighed weapons with 4 attacks, and rend 2 against priests and wizards.</p><p>The Putrid Blightkings come in a box of 5, with mainly fixed builds except for the 2 head options for the Champion, and the option to build a Standard Bearer, or normal Blightking.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/age-of-sigmar-maggotkin-of-nurgle-releases-7.jpg?itok=5Qmden0j 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><h2>The Pustules</h2><p>The Pustules are a Maggotkin Regiment of Renown, and the box comes with 10 Plaguebearers, a Spoilpox Scrivener, and a Feculent Gnarlmaw. The Spoilpox Scrivener is also available separately in this wave of releases, having only been available in the Spearhead box before. This Regiment of Renown can be included in forces from the other 3 Chaos gods (Blades of Khorne, Disciples of Tzeentch, Headonites of Slaneesh), or in Slaves to Darkness, Skaven, or <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/age-of-sigmar-helsmiths-of-hashut-army-set-review-let-fire-duardin-of-war" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Helsmiths of Hashut</a> armies.</p><p>Normally, Nurgle's Plaguebearers are more difficult for enemies to hit while they're contesting an objective, and the Spoilpox Scrivener can boost their Control Score to help win that objective. The Gnarlmaw is a terrain feature that deploys at the start of the battle, and can heal the Plaguebearers if they are within 12 inches of it, and can return slain models if they are contesting an objective for some overlapping synergies to make sure your Plaguebearers dominate the objective their sitting on.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>From The Depths Of Darkwater</h2><p>Several units from the recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-quest-darkwater-review-cant-stop-rot" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Warhammer Quest Darkwater</a> are getting separate releases and appear in the new Maggotkin of Nurgle Battletome. The only ones that don't make an appearance are Mulgoth the Cleaver and the Blight Templars, with the following releases in boxes we detail below.</p><ul><li>Court of Gelgus Pust - Gelgus comes in a box along with Belga the Cystwitch and Shaman Foulhoof. Gelgus comes armed with Malady and Contagion, which have 7 attacks with 3 damage each, and once per game, he can pollute a terrain feature that boosts the healing of nearby friendly units and reduces the healing of nearby enemy units. Belga can deal mortal wounds to diseased enemy units within 18 inches, and enemies removed by that ability can return slain Plaguebearers to the battlefield. Foulhoof can boost the attacks of nearby Pestigor units, which also get a release in this wave.</li><li>Pestigors - Pestigors are the beastmen of Nurgle, and come in boxes of 10. They are just as durable as their Nurgle brethren, with an additional save. They each have 2 attacks and gain Rend 1 within their own territory. Foulhood can boost those attacks to 3 to make them very capable.</li><li>Cankerborn - The Cankerborn come in a box of 2, and you get 2 objective miniatures, which are used to mark objectives or terrain at the end of any turn with Pesilent Pollutants. The Cankerborn can use the Pollutants to teleport around the battlefield in their movement phase. They each have 4 attacks dealing 3 damage and dealing mortal wounds on crits.</li><li>Pox-Wretches - Pox-Wretches come in a box of 14, with 6 Mire Kelpie tokens, which the Pox-Wretches can remove to try and give a unit they're in combat with the Diseased keyword. The Diseased keyword plays into the Maggotkin of Nurgles' faction abilities, like the Blessed by the Plaguefather ability, which deals 1 mortal wound to all enemy units if all enemies have the Diseased keyword.</li></ul><h2>Age of Sigmar Maggotkin of Nurgle Units Final Thoughts?</h2><p>I've always been a fan of the Plaguefather's forces. I love the detail that the 2 ranges miniatures have (<em>AoS</em> and <em>40K</em>), and these new sculpts are no different. I've always been respectful of their resilience, having come across them many times playing <em>Warhammer 40,000</em>. It also pleases me that the releases come hot off the back of the release of <em>Warhammer Quest Darkwater</em> and that the units are available so soon after, rather than being locked behind a separate game.&nbsp;</p><p>The new Maggotkin of Nurgle units have a lot of synergies on the battlefield, through the common goal of spreading disease to empower other abilities, and through local abilities like Foulhoof boosting the Pestigors. The Pustules regiment of renown is a lot of fun, and making the Plaguebearers even more resilient than normal is very satisfying. The whole wave of new release miniatures is full of fantastic detail, but the Sloven Knights and the Rotswords musician are my favourites.</p><hr><p><em>The copies of</em> <strong>The Age of Sigmar Maggotkin of Nurgle releases&nbsp;</strong><em>used to produce this review were provided by Games Workshop.</em></p></div><div><p><span><div>
