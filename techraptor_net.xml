            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/days-gone-remastered-accessibility<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and developer Bend Studio have revealed the kind of accessibility options and features you can expect from the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Days Gone Remastered</em>, and it's got plenty in store for all kinds of gamers.</p>

<p>The game, which lands exclusively on PS5 later this week, will feature a number of enhancements over the PS4 original, including new game modes, faster loading times, and improved visuals, among other things.</p>

<p>It'll also have a host of new accessibility features, including extra subtitle colors, a fully customizable high contrast mode to aid visibility, and new audio features. It looks like Sony is aiming for this to be the definitive version of&nbsp;<em>Days Gone</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/days-gone-remastered-accessibility-high-contrast.jpg?itok=o_KuKInW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/days-gone-remastered-accessibility-high-contrast.jpg?itok=85eH6dVA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Days Gone Remastered&nbsp;</em>will have tons of new accessibility features.</figcaption></figure><p>First up, eleven new subtitle colors have been added, and you can change them based on preference, mixing and matching them as you see fit.</p>

<p>The aforementioned high contrast mode will come complete with color choices for protagonist Deacon, the NPCs he meets, the enemies he fights, and interactable objects. Again, you'll have a choice of eleven colors to choose from.</p>

<p>In terms of audio, you can expect "a fully revised and improved audio mix" that should make sounds easier to pick out, as well as narration for the UI, audio cues for collectible objects, and increased haptics through your controller when a collectible is near.</p>

<p><em>Days Gone Remastered</em>'s controls will also be fully customizable, and you can even set the game's speed to lower it if you find yourself easily overwhelmed by&nbsp;<em>Days Gone</em>'s relentless zombie hordes.</p>




<p>If you're a PC player and you're worried you'll be missing out on these features, as well as a number of other accessibility tweaks coming to&nbsp;<em>Days Gone Remastered</em>, don't be; "most" of these features will also be coming to PC, although the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/days-gone" rel="nofollow">PS4 version</a> won't be getting them, by the sounds of things.</p>

<p><em>Days Gone Remastered&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/days-gone/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a> on April 25th.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fire-emblem-the-sacred-stones-nintendo-switch-online<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has added another classic strategy RPG to Nintendo Switch Online in the form of&nbsp;<em>Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones</em>, and it's available to play as part of the service's Expansion Pack addon right now.</p>

<p><em>The Sacred Stones&nbsp;</em>is one of three&nbsp;<em>Fire Emblem&nbsp;</em>games developed for the Game Boy Advance, alongside 2003's&nbsp;<em>The Blazing Blade</em>, which was released in the US as simply&nbsp;<em>Fire Emblem&nbsp;</em>(and which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fire-emblem-nintendo-switch-online" rel="nofollow">added to Switch Online in 2023</a>).</p>

<p>The other GBA&nbsp;<em>Fire Emblem&nbsp;</em>game, 2002's <i>The Binding Blade</i>, has never been released outside of Japan. However, while&nbsp;<em>The Blazing Blade&nbsp;</em>is technically a sequel to&nbsp;<em>The Binding Blade</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Sacred Stones&nbsp;</em>has nothing to do with either game from a narrative perspective.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-online-fire-emblem-the-sacred-stones-map.jpg?itok=LenipwgM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-online-fire-emblem-the-sacred-stones-map.jpg?itok=maSvNx6S 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones&nbsp;</em>is the Game Boy Advance's third&nbsp;<em>Fire Emblem</em>&nbsp;game.</figcaption></figure><p><em>The Sacred Stones&nbsp;</em>revolves around protagonists Ephraim and Eirika, a brother-and-sister duo who must defend their homeland from hostile invaders.</p>

<p>After a certain point in the game, you'll be able to choose which of the two siblings' stories you'd like to follow, with one route (Ephraim's) being significantly more challenging than the other. Eventually, however, the two lords' paths unite once again.</p>

<p>Otherwise,&nbsp;<em>The Sacred Stones&nbsp;</em>offers very similar turn-based strategy gameplay to its predecessors, and, indeed, to its successors as well. If you've played a&nbsp;<em>Fire Emblem&nbsp;</em>game before, you'll probably feel right at home here.</p>

<p>If you haven't, <i>Fire Emblem&nbsp;</i>games take place on a square grid, and you must maneuver your characters in order to defeat enemy troops, protect vulnerable units from attack, and achieve whatever the current map's objective happens to be.</p>




<p>The action is spiced up by the fact that if you lose any of your units during combat, they're gone forever. Later&nbsp;<em>Fire Emblem&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/fire-emblem-engage" rel="nofollow">games</a> would allow you to turn this feature off, but&nbsp;<em>The Sacred Stones&nbsp;</em>certainly doesn't, so be aware of that before you jump in.</p>

<p><em>Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones&nbsp;</em>is available right now as part of a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership. It'll also be fully playable on Nintendo Switch 2 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">when the console launches on June 5th</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[OutRun Movie Reportedly Coming from Michael Bay and Sydney Sweeney]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/outrun-movie-report</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/outrun-movie-reportedly-coming-from-michael-bay-and-sydney-sweeney.1170180/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/outrun-movie-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report has emerged which claims that a movie based on the classic Sega racing property&nbsp;<em>OutRun&nbsp;</em>is in the works, and two major Hollywood figures are apparently attached to the project.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/sydney-sweeney-michael-bay-outrun-video-game-universal-1236373036/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Deadline</a>, the&nbsp;<em>OutRun&nbsp;</em>movie is in development at Universal, and attached to direct is none other than&nbsp;<em>Transformers&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&nbsp;</em>director Michael Bay.</p>

<p>Deadline says that Bay will also serve as a producer, and he'll take that role alongside&nbsp;<em>Madame Web&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Immaculate&nbsp;</em>star Sydney Sweeney, although it's not clear whether she'll be starring in the movie as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/outrun-movie-report-racing.jpg?itok=jZZt5Gh6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/outrun-movie-report-racing.jpg?itok=K5MdwUGM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>OutRun&nbsp;</em>is apparently getting a movie.</figcaption></figure><p>Currently attached to write the script for&nbsp;<em>OutRun&nbsp;</em>is Jayson Rothwell, who's penned the likes of the Mads Mikkelsen-starring&nbsp;<em>Polar&nbsp;</em>and the dark Santa Claus killer comedy&nbsp;<em>Silent Night&nbsp;</em>(the 2012 movie starring Malcolm McDowell, not the 2021 Keira Knightley movie).</p>

<p>It's likely that when it comes to developing <em>OutRun</em>, Universal has been buoyed by the phenomenal success of recent video game adaptations like A&nbsp;Minecraft Movie (the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-minecraft-movie-trailer" rel="nofollow">terrible first trailer</a> for which did nothing to dent its box office)&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/super-mario-bros-movie-stats" rel="nofollow"><em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em></a>.</p>

<p>There's also a success closer to home to which Universal can look, namely that of&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em>, the movie adaptations of which cumulatively&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-the-hedgehog-movies-1b-box-office" rel="nofollow">crossed $1 billion at the box office</a> back in January.</p>

<p>It's fair to say that video game movies are big business, but adapting&nbsp;<em>OutRun</em>, a franchise that has historically been very light indeed on story, might be a trickier prospect than doing the same for&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>or even&nbsp;<em>Mario</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/a-minecraft-movie-outrun.jpg?itok=zSpnQYNA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/a-minecraft-movie-outrun.jpg?itok=Ci3Lw1vf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>A Minecraft Movie&nbsp;</em>is cleaning up at the box office.</figcaption></figure><p>Right now, we don't know what kind of creative direction the&nbsp;<em>OutRun&nbsp;</em>movie will take, and it's likely to be a while before we hear anything concrete; after all, the movie is almost certainly in its early stages right now.</p>

<p>Still, if you just can't wait for more video game movies, there are plenty on the way. Nintendo's&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>movie is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/live-action-zelda-movie-march-2027" rel="nofollow">set for 2027</a>, and movies based on the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-movie-report" rel="nofollow"><em>Split Fiction</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shinobi-movie-announced" rel="nofollow"><em>Shinobi</em></a>, and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingmakers-movie-announced" rel="nofollow">Kingmakers</a>&nbsp;</em>are all apparently also in the works.</p>
