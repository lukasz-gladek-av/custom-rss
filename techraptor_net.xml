      <div><p>This past weekend, the Kickstarter campaign for <em>Zamanora: Ballad of the Witch</em> concluded. The campaign for this fantasy TTRPG, based on Balkan and Slavic folklore, was funded within 20 minutes of going life and ended with more than 10 times its goal.</p>



<p>According to its official campaign page, Zamanora: Ballad of the Witch is a TTRPG supplement heavily inspired by grim tales from Balkan and Slavic folklore. It's a supplement compatible with the current edition of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> and Son of Oak's hotly anticipated <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/legend-in-mist-is-2025s-most-anticipated-tabletop-roleplaying-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Legend in the Mist</em></a> system.</p>

The material includes new character options, locals, eerie magic items, spells, and monsters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition, the books contained detailed information on the land of Zamanora as well as prewritten adventure. In keeping with the grim tone, the books include new rules for vampirism, lycanthropy, and debilitating curses.</p>

<p>This culture influence extends to unique gameplay mechanics. Players can abjure evil spirits as a Kuker or hunt down terrors of the knight as a Krsnic. Imbue poppets with magical power or perform communal ceremonies to cast powerful spells. There's even a system tracking the creeping influence of the Hidden World on the real world, an influence that affects mind and body.</p>

<p>The pledge tiers of <em>Zamanora: Ballad of the Witch</em> Kickstarter campaign are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Digital PDFs for $44:</strong> Digital PDFs of the Core Book and Monsters &amp; Fables</li>
	<li><strong>Core Book for $53:</strong> Digital and Physical copy of the Core Book</li>

</ul><p>It must be noted that the developers address potential import costs for Zamanora: Ballad of the Witch in light of recent US <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/game-manufacturers-association-opposes-new-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">trade tariffs</a>. According to the campaign, all orders made in the US, Canada, Europe, and the UK will be handled within fulfillment centers in said countries. Which means import taxes should be no problem. You will still need to pay for shipping.</p>

<p>The campaign has raised&nbsp;<span><span>$327,152, which is more than ten times their initial funding goal of $</span></span><span><span><span>$21,905. You can still back the project at any tier at time of writing.</span></span></span></p>
