            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report has emerged which claims that Ubisoft is currently working on a&nbsp;<em>Rayman&nbsp;</em>remake, that said remake is tentatively scheduled for next year, and that a fourth mainline&nbsp;<em>Rayman&nbsp;</em>game is also in development.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-future-of-rayman-games-ubisoft/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Insider Gaming's Tom Henderson</a>&nbsp;(who, as per, cites "those familiar with the game's development"), the&nbsp;<em>Rayman&nbsp;</em>remake is "tentatively targeting a late 2026 release date", and it's going "incredibly well".</p>

<p>That project is joined by&nbsp;<em>Rayman 4&nbsp;</em>(which almost certainly won't be its final name), which, according to Henderson, is currently in the preliminary planning stages. Henderson's sources apparently say that&nbsp;<em>Rayman 4</em>'s existence will depend on whether the&nbsp;<em>Rayman&nbsp;</em>remake does well.</p>

<p>Producer Loic Gounon says that fans shouldn't expect news from Ubisoft on what's in the works for&nbsp;<em>Rayman&nbsp;</em>"too soon", but reassures those hopeful for a new&nbsp;<em>Rayman&nbsp;</em>game by saying the franchise is "in good hands".</p>

<p>Of course, Gounon's comments don't confirm Henderson's report; for all we know, the&nbsp;<em>Rayman&nbsp;</em>remake could be canceled at a moment's notice, especially if recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/contraband-canceled-report-avalanche-studios" rel="nofollow">cancellations</a> elsewhere in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioshock-remake-canceled-bioshock-4-story-report" rel="nofollow">industry</a> are <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">anything to go by</a>.</p>

<p>Still, it's nice to know that&nbsp;<em>Rayman&nbsp;</em>remains in Ubisoft's thoughts. Let's just hope the studio chooses to revive him in a form marginally less offensive than his appearance in that one <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-nft-game-captain-laserhawk-rayman" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">really weird NFT game</a> from late last year.</p>

More at eleven.</figcaption></figure><p>As Gounon says, it's likely to be some time before we hear anything more about Ubisoft's plans for&nbsp;<em>Rayman</em>, so you'll have to stay tuned for that.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the series' latest mainline title,&nbsp;<em>Rayman Legends</em>, is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/242550/Rayman_Legends/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0001-CUSA00069_00-RAYMANLEGENDS001" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS4</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/rayman-legends/C26K4DVGR45B" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox One</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/rayman-legends-definitive-edition-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> (as well as all of those machines' successors thanks to backwards compatibility), and if you haven't played it yet, you really should.</p>
