            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has hired a new Senior Designer for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>. James Haeck, whose body of work includes many acclaimed supplements and modules for the world's most popular fantasy TTRPG, will now help shape that game for the future.</p><p>In a report from EN World, James Haeck announced on Ghostfire Games' Eldritch Lorecast podcast that he would be joining Wizards of the Coast's as a senior <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> designer. Haeck will join other writers who have been similarly promoted, including Game Design Director Justice Ramin Arman (<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/journeys-through-radiant-citadel-review" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Journeys Through the Radiant Citadel</em></a>), Makenzie de Armas (<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/vecna-eve-of-ruin-dd-5e-review-culmination-of-years-of-work" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Vecna: Eve of Ruin</em></a>), and James Wyatt (<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/van-richtens-guide-to-ravenloft-review" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft</em></a>).</p><picture>

  </picture><p>Like his peers, James Haeck has had a prolific career within the TTRPG space. He has written official <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> material for several years as a freelancer and is an Ennie Award-winning game designer. This work includes acclaimed modules like <em>Waterdeep: Dragon Heist</em> and <em>Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus</em>.</p><p>In addition, Haeck has contributed to other publications. These include <em>Draw Steel</em> developer MCDM and Ghostfire Games. His biggest contribution was to Darrington Press' Critical Role. He has written for <em>Explorer's Guide to Wildemount</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/taldorei-reborn-now-available-on-dd-beyond" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Tal'Dorei Reborn</em></a>, and was a co-writer on the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/critical-role-call-of-netherdeep-review" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Call of the Netherdeep</em></a> module.</p><p>The hiring of James Haeck by Wizards of the Coast appears to be an attempt to retain developer talent after the departure of creative leads Jeremy Crawford and Chris Perkins.&nbsp;</p><p>It can also be speculated that this new creative team may be working on a new wave of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> supplements in the style of the recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-forgotten-realms-heroes-of-faerun-and-adventures-in-faerun-review" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Forgotten Realms</a> books and <em>Eberron: Forge of the Artificer</em>. While Wizards of the Coast has been quiet, rumor has it that future books may include the debut of a new core class, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dungeons-dragons-2024-psion-ua-update-refines-new-psychic-casting-class" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Psion</a>, and potentially a return to the controversial post-apocalyptic <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-dungeons-dragons-unearthed-arcana-may-hint-at-return-to-dark-sun-setting" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Dark Sun</em></a> setting.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Major hardware player 8BitDo has announced a brand new device ahead of this month's CES showcase, which begins tomorrow, and if you've ever wanted to play games on your phone vertically rather than horizontally, the FlipPad is for you.</p><p>As spotted by the appropriately-named <a href="https://retrohandhelds.gg/8bitdo-announces-controller-built-for-vertical-mobile-gaming/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Retro Handhelds</a>, the FlipPad was revealed by 8BitDo over on <a href="https://x.com/8BitDo/status/2007844470444933384" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">social media</a>. The company describes the controller as "a flip-style gamepad designed for mobile gaming", and it'll be compatible with both iOS and Android phones.</p><p>8BitDo has earmarked the FlipPad for a summer release, but if you're lucky enough to be attending CES 2026, then you'll be able to experience the controller at 8BitDo's booth. Be sure to put it through its paces if that's you!</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>The 8BitDo FlipPad wants to be your vertical mobile gaming controller of choice.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As shown in the video clip accompanying the FlipPad's design, the controller connects to the USB-C port of your phone and can be flipped upwards to cover the bottom part of your screen. You can then swivel the FlipPad downwards when it's not in use.</p><p>Aesthetic-wise, as Retro Handhelds notes, the FlipPad bears more than a passing resemblance to one of the most iconic color schemes sported by the Nintendo Game Boy, which I can't imagine is an accidental choice.</p><p>Of course, since the FlipPad connects via your phone's charging port, you'll likely be able to use it just as you would any other regular controller, although you should bear in mind that it doesn't feature analog sticks, so this is very much a retro-focused device.</p><p>The FlipPad joins a mobile controller market that also includes heavyweights like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/backbone-pro-announcement" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="15935167-00e8-49bb-b367-3dba4b827098" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">the Backbone Pro</a> and offerings from companies <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/gamevice-is-smartphone-controller-worth-looking-into" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3002d824-ec13-462e-a34c-e7a6d3d44724" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">like Gamevice</a>, although it's fair to say 8BitDo's new offering is trying to serve a different niche than those venerable devices.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>The mobile controller field is very competitive indeed.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Perhaps of greater interest to 8BitDo in this case are handhelds like GameSir's <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/843605/gamesir-pocket-1-smartphone-android-wireless-bluetooth-controller" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">recently-announced Pocket 1</a>, which I'm sure the company will be keeping an eye on.
