            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>iRacing Studios, the developer behind the upcoming&nbsp;<em>NASCAR 25</em>, has announced a multi-year partnership to bring a series of IndyCar games to PC and consoles, starting with an inaugural title next year.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.indycar.com/news/2025/08/08-26-iracing-console-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on the official IndyCar website, the open-wheel racing brand reveals that the first IndyCar title is due to land on PC and current-gen consoles in "the second half of 2026".</p>

<p>It'll mark the first IndyCar game since 2004's&nbsp;<em>IndyCar Series 2005</em>, which was developed by legendary racing studio Codemasters (which also had the&nbsp;<em>WRC&nbsp;</em>series <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nacon-wrc-games-2027-2032" rel="nofollow">taken away from it by Nacon</a> recently amid rumors of a shutdown).</p>

<p>iRacing president Tony Gardner says that IndyCar fans have "long been clamoring for a standalone title for consoles", and that the studio's upcoming game will "offer all the excitement of the NTT IndyCar series and an immersive experience that fans of all ages can enjoy".</p>

<p>As for IndyCar's president J. Douglas Boles, he says that the IndyCar series is "the most competitive and challenging racing on the planet", and that as such, it "deserves a dedicated and widely available gaming experience".</p>

<p>You can expect a "robust, multilevel career mode" in iRacing's IndyCar game, as well as licensed drivers from the IndyCar series and Indy NXT. Naturally, the game will also support online multiplayer to help you prove your racing dominance around the world.</p>

<p>We'll likely learn more about IndyCar and iRacing's collaboration in the months to come, so stay tuned for more. When it launches, it's due on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, and it looks like it'll support Steam Deck as well.</p>
