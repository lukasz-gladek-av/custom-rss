            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-sales-3m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Medieval colony sim&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>has crossed another big sales milestone, publisher Hooded Horse and developer Slavic Magic have revealed.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>has now hit three million sales across all of the PC storefronts on which it's available. That means the game has picked up another million sales for itself in the time between now and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-sales-two-million" rel="nofollow">May last year</a>.</p>

<p>Three million is a particularly impressive number when considering that&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>is available on Game Pass (as long as you're a PC Game Pass or Game Pass Ultimate member, at any rate; the console version isn't available via the service).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/manor-lords-sales-3m-village.jpg?itok=LTg9_RtJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/manor-lords-sales-3m-village.jpg?itok=URerxqwZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>has hit another big sales milestone.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>was originally released via Early Access in April 2024, quickly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-price-player-count" rel="nofollow">climbing the Steam charts</a> and passing 120,000 concurrent players within just a few hours of its release (again, impressive given it landed on Game Pass on day one as well).</p>

<p>Within just a few days, the game had managed to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-sales-player-count" rel="nofollow">surpass a million sales</a>, and it had broken the two million barrier inside three weeks. Naturally, sales have slowed since then, but amassing another million sales in less than a year is solid work.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>is, it's a medieval colony sim-come-city builder in which you must build and oversee your very own village (hence the title).</p>

<p>You'll be responsible for overseeing the game's "complex economic and social simulations", guiding your village and constructing different districts depending on what you need to grow and flourish.</p>




<p><em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>does have combat, but by its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-manor-lords-roadmap-yet" rel="nofollow">own developer's admission</a>, it's not intended to be a&nbsp;<em>Total War&nbsp;</em>competitor; it's a city builder with battles rather than a war simulator with city building.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>right now on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1363080/Manor_Lords/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/manor_lords" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/manor-lords-ef795f" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Epic</a>, and the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/manor-lords-game-preview/9p5f966564fs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Microsoft Store</a>, and it's also available on Xbox.</p>
