            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/arrowhead-tencent-stake-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report has emerged which claims that Chinese gaming and tech giant Tencent purchased a 15% stake in&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>developer Arrowhead Game Studios last year.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tencent-has-acquired-15-75-of-arrowhead-game-studios/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Insider Gaming</a> (which in turn cites Swedish publications <a href="https://www.di.se/digital/spelsuccen-gor-729-mkr-i-vinst-tencent-koper-in-sig/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Dagens Industri</a> and <a href="https://www.di.se/digital/spelsuccen-gor-729-mkr-i-vinst-tencent-koper-in-sig/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Breakit</a>), Tencent paid roughly $83 million for the stake, which represents a fraction of Arrowhead's reported valuation of about $532 million.</p>

<p>Insider Gaming also says that Arrowhead chief creative officer Johan Pilestedt welcomed the deal, claiming that it will open up the Chinese market for Arrowhead. Pilestedt also apparently said that the Chinese player base is the "holy grail" in the gaming industry (a quote for which Insider uses machine translation).</p>

The company is one of Ubisoft's major shareholders, having recently had a major role in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft--report-new-gaming-entity-core-ip" rel="nofollow">creation of a new entity</a> that will handle much of Ubisoft's most popular IP.</p>

<p>Tencent also counts&nbsp;<em>Dying Light&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tencent-techland-majority-stakeholder" rel="nofollow">Techland</a>,&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls&nbsp;</em>studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tencent-and-sony-buy-over-30-shares-in-from-software" rel="nofollow">FromSoftware</a>, and&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>giant Epic Games among its investments, with the latter having landed Tencent in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/us-government-investigating-epic-games-riot-games-due-to-tencent" rel="nofollow">hot water with the US government</a> in the past.</p>

<p>That's not to mention Tencent's many collaborations with other studios in the gaming industry, like its&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-outlanders-mobile-rpg" rel="nofollow"><em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>mobile RPG</a> or its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-mobile-revealed" rel="nofollow">mobile version of&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-mobile-revealed" rel="nofollow">Final Fantasy XIV</a>&nbsp;</em>(which has yet to come to the West). Suffice it to say Tencent is a pretty big deal, even for the Western gaming industry.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with Arrowhead, meanwhile, its most recent (and by far its biggest) game is PS5 and PC exclusive&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-financials-helldivers-2-sales" rel="nofollow">passed twelve million sales last year</a>&nbsp;and which has a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/helldivers-2-board-game-fully-funded-in-12-minutes-on-gamefound" rel="nofollow">board game adaptation</a> on the way as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/arrowhead-tencent-helldivers-2-mech.jpg?itok=igpWSSDF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/arrowhead-tencent-helldivers-2-mech.jpg?itok=YUxI8iJ6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>is a big deal for Arrowhead.</figcaption></figure><p>Despite&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>'s monumental success, creative director Johan Pilestedt is already thinking about what to do next; in January, he <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-johan-pilestedt-sabbatical" rel="nofollow">announced he would take a "sabbatical"</a> before returning to work on the studio's next project.</p>

<p>It's unlikely that Tencent's investment in Arrowhead will result in any major creative changes for the company, but we'll have to wait and see what happens next. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-myth-wukong-xbox-series-x-s-version-arriving-exactly-a-year-after-ps5-launch.1209180/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-xbox-series-xs-version<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Exactly one year after its release on PS5 and PC, celebrated Soulslike action RPG&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>is finally coming to Xbox Series X|S.</p>

<p>Xbox <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1930806857725026414" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">confirms the news</a> in a post on X, simultaneously revealing a release date of August 20th, which is, to the day, exactly a year after it was released on Sony's platform and on PC.</p>

<p>This release date arguably throws some doubt on the idea that the Xbox Series S console's memory limitations were to blame for the port's delay, which was the official line taken by developer Game Science <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-xbox-port-series-s" rel="nofollow">back in January this year</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/black-myth-wukong-xbox-series-xs-release-date-potion.jpg?itok=1BFhyhK4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/black-myth-wukong-xbox-series-xs-release-date-potion.jpg?itok=K90vimi5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>is finally coming to Xbox Series X|S.</figcaption></figure><p>Certainly, some <a href="https://x.com/NikTekOfficial/status/1930854070551523584" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">people</a> in the replies for Xbox's message are <a href="https://x.com/SnapBlastPLAY/status/1930905753251922425" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">speculating</a> that the previously-mooted Sony exclusivity deal may be the <a href="https://x.com/Charmer184/status/1930834254499590506" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reason</a> for the August 20th release date, or at the very least that the Xbox Series S' memory limitations weren't really to blame.</p>

<p>In fairness to Microsoft and Game Science, the Xbox Series S is a notably less powerful machine than the Series X, and&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>is a notoriously demanding game, requiring some pretty hefty hardware to run well on PC.</p>

<p>In any case, if you're an Xbox Series owner, you'll finally get to play&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>on your console on August 20th. The timing of this announcement is also notable, coming as it does just two days before Xbox's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-summer-show-date-2025-the-outer-worlds-2" rel="nofollow">Summer Game Fest showcase</a>.</p>

<p>While we don't know what surprises Xbox has in store for that show, we can reasonably guess that a release date for&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2&nbsp;</em>will be revealed, given that a showcase specifically dedicated to the game will air after Xbox's main show.</p>

We'll have to wait and see what that show has in store.</p>
