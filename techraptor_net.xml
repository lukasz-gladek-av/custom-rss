            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has revealed that&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>has hit a major download milestone since launching almost a year ago, and that there are some big bonuses in the offing for players to celebrate the game's impending first birthday.</p>

<p>As announced in an <a href="https://press.pokemon.com/en/releases/Pokemon-Trading-Card-Game-Pocket-Celebrates-Its-First-Anniversary-and-" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official press release</a>,&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>has been downloaded over 150 million times across Android and iOS since its launch <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-release-date" rel="nofollow">on October 23rd last year</a>.</p>

<p>While it's certainly true that not everyone who downloaded the game will still be playing it (and still fewer may have spent actual money on anything within the app), it was reported back in December that&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-dena-revenue" rel="nofollow">a real moneyspinner for developer DeNA</a>.</p>

<p>New missions and promo reissue events will also be arriving alongside these packs, and you can look forward to new in-app updates landing soon as well, including the new Share feature, an expanded range of cards to be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-update-new-expansion-release-date" rel="nofollow">traded</a>, and more.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>, it's a digital version of the popular&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>trading card game in which you can open digital booster packs, trade cards with your friends, and battle using custom-built (or pre-built!) decks.</p>

<p>Since launch, various expansions have been released for the game, including the likes of the Gen 2-themed&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-wisdom-of-sea-and-sky-expansion" rel="nofollow"><em>Wisdom of Sea and Sky</em></a>, the Eevee-centric&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-eevee-grove" rel="nofollow"><em>Eevee Grove</em></a>, and the cosmic&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-celestial-guardians-set" rel="nofollow">Celestial Guardians</a>&nbsp;</em>set, among many others.</p>




<p>The game has also been the subject of controversy and criticism; when the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Wisdom of Sea and Sky&nbsp;</em>launched, an immersive art card was pulled from&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>over <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-ho-oh-production-issue-plagiarism" rel="nofollow">accusations of plagiarism</a>.</p>

<p>Not only that, but the trading feature was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trade-tokens" rel="nofollow">met with widespread criticism</a> when it was first added to the game, prompting DeNA and The Pokemon Company to award players free trade tokens by way of an apology.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>for free right now on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.pokemon.pokemontcgp&amp;hl=en_GB" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pok%C3%A9mon-tcg-pocket/id6479970832" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">iOS</a>.</p>
