The latest installment, Horrified: Dungeons &amp; Dragons, is courtesy of a licensed partnership with Wizards of the Coast, bringing certain iconic dungeon-dwelling beasts to the board game series.</p>

<h2>The Horrified: Dungeons &amp; Dragons Announcement</h2>

<p>In a press release, Ravensburger provided more details on <em>Horrified: Dungeons &amp; Dragons. </em>As the name implies, the game will combine the core gameplay of the Horrified board game with the world's most popular TTRPG. This will be the fifth official entry in the <em>Horrified</em> series behind 2023's <em>Horrified: Greek Monsters</em> and 2021's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/horrified-american-monsters-board-game-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Horrified: American Monsters</em></a>.</p>

One of those monsters is the legendary Beholder, the many-eyed aberrations that have doomed many adventuring groups over the decades.</p>

<p>In addition, they will need to handle other game mechanics inspired by the RPG. Players will work together, encounter puzzle-like obstacles, gather item tokens, protect citizens, and avoid attacks. Also to immerse players into a detailed setting and story, each monster will have unique thematic challenges.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The extensive lore and world-building of D&amp;D enables players to embark on epic journeys as they quest to battle deadly foes, uncover secrets and make memories together,” said Dan Rawson, Senior Vice President, D&amp;D, RPG and Hasbro Direct at Wizards of the Coast. “Connection and storytelling are at the core of D&amp;D, and we’re always looking for new ways for players to immerse themselves in the fantasy realm. Bringing the franchise’s rich characters to something like Horrified, which features narrative-driven adventure and cooperative gameplay, just feels natural.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Horrified: Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> will be available Summer 2025 at an MSRP of $29.99.</p>
