            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ryan Burns, the developer behind psychological horror game <em>The Oily Depths</em>, has slashed the game's price permanently in response to player feedback, so now's your chance to get it much, much cheaper.</p><p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3113030/view/542256414786060359" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">news post</a> on the game's Steam page, Burns says he's been "listening closely" to player feedback following the release of <em>The Oily Depths</em>, which happened earlier this week.</p><p>After reviewing player comments and "taking a hard look at where the game stands right now", Burns decided to cut <em>The Oily Depths</em>' price from $8 down to just $3. That's a price cut of over 60%, and it's not a temporary sale, either; that's a permanent cut.</p><figure role="group">

<p>Burns says he wants every player to feel as though "they got a great value out of their experience" with <em>The Oily Depths</em>, and that he believes the new price "better reflects the scope and length of the game".</p><p>If you did buy <em>The Oily Depths </em>at its original price, Burns says that given the game's short length, you should still be within the Steam refund window, so you can ask for a refund "and repurchase at the new price if you'd like".</p><p>As a quick reminder, Steam refunds are offered to players with fewer than two hours' playtime in a game, as long as they've owned that game for less than two weeks. Since <em>The Oily Depths </em>came out on February 9th, the latter, at least, applies to every player right now.</p><p>If you're wondering exactly what <em>The Oily Depths </em>is, it's a short horror adventure <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-oily-depths-ex-blizzard-ubisoft-dev" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9d7b5677-68b0-4a7b-8a7c-8bf4bc8cb7eb" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">created by ex-Blizzard staffer Ryan Burns</a>, and it combines a lo-fi, chunky art style with gameplay that revolves around examining and maintaining machines abord a deep-sea submarine.</p>
<p>You can check out <em>The Oily Depths </em>at its new price on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3113030/The_Oily_Depths/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC via Steam</a> right now.

<p>When it comes to Nexon's other franchises, the popular <em>Dungeon&amp;Fighter </em>franchise grew in both China and Korea on PC, although <em>Dungeon&amp;Fighter Mobile </em>is struggling somewhat. The <em>MapleStory </em>franchise, meanwhile, seems to be going from strength to strength across all of its iterations.</p><p><em>The First Descendant</em>, meanwhile, served as Nexon's third best-selling franchise in North America and Europe, coming in behind the aforementioned <em>MapleStory </em>and <em>Arc Raiders</em>. Revenue for Embark's other shooter, <em>The Finals</em>,<em> </em>also apparently grew during the fourth quarter.</p><p><em>Arc Raiders </em>was first revealed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-announcement-from-game-awards-2021" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="371b9b88-7644-4a02-9183-477032433072" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">back at the 2021 Game Awards</a> and was originally due to launch in 2022, although it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/arc-raiders-delay-pushes-release-date-to-2023" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="eb70e4ac-4ed0-4322-b525-b44038581489" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">delayed</a> a number of times before finally settling on a late 2025 launch date. When it was released, it quickly gained an audience, selling <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/arc-raiders-sales-4m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="08dd5792-c4a8-4824-90f6-27b50a7dc7fa" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">four million copies in under two weeks</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>By Christmas, <em>Arc Raiders </em>had reached 12 million sales, a milestone even Nexon and developer Embark don't appear to have expected; the reward they prepared for said milestone was actually intended for the 10 million mark.</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with the game, it's a multiplayer extraction shooter that blends PvP and PvE combat, with teams of players taking to the field to battle both each other and the hostile machines of a post-apocalyptic world.</p><p>You can check out <em>Arc Raiders </em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1808500/ARC_Raiders/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/arc-raiders/9NDF1F263RZ4" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a> if you'd like to see what all the fuss is about.
