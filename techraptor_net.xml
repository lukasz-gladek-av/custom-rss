            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dynasty-warriors-origins-sales-1m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Koei Tecmo has revealed that&nbsp;<em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins&nbsp;</em>sales have hit their first major milestone exactly a month after the game's initial release.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins&nbsp;</em>has racked up a million sales across PC and current-gen consoles. Not only that, but the game's demo, which is available to check out right now, has amassed over two million downloads.</p>

<p>To celebrate the sales milestone, Koei Tecmo also posted some new artwork featuring the amnesiac main character of&nbsp;<em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em>, along with the kindly doctor Yuanhua, who's helping our protagonist look for answers about his past.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dynasty-warriors-origins-sales-1m-artwork.jpg?itok=WqShp_vW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dynasty-warriors-origins-sales-1m-artwork.jpg?itok=T5N-p9lS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em>&nbsp;has officially sold over a million copies.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em>, it's the latest entry in Koei Tecmo's long-running hack-and-slash series, which actually <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/dynasty-warriors-fighting-game-turned-musou" rel="nofollow">started life as a one-on-one fighter</a> serving as a spinoff of the publisher's&nbsp;<em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms&nbsp;</em>franchise.</p>

<p>Although the name might lead you to believe that <i>Origins&nbsp;</i>is a prequel, that's only true in a certain sense. The game still takes place in the time period covered by the classical Chinese novel&nbsp;<em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms</em>, but it focuses heavily on the first half rather than encompassing the whole thing.</p>

<p>Rather uniquely for&nbsp;<em>Dynasty Warriors</em>,&nbsp;<em>Origins&nbsp;</em>features an original protagonist, and in much the same way as Team Ninja's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/wo-long-fallen-dynasty" rel="nofollow"><em>Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty</em></a>, the story revolves around our main character as he meets famous historical figures and helps them to beat the snot out of hundreds of enemies on the battlefield.</p>




<p>Narrative changes aside, however,&nbsp;<em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins&nbsp;</em>offers more of the same large-scale tactical hack-and-slash combat you've come to know (and potentially love) from the franchise, so you'll probably already know whether this one's for you or not.</p>

<p><em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2384580/DYNASTY_WARRIORS_ORIGINS/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/dynasty-warriors-origins/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/dynasty-warriors-origins/9p5hjqnx53xj" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dark-and-darker-lawsuit-trade-secret-infringement<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Korean courts have ruled that Ironmace's dungeon-crawling PvPvE action RPG&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker&nbsp;</em>did not infringe on Nexon's copyright, but that it did infringe on the company's trade secrets, necessitating a payment of around 8.5 billion Korean won (around $6 million).</p>

<p>Per Korean news platform <a href="https://biz.chosun.com/en/en-it/2025/02/13/MXHA4WV3ANHRFCJZQI4UE4HTQE/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Chosun</a>, the Seoul Central District Court's Civil Division 63 came to the decision yesterday. It essentially represents both a win and a loss for Ironmace.</p>

<p>For context, since 2023,&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker&nbsp;</em>has been the subject of an ongoing legal battle between developer Ironmace and Korean studio Nexon, several ex-employees of which make up some of Ironmace's ranks.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dark-and-darker-court-case-trade-secret-infringement-skeletons.jpg?itok=o1901PnW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dark-and-darker-court-case-trade-secret-infringement-skeletons.jpg?itok=LR9qxE_F 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dark and Darker&nbsp;</em>developer Ironmace must pay Nexon around $6 million for trade secret infringement.</figcaption></figure><p>Nexon alleged in its lawsuit that&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker&nbsp;</em>bore striking similarities to an internal game tentatively codenamed&nbsp;<em>P3</em>. That project's leader Ju-Hyun Choi was fired from Nexon in August 2021 and went on to create&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker&nbsp;</em>alongside several other ex-Nexon staffers.</p>

<p>According to Nexon, assets from&nbsp;<em>P3</em>'s development were leaked by Choi onto an external non-Nexon server, and those assets were instrumental in Choi's decision to try and create a game that would play similarly to&nbsp;<em>P3</em>.</p>

<p>The lawsuit led to Nexon <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dark-and-darker-developers-respond-to-dmca-takedown-from-nexon-after-removal-from-steam" rel="nofollow">issuing a DMCA takedown</a> against&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker&nbsp;</em>on Steam in March 2023 (although the game has since been restored to the platform) and also resulted in a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dark-and-darker-early-access-delayed-bit-following-legal-dispute-against-nexon" rel="nofollow">delay to the game's eventual 1.0 release</a>, according to Ironmace.</p>

<p>From Chosun's report, it sounds as though the Korean court agrees with Nexon that material was leaked onto a server from inside the company, but the court doesn't consider this matter to fall under the umbrella of copyright infringement.</p>




<p>It's not clear whether Nexon will pursue any further legal action against Ironmace and&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker</em>, but for now, it looks as though the studio and its game won't be facing any more imminent legal threats or takedowns.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2016590/Dark_and_Darker/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and mobile devices.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/ethnos-2nd-edition-review-breezy-power-struggle</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ethnos-2nd-edition-review-a-breezy-power-struggle.1109643/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/ethnos-2nd-edition-review-breezy-power-struggle<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Published by CMON, I got the chance to try out Paolo Mori's&nbsp;<i>Ethnos 2nd Edition</i> thanks to a preview copy sent by distributor Asmodee USA. This update to the original <i>Ethnos </i>game features all new artwork, updated components, a new clan, and a solo-player mode. Follow along as I dive in!</p>

<h2>What Is <i>Ethnos 2nd Edition</i>?</h2>

<p>In <i>Ethnos 2nd Edition</i>, players take on the role of aspiring leaders battling for control of the continent of Ethnos, with the goal of becoming emperor. To&nbsp;do so, you’ll need to gain the help of scattered clans, uniting them in your quest for conquest.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Ethnos 2nd Edition</i> Stats:</p>

<ul><li>1 - 6 Players</li>
	<li>Est. Game Time: 60 Minutes</li>
	<li>Game Genre: Tableau Building, Area Influence</li>
	<li>Complexity: Medium</li>
</ul></blockquote>

<h2>How Do I Play&nbsp;<em>Ethnos 2nd Edition</em>?</h2>

<p>Setup begins by laying out the central board and determining which six of the twelve included clans will be a part of the game (after your first few games with more straightforward clans, this is determined randomly, which adds nice variability from game to game). Each clan has a different special ability, and you'll take turns either drawing Ally cards from a shared pool or playing Ally cards from your hand.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ethnos-2nd-edition-board-and-cards.jpg?itok=s-LwuS-r 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ethnos-2nd-edition-board-and-cards.jpg?itok=V5w1jpm8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>When you play a set of Ally cards, they have to either each be of the same clan, or be from different clans but all in the same color. You do this to place a control marker (nicely stackable pagoda-style plastic pieces) on a section of the map matching the color of the top card you play in your set.</p>

<p>Which card you choose to be the top of your stack of Ally cards, or to "lead" the set you play, also triggers' that top card's special ability. If you have more Ally cards than the amount of control markers present in any given color-coded territory, you place your marker.</p>

<p>This creates a really interesting gameplay loop of trying to build sets of cards in your hand, and determining the right time to lay down your sets of cards to place control markers. If it weren't for the cards' special abilities, this would be a very, very simple game - but each clan can do its own thing to slightly tweak the rules, opening up layers upon layers of strategy.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ethnos-2nd-edition-card-sets.jpg?itok=o3RrwLZe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ethnos-2nd-edition-card-sets.jpg?itok=4frAjCFH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2><em>Ethnos 2nd Edition&nbsp;</em>Clan Abilities Add A Dash Of Complexity</h2>

<p>As I'd mentioned above, there are twelve different animal-themed clans in the game. You'll play with six of them present during your play through, and each one has different goals, can offer additional scoring opportunities, and more!</p>

<p>These abilities are all vastly different, and I won't lay them all out here, but I'll give a few examples. The Owl Summoners Clan allows you to play an additional party of Ally cards from your hand when you play a party with an Owl as leader (normally you have to discard the rest of your hand). The Tiger Samurai Clan needs one less card than usual to place a control marker in a region. The Monkey Nomads Clan has a separate board you'll set up when they're in play, allowing you to place markers to gain additional points.</p>

<p>That's just scratching the surface, with some clans being more complicated, or requiring extra components, while some are more straightforward. We've played&nbsp;<em>Ethnos 2nd Edition</em>&nbsp;over and over again in the past month or so, and the combinations we've come across, and fun interactions, never cease to amaze. It truly feels like an entirely different game each time I play it.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ethnos-2nd-edition-game-board.jpg?itok=Aan1-cwX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ethnos-2nd-edition-game-board.jpg?itok=XmDpF1Zy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>What's New With <em>Ethnos 2nd</em> Edition?</h2>

<p>As you can tell from the game's title, this is a brand new edition of the game, and it comes with some quality of life changes... and an entirely new clan! The entire game has been given an overhaul visually, with all new clan names, brand new artwork on the board and cards, and new balance tweaks for Prestige points (formerly known as Glory points).</p>

<p>I'd never played the original&nbsp;<em>Ethnos</em>, but looking at&nbsp;<em>Ethnos 2nd Edition</em>&nbsp;it's clear what a difference these graphical changes make. The game board is easier to read, and the cards now feature bright, anthropomorphic animals vs. old fantasy creatures in the original edition. They've also done away with any text on the cards, instead using symbols to communicate each clan's special ability.</p>

<p>Though a bit daunting at first, after a few plays of the game we were familiar with the meaning of the symbols, and happy to not have lots of text cluttering the cards.</p>

<p>Then there's the new Clan, the Raccoon Merchants Clan - this clan adds coins - which serve as extra points when scoring - to the region they're played in. It provides a nice additional twist, and can begin to ramp up competition for particularly valuable regions pretty quickly.</p>

<p>The new edition also boasts a solo mode, where you can play alone against the game itself. The rules for solo mode look detailed and well-thought out, with tight mechanics around how the game's antagonist, Chief Bruno, draws and plays cards.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ethnos-2nd-edition-playing-a-set-of-blue-cards.jpg?itok=5_PpC4SS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ethnos-2nd-edition-playing-a-set-of-blue-cards.jpg?itok=YF6A-a5n 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2><em>Ethnos 2nd Edition</em>&nbsp;- Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><em>Ethnos 2nd Edition</em>&nbsp;is one of the more easy-to-grasp set collection and area control games I've played in a while. And in our playtesting we found the gameplay extremely satisfying once you have a firm grasp on what each of the clans on the board can do.</p>

<p>I&nbsp;<em>loved</em>&nbsp;2023's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/archeos-society-review-is-this-years-best-board-game" rel="nofollow"><em>Archeos Society</em></a>, which was also designed by Paolo Mori and features similar gameplay mechanics. And overall, I do prefer&nbsp;<em>Archeos Society</em>&nbsp;over&nbsp;<em>Ethnos</em>, as I feel it&nbsp;refined the gameplay elements Mori worked through with this game.</p>

<p>But here's the big question: if you already own <i>Ethnos</i>, do you need to pick up this second edition? If you found the text-heavy cards, overall theme of the game, or map not to your taste, then this version of the game makes marked improvements in all three areas, and might make what is a very fun play experience even more to your taste.</p>

<p>And whether you already own it or not, there's certainly something nice about playing this streamlined set collector - and if you haven't tried the game before, and like what you've read so far, it's definitely worth checking out.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/infinity-nikki-steam-confirmed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Infold Games has announced that an <i>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</i>Steam release is on the way, so you're in luck if you've been wanting to add the cozy open-world adventure to your library on Valve's app.</p>

<p>In a press release, Infold confirms that the game, which has attracted more than 20 million downloads since launching in December, will support cross-progression, so you'll be able to pick up where you left off on Steam.</p>

<p>It does sound like that feature will require an Infold Games account, though, so if you were hoping to check out&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>on Steam without signing up to another third-party account, it looks like you'll be out of luck.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/infinity-nikki-steam-balloons.jpg?itok=PHDGykfy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/infinity-nikki-steam-balloons.jpg?itok=KjRwbbsJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>is floating its way onto Steam.</figcaption></figure><p>Not only will&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>be available on Steam, but it'll also boast "the full range of features unique to the platform", according to Infold Games. That means widespread controller support, Steam achievements, and "social integration".</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/InfinityNikkiEN/status/1890262857750905235" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message</a> on X, Infold says that each <em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>Steam wishlist milestone it reaches will result in more rewards for players. Getting 10,000 wishlists will grant players some "live wallpaper", while hitting 50,000 will reveal some new concept art.</p>

<p>At 100,000 wishlists, Infold will reveal "more surprises", while 200,000 wishlists will result in "the final surprise" being granted to players. That sounds pretty ominous, but given&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki</em>'s cozy vibes and cutesy aesthetic, I'm sure it'll be something light-hearted.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/infinity-nikki-steam-wishlists.jpg?itok=CNySqrzm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/infinity-nikki-steam-wishlists.jpg?itok=AbpvQSXJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Wishlisting&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>on Steam could lead to something good.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki</em>, it's an open-world adventure that emphasizes platforming, minigames, and general cozy vibes rather than action-packed setpieces or tense combat.</p>

<p>The game sees Nikki and her companion Momo exploring the world of Miraland, and while there is a story (and it's got some pretty high stakes at that), the focus here is much more on enjoying the game however you want to.</p>

<p>Since release,&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>has proven pretty popular, attracting <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/infinity-nikki-downloads-10m" rel="nofollow">over 10 million downloads in just a few days</a>. Two major <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/infinity-nikki-version-1-1" rel="nofollow">updates</a> have been released for the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/infinity-nikki-version-12-release-date" rel="nofollow">so far</a>, bringing new outfits, story content, and more.</p>

<p><em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>is available now on <a href="https://infinitynikki.infoldgames.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fantasy-life-i-release-date-confirmed-for-may-additional-platforms-revealed.1109583/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Level-5 has announced the&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</em>release date, with the long-awaited JRPG landing not only on Switch but also on other platforms in May.</p>

<p>That's right: after numerous delays,&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em>finally has a concrete release date, and it's May 21st. Not only that, but the game will be arriving across PC, PlayStation, and Xbox as well as Switch.</p>

<p><em>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</em>was first revealed during a February <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/february-2023-nintendo-direct-here-are-all-news-announcements" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Direct presentation</a>, at which point it was given a release window of 2023. That release window later proved to be overly optimistic, though, as in November of that year, Level-5 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-girl-who-steals-time-delayed" rel="nofollow">delayed the game to 2024</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fantasy-life-i-release-date-dragon-characters.jpg?itok=64Wg7ErB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fantasy-life-i-release-date-dragon-characters.jpg?itok=kKa7QJEQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</em>finally has a release date.</figcaption></figure><p>Eventually, a release date of October 10th was settled on for&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i</em>, but it was then announced that the game wouldn't make that date either, with Level-5 delaying its "slow life" RPG <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-girl-who-steals-time-delayed-indefinitely" rel="nofollow">indefinitely in August last year</a>.</p>

<p>Now, however, Level-5 has announced a release date for&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i</em>, and it looks like the studio is serious about this one, although there's every chance it'll be delayed again before May 21st rolls around.</p>

<p>The release date was revealed as part of a brand new features trailer for&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i</em>, showing off the things you can do in the game. If you're a fan of the original 3DS&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life</em>, then it's likely you'll find a lot to like here as well.</p>

<p>Not only can you adventure across a "vast open world" and choose which one of a variety of jobs you want to pursue, but you can also create and maintain your own island, delve into "endless dungeons", and even play the game in split-screen co-op.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-financials-cost-cutting-q3<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has revealed that it plans to implement yet more cost-cutting measures into the next financial year in order to exceed its cost reduction targets "by a significant margin".</p>

<p>In its latest financial <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/2GbdOQTUuRZV3mqGXgTfeK/520f2262c4f60b4bc13f0f3a59ec37e7/Ubisoft_FY25_Q3_PR_English_vFinal.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a> (which covers the period between October and December 2024), Ubisoft reveals that its "net bookings" - essentially net sales sans fees and other cancellations - fell by 34.8% when compared to the same period last year.</p>

<p>The company points to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing" rel="nofollow">cancellation of first-person shooter&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing" rel="nofollow">XDefiant</a>&nbsp;</em>and the closure of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-layoffs-leamington-closure" rel="nofollow">three</a> Ubisoft locations as major cost reduction initiatives, and CEO Yves Guillemot says Ubisoft isn't done yet, although he doesn't clarify exactly what's coming next.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ubisoft-finances-cost-cutting-xdefiant.jpg?itok=6spiOGKj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ubisoft-finances-cost-cutting-xdefiant.jpg?itok=bhcu7Nf7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ubisoft canned first-person shooter&nbsp;<em>XDefiant&nbsp;</em>in December.</figcaption></figure><p>Guillemot says that Ubisoft "plan[s] to pursue [its] efforts" with regards to cost-cutting measures into the 2025-26 financial year, "going beyond the initial target by a significant margin".</p>

<p>It's not entirely clear what he means by that, but given that previous cost-cutting measures have involved layoffs and studio closures, it's not unlikely that we'll see more of that kind of thing in the year to come.</p>

<p>He also says that the "formal review process of [Ubisoft's] strategic options" is ongoing, with a view to "unlock[ing] the best value from our assets for our stakeholders" and fostering the "best conditions to create great games in a fast-evolving market".</p>

<p>For context, a Ubisoft shareholder <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activist-ubisoft-investor-open-letter-change" rel="nofollow">called for "strategic and structural change"</a> at the company back in September, reportedly prompting Guillemot and major stakeholder Tencent to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-bosses-tencent-private-buyout-report" rel="nofollow">consider taking the company private</a>.</p>

<p>As noted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisoft-ceo-says-the-plan-is-to-focus-on-open-world-and-live-service-games-year-after-year/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">VGC</a>, during a followup Q&amp;A session, Guillemot told investors that Ubisoft is committed to "open-world action adventure" games and "game as a service-native experiences" for the foreseeable future, so if you were hoping for a&nbsp;<em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown&nbsp;</em>sequel, you may well be disappointed.</p>
