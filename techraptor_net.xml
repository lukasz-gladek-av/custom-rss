            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Josef Fares, the creator of <em>It Takes Two</em>, <em>Split Fiction</em>, and <em>A Way Out</em>, has provided an update on how a couple of his games are doing in sales terms, and it probably won't shock you to learn that <em>Split Fiction </em>hasn't stopped its siblings from continuing to do numbers.</p><p>In a recent interview with The Game Business' Christopher Dring, Fares says that his co-op parenting therapy simulator <em>It Takes Two </em>has now reached "almost 27 million" copies sold, which means it's racked up another 7 million <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hazelight-josef-fares-new-ip-it-takes-two-sales" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="633e6441-117c-4a56-a95e-474174ff5be7" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">since October 2024</a>.</p><p>As a reminder, <em>It Takes Two </em>allows you to play through the entire game with a friend even if they don't own the game thanks to its Friend's Pass (which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-friends-pass-crossplay" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="18aa71dd-1fab-4eaf-acb2-d391c4557f22" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Split Fiction </em>also offers</a>), so sales could be even higher were it not for that concession.</p><figure role="group">

<p>It's not just <em>It Takes Two </em>that's doing well, though. In the aforementioned interview, Fares also confirms that <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/way-out" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e2cb188e-f0aa-4666-85ea-d14e29df56e5" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>A Way Out</em></a>, which was Hazelight's first foray into co-op-exclusive adventuring, has sold "over 12 million" copies as well.</p><p>Of course, <em>Split Fiction</em>, the studio's latest title, is "doing very well as well", according to Fares. At last count, <em>Split Fiction </em>had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-sales-4m-battlefield-skate" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="780fa581-f417-4e89-86d1-414cbf5909f8" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">sold four million copies</a>, and since that figure is from May last year, it's likely to be much further ahead than that by now.</p><p><em>Split Fiction</em>'s success is such that a movie version is in the works, with a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-movie-report" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="249fa328-8f25-4975-b468-c4dc37526434" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">bidding war reportedly taking place</a> over the rights to said movie. Sydney Sweeney is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-movie-sydney-sweeney" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="105b35be-df6f-4f5c-8f24-3e9c7adc0b61" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">apparently attached to star in the movie</a>, and <em>Deadpool and Wolverine</em>'s writers will be penning the script.</p><p>Back in 2022, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/it-takes-two-movie-and-tv-adaptations-in-works" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e533eb5a-c393-43f4-836a-16e1dbdf765e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">movie and TV adaptations</a> of <em>It Takes Two </em>were also mooted, but we haven't heard much more about those since then. Hopefully, this new sales milestone will convince those involved to get a move on.</p>
