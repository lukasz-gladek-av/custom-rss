            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Konami has announced that sales of recent stealth remake&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater&nbsp;</em>have reached a major milestone.</p>

<p>According to a press release,&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater&nbsp;</em>has managed to surpass a million sales across both physical and digital versions (and, naturally, across all platforms). This, Konami says, "reflects the enduring popularity of the&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear&nbsp;</em>series".</p>

<p>In case you need a reminder,&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater&nbsp;</em>is a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-3-remake-announced-at-state-of-play" rel="nofollow">faithfully-rendered remake</a> of the original 2004 stealth classic, complete with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-d-snake-eater-remake-reveals-first-spectacular-gameplay-in-unreal" rel="nofollow">revamped visuals and gameplay</a>, as well as new quality-of-life improvements.</p>

<p>Changes include a new over-the-shoulder camera mode, as well as the ability to switch between various camo presets on the fly, thus (I think) fixing one of the original game's most irksome problems.</p>

<p>The visuals have also been updated and reworked courtesy of the game's shift to Unreal Engine 5, making for some pretty breathtaking jungle vistas and some rather impressive character model work to boot.</p>

<p>If, however, you're expecting a completely transformative remake along the lines of&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>, you're going to be disappointed;&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta&nbsp;</em>retains the skeleton of the original game, so it's really just the visuals and gameplay that have been tweaked and improved.</p>




<p>If you're playing on PC or PlayStation 5, you'll also find the classic Snake vs. Monkey mode included, and a new Fox Hunt multiplayer mode is also set to debut on all platforms later this year.</p>

<p><em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater&nbsp;</em>is available now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2417610/METAL_GEAR_SOLID_D_SNAKE_EATER/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater.algolia/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/metal-gear-solid-d-snake-eater/9pjln214rtkq" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.
