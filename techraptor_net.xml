            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="25b964ba-1595-45a4-84b1-e7d705f5dc6c" href="https://techraptor.net/games/astrobotanica" rel="nofollow"><em>Astrobotanica</em></a>&nbsp;is an indie survival title being developed by&nbsp;Space Goblin Studio. Funded through a Kickstarter campaign, the title offers a relaxing survival experience during the prehistoric era of Earth. Playing as an alien named Xel, you have the technology to scan plants, animals, and cavemen, create various tonics that can cure illnesses, decrease air needs, and more. I've been interested in the game since I first heard about the Kickstarter campaign and jumped at the chance to dive into the demo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The bulk of the demo consists of scanning different plants to learn what they do, interacting with one caveman named Ube, and solving puzzles. It gives a relatively well-rounded feel of what&nbsp;<em>Astrobotanica</em>&nbsp;offers to the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="taxonomy_term" data-entity-uuid="a90d9136-1388-4f79-8f46-10943fc6369d" href="https://techraptor.net/genre/survival" rel="nofollow">survival genre</a> mechanics wise. You scan plants and animals to see what they are. Scanning Neanderthals allows you to see what their current health status is. Interacting with them gives you to the chance to heal them and learn their language. Plants have different properties raw and when made into a tonic, with tonic making being a frequent action for surviving.&nbsp;</p>

From collecting trophies to put in specific places, using plant juices, or pushing orbs found in ruins to their correct position, the puzzles stand out as one of the interesting parts of the game. Not only were there multiple things to solve, all of the puzzles were different. If this variety is kept up in the complete version it will give&nbsp;<em>Astrobotanica</em>&nbsp;the ability to stand out amongst competitors that have 2-3 puzzle layouts that repeat with various difficulty through those titles.</p>

<h2>Lacking a Hook</h2>

<p>While most of the game mechanics are well explained, there is zero story tying game aspects together. Why are you on this planet? Why do you want to heal Neanderthals? What is your name? The only way you find out what you're called or your appearance is from the P.R.I.M.A.L. tab. Besides that, there's little else to really give you a reason to do, well, anything. If you don't watch any trailers, read the in-depth Steam page description, or skim through news about&nbsp;<em>Astrobotanica</em>, you have no idea what the game is about. What is the over-arcing goal that you're meant to work towards?</p>

<p>Hopefully the lack of narrative is due to the demo being a small sample of the early access version.&nbsp;<em>Astrobotanica</em>&nbsp;is supposed to be rich with lore, and hints of that are present. You can find different idols and stone tablets while exploring the demo area. However, what they represent or say, and even where they are stored in your inventory, are mysteries.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/juice-puzzle-astrobotanica.jpg?itok=jNAgGHYc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/juice-puzzle-astrobotanica.jpg?itok=-9Pc0FlH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Regardless of missing narrative, there is a quest tracker that updates as you complete various tasks. These include scanning a plant, making a tonic, and healing Ube. There's no real draw to it, though. No fanfare is made when an objective is complete. It's not the biggest issue, but being reminded that a task changed and you're focusing on something else certainly helps streamline the quest cycle.</p>

<p>Other missing items include map markers on the map or being able to put a marker on the map. Even when you buy the P.R.I.M.A.L. HUD upgrade, the map remains unchanged and pretty much useless since you'll be using the HUD compass for all your navigation needs. Since you only have access to the first level of upgrades, map markers could be listed later on.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/astrobotanica-primal-tab.jpg?itok=l_MNnIvf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/astrobotanica-primal-tab.jpg?itok=iRIL09a3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>One other massive aspect of&nbsp;<em>Astrobotanica</em>&nbsp;that was missing in the demo was building. Many open-world survival games have building as one of the big draws to playing. You can design your own camp, create an epic castle, grow massive gardens, etc. The same can be said for this game based on the Kickstarter information. When it comes to the demo, you can't do any building aside from placing garden plots in the demo. You can see some structures you'll be able to construct in the future, but can't actually place them in the world, even if you do unlock the plan.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The game struggled as I continued to play. By the time I wrapped up my three hour session, it was consistently lagging, sluggish to load areas as I moved around, and put excess strain on my PC. This is a concern for players on older computers and those that like long gaming sessions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Astrobotanica</em>&nbsp;may have a unique premise and story that is ready to set it apart from the competition, but with no narrative present in the demo and lacking many staple mechanics of the survival genre, it's hard to see it. Open world survival crafting games are extremely popular, with titles like&nbsp;<em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="72a14f4d-4d77-4ace-a3aa-09008b8c98bf" href="https://techraptor.net/games/palworld" rel="nofollow">Palworld</a>,</em>&nbsp;<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="294eedd9-16ba-4c31-9a65-967aeca4d3fc" href="https://techraptor.net/games/enshrouded" rel="nofollow"><em>Enshrouded</em></a>, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5840301c-ab91-4d31-a561-7a7d64d82464" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/dune-awakening-interview-art-directors-gavin-whelan-and-david-levy" rel="nofollow"><em>Dune: Awakening</em></a>, and <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fbd23abe-125c-4cba-8afc-994aaf0735ef" href="https://techraptor.net/games/rust" rel="nofollow">Rust</a>.</em>&nbsp;It's a competitive niche to launch a game in.</p>

<p>Many of these smaller issues could be in development and were simply unready for the demo. Nonetheless, playing the demo didn't hook me. There was no story to grab my attention, and the mechanics present weren't unique enough to keep me wanting more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Variety is the spice of life, and this is incredibly relevant when playing TTRPG like Pathfinder. No one wants to battle the same sets of goblins and highway bandits over and over again. To add a bit of variety to our games, we took a look at the Bog Dwellers, Cave Lurkers, and Forest Stalkers.</p>

<p>These packs of painted minis are intended to add a bit of variety and flair to battles, matched to the region that you'd likely encounter them in.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Before even getting to what's in any of these packs I'm a fan of them being corralled by the region where you'd likely run into them. When there are just so many monsters in the Pathfinder Bestiary, it can be difficult when trying to build an encounter from scratch to know what is available to you.</p>

<p>These collections, even as a list of names online, allows players searching for a new foe to throw into a Forest or Swamp encounter a few interesting alternatives because againâ€¦ Variety is the spice of life.</p>



<p>Inside the Pathfinder Battles Bog Dwellers pack you'll find miniatures for the following creatures:</p>

<ul><li aria-level="1">Grimstalker</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Mudwretch</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Castoroides</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Bog Mummy</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Boggard Scout</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Shimmernewt</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pathfinder-forest-bog-and-cave-set-02.jpg?itok=GXtaisgD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pathfinder-forest-bog-and-cave-set-02.jpg?itok=F6X1XK5x 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This group can be split pretty evenly between the cuties and the creepies. The cuties are made up of the Castoroides, the large beaver-like creature, the Boggard Scout, ready to pounce or attack with it's conch morning star, and the Shimmernewt, who really isn't doing anythingâ€¦ Ironically the Shimmernewt is the deadliest of these creatures at CR 6.</p>

<p>These characters stand out with bright colors or recognizable features. The Castoroides and Boggard both do a good job of directing you towards their features, informing you about their abilities. Whether it be the Castoroised claws and tail, or the weapon the Boggard is wielding and it's dexterity. While the Shimmernewt is just standing their it's bright color immediately draws your eye.</p>

<p>On the creepier side the Grimstalker and Bog Mummy both fall into a very similar looking "Swamp Zombie" category. While accurate to the look the meshing of the dark greens and brown does give these minis a bit of a legibility issue when across the table from you.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pathfinder-forest-bog-and-cave-set-06.jpg?itok=Oy1Ctn74 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pathfinder-forest-bog-and-cave-set-06.jpg?itok=29m_T2q- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Ironically, the Mudwretch, who is a humanoid pile of mud, is predominantly brown but the bulkier features like his large fingers and drooping face are actually easier to see at a distance.</p>

<h2>Pathfinder Battles Cave Lurkers</h2>

<p>Inside the Pathfinder Battles Cave Lurkers pack you'll find miniatures for the following creatures:</p>

<ul><li aria-level="1">Xulgath Skirmisher</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Xulgath Stoneliege</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Orc Warchief</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Myceloid</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Hunting Spider</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Cave Scorpion</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pathfinder-forest-bog-and-cave-set-03.jpg?itok=QEEpN386 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pathfinder-forest-bog-and-cave-set-03.jpg?itok=yodPx5VQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>I'm in love with every single mini in this pack. Of the humanoid creatures â€“ Xulgath Skirmisher, Xulgath Stoneliege, and the Orc Warchief â€“ each has been modeled with great motion or intention. Whether it's a hunched sneer or standing square on shouting each of these characters gives a sense of personality.</p>

<p>The Orc Warchief is a perfect example of what I like seeing from packs like these. They might not all be fodder enemies, but when you want one mini to really stand out from the rest in the pack you want it to be eyecatching. Putting a variety of Orc's on a battle map I want no one at my table to question that the one with the battle flags brandishing the giant mace is going to be the one that gives the most trouble.</p>

<p>Minis where everyone is the same are great to fill a battlefield, but when there is uniqueness it allows a level of immersion in the gameplay that lets the characters, through their player's eyes, infer more about the battlefield.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pathfinder-forest-bog-and-cave-set-07.jpg?itok=cLcVvKGJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pathfinder-forest-bog-and-cave-set-07.jpg?itok=pcNrHdtP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The Myceloid is another fascinating creature in just how harshly it's colors juxtapose what you normally see from monsters. Instead of dull colors and realism it's fluorescent green with a hot pink mushroom cap. It's screaming "Danger" in nature.</p>

<p>For the little creepy crawlies, the Hunting Spider and Cave Scorpion, the Cave Scorpion is very plain looking, but the Hunting Spider does a lot to stick out compared to other spider miniatures I've seen. Normally going for a a texture and color of the black hairs on a spider the purple gives off a sense of poison and a hard carapace for defense.</p>

<h2>Pathfinder Battles Forest Stalkers</h2>

<p>Inside the Pathfinder Battles Forest Stalkers pack you'll find miniatures for the following creatures:</p>

<ul><li aria-level="1">Elf Hunter</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Werewolf</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Buso</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Wereboar</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Werebat</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Catfolk Bandit</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pathfinder-forest-bog-and-cave-set-04.jpg?itok=bmJyCCFp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pathfinder-forest-bog-and-cave-set-04.jpg?itok=muDFkJSt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This group of Forest Stalkers is an interesting mix of one standard creature, the Elf Hunter, one wood zombie, the Buso, and a mix of animal-human hybrids.</p>

<p>The Buso is by far the most terrifying thing in this collection as everything about it just seems a bit off. A slender body, but a pale grey, one eye on it's face and a head of hair that belongs in a 6th century monastery, and a curved machete in it's hand ready to swing.</p>

<p>For each of the humanoid hybrids, I'm a big fan of the varying levels of humanity. The Wereboar and Catfolk Bandit dressed as if they were in a town of their peers or heading out on adventures of their own, the Werebat seems to be in a state of transformation shredding a human form for it's present one, and the werewolf has embraced it's change wielding tools andâ€¦ that's about it.</p>

<p>Immediately, things like these can inform a player of the scenario that they're in and they've been very deliberately picked.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pathfinder-forest-bog-and-cave-set-05.jpg?itok=VnQxJ0KJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pathfinder-forest-bog-and-cave-set-05.jpg?itok=j_MtsE4h 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>If Three Is A Crowd, Two Is Company, Then What Is One?</h2>

<p>While each of these miniatures are a fantastic representation of the stat block in Pathfinder that they represent as any player will know even at early levels you'll want to be challenging your party with groups of more than one creature.</p>

<p>The different were-creatures can join together to form a group, as can the two Xulgath's, but for many of the other creatures here it can be hard to put just one down at the table.</p>

<p>A mix of creatures is a great way to get hero or boss style creatures, like the Orc Warchief, but something like a Hunter Spider or Buggard Scout might fare better in a Spider or Buggard themed collection.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pathfinder-forest-bog-and-cave-set-08.jpg?itok=TtFxij1u 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pathfinder-forest-bog-and-cave-set-08.jpg?itok=X3EDiYcc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Some of these characters definitely deserve their solo focus, but others come across as pack creatures that you'd want to have a few of if you plan to populate your table with accurate representations for combat.</p>

<h2>Bog Dwellers, Cave Lurkers, and Forest Stalkers Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>The Bog Dwellers, Cave Lurkers, and Forest Stalkers of this Wizkids Pathfinder Battles collection is filled with creatures worth of standing as direct foes to your characters, as well as some casual fodder for them to encounter in a random battle along the way.</p>

<p>The strengths in this set are that each mini can help to prompt a GM to get their mind racing about unique encounters related to the location of the bundle. You're headed into a bog or swamp? Well do you want the party to encounter swamp zombies, local fauna, or a brightly lit lizard?</p>

<p>The downside of these collections is that while you'll get a good representation for one or two of a similarly grouped enemy, you won't have enough to run an encounter without having to say "imagine all of them look like this guy" while gesturing to the Shimmernewt.</p>
