The company has a consistent track record of well-received titles, and with a new head at the helm, that quality has the potential to grow.</p>

<h2>The New Dice Throne CEO Announcement</h2>

<p>According to a press release, Dice Throne has announced Casey Sershon as their CEO. Sershon has over a decade of experience in the tabletop industry. He served as Senior Director of Business and Development at The Op, playing an active role in every part of the business, including helping the development team make <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/marvel-dice-throne-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Marvel Dice Throne</em></a> and <em>X-Men Dice Throne</em>.</p>

It is a competitive board game where players roll dice and play cards to manipulate those dice results to beat their opponents. It debuted in 2018 and has remained consistently popular, spawning waves of supplements and several successful Kickstarter projects. Its most recent, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dicethrone/dice-throne-outcasts" rel="nofollow"><em>Outcasts</em></a>, raised more than $1.6 million.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;"Joining Dice Throne is an honor. This team and the community around it are something special, and their passion for these games is unrivaled. I plan to preserve and build upon what Nate has had such a pivotal role in creating so fans can trust that what they love about Dice Throne is here to stay,” explains Casey Sershon, CEO of Dice Throne. “My top priority will be expanding on the incredible community we’ve fostered and continuing the company’s growth. I’m excited to leverage my game industry experience to help the brand reach new heights and fans. The surface of Dice Throne’s potential has barely been scratched.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sershon's new role of CEO begins at the cusp of a tumultuous time for the tabletop industry. As the United States has sworn in convicted felon and President Donald Trump for a second term, his proposed <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/deep-regrets-developer-voices-potential-impact-of-imposing-us-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">trade tariffs</a> may have an adverse effect on tabletop prices across the entire industry. Offsetting such production costs will be a challenge for all involved.</p>
