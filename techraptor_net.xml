            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Red Square Games and Asmodee have announced&nbsp;<em>Twilight Imperium Digital</em>, and it is, as you've probably already guessed, a Steam version of the popular (if extremely weighty) tabletop game.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://x.com/RedSquare_Games/status/1967984321970540682" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement post</a> on social media, Red Square says the digital version of&nbsp;<em>Twilight Imperium&nbsp;</em>has been made "with love by fans at Red Square Games and Asmodee", and that the game is for both "the old guard" and "the new heirs".</p>

<p>The game's Steam page describes it as an adaptation of what the two studios call a "legendary board game of galactic conquest" which has been "reimagined for digital play", so there should be a few concessions to make it a little more streamlined on Steam (steamlined?).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/twilight-imperium-digital-board.jpg?itok=FWy1wyn4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/twilight-imperium-digital-board.jpg?itok=K9xAsUQn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Twilight Imperium Digital&nbsp;</em>adapts the legendary strategy game for Steam "soon".</figcaption></figure><p>If you're familiar with&nbsp;<em>Twilight Imperium</em>, you'll probably know how this one's going to play out. Expect a vast game of diplomacy, combat, and exploration in which you'll need to decide whether to trade peacefully with your other players or dominate them with military might.</p>

<p><em>Twilight Imperium Digital&nbsp;</em>will offer 17 unique factions, each of which boasts "asymmetric powers and playstyles", and it also promises "massive replayability" thanks to its randomized galaxies and objectives.</p>

<p>If you can't convince anybody else to play this one with you, there's a solo mode in which you can take on a computer opponent, but naturally,&nbsp;<em>Twilight Imperium Digital&nbsp;</em>will thrive best in multiplayer. The game also supports hotseat and asynchronous play so you can enjoy it "at your own pace".</p>

<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Twilight Imperium Digital</em>, which should give you a decent sense of how the game will play out in comparison to the tabletop experience, right here.</p>




<p><em>Twilight Imperium Digital&nbsp;</em>doesn't have a release date yet, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3669430/Twilight_Imperium_Digital/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wishlist it on Steam right here</a>. Hey, who knows? Maybe this will lead to a digital version of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/twilight-imperium-spinoff-twilight-inscription-announced" rel="nofollow">spinoff&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/twilight-imperium-spinoff-twilight-inscription-announced" rel="nofollow">Twilight Inscription</a>&nbsp;</em>somewhere down the line.</p>
