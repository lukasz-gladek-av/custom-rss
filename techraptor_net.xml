            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rockstar has announced that the hotly-anticipated <i>Grand Theft Auto 6&nbsp;</i>has been delayed once again, with the game now due to launch in November next year.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/ak3ak31a49a221/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-now-set-to-launch-november-19-2026" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on the official&nbsp;Rockstar website, the studio says that the open-world game, which was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-vi-release-date-delay" rel="nofollow">due to arrive in May 2026</a>, will now launch on November 19th that same year. This represents the game's second delay; it was initially set for a 2025 launch before being pushed back to May.</p>

<p>The studio says it's sorry for "adding additional time" to what it knows "has been a long wait", but that the extra months of development will allow the team to "finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and deserve".</p>

<p>Their consternation makes a lot of sense; as of February last year,&nbsp;<em>GTA 5&nbsp;</em>had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-v-has-sold-over-195-million-units-red-dead-redemption-2-at-61-million" rel="nofollow">sold a mammoth 195 million units</a>, and since it's been almost two years since that figure, it's likely that the game's sales have only increased since then.</p>

<p>News of&nbsp;<em>GTA 6</em>'s delay also comes just a few days after developer Rockstar was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rockstar-union-busting-accusation-gta-6" rel="nofollow">accused of union-busting</a> following the dismissal of a number of employees who were reportedly involved in union activity.</p>

<p>Rockstar subsequently <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-05/-grand-theft-auto-studio-says-fired-employees-were-leaking-information" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">claimed</a> that the employees in question were leaking information about&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, with a spokesperson saying that the employees were sharing company information in a forum that also included non-workers.</p>




<p><em>Grand Theft Auto 6&nbsp;</em>is now set to launch for <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/grand-theft-auto-vi/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/grand-theft-auto-vi/9NL3WWNZLZZN" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on November 19th, 2026. No PC version has yet been confirmed by Rockstar.</p>
