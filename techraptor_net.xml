            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nightingale-developer-inflexion-games-layoffs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Nightingale&nbsp;</em>developer Inflexion Games has become the latest studio to be hit by layoffs, with the developer blaming what it calls "the stark realities of the industry".</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/PlayNightingale/status/1851671600078143563" rel="noopener" target="_blank">statement on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Inflexion CEO Aaryn Flynn says that his studio has explored "every possible option" to lift itself out of an "incredibly challenging" situation, but that he has had to "make the difficult decision to let go some of our remarkable and talented team members".</p>

<p>Separately, an Inflexion employee <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/dozens-of-staff-laid-off-at-inflexion-as-part-of-restructuring" rel="noopener" target="_blank">confirmed to GamesIndustry.biz</a>&nbsp;that the number of layoffs is at least 22, based on internal company communications that employee apparently has access to.</p>

<p>As such, not only will these staff be laid off, but Inflexion's UK office will also be closing entirely. Flynn says he and his studio will "support each member of the team affected by the reductions".</p>

<p><em>Nightingale&nbsp;</em>itself will seemingly continue development; Flynn says he will provide "more details on our upcoming updates soon", so we'll likely get to find out what&nbsp;<em>Nightingale</em>'s future direction will be in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>In our&nbsp;<em>Nightingale&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/nightingale-preview">preview</a>, writer Robert Adams declared that there's "plenty of fun to be had" in the game, but that players should be aware of the game's "flaws" before diving in, which might give some idea as to why&nbsp;<em>Nightingale&nbsp;</em>hasn't been more successful.</p>




<p>It also looks as though a major initiative to fix some of&nbsp;<em>Nightingale</em>'s biggest problems, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1928980/view/4569553448608139865" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dubbed "Realms Rebuilt"</a>, hasn't been as successful as Inflexion had hoped.</p>

<p>Of course, this won't come as much of a salve to Inflexion, but it's not the only studio losing employees at the moment. The industry is still in the grip of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-june-14th">layoff wave</a>&nbsp;that has affected (and looks like it will continue to affect) companies both <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/riot-games-league-of-legends-layoffs">big</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/disco-elysium-developer-zaum-confirms-game-cancellation-and-layoffs">small</a>.</p>
