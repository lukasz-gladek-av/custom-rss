            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bend-studio-layoffs-days-gone<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Days Gone&nbsp;</em>developer Bend Studio has been hit by sweeping layoffs affecting around a third of the company's staff, parent company Sony has confirmed.</p>

<p>In a statement given to <a href="https://kotaku.com/days-gone-sony-bend-canceled-shooter-layoffs-1851784264" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Kotaku</a>, Sony says the layoffs are part of "strategic changes to better position the studio for long-term success", a pretty standard corporate line. The company goes on to say that the "workforce reduction" was a decision that was "not made lightly", and that those being laid off made "meaningful contributions" to Bend Studio.</p>

<p>Sony did not, however, confirm the exact scope of the layoffs. That figure comes from Bloomberg's Jason Schreier, who said on social media platform <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lrbil2zvis2q" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>&nbsp;that "around 40 people", i.e. 30% of Bend Studio's staff, had been laid off.</p>

In the statement given to Kotaku, Sony said it made the decision not to proceed with Bend's game following "careful consideration".</p>

<p>According to Schreier, Bend Studio is currently working on a new project that it started following the live-service game's cancellation, and Sony says it remains "confident in [Bend Studio's] future and creative direction", so it sounds as though the studio is still working on a game of some sort.</p>

<p>Layoffs at Bend Studio come after a wider wave that has swept across the industry, affecting smaller studios like&nbsp;<em>Yooka-Laylee&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playtonic-layoffs-yooka-laylee" rel="nofollow">Playtonic</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Oxenfree&nbsp;</em>outfit <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/oxenfree-night-school-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Night School</a>, as well as larger companies like EA subsidiary <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/respawn-layoffs-project-cancellations" rel="nofollow">Respawn</a> and tech giant <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-3-percent-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">Microsoft</a>.</p>

<p>Bend Studio's game is also not the only live-service project Sony has canceled in recent months. As well as the other game shut down at the same time as Bend's, live-service shooter&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds" rel="nofollow">shut down mere days after its launch</a> last year.</p>

Its next live-service project is Bungie's&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marathon-release-date-gameplay-revealed" rel="nofollow">due to launch in September</a>; as far as we know, that's still the case, despite lukewarm reception to previews and the recent revelation that an artist who previously worked on the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-marathon-art-stolen" rel="nofollow">stole artwork from an online artist</a>.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what kind of game Bend Studio is working on next, but there will be a lot of folks hoping it's a&nbsp;<em>Days Gone&nbsp;</em>sequel. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-switch-2-is-now-nintendos-fastest-selling-console-worldwide.1215474/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-fastest-selling-nintendo-console<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has revealed that the Switch 2 has become the gaming giant's fastest-selling console worldwide, having reached a major milestone in just four days.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1932620051955270127" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Nintendo says the Switch 2 sold 3.5 million copies within the first four days of its release, thus making it the "fastest-selling Nintendo hardware ever" around the world.</p>

<p>The console has also set records for Nintendo in specific regions of the globe; earlier this week, it was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-the-fastest-selling-nintendo-console-in-uk-history-but-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs-launches-were-bigger" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> that the Switch 2 is Nintendo's fastest-selling machine in the UK, although it hasn't pipped the PS5 or the Xbox Series X|S to the post as the country's fastest-selling games console ever.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-fastest-selling-multiple-consoles.jpg?itok=WxQygTUk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-fastest-selling-multiple-consoles.jpg?itok=9C0bqQLP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Nintendo Switch 2 has become the fastest-selling Nintendo console around the world.</figcaption></figure><p>If you've somehow missed out on the Switch 2's launch, it's Nintendo's newest console. Released <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">on June 5th</a>, the console packs more powerful internals than its predecessor, as well as a larger screen, magnetic Joy-Cons, and various other improvements.</p>

<p>The Switch 2 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">launched with&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">Mario Kart World</a>&nbsp;</em>as its main draw, but it also has a number of last-gen and current-gen ports under its belt, and a number of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-upgrades-switch-1" rel="nofollow">original Switch games</a> have received either free or paid upgrades to enhance their performance on the new console.</p>

<p>It's not clear whether the console will go on to fulfil Nintendo's expectations. The company said last month that it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-15m-switch-2-first-year" rel="nofollow">expects to sell 15 million</a> Switch 2 units in its first year, and a Bloomberg report earlier this year suggested that Nintendo is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-20m-shipments-report" rel="nofollow">preparing to manufacture 20 million units</a> for sale in the same time period.</p>

<p>This is a strong start for the Switch 2, though, and even if it hasn't beaten the PS5 or the Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo will be happy that the new machine appears to have outsold the original Switch, at least in terms of the first four days.</p>




<p>You can grab a Switch 2 right now from any number of retailers (assuming the console is in stock at the time you're reading this, of course).</p>
