            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Spike Chunsoft has announced that upcoming visual novel remake&nbsp;<em>Steins;Gate Re:Boot&nbsp;</em>will be making its way to the West in 2026, and the company has shown off some of the changes coming to the revamped version of the classic game as well.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.spike-chunsoft.com/news/sgr_title_announcement/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on its official website, Spike Chunsoft says that a North American and European release of&nbsp;<em>Steins;Gate Re:Boot&nbsp;</em>is on the cards for next year, although the publisher stops short of announcing a specific month.</p>

<p>The game, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steins-gate-reboot-2025" rel="nofollow">originally announced last year</a>, will serve as an enhanced remake of&nbsp;<em>Steins;Gate</em>, a visual novel that made its debut on the Xbox 360 all the way back in 2009. It'll feature "updated visuals and new narrative content", according to Spike Chunsoft.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to brand new background art that aims to stay faithful to the way the game's Akihabara setting would have looked in 2010, "created using extensive reference materials", according to Spike Chunsoft.</p>

<p>New locations have been added to&nbsp;<em>Steins;Gate Re:Boot&nbsp;</em>in order to "complement and enrich the story", and new scenes have been added to "further a sense of immersion". Event stills have been reworked from the game's original storyboards to "deliver greater dramatic impact".</p>

<p>As well as all of the above,&nbsp;<em>Steins;Gate Re:Boot&nbsp;</em>will also boast a reworked UI that should make navigating the game a little easier. All told, it sounds like Mages and Spike Chunsoft are angling to make this the definitive version of&nbsp;<em>Steins;Gate</em>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Opus: Prism Peak Delayed to March 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/opus-prism-peak-delayed-march-2026</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/opus-prism-peak-delayed-to-march-2026.1359634/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Sigono and publisher Shueisha Games have announced that upcoming narrative adventure game&nbsp;<em>Opus: Prism Peak&nbsp;</em>has been delayed once again, but at least we now know in which month it'll be launching next year.</p>

<p>Per a new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1947910/view/585033008523771918" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Steam,&nbsp;<em>Opus: Prism Peak&nbsp;</em>will now be arriving in March 2026. It was originally slated for a 2025 release, but Sigono says that more time is needed to ensure the game "reaches the level of quality [the studio is] aiming for".</p>

<p>Sigono says the extra development time will allow it to polish the game further and ensure it's in a fit state for launch. It's a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paralives-delayed-may-2026" rel="nofollow">pretty standard reason</a> for games to be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-delayed-indefinitely" rel="nofollow">delayed</a>, but hey - what's that oft-misattributed quote about delayed games and rushed games, again?</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/opus-prism-peak-delayed-2026-eugene.jpg?itok=SMntnFaH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/opus-prism-peak-delayed-2026-eugene.jpg?itok=q91snEYu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Opus: Prism Peak&nbsp;</em>has been delayed again, but it's got a new release window, at least.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Opus: Prism Peak&nbsp;</em>is the latest title in Sigono's&nbsp;<em>Opus&nbsp;</em>series of narrative adventure games, which began in 2016 with&nbsp;<em>Opus: The Day We Found Earth</em>, followed by 2018's&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/opus-rocket-of-whispers-cleared-for-takeoff-on-switch-22nd-march" rel="nofollow">Rocket of Whispers</a>&nbsp;</em>and 2021's&nbsp;<em>Echo of Starsong</em>.</p>

<p>The games are loosely connected to one another by theme and atmosphere, but they don't tell a continuous story, so you won't need to have played previous&nbsp;<em>Opus&nbsp;</em>games to get the most out of&nbsp;<em>Prism Peak&nbsp;</em>when it eventually arrives.</p>

<p>In&nbsp;<em>Opus: Prism Peak</em>, you'll play as a photographer stranded in a place known as the Dusklands alongside a mysterious young girl who's lost her memories. As you find your way home, you'll uncover the mysteries of the Dusklands and of your companion as well.</p>

<p>Like previous&nbsp;<em>Opus&nbsp;</em>entries, you shouldn't expect high-octane action from this one; it'll be a contemplative narrative-led experience with an emphasis on photography, dialogue, and exploration.</p>




<p><em>Opus: Prism Peak&nbsp;</em>is set to launch across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1947910/OPUS_Prism_Peak/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, Switch 2, and Switch in March next year. You can try out a demo for the game on Steam right now if you want to get a feel for what it'll be like.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Total War: Warhammer III Immortal Empires Is Being Made Free for Owners of the First Two Games]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/total-war-warhammer-iii-immortal-empires-free-first-two</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/total-war-warhammer-iii-immortal-empires-is-being-made-free-for-owners-of-the-first-two-games.1359628/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Creative Assembly and Sega have announced that owners of&nbsp;<em>Total War: Warhammer I&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>II&nbsp;</em>(or both, of course) will soon be able to play&nbsp;<em>Total War: Warhammer III</em>'s Immortal Empires campaign for free.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://community.creative-assembly.com/total-war/total-war-warhammer/blogs/86" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> on the official Creative Assembly website, the developer says that starting from December 4th, all owners of the first two games in the&nbsp;<em>Total War: Warhammer&nbsp;</em>series will gain access to Immortal Empires and its The Lost God prologue campaign at no extra cost.</p>

<p>What's more, even if you don't own&nbsp;<em>Total War: Warhammer III</em>, you can still buy Immortal Empires-related DLC to play extra factions in the campaign mode, since you'll access the campaign through a new listing in your library (assuming you don't own the third game, of course).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/total-war-warhammer-iii-immortal-empires-free-first-two-games-grand-cathay.jpg?itok=PzNJIsGN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/total-war-warhammer-iii-immortal-empires-free-first-two-games-grand-cathay.jpg?itok=gLiw2Ui8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Total War: Warhammer III</em>'s Immortal Empires campaign will soon be free to owners of the first two games.</figcaption></figure><p>Naturally, if you already own&nbsp;<em>Total War: Warhammer III</em>, then nothing will change for you, but this should make it easier for you to recruit some friends to enjoy Immortal Empires alongside.</p>

<p>This update also doesn't include any of <i>Total War: Warhammer III</i>'s other content, so if you want to play the Realms of Chaos campaign or experience any of the Legendary Lords, you'll need to buy the Upgrade Pack, which contains the aforementioned features, plus a couple of extras.</p>

<p>As a reminder, the Immortal Empires campaign for&nbsp;<em>Total War: Warhammer III&nbsp;</em>launched in beta <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/total-war-warhammer-3-immortal-empires-coming-in-august" rel="nofollow">back in August 2022</a>, eventually releasing in full for owners of the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/total-war-warhammer-iii-update-24-brings-immortal-empires-to-all-players" rel="nofollow">the following February</a>.</p>

<p>Creative Assembly describes Immortal Empires as a "vast sandbox campaign encompassing the entire&nbsp;<em>Warhammer&nbsp;</em>world" and "the culmination of the entire&nbsp;<em>Total War: Warhammer&nbsp;</em>series, so it's not just an extra; it's essentially the flagship feature of the newest game.</p>




<p><em>Total War: Warhammer III</em>'s Immortal Empires campaign is available now to everyone who owns the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1142710/Total_War_WARHAMMER_III/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on Steam</a>, and it's also coming to owners of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/364360/Total_War_WARHAMMER/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Warhammer I</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/594570/Total_War_WARHAMMER_II/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">II</a>&nbsp;</em>on December 4th.</p>
