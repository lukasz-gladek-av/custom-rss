            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-xbox-series-xs-version<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Exactly one year after its release on PS5 and PC, celebrated Soulslike action RPG&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>is finally coming to Xbox Series X|S.</p>

<p>Xbox <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1930806857725026414" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">confirms the news</a> in a post on X, simultaneously revealing a release date of August 20th, which is, to the day, exactly a year after it was released on Sony's platform and on PC.</p>

<p>This release date arguably throws some doubt on the idea that the Xbox Series S console's memory limitations were to blame for the port's delay, which was the official line taken by developer Game Science <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-xbox-port-series-s" rel="nofollow">back in January this year</a>.</p>

<p>In fairness to Microsoft and Game Science, the Xbox Series S is a notably less powerful machine than the Series X, and&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>is a notoriously demanding game, requiring some pretty hefty hardware to run well on PC.</p>

<p>In any case, if you're an Xbox Series owner, you'll finally get to play&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>on your console on August 20th. The timing of this announcement is also notable, coming as it does just two days before Xbox's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-summer-show-date-2025-the-outer-worlds-2" rel="nofollow">Summer Game Fest showcase</a>.</p>

<p>While we don't know what surprises Xbox has in store for that show, we can reasonably guess that a release date for&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2&nbsp;</em>will be revealed, given that a showcase specifically dedicated to the game will air after Xbox's main show.</p>

We'll have to wait and see what that show has in store.</p>
