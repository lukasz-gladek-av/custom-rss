            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/riders-republic-movie-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>According to a new report, a movie based on Ubisoft's extreme sports racer&nbsp;<em>Riders Republic&nbsp;</em>is in the works, and I'd love to meet literally anyone who asked for such a project.</p>

<p>Per a Deadline <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/05/riders-republic-adil-bilall-gaumont-ubisoft-1236397176/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">article</a>, the&nbsp;<em>Riders Republic&nbsp;</em>movie will be a co-production between French movie house Gaumont and Ubisoft, and it'll be directed by&nbsp;<em>Bad Boys: Ride or Die&nbsp;</em>helmsmen Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah, colloquially known as Adil &amp; Bilall.</p>

<p>Writing duties on the project will be handled by&nbsp;<em>The World Is Yours&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Stillwater&nbsp;</em>scribe&nbsp;Noé Debré, although it's not clear whether there will be any other writers on the movie or whether Debré will be the sole writer.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riders-republic-movie-racing.jpg?itok=bcAQTRwJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riders-republic-movie-racing.jpg?itok=nBQyJQs3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Was a&nbsp;<em>Riders Republic&nbsp;</em>movie in the cards for 2025 as far as you're concerned?</figcaption></figure><p>This won't be Ubisoft's first foray into multimedia; the company is currently gearing up for the release of Netflix animated series&nbsp;<em>Splinter Cell: Deathwatch</em>, which is set to launch sometime later this year. Lest we forget, there's also 2023's Netflix series&nbsp;<em>Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix</em>.</p>

<p>Indeed,&nbsp;<em>Riders Republic&nbsp;</em>is just one of a number of video game movies in the works right now. Others include <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-movie-sydney-sweeney" rel="nofollow">a movie</a> based on EA's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-sales-4m-battlefield-skate" rel="nofollow">hit multiplayer game</a>&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>, as well as a movie based on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortuary-assistant-movie-announced" rel="nofollow">horror work sim&nbsp;<em>The Mortuary Assistant</em></a>&nbsp;and an adaptation of Sega's racer&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/outrun-movie-report" rel="nofollow"><em>OutRun</em></a>.</p>

<p>Video games are also proving ripe territory for series adaptations. Amazon's wildly successful&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>series, for instance, is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-season-3-confirmed-season-2-december" rel="nofollow">set to air its second season later this year</a>, and a third season has already been greenlit. HBO's&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us</em>, meanwhile, is partway through its second season at time of writing.</p>

<p>These shows join animated fare like Netflix's&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-devil-may-cry-renewed-second-season" rel="nofollow">Devil May Cry</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Castlevania&nbsp;</em>shows, as well as Prime Video's&nbsp;<em>Secret Level</em>, an anthology series with shorts based on properties like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/warhammer-40000-secret-level-trailer-brings-glory-to-imperium" rel="nofollow"><em>Warhammer 40k</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Armored Core</em>, and, er,&nbsp;<em>Concord</em>.</p>




<p>Naturally, the&nbsp;<em>Riders Republic&nbsp;</em>movie doesn't have a release date yet, and we don't know who's attached to star in it either. It's likely we'll learn more about the project in the coming months, but don't expect it to arrive in cinemas for a while.</p>
