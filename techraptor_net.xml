            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-tony-hawks-remasters-potentially-leaked-by-pro-skater<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Pro skater Tyshawn Jones may just have leaked the existence of a brand new collection of&nbsp;<em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater&nbsp;</em>remasters, if a recent radio interview is anything to go by.</p>

<p>Speaking to New York station Power 105.1FM (thanks, <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/02/skater-tyshawn-jones-claims-to-be-in-upcoming-tony-hawk-game-remaster" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gematsu</a>), Jones said he's "in a&nbsp;<em>Tony Hawk&nbsp;</em>coming out" and that "they got a new one they're remastering, so that's about to come out".</p>

<p>As a reminder, Activision hasn't announced any new&nbsp;<em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater&nbsp;</em>remasters, so if Jones is right and a new collection is imminent, he's gotten ahead of Activision in revealing its existence.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-and-2-trick.jpg?itok=gZliE2DZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-and-2-trick.jpg?itok=esWJ9Yxi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A new&nbsp;<em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater&nbsp;</em>remaster collection may be on the way.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that remasters of PS2 titles&nbsp;<em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>4&nbsp;</em>were originally on the cards, but Tony Hawk himself said back in 2022 that those plans had been <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tony-hawk-confirms-plans-for-pro-skater-3-4-remake-were-abandoned-after-blizzard-merger" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">shelved</a> after Blizzard's merger with Vicarious Visions.</p>

<p>Of course, a lot has happened since then, and it's entirely possible that the plans have been revived. It's also possible that Jones did the work he did for those remasters way back when and that no further development has occurred since their cancellation.</p>

<p>Presumably, the potentially-upcoming collection would include&nbsp;<em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>4</em>, but Activision could decide to skip those games and head straight for&nbsp;<em>Tony Hawk's Underground</em>&nbsp;instead.</p>

<p>Doing so seems like a missed opportunity to me, though; these are popular games, after all, and the two PS2 installments before the series switched to&nbsp;<em>Underground&nbsp;</em>were pretty popular with the critics of their time.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-and-2-grind.jpg?itok=snp5Sk_d 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-and-2-grind.jpg?itok=GOUhU0OH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>4&nbsp;</em>could be about to get the&nbsp;<em>1 + 2&nbsp;</em>treatment.</figcaption></figure><p>If the&nbsp;<em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>4&nbsp;</em>remasters are in the works, they'll face some pretty stiff competition thanks to EA's&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>reboot, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/skate-reboot-early-access-2025" rel="nofollow">due to land in Early Access sometime this year</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, the two games are arguably targeting different audiences;&nbsp;<em>Tony Hawk's&nbsp;</em>tends to aim for a general audience, while&nbsp;<em>Skate</em>&nbsp;has always seemed to be focused on the hardcore skater crowd.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what happens with regards to new&nbsp;<em>Tony Hawk's&nbsp;</em>remasters, but my&nbsp;<em>Tony Hawk's&nbsp;</em>nostalgia and I are certainly hoping Jones is on the money. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elder-scrolls-vi-auction-charity-npc</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elder-scrolls-vi-auction-could-let-you-create-an-in-game-npc-for-charity.1112145/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elder-scrolls-vi-auction-charity-npc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bethesda is holding a charity auction that could allow you to create your very own character to appear in&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls VI</em>, with all proceeds from the auction going to the Make-a-Wish Foundation.</p>

<p>In an announcement <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/2KceBLysMenA9JY9LsnSL3/bid-on-a-chance-to-create-a-character-for-the-elder-scrolls-vi" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on its website, Bethesda says the winner of the auction will get "the opportunity to work with Bethesda Game Studios to create a character to appear as an NPC in&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls VI</em>".</p>

<p>All money made from the auction will go directly to Make-a-Wish, and the auction is open to anyone in the United States, although you'll probably want to have a fair bit of cash handy if you're planning to bid.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-elder-scrolls-vi-make-a-wish-foundation-skyrim.jpg?itok=tEaLNbns 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-elder-scrolls-vi-make-a-wish-foundation-skyrim.jpg?itok=P1vxVeO9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>See that NPC in front of the Dragonborn? That could be your NPC, only in&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls VI&nbsp;</em>instead of&nbsp;<em>Skyrim</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>At time of writing, current bidding stands at a whopping $11,650, so you're going to have to bid over that if you want to create your own&nbsp;<em>Elder Scrolls VI&nbsp;</em>character. Still, at least everything is going to charity!</p>

<p>Of course, it is worth noting that&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls VI&nbsp;</em>currently doesn't have a release window; in fact, we know very little about the game, beyond the fact that it's presumably still in development and that it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elder-scrolls-vi-after-2026-no-ps5" rel="nofollow">probably won't release until next year or later</a>.</p>

<p>It's also worth noting that Bethesda doesn't provide any kind of time frame in its post, so it could be a while before you're invited to collaborate with the studio to make your own&nbsp;<em>Elder Scrolls VI&nbsp;</em>character.</p>

<p>Again, though, all of the proceeds for the bid are going to charity, so if you've got a lot of money knocking around and you're looking to spend it on a good cause, you could do a heck of a lot worse than this.</p>




<p><em>The Elder Scrolls VI&nbsp;</em>was first announced all the way back in 2018, and since then, Bethesda has been relatively radio-silent regarding the game.</p>

<p>We still don't know where it will be set or what the story will be, nor do we know what to expect with regards to gameplay (although we can guess it'll be a first-person RPG along the lines of its predecessors).</p>

<p>If you'd like to bid on the character creation auction, you can do so by heading over to the Make-a-Wish Foundation's <a href="https://my.onecause.com/event/organizations/sf-0018000000bK8c8AAC/events/vevt:fd137384-5aab-481b-bcc9-95db4365f38b/auctions/silent-auction" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Silent Auction page</a> and searching for "Bethesda", where you'll find an opportunity to contribute. Alternatively, you can <a href="https://secure2.wish.org/site/SPageServer?pagename=dfr_landing" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">make a flat, non-Bethesda-related donation here</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/relic-earth-vs-mars-turn-based-strategy</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/relic-reveals-b-movie-inspired-turn-based-strategy-game-earth-vs-mars.1112142/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/relic-earth-vs-mars-turn-based-strategy<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Company of Heroes&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Dawn of War&nbsp;</em>developer Relic has revealed&nbsp;<em>Earth vs Mars</em>, a turn-based strategy game that looks like it's taking equal inspiration from&nbsp;<em>Advance Wars&nbsp;</em>and classic 50s sci-fi B-movies.</p>

<p>The studio <a href="https://x.com/relicgames/status/1891851631622328551" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">describes</a> the game as a "Relic Labs-style" project, which probably means it's one of the first efforts we're seeing that's part of Relic's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/relic-entertainment-future-plans" rel="nofollow">intention to branch out and create smaller games</a> alongside its flagship real-time strategy titles.</p>

<p>As you'd probably expect from a game inspired by classic sci-fi,&nbsp;<em>Earth vs Mars&nbsp;</em>takes place during a Martian invasion, which sees Martians "abducting animals and humans and harvesting their atomic essence to create bizarre Martian-creature hybrids". Yikes.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/earth-vs-mars-relic-map.jpg?itok=knPx8MKf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/earth-vs-mars-relic-map.jpg?itok=dDSHUgn- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Earth vs Mars&nbsp;</em>is set during a Martian invasion, but it's a colorful romp inspired by&nbsp;<em>Advance Wars</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Rather than taking the relatively serious&nbsp;<em>XCOM: Enemy Unknown&nbsp;</em>direction, Relic has chosen a more colorful&nbsp;<em>Advance Wars</em>-style aesthetic for&nbsp;<em>Earth vs Mars.</em></p>

<p>In a slightly terrifying twist, you'll be able to create human-creature hybrids of your own to take on the Martians. Specifically, you'll be splicing animals from Earth together, as well as with humans, to "create powerful hybrid supersoldiers" to fight alongside the military. Space Marines look positively cute in comparison.</p>

<p>Relic gives examplkes like "the fast-moving cheetah-fly", "devastating human-rhino hybrids", and "deadly squirrel-cow infantry". It's a good thing this game has a cartoony art style, because this all sounds like it has the potential to be genuinely haunting.</p>

<p>As you progress through&nbsp;<em>Earth vs Mars</em>' 30-plus-mission campaign, you'll gain access to new creatures and encounter new Martian enemies as well, including a "sentient organic weapon" known as the Creep, as well as "the Martians' own mutant creations".</p>

<p><em>Earth vs Mars&nbsp;</em>is available to wishlist right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3269230/Earth_vs_Mars/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>. It doesn't have a release date yet, so stay tuned for more.</p>
