            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yesterday, Sony held a brand new PlayStation State of Play showcase, during which we got to see around 40 minutes of new announcements and reveals for upcoming PlayStation games. Here's everything that was announced during the show!</p>

<hr><h2>Housemarque kicks things off with&nbsp;<em>Saros</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/state-of-play-september-2025-saros_0.jpg?itok=FaXM9nII 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/state-of-play-september-2025-saros_0.jpg?itok=LBEy-fv6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Saros&nbsp;</em>is a lot like&nbsp;<em>Returnal</em>, it turns out.</figcaption></figure><p>When the State of Play was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-state-of-play-september-2025-confirmed" rel="nofollow">first revealed on Tuesday</a>, Sony promised that we'd get to see more of Housemarque's upcoming&nbsp;<em>Saros</em>, and indeed we did. It looks like a supercharged&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/returnal" rel="nofollow"><em>Returnal</em></a>, so if you liked that game's frantic third-person action, you'll probably like this too. It's coming on March 20th.</p>

<h2><em>Zero Parades - For Dead Spies&nbsp;</em>looks a lot like&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zero-parades-for-dead-spies-state-of-play-september-2025.jpg?itok=al5HL_IE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zero-parades-for-dead-spies-state-of-play-september-2025.jpg?itok=IDyzZk3R 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hey, ZA/UM's next game looks a lot like&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>, too. Is a theme emerging?</figcaption></figure><p>ZA/UM (or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/disco-elysium-developer-zaum-confirms-game-cancellation-and-layoffs" rel="nofollow">what remains of it</a>) is up next, and it turns out that its painterly isometric RPG&nbsp;<em>Zero Parades - For Dead Spies&nbsp;</em>looks a lot like&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>. Whether it can maintain its predecessor's widespread love remains to be seen, however.</p>

<h2><em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024&nbsp;</em>hits PS5 in December</h2>

<p>Next, we got to see footage of the rather impressive-looking&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-dune-expansion-announced" rel="nofollow">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a>&nbsp;</em>running on PS5, and it's hitting Sony's console on December 8th. Not only that, but it's getting a PS VR2 update next year for that extra immersion.</p>

<h2><em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>sure is a&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>game</h2>

<p>Do you like shooting guys? How about shooting guys...on a battlefield? Well, I'd imagine that if you answered yes to both of those questions,&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>is for you. We got to see some gameplay footage of it on PS5, and it's coming on October 10th.</p>

<h2><em>Deus Ex Remastered&nbsp;</em>revives a PC classic</h2>




<p>If you've ever found yourself wanting to play the original&nbsp;<em>Deus Ex&nbsp;</em>but being put off by its admittedly old-school potato-head graphics, then you'll want to check out&nbsp;<em>Deus Ex Remastered</em>, which revamps the classic im-sim on February 5th.</p>

<h2><em>Halloween&nbsp;</em>sounds ridiculously ambitious</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/halloween-state-of-play-september-2025.jpg?itok=zYCFIvip 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/halloween-state-of-play-september-2025.jpg?itok=oJ-9tdYn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Halloween&nbsp;</em>(the game, not the holiday) is still a long way away.</figcaption></figure><p>Next up, it's Illfonic's&nbsp;<em>Halloween</em>, which has a release date, albeit one that's pretty far off: it's launching on September 8th next year. You'll be able to take part in either "a standalone single-player story" or "dynamic asymmetrical multiplayer matches".</p>

<h2><em>Last Epoch&nbsp;</em>is coming to PS5</h2>

<p><em>Diablo</em>-esque hack-and-slash action RPG&nbsp;<em>Last Epoch&nbsp;</em>is coming to PS5, and developer Eleventh Hour Games took this opportunity to also reveal a brand new expansion, which will launch on the same day as the game itself does on PS5.</p>

<h2><em>The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin&nbsp;</em>is coming in January</h2>

<p><em>The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin</em>, an action RPG based on the iconic manga and anime series, is landing on January 28th, and we got a new look at some of its very anime-looking gameplay during the State of Play as well.</p>

<h2>Mega Man joins&nbsp;<em>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</em>' roster</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sonic-racing-crossworlds-mega-man-state-of-play-september-2025.jpg?itok=gnmNmeON 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sonic-racing-crossworlds-mega-man-state-of-play-september-2025.jpg?itok=moy0A1cN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Well, if Capcom won't do it...</figcaption></figure><p>With no brand new&nbsp;<em>Mega Man&nbsp;</em>game anywhere on the horizon, it seems it falls to Sega to keep the Blue Bomber's legacy alive. He'll appear as a playable character in&nbsp;<em>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</em>, which is out...well, today, as it happens!</p>

<h2><em>Nioh 3</em>&nbsp;gets a release date reveal, surprising nobody</h2>

<p>Team Ninja and Koei Tecmo's hack-and-slash Soulslike&nbsp;<em>Nioh 3&nbsp;</em>is up next, and it's launching on February 6th on PC and PlayStation 5. Then again, we already knew that thanks to an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nioh-3-release-date-leak-amazon-japan-listing" rel="nofollow">accidentally-uploaded Amazon Japan listing</a>.</p>

<h2><em>Dynasty Warriors 3 Complete Edition Remastered&nbsp;</em>brings the nostalgia</h2>

<p>Remember that remaster of a classic&nbsp;<em>Dynasty Warriors&nbsp;</em>game Koei Tecmo teased back in August? Well, it turns out that remaster is for&nbsp;<em>Dynasty Warriors 3</em>, and you'll be able to check it out on March 19th.</p>

<h2><em>Code Vein II&nbsp;</em>brings more anime Soulslike goodness in January</h2>

<p>Next up, we got a release date for Bandai Namco's anime Soulslike <i>Code Vein II</i>, which will bring more stylized hack-and-slash action (and probably more incomprehensible plotting as well) when it arrives on January 30th.</p>

<h2><em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles&nbsp;</em>gets a spotlight</h2>

<p>This one's not new, but it's nice to get a look at Square Enix's upcoming&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy Tactics&nbsp;</em>remaster nonetheless. The revamped version of the iconic tactics RPG is heading your way on September 30th, and you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/final-fantasy-tactics-ivalice-chronicles-review-timeless-classic" rel="nofollow">read our review here</a>.</p>

<h2>Somehow,&nbsp;<em>Let It Die&nbsp;</em>returned</h2>




<p>I bet the return of roguelite hack-and-slasher&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/let-it-die" rel="nofollow">Let It Die</a>&nbsp;</em>wasn't on your bingo card, and yet here we are.&nbsp;<em>Let It Die: Inferno&nbsp;</em>revives the original game's "twisted, darkly funny dystopian world", and you'll be descending into the titular abyss when it arrives on December 3rd.</p>

<h2><em>Chronoscript: The Endless End&nbsp;</em>has a silly name, but it looks fun</h2>

<p>Next, it's an action RPG from the folks behind <em>RPG&nbsp;</em><em>Time: The Legend of Wright</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Chronoscript: The Endless End</em>&nbsp;brings a similar hand-drawn vibe, as well as a rather ridiculous name that evokes the halcyon days of PS1 JRPGs.</p>

<h2><em>Crimson Desert&nbsp;</em>launches in March</h2>

<p>Are you looking forward to Pearl Abyss' open-world action-adventure title&nbsp;<em>Crimson Desert</em>? Well, you won't have too much longer to wait for it, because the game is launching on March 19th, and more gameplay was revealed during this State of Play as well.</p>

<h2>Sony's Pulse Elevate wireless speakers are pretty chic</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pulse-elevate-speakers-state-of-play-september-2025.jpg?itok=D1QUFsw1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pulse-elevate-speakers-state-of-play-september-2025.jpg?itok=g8juS_px 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sony is releasing some new speakers to jazz up your PS5 (or PC) setup.</figcaption></figure><p>Who's up for a hardware announcement? Well, whether you are or not, here's one for you. The Pulse Elevate wireless speaker set combines the PS5's space-age aesthetic with 3D audio, as well as seamless switching between devices. These are launching next year.</p>

<h2>PlayStation Plus gets some love</h2>

<p>Sony revealed some games heading to the PlayStation Plus subscription service next, including&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us Part II&nbsp;</em>(and its <i>Remastered&nbsp;</i>counterpart on PS5) tomorrow, as well as&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2</em>,&nbsp;<em>Goat Simulator 3</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Cocoon</em>.</p>

<h2>A big&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>update is coming</h2>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo&nbsp;</em>series has sold 100 million units around the world, it turns out, and to celebrate the milestone, creator Kazunori Yamauchi says a big update is coming to <i>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</i>in December, bringing new cars, new tracks, and more.</p>

<h2><em>God of War&nbsp;</em>is getting...a limited-edition controller</h2>

<p>How would you choose to celebrate the 20th anniversary of one of the most influential action franchises in gaming? If you said "with a limited-edition DualSense controller, of course", then you're on Sony's wavelength, but I'm not sure everyone else is. It's coming in October.</p>

<h2>Insomniac's&nbsp;<em>Marvel's Wolverine&nbsp;</em>gets some new gameplay and a release window</h2>




<p>At last! Insomniac took to the...er, the virtual stage next to reveal some gameplay footage (albeit some fairly heavily scripted footage) from&nbsp;<em>Marvel's Wolverine</em>, which, it turns out, is launching in fall next year. The reveal was followed by a neat little vignette about the making of the game.</p>

<hr><p>That's all from the September 2025 State of Play! Stay tuned for the next one, whenever that will be, and make sure to check back with us for all the other major publishers' events as and when they happen.</p>
