            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/infinity-imperial-service-action-pack-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the <em>Infinity</em> universe,&nbsp;PanOceania is the most powerful faction in the Human Sphere, boasting the most planets, a thriving economy, and cutting-edge technology. Standing against them are the combined nations of Yu Jing, united under the powers of the ruling Party and the Emperor, each backed up with their own military force. The Incincible Army makes sure the designs of the Party are adhered to, and the Imperial Service does whatever it takes to see that the desires of the Emperor are met. In this article, we'll take a look at the new <em>Infinity</em> Imperial Service Action Pack, and what lengths this determined group of enforcers will go to.</p>

<p><em>Infinity N5 </em>launched last year with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/infinity-operation-sandtrap-review-launch-of-infinity-n5" rel="nofollow">Operation Sandtrap</a> box, and those who've been reading my articles for a while will know that I started my own <em>Infinity</em> journey with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/infinity-jsa-army-pack-review-take-to-war-with-cyber-ninjas-and-samurai-power" rel="nofollow">JSA launch box</a> back in 2018 when the JSA broke away from Yu Jing and became a non-aligned army, before finally becoming their own standalone faction in <em>Infinity N5</em>.</p>




<h2>The Dragon's Claws</h2>

<p>The Imperial Service is made up of&nbsp;tactical units of Judicial and Military Police, criminal regiments, units transferred as reinforcements by the State Empire Army, and special troops in direct service to the Emperor. Its outward-facing mission is to preserve the rule of law and order and defend Yu Jing from any internal or external enemy. The rule of law and order they follow is that directed by the Emperor, and if that ever comes into conflict with anyone else, even the Party, they will do whatever is required to see their goals met.</p>

<p>This means that the Imperial Service is made up of empowered bad guys, given free rein to see that the wills of the Emperor are enforced, and their playstyle shows this. The Imperial Service has a combination of infiltration and camouflaged troops, as well as solid attacks when they need to eliminate their target.</p>

<p>The Imperial Service Action pack includes 9 Imperial Service units, some of them unique to the Imperial Service sectorial, and others can be used in other sectorials, and the wider Yu Jing faction. The action pack contains:</p>

<ul><li>3x Celestial Guards - The core line troops of the Imperial Service, armed with combi rifles.</li>
	<li>1x Imperial Agent Crane Rank - Armed with a heavy machine gun, this is the Lieutenant of the set, but I would look at replacing them with Sun Tze (who is an absolute beast).</li>
	<li>1x Imperial Agent Pheasant Rank - The backup Lieutenant armed with a red fury. They also have tactical awareness which gives them&nbsp;an extra order token each turn.</li>
	<li>1x Bayara with Light Shotgun - This unit is actually 2 units on the same base. Their purpose is to hunt down intruders into the palace, so their profile comes armed with several ways of discovering hidden foes.</li>
	<li>1x&nbsp;Wu Ming - This profile comes armed in this set with a submachine gun, and has its own Fireteam named after it. It can join&nbsp;up with a Zangying and the Imperial Agents if required for the fireteam bonuses they provide.</li>
	<li>1x Koga Ninja - I'm a huge fan of the ninjas in JSA, and this Imperial Service ninja doesn't disappoint. With all the usual sneakiness of ninja units, the Koga&nbsp;is armed with all kinds of electro-magnetic weapons, the target of their attacks has to make 2 saving throws per hit and half their usual saving throw bonus.</li>
	<li>1x Jinyao Drop Unit - This assault unit can super-jump for maximum board mobility and comes armed&nbsp;with a boarding shotgun and para mines, which can immobilize units that set them off.</li>
</ul><figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/infinity-imperial-service-action-pack-4.jpg?itok=Wt1J6tU0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/infinity-imperial-service-action-pack-4.jpg?itok=hk5U31gA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Also avvialble as part of the Imperial Service revivial for&nbsp;<em>Infinity N5&nbsp;</em>are the Longwang TAG and specialist Dragon Lord.</figcaption></figure><h2>His Will</h2>

<p>Realising alongside the Imperial Service action pack are the Longwang, Imperial TAG police, and a special launch miniature, the Dragon Lord, Imperial Service Judges. The Longwang is an armored TAG unit, accurate at range with its heavy machine gun and its immobilizing adhesive launcher, and deadly up close with its para close combat weapon. It also gets a bonus order token to get things done. The Dragon Lord is a specialist troop to help you complete mission objectives, they're decent in close combat, and their ranged nanopulser is a template weapon for anyone trying to close with them.</p>

I'd also look to pick up a Su-Jian, who can fireteam up with another Su-Jian or the Longwang, and has 2 forms. Using a movement action to change between them, the Su-Jian has a high-mobility form, which allows them to close the distance quickly, and then change into the combat form when they're ready to bring the pain.</p>

<p>The <em>Infinity</em> Imperial Service action pack is a decent box, with some fantastic-looking miniatures. It goes some way to showing what the Imperial Service is capable of and combined with the Longwang, gives them some presence on the table. You will need to add some units to get the most out of them though, and they're not a super straight-forward faction to pilot if you're a brand new <em>Infinity</em> player. But they are fun, and have a lot of tricks and ways to hunt down hidden enemies, plus this box has the new Koga Ninja, who is pretty awesome.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-date-everything-release-date-summer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Romantic dating sim&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>has a brand new release date, and Team17 and Sassy Chap's "star-studded" adventure is arriving on PC and current-gen consoles just in time for summer.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>will now be launching on June 17th. The game was due to launch on what would have been the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/date-everything-delayed-again" rel="nofollow">ideal date for its arrival</a>, but it was delayed (and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/date-everything-delayed-valentines-day" rel="nofollow">not for the first time</a>) in order to ensure additional polish.</p>

<p>In&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!</em>, you're equipped with a pair of "Dateviators", glasses that essentially allow you to see objects in your home as dateable people. It's probably best if you don't think about the implications of that too much.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/date-everything-release-date-summer-keyes.jpg?itok=ZNzcEnaP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/date-everything-release-date-summer-keyes.jpg?itok=MIlY9Vg0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>has a new, and hopefully final, release date.</figcaption></figure><p>Equipped with said Dateviators, you'll be able to romance over 100 characters, with inanimate objects like laundry baskets, pianos, and vacuum cleaners available for romantic relationships. You can even date concepts like existential dread.</p>

<p>Not only can you date lots of characters, but you can also explore a "fully interactive 3D overworld", as Sassy Chap says, and the world of the game will change based on choices you make throughout your run.</p>

<p>Sassy Chap is also promising lots of branching dialogue and multiple endings for each character (not just for the game itself), as well as full voice acting for the game's romanceable roster.</p>

<p>The voice cast is pretty impressive, too; actors include the likes of&nbsp;<em>Supernatural</em>'s Felicia Day (with whom you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/felicia-day-is-new-guest-at-twenty-sided-tavern-key-to-improv-and-dungeons" rel="nofollow">check out our&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>-themed interview here</a>),&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>'s Ben Starr, and&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>'s Neil Newbon, also known as Astarion.</p>




<p>With over a million words in its script,&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>might not be quite on the same level as&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-script-words" rel="nofollow"><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>for sheer volume</a>, but it promises to keep you busy nonetheless.</p>

<p><em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>lands on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2201320/Date_Everything/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010892" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/date-everything/9n0ccpmbljq8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and Nintendo Switch on June 17th. No Nintendo Switch 2 version has yet been confirmed.</p>
