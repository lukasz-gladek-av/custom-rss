            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Funcom and developer Astrolabe Interactive have announced the Bloom &amp; Blight update for cozy survival adventure&nbsp;<i>Aloft</i>, and it's set to bring big improvements to the game next month.</p>

<p>As revealed in a press release,&nbsp;<em>Aloft</em>'s Bloom &amp; Blight update will arrive on November 4th, and the two studios are talking a big game for the update; it's apparently set to improve "almost every facet" of the game.</p>

<p>According to Funcom and Astrolabe, Bloom &amp; Blight will "revamp and improve almost every aspect of [<em>Aloft</em>], including world generation, tech tree progression, exploration and travel, ecosystem restoration, and combat", so this is a pretty ambitious undertaking.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aloft-bloom-blight-update-cliff.jpg?itok=kwigv55z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aloft-bloom-blight-update-cliff.jpg?itok=_Jing2EI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Aloft&nbsp;</em>is getting a very big update indeed soon.</figcaption></figure><p>Many of the changes coming as part of&nbsp;<em>Aloft</em>'s Bloom &amp; Blight update were outlined in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1660080/view/517473930105061675" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">developer blog</a> back in late September, and it does indeed look like the developers are pulling out all of the stops with this one.</p>

<p>Progression will be overhauled to be less confusing and directionless, and ecosystem restoration will be redesigned so that it feels more "engaging" and less "likely simply ticking items off a checklist".</p>

<p>It's not just content within the game that will be getting changes, however;&nbsp;<em>Aloft</em>'s developers are also working on the technical side of things, with the save data system getting a complete overhaul to "achieve long-term stability".</p>

<p>Suffice it to say that if you haven't played&nbsp;<em>Aloft </em>since its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/aloft-early-access-release-date" rel="nofollow">January Early Access release</a>, or even if you're new to the game, you should hopefully find a significantly improved and expanded version of the survival adventure after Bloom &amp; Blight lands.</p>




<p>News of&nbsp;<em>Aloft</em>'s latest major update comes just a couple of days after publisher Funcom <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-funcom-layoffs" rel="nofollow">embarked on a spate of layoffs</a>, with&nbsp;<em>Metal: Hellsinger&nbsp;</em>developer The Outsiders <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-hellsinger-the-outsiders-shut-down-funcom" rel="nofollow">closing down</a> as a result of these staff cuts.</p>

<p>That's despite the fact that sci-fi survival sim<i>&nbsp;Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</i>proved to be the company's most successful release yet, racking up <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-sales-1m-infographic" rel="nofollow">a million sales within just two weeks of its launch</a> back in June this year.</p>

<p>In any case, you can check out&nbsp;<em>Aloft&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1660080/Aloft/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>, and you can remind yourself what our very own Isaac thought of the game by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/aloft-preview" rel="nofollow">reading his preview from January</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Vampire Survivors&nbsp;</em>developer and publisher Poncle has announced a brand new update for the arcade roguelike, and it'll finally bring the ability to play the game online alongside your friends.</p>

<p>As revealed in <a href="https://x.com/poncle_vampire/status/1975546530238013703" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on X,&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors&nbsp;</em>Update 1.14 is due to arrive sometime this fall, and it's bringing online co-op to the game on both PC and consoles, although it's not clear right now whether the game's multiplayer mode will feature crossplay.</p>

<p>Of course, Poncle revealed the news of&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em>' online co-op mode with a characteristically amusing trailer featuring a throwback Windows 95-style operating system, so if, like me, you're hopelessly nostalgic for the days of old-school PC gaming, this one'll appeal to you.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/poncle-vampire-survivors-online-co-op-update-windows-95.jpg?itok=VZADLhqn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/poncle-vampire-survivors-online-co-op-update-windows-95.jpg?itok=S10Mc8B4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Oh, Poncle, you rogue, you.</figcaption></figure><p>The trailer also shows a clip of four players enjoying&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors&nbsp;</em>together, and indeed, the game's online co-op mode will support up to four players, so grab three friends and get ready to fill the screen with an absolutely cosmic amount of projectiles.</p>

<p>As well as online co-op, there are four more major features to be revealed as part of&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors&nbsp;</em>Update 1.14, and Poncle is pledging to reveal new cards each week, so we'll learn more about what else is coming as part of this update in...well, in a week, as it happens.</p>

<p>News of&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em>' latest update comes just a couple of months after Poncle announced its second major <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-survivors-studio-poncle-publishing" rel="nofollow">foray into the publishing world</a> in the form of brick-breaking roguelike&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kill-the-brickman-poncle-out-now" rel="nofollow">Kill the Brickman</a>&nbsp;</em>(no, not that one).</p>




<p>As for the game that made Poncle's name, if you're somehow unfamiliar with it,&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors&nbsp;</em>is an action-heavy arcade roguelike in which you must survive hordes of enemies swarming you across a variety of different maps.</p>

<p>To that end, you'll gain access to projectile and melee weapons that fire themselves, so it's up to you to position yourself correctly and try to build the perfect combination of items in order to survive for as long as you possibly can.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hades-2-review-the-new-standard-for-rougelites.1318504/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/supergiant-games" rel="nofollow">Supergiant Games</a>, the developers for hits like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/review/transistor-review-kill-robots-talking-sword" rel="nofollow">Transistor</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/supergiant-games/reviews" rel="nofollow"><em>Hades</em></a>, never cease to amaze me. Somehow, each game they make is better than the last. So with their latest title<em>&nbsp;Hades 2,&nbsp;</em>I have to wonder how anything could top this. Yes, it's that good. With how incredible&nbsp;<em>Hades 2&nbsp;</em>is, can you&nbsp;<em>imagine</em>&nbsp;what they've got cooking in the future?</p>

<p>But let's focus on the present for now.&nbsp;<em>Hades 2&nbsp;</em>is undeniably a Game of the Year contender, the same as its predecessor. This <a href="https://techraptor.net/genre/roguelite/games" rel="nofollow">roguelite</a> -- filled with mechanical depth and wonderful, complex characters -- continues to give more and more, even after dozens of runs across many hours of gameplay.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hades-2-hecate.jpg?itok=opPfS3jt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hades-2-hecate.jpg?itok=pFLd10Cn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hecate isn't the only one with a grudge.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Hades</em>&nbsp;is Back and Better than Ever</h2>

<p><em>Hades 2</em>&nbsp;expands upon what was already a meaty game in&nbsp;the original&nbsp;<em>Hades</em>. Hailed as one of the greatest in its genre,&nbsp;<em>Hades</em>&nbsp;provided a great deal of content as player character Zagreus fought through an Underworld directly based on Greek myth.</p>

<p>With this title stars Zagreus' sister, Melinoe, who was born after the events of the original and, due to the scheming of the Titan of Time Chronos, she was whisked away from her family at a very young age. Melinoe, along with the titaness Hecate, trained for many years in the ways of witchcraft and combat in order to take down Chronos and save both the Underworld and the other gods of Olympus.</p>

<p>Any good run in&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>&nbsp;begins with some prep work, and that's what Hecate's base of operations is for. It's a beautiful, witchy hub where Melinoe can, among other things, conduct incantations at the cauldron to unlock new mechanics. Incantations require materials, which are acquired during your runs, so despite&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>'s inevitability of failure during a run, you're still making progress towards your end goal.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hades-2-incantations.jpg?itok=txCFQvlV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hades-2-incantations.jpg?itok=rw41BZmc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The iconic witch's cauldron, a very useful tool.</figcaption></figure><p>Because upgrades are introduced at a natural and steady pace, I was never overwhelmed by the breadth of mechanics. There is a&nbsp;<em>lot</em>&nbsp;going on in&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>, you see, but somehow, Supergiant Games manages to make it less intimidating than it sounds.</p>

<p>You can unlock new weapons, open up new pathways, and add helpful shrines to enhance your run. Conduct the&nbsp;Propensity Toward Gold incantation to allow urns with extra gold to appear, or activate&nbsp;Faith of Familiar Spirits to acquire animal companions.</p>

<p>Most, if not all, incantations are more nuanced than many roguelites' approach to metaprogression. This makes&nbsp;<em>Hades 2&nbsp;</em>vastly more interesting in terms of gameplay, meaning that every time you unlock the ability to do a new incantation, it's actually quite exciting.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hades-2-boon-of-poseidon_0.jpg?itok=0FJcaWym 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hades-2-boon-of-poseidon_0.jpg?itok=dGtKzHpm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Thank you, Uncle Poseidon.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><h2>Gifts of the Gods</h2>

<p>Beyond that, of course, is your standard run through the Underworld in your quest to defeat Chronos. This formula remains true to the original&nbsp;<em>Hades</em>&nbsp;in that you'll fight across a number of zones with hand-crafted rooms arranged in random order. You acquire upgrades and items after completing combat encounters in each room, creating a simple combat loop.</p>

<p>Boons will be the main source of your power here -- these are gifts from the gods that alter your abilities during a run. Like incantations, boons have more nuance to them than your typical roguelite upgrade. You might get stat increases like increased damage or power, but more often than not, boons alter the way your abilities behave.</p>

<p>For every boon you're given three choices, but there are something like two dozen boons for each god, so the possibilities with your builds feel limitless. As an example of what we're working with,&nbsp;I'd get pretty excited every time I saw a boon of Hephaestus waiting for me.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/haphaestus-hades-2.jpg?itok=gWzIJj53 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/haphaestus-hades-2.jpg?itok=T8swHtLb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Side note, I love his design.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>The God of the Forge would, appropriately, buff your attacks to have blast-like effects, much like a hammer striking hot metal fresh from the forge. These blast effects deal a great amount of damage and refresh after a cooldown. Hephaestus' boons often inflict a debuff called "Glow" on enemies, which allows foes to take an increased percentage of damage.</p>

<p>Of course, you'll likely find your favorite gods and pick which boons work best for you. Personally, I'm still experimenting with possibilities even after 30 hours of playtime, and I definitely haven't seen everything boons have to offer.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hades-2-gameplay.jpg?itok=64Aizidb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hades-2-gameplay.jpg?itok=_1TzNJOY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>They look intimidating, but they're no match for Melinoe.</figcaption></figure><h2>Melinoe the Witch</h2>

<p>Where Zagreus felt like more of a brawler in&nbsp;<em>Hades</em>, Melinoe is more like a spellcaster. She is a witch, after all, so it only makes sense for her to utilize more spells and ranged-based attacks. Thus, more of her toolkit favors ranged combat, though you're still given a number of close-ranged weapons to choose from.</p>

<p>Though the melee weapons felt way more underpowered compared to the ranged weapons in&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>. Why get up close and risk getting hit by an enemy when you can attack just as effectively at range? So yes, I vastly preferred keeping foes at bay.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In terms of weapon variety,&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>&nbsp;is similar to its predecessor. You're given a handful of weapons -- called Nocturnal Arms -- to choose from, which will serve as the basis for your kit. From there, these enhance your attacks, dash-strikes, and specials.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hades-2-skull.jpg?itok=XGQsqAGB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hades-2-skull.jpg?itok=CByzXfuG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Using the skull on our skeletal punching bag, Schelemeus.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>I preferred the Argent Skull, which is an ammo-based projectile that has a potent, long-range attack that catered to my preferred playstyle. You're given four skulls, and after shooting them, Melinoe must recover them in order to shoot again.</p>

<p>It sounds like a bit of an unconventional way to play, but I like that. Melinoe special dashes forward and grabs those skulls, so the Argent Skull has a great deal of mobility to add onto it. Grab Hephaestus' boons to alter its attacks and specials, and you're going to melt bosses!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hades-2-weapons.jpg?itok=sj-QFFFn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hades-2-weapons.jpg?itok=din5BxJL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Weapons even have variants, so there is so much to unlock and use!</figcaption></figure><p>There's also the cast ability, which you're given regardless of what weapon you choose. This creates a circle on the ground that slows down enemies and can be a very beneficial tool when overwhelmed. Add on a damaging boon, and it serves as a great way to tack on debuffs and damage foes.</p>

<p>Once more adding some complexity and depth to&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>'s mechanics are Arcana cards, which are permanent unlocks that serve as ways to improve survivability, increase the potency of abilities, and much more. Keepsakes, gifts from gods and other characters, also aid you in&nbsp;this one, as they did in<em>&nbsp;</em>the original. By now, you can probably see what I mean when I say there's a lot going on in&nbsp;<em>Hades 2.&nbsp;</em></p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mt.-olympus-hades-2.jpg?itok=IPQ6kARS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mt.-olympus-hades-2.jpg?itok=JHIXZtvn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>So this is where the gods live, eh?</figcaption></figure><h2>Taking the Fight to Mt. Olympus</h2>

<p>Truth be told, there's much more to&nbsp;<em>Hades 2&nbsp;</em>than just traversing through the Underworld.&nbsp;Eventually, Melinoe gains the ability to fight on the surface in an attempt to rescue Mount Olympus from a siege. Here we have even&nbsp;<em>more&nbsp;</em>variety&nbsp;in gameplay as it introduces new level layouts, an entirely different&nbsp;set of enemies, bosses, and characters to meet as well.</p>

<p>This is where I realized that&nbsp;<em>Hades 2&nbsp;</em>is more special than I initially thought. The surface is where Supergiant Games' strengths are truly leveraged. Gameplay is, as usual, wonderful, but where they truly excel is with art and sound direction, and strong character writing.</p>

<p><em>Hades 2</em>&nbsp;is gorgeous, and the zones are so varied. In the Underworld, Chronos' version of Tartarus has this opulent, clockwork aesthetic. Go to the surface, and you'll eventually reach the snow-capped cliffs of Mt. Olympus, which are magical in their own right, despite their beauty being marred by Chronos' attacking army.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/prometheus-hades-2.jpg?itok=TyYDL7jH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/prometheus-hades-2.jpg?itok=qixaONM7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Holy moly what a cool lookin' dude.</figcaption></figure><h2>All Things Greek Myth</h2>

<p>Meanwhile, this title brings its characters to life with some of the best character design in the business, as well as strong voice performances by its wonderful cast,&nbsp;including everyone's favorite Ben Starr as Prometheus.</p>

<p>I do want to make a point with Prometheus for a second. If you're familiar with his myth, he was essentially damned to a hellish eternity of being chained to a mountaintop while an eagle devours his innards. I didn't realize it at first, but Prometheus has a bandage around his belly along with a giant scar. As a boss, he has an eagle companion as a weapon and also uses fire (the fire makes sense, as he was the one who gave fire to humanity).</p>

<p>This is just one example of strong visual design conveying a lot about a character, but you'll see this in just about every encounter. You don't really need to know much, if anything, about Greek mythology to enjoy the writing&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>&nbsp;offers, though. It's well-written enough that you can intuit a character's backstory based on what they say.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/scylla-and-the-sirens-hades-2.jpg?itok=VzPx4JZ2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/scylla-and-the-sirens-hades-2.jpg?itok=JqC64Crq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This one is for Odysseus!</figcaption></figure><p>It was a particular joy to see characters featured from&nbsp;<em>The Odyssey,&nbsp;</em>my favorite tale from Greek myth. There's the cunning and wily Odysseus, who now acts as a tactician for Hecate. We fight Scylla, a sea monster that had a run-in with Odysseus in the past, as well as the cyclops Polyphemus, who still hasn't forgotten how Odysseus outwitted him that one time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This really scratches the surface when it comes to writing, but I'm continually amazed by how much dialogue is offered in&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>. There are dozens upon dozens of lines for each character, reacting to different things like how your run went, what items you have on, and the like. It's marvelous work.</p>

<p>Really, writing is very strong up until the end. I expected more of an emotional response, but I wasn't fully satisfied with how things ended. This, I realize, is a common complaint among the fandom, but there's a lot of truth to it. I won't divulge details, but I expected something more, I don't know,<em>&nbsp;</em>compelling or thought-provoking, given how strong the rest of the narrative was.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fields-hades-2.jpg?itok=z6jPCCpR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fields-hades-2.jpg?itok=1R7-zTCE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Where to go from here?</figcaption></figure><h2>Hades 2 Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>I know it's in a roguelites nature to be repetitive, but one additional issue I had with&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>&nbsp;was its boss battles. I felt the same way I did in the original, but they're just so repetitive to a point that I don't look forward to fighting them anymore.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, in order to roll credits, you're tasked with getting to the end of both the Underworld and the surface quite a few times, so you'll be repeating this cycle a lot. There's no simple solution to fixing this. It's a quirk from roguelites I don't really prefer, so I'd lose excitement when I knew a boss was in the next room.</p>

<p>Despite this,&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>&nbsp;is by far the most compelling roguelite ever made. Possibly even the best, and I'm not being hyperbolic. Seriously, it's no wonder other developers try to emulate the formula, only to create something less than the inspiration. Well, with a second stab at&nbsp;<em>Hades</em>, Supergiant Games one-ups itself with an even better version of the game that shook up the genre.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Shovel Knight&nbsp;</em>developer Yacht Club Games has announced that&nbsp;<em>Mina the Hollower</em>, its upcoming retro-style top-down action-adventure game, has been delayed indefinitely.</p>

<p>Announcing the delay in a <a href="https://www.yachtclubgames.com/blog/delay-extravaganza-ii-the-tail-continues/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a>, Yacht Club says that despite "working tirelessly day and night to finish"&nbsp;<em>Mina the Hollower&nbsp;</em>for its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mina-the-hollower-release-date-yacht-club" rel="nofollow">intended October 31st release date</a>, the development team is "just not quite there yet".</p>

<p>According to the studio, the delay in question won't be "major"; it'll simply be an opportunity to "apply some final polish and balancing" to ensure that&nbsp;<em>Mina the Hollower&nbsp;</em>is ready for primetime when it releases. However, no new release date was revealed, so we don't know when the game will actually be arriving.</p>

<p>As for what's actually being done during the final hours of development, Yacht Club says the team is currently working on issues like finalizing design and art, game balance, and implementing localization, as well as "eating cheese". Well, that's a noble reason for a delay in my books.</p>

<p>If you're wondering what&nbsp;<em>Mina the Hollower&nbsp;</em>is, it's the next title developed by&nbsp;<em>Shovel Knight&nbsp;</em>outfit Yacht Club Games, which has also branched out into publishing with the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/yacht-club-games-announce-8-bit-platformer-cyber-shadow" rel="nofollow">2021's&nbsp;<em>Cyber Shadow</em></a>.</p>

<p>The game revolves around the titular Mina, who must traverse Tenebrous Isle in order to rescue it from a curse. It utilizes deliberately retro-style graphics, just like&nbsp;<em>Shovel Knight</em>, but this time, the vibe is much more&nbsp;<em>Link's Awakening&nbsp;</em>than&nbsp;<em>Mega Man</em>.</p>




<p>We don't yet know when&nbsp;<em>Mina the Hollower&nbsp;</em>will launch, but when it does, it's set to arrive on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1875580/Mina_the_Hollower/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010918" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, Xbox, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/Mina-the-Hollower-2887867.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">both</a> Nintendo Switch <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Mina-the-Hollower-2887790.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">consoles</a>.
