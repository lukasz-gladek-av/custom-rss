            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Modiphius Entertainment has announced an official <em>Doom Arena Board Game</em>. The tabletop publisher behind <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/modiphius-announces-fallout-wasteland-warfare-second-edition" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Fallout: Wasteland Warfare</em></a> and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/mass-effect-board-game-review-back-to-reaper-war" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Mass Effect</em> board game</a> will be bringing the hyperviolence of the seminal shooter series to gaming tables.</p>

<h2>The Doom Arena Board Game Announcement</h2>

<p>In an official press release, Modiphius has announced that two versions of the <em>Doom Arena Board Game</em> will be available later this year via a Kickstarter campaign.</p>

The simple, but effective narrative of Doom Guy trapped on a Mars outpost surrounded by demonic enemies.</p>

<p>The second game, <em>Doom: The Dark Ages Arena Board Game</em>, is based on the 2025 release of "New Doom," an era packed with cosmic factions of demons, angels, cosmic horrors, and a superpowered hero called The Doom Slayer.</p>

<p>Regardless of which game you pick, both will feature a quick-to-learn competitive experience. Players face off as either Doom Guy or the demonic hordes as they navigate different battlefields, uncovering weapons and hidden power-ups straight from the series. These battles will escalate across three rounds. Last one standing wins. Of course, no matter who wins, the arenas are going to have a new crimson paint job.</p>

<p>Both versions of the <em>Doom Arena Board Game</em> will share the same ruleset. Additionally, the Kickstarter campaign will feature optional expansions, covering various enemies found in each franchise. Enemies such as the Atlan mech and the Mecha Dragon from <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/doom-dark-ages" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em></a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Chris Birch, co-founder of Modiphius, said: “DOOM has been that game that hard-core FPS players have loved since the original, and it brings back so many memories. We’re so excited to bring that frantic action, combined with our awesome miniatures, to the tabletop!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is unclear at the time of writing who the developers of the <em>Doom Arena Board Game</em> are or when the game is expected to ship. However, there is a good chance the base price may be more than expected due to recent current events.</p>
