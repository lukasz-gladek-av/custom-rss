            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After many years of waiting,&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>is finally out, but you may have a little trouble actually buying the game, because it appears to be crashing the digital storefronts on which it's available.</p>

<p>As noted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-steam-numbers-massive-player-count/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">TheGamer</a>,&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>quickly began destabilizing storefronts the moment it was released (around 40 minutes ago at time of writing), with Steam, the PlayStation Store, the Nintendo eShop, and even Xbox Game Pass' frontage all affected.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that I haven't been able to replicate these outages; for me, the storefronts in question all appear to be behaving themselves, although Steam is by far the most intermittent, since it's occasionally taking a few moments longer than usual to load.</p>

<p>Back in August, however, the&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-september" rel="nofollow">release date was finally revealed</a>, and the resulting furore caused <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-indie-delays" rel="nofollow">several indie developers to delay their games</a> in order to avoid clashing with said date. That's how anticipated&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>is (or was, prior to release).</p>

<p>That, then, would probably explain why storefronts are crashing; those who've been waiting for&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>since 2019, and those who are merely curious about its legendary status, are rushing to buy it in droves. I'd imagine the Steam numbers for this one are going to look very good indeed come tomorrow.</p>
