            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/second-monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has announced that a second&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>open beta will be held next month, giving you another chance to check out the next major installment in the&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>franchise.</p>

<p>The first open beta <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta" rel="nofollow">took place in November</a>&nbsp;and was so popular that it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-steam-records" rel="nofollow">broke Steam player count records</a> for the series, despite essentially being a playable demo. No wonder Capcom wants to hold a second beta test.</p>

<p>According to Capcom, this second beta is for players who "were unable to participate the first time or simply wish to play again", so if you did miss the first open beta, now's your chance to check it out once more.</p>

The first starts on February 7th and ends on the 10th, while the second runs between February 14th and 17th.</p>

<p>This second beta will contain all of the content featured in the first test, as well as the chance to take down the returning Gypceros monster, which made its last mainline appearance in&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Generations</em>.</p>

<p>You'll also be able to create your character, remake it "as many times as you like", and even design your Palico companion. Naturally, character creation data will also carry over into the full version of the game, and you can use the character you made in the first beta as well.</p>




<p>If you take part in the beta, you can also net yourself some unique rewards for the full game, including a bonus pendant and some extra items.</p>

<p>The second beta period will be held not long before the main game releases;&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>is due to launch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/monster-hunter-wilds/9NMT6XFN0LVD" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on February 28th.
