            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Just a week or so after setting a new record for concurrent users (CCU), Steam has now broken that record as well, passing a major CCU milestone in the process.</p><p>A quick look at the SteamDB <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/753/charts/#max" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">charts</a> for overall players shows that the platform hit an all-time high of 42,042,778 players yesterday, comfortably passing the 42-million-player barrier as well.</p><p>As a reminder, Steam last <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steam-concurrent-user-count-record-january-2026" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7be73f4e-884f-478a-a432-b10c198a1f4a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">broke its CCU record on January 5th</a>, when the platform registered a high of 41,816,052 players simultaneously online. It looks like the meteoric rise in popularity of Valve's platform is showing no signs of slowing down, despite Steam entering its 23rd year in 2026.</p><figure role="group">

<p>As noted by user <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/morwull.bsky.social/post/3mc5qaakaj22w" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Alejandro LL over on Bluesky</a>, the in-game player count peak record was also broken last week, with 13.4 million players enjoying games on Steam at the same time at one point. That's only a very, very slight increase over last week's figure, but it's still impressive.</p><p>By this metric, it's safe to say that Steam is very much the most popular PC gaming storefront, and players are buying games in their droves on Valve's platform as well.</p><p>Some of last year's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steam-best-of-2025" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="506dd7fd-a10c-4745-bcb4-ef7cfe0636c8" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">best-selling</a> and highest-grossing Steam games include perennial favorites like <em>GTA Online </em>and <em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em>, as well as much-vaunted single-player RPG <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em>, which achieved <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-3m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c5a6dab0-4602-48f3-8a89-7254df3e04d7" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">some pretty impressive sales numbers</a>.</p><p>However, Steam's best-seller list was also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/almost-20-of-top-new-sellers-on-steam-in-2025-used-generative-ai" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="16d0c419-db96-434f-99c7-9e50c881e987" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">rife with games that used generative AI</a>, an issue that continues to cause deep divisions; some <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hooded-horse-no-gen-ai-contracts" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4bf049e2-a4f8-41a0-b834-8030bfbcc977" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">slam AI</a> for its environmental impact and low-quality asset generation, while others consider it to be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-generative-ai-characters-pubg-inzoi" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5b68d64e-aec4-43ca-8198-297e274eb0d3" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">a boon during development</a>.</p><figure role="group">

<p>If you're not familiar with <em>Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot</em>, it is, as you've probably already surmised, an action RPG based on the long-running <em>Dragon Ball </em>series (the creator of which, Akira Toriyama, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-akira-toriyama-dies-at-68" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="8ae39a53-9e74-423d-ab8a-749d419a6fa3" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">sadly passed away in March 2024</a> aged just 68).</p><p>The game follows the events of the <em>Dragon Ball Z </em>anime series and includes four major arcs as part of its base offering, namely the Saiyan, Frieza, Cell, and Buu Sagas. Originally available on last-gen machines, it netted itself a PS5 and Xbox Series X|S release <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-z-kakarot-comes-ps5-xbox-series-next-year" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="cea9dab9-2fc1-4b67-a605-60c63a5ed2e2" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">in 2023</a>.</p><p>Extra storylines from other <em>Dragon Ball </em>media, including the likes of <em>Dragon Ball Super </em>and <em>Dragon Ball Daima</em>, are available as DLC, with the latest expansion taking players to <em>Daima</em>'s Demon Realm.</p><p>The first part of said DLC is already out for you to try, and the second part will be arriving in just a few days, so you won't have to wait too long to witness its conclusion.</p>
