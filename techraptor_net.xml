            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/killer-instinct-gold-nintendo-switch-online<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced that&nbsp;<em>Killer Instinct Gold</em>, a classic fighting game from the Nintendo 64 days, is now available via Nintendo Switch Online's Expansion Pack service.</p>

<p>Rare's fighter is the latest N64 game to join the subscription service's lineup, following on from other classics like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ridge-racer-64-nintendo-switch-online" rel="nofollow"><em>Ridge Racer 64</em></a>, spooky action-adventure game&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-n64-halloween" rel="nofollow"><em>Shadow Man</em></a>, and cult classic&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-n64-april-2024" rel="nofollow"><em>Iggy's Reckin' Balls</em></a>, among others.</p>

<p>Unlike some Switch Online N64 releases, it doesn't look like&nbsp;<em>Killer Instinct Gold&nbsp;</em>will be packing any extra online features; it'll just be you against the computer, or a friend that's daring enough to test their might against your unbeatable Sabrewulf.</p>

It features ten playable characters, three of whom (Kim Wu, Maya, and Tusk) are new additions to the roster.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, several characters from the original&nbsp;<em>Killer Instinct&nbsp;</em>haven't made it into&nbsp;<em>Killer Instinct Gold</em>'s roster, including Chief Thunder, Cinder, and Riptor. All of them would return for 2013's&nbsp;<em>Killer Instinct&nbsp;</em>reboot, however, as would every other character from the series up to that point.</p>

<p>Designed as a response to Midway's hugely popular&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat</em>,&nbsp;<em>Killer Instinct&nbsp;</em>features a focus on combo-based gameplay; the infamous "C-C-C-COMBO BREAKER" soundbite comes from the original 1994 release.</p>

<p><i>Killer Instinct Gold&nbsp;</i>largely carries across&nbsp;<em>Killer Instinct 2</em>'s gameplay and characters from the original arcade release, but it omits voiceovers and full-motion video sequences thanks to the memory limitations of the N64's cartridges.</p>




<p>To date, 2013's&nbsp;<em>Killer Instinct&nbsp;</em>remains the last game in the series, and since developer and custodian Iron Galaxy <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rumbleverse-and-killer-instct-studio-iron-galaxy-suffers-layoffs" rel="nofollow">suffered layoffs back in February</a>, I'm not sure another one is on the way anytime soon.</p>

<p>Still, you can content yourself with&nbsp;<em>Killer Instinct Gold</em>, which is available now as part of a Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack subscription. It'll also be playable on Nintendo Switch 2 when the console <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">launches on June 5th</a>.</p>
