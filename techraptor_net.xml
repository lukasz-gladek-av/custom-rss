            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p dir="ltr">Tarsier, well known for the creepy adventures of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/little-nightmares-2" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="22061769-d5d4-4e95-9fc9-7d2eb3fb1682" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Little Nightmares I </em>and <em>II</em></a> were unfortunately not able to make the threequel due to the shifting landscape of the gaming industry, but with the announcement of <em>Reanimal, </em>they were returning to familiar territory. How is <em>Reanimal </em>as a spiritual successor, what has changed, and what remains the same?</p><h2 dir="ltr">Just Two Small Children In A World That's Too Large For Them</h2><p dir="ltr">The game starts solemnly, with the boy of a brother/sister pairing making their way through vast waters on a boat. Moving from buoy to buoy, it's not long before your sister is picked up, the co-op player if you're experiencing the game with a friend.</p><p dir="ltr">While there isn't much clear at this point in the game, what is clear is that you'll be working to find your friends scattered through this creepy world and escape. Throughout the story, you run into your friends, each also trying to find their own way out of creepy locations, including a factory and trainyard, a farm and lighthouse, and a broken city.</p><picture>

  </picture><p dir="ltr">As you'd expect in a Tarsier Studios title, you'll be the target of some larger-than-life and horrific entities as you make your way through the world. Getting through a crowded parking lot is far more tense when you're navigating around the shed slithering skins of weirdly proportioned men or running from your life from a grossly deformed pelican. You're just two small children fighting to survive in a very large world.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><em>Reanimal's </em>Story Is Layered With Depth</h2><p dir="ltr">At its core, it's a story about trying to navigate through environmental puzzles and make your way out on the other side, while rescuing your friends, unscathed, but as with all of Tarsier Studios' works, the adventure is layered in metaphor and situations open to the player to interpret. Whether it be the heavy themes of industrialism and war, the birds quite literally kamikaze dive-bombing you at times, and the only creature other than your friend that offers any positivity, are pigs also sheltering from the horrors of the world before being led to slaughter, there's a far grander story at play here.</p><p dir="ltr">For the story on the surface, that of a boy, a girl, and their friends escaping, less is definitely more. You experience the tension, and the story is made up of smaller moments that come and go, keeping you engaged with the story. As for the deeper meaning behind the story, I feel I understand parts of it, but that there's a lot that I just might not be smart enough to understand on initial play.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2 dir="ltr">Escape, Escape, And Then Escape Again</h2><p dir="ltr">If you're familiar with <em>Little Nightmares</em>, then the gameplay loop will be one you're familiar with. Entering a new area it's your job to investigate your surroundings and find your way forward. This might be by simply making your way through a gap in wall panels, or to hunt for a bolt cutter as a way to break through a chained fence.</p><p dir="ltr">None of these puzzles is ever difficult and relies on you simply observing your environment. An early example of this is a pump trolley whose wheels have fallen off, the missing wheels are right next to the device or one room away.</p><p dir="ltr">Puzzles aren't just about getting towards something, but also getting away from something. These puzzles have you strategically hiding or running away from enemies. The hiding puzzles I had the most issues with, with these terrifying humanoid creatures moving around the room in a certain way there were a few times where I felt like, unless the pattern was previously known, there wouldn't be any way to progress. This led me to do what I could, get caught/eaten, and try again with knowledge of the pattern, trivializing the process.</p><p dir="ltr">The only way to succeed felt like I had to fail first.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2 dir="ltr">Tarsier's Largest Game World</h2><p dir="ltr">The way the gameplay of <em>Reanimal </em>varies furthest from previous Tarsier titles is in the scope of the world. Starting in a boat and making my way to a beach, I expected that to be the bottleneck to lead me into the story. Instead, the world remained quite large with what might almost be called a hub area that you routinely cycle back to.</p><p dir="ltr">Accompanying travel by boat is also a few segments of traveling by car and other vehicles.</p><p dir="ltr">The protagonists of this adventure are also voiced, but to say that there's a lot of dialogue or anything in the way of exposition would be a lie.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Reanimal </em>also advertises itself as a co-op horror adventure. By all means, <em>Reanimal </em>is a co-op game, with the sister character being controlled by the CPU if another player isn't present, but there isn't too much that really highlights co-operability.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/reanimal-review-co-op-action.jpg?itok=wIVUqYuB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p dir="ltr">There are only a small handful of times that the characters have to truly separate, but even that is just one character making their way to a different part of the same room to create a bridge/opening for the other to rejoin them.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Co-op Mostly For Show, Some Special Moments</h2><p dir="ltr">One section of the game had the characters tethered together, allowing them only a short distance from one another, having to navigate a maze of paths that were too fragile for more than one character to stand at a time.</p><p dir="ltr">This segment, and needing to plan movements from one path to another to remain within distance but not cause the path to crumble, was fantastic and forced some more thought into movement, but it was very short, and nothing this cooperative was revisited throughout the game.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're someone who really likes exploring worlds, there are all manner of secrets to find, including different gross hats for your characters to wear, concept artwork, and more secrets that unlock a 'true' ending.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/reanimal-review-bird-boss.jpg?itok=2UR3dMr5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p dir="ltr"><em>Reanimal's </em>true strength is in just how unsettling every aspect of it is. The world is dark, the creatures are disfigured and move with an unrealistic shamble, and you're always anticipating the worst to leap out at you from the next room.</p><p dir="ltr">Some of my favorite set pieces were a movie theater filled with deflated husks of humans, a cannon battlement at sea, and a brief underwater section that added even more isolation to the feeling of the world.</p><p dir="ltr">This dabbling in the 'unknown' of the waters, whether at the surface or deep below, was a nice touch of verticality to the world, and I would love to see Tarsier take a deep-sea horror adventure even further in the future.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2 dir="ltr"><em>Reanimal </em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2><p dir="ltr">I had a fun (unsettling) time playing through <em>Reanimal</em>. It's clear that the DNA of <em>Little Nightmares</em> is strong in this spiritual successor, and Tarsier is still a master of telling stories of strange little guys getting stuck in horrific worlds with disgusting characters.</p><p dir="ltr">The enhancements to gameplay were a delight and a fun way to enhance the experience, without straying too far from what makes these kinds of games enjoyable. If you're up for a spooky and tense adventure of exploration and escape, then <em>Reanimal </em>will be a great experience.</p><hr><p><em><strong>TechRaptor </strong>reviewed Reanimal on PC Via Steam with a code provided by the publisher.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/echo-generation-review" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4ae52c58-bf27-4725-a955-cfd07a88e454" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Echo Generation</em></a> was a game that immediately captured me when I first played its demo in 2020, and I was even more excited to see that a sequel was on the way. <em>Echo Generation 2</em> is an RPG where kids go on an adventure, discover the supernatural, and have a fun time along the way. I got my hands on the <em>Echo Generation 2</em> demo that shows a shift from traditional RPG combat to deckbuilding, and a story that hits the ground running with intrigue and larger stakes than before.</p><p dir="ltr">In the <em>Echo Generation 2</em> demo, you start as 'Sister M', a girl raised in a secret facility, having her psychic powers tested by scientists. While she's normally ok to go with the flow, the disappearance of her friends that she was raised with causes her to want to confront the director of the program.</p><p dir="ltr">This demo was only a few hours long, so not too much of the story was explored. You could travel around the various locations in the facility, interact with a lot of the world and other scientists to learn what life has been like, and it ended with a tease of something much larger going on behind the scenes that has been interesting to dive into when the full game releases.</p><picture>

  </picture><p dir="ltr">It already feels like the adventure and the stakes of the journey will be far larger. While I'm excited to be able to set out on a new big adventure, I do think I'll miss the small town 'kids on bikes' vibes of the original game.</p><p dir="ltr">World exploration is quite standard, with plenty of humans and objects to interact with. The player is rewarded by fully exploring areas, allowing them to find various items and prompts for side-quests with beneficial rewards. The biggest change to the <em>Echo Generation</em> formula is in the combat.</p><h2>Build Decks And Unleash Combos In <em>Echo Generation 2</em></h2><p dir="ltr">Combat in <em>Echo Generation 2</em> is a turn-based deckbuilding experience. As Sister M, you can build up a deck of ten cards with different damage and healing effects, target parameters, status, and more. One card might deal 30 damage to every enemy and inflict a burn status and be usable three times in a single combat, while another can allow you to heal slightly better and get a regen effect for two turns and can be used twice per combat.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/echo-generation-2-combat-1.jpg?itok=k38ADqzm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/echo-generation-2-combat-1.jpg?itok=gYG2OPcR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p dir="ltr">It's clear very early on that inflicting status effects is going to be extremely important as you progress through the game. Sister M's base ability lets her inflict two random statuses, and from fighting soldiers around the facility, you get a large number of cards that will inflict Burn, and then cards that will consume Burn for additional damage.</p><p dir="ltr">From the upgrade tree action economy will also play a major role as leveling up lets you play more cards through a turn, you'll go through your deck faster but have more chances to deal fast and powerful combos against your enemies.</p><p dir="ltr">The boss of the demo was one that I took a few tries to beat just to make sure I was able to find the right speed of dealing damage, building up combos, and also routinely setting up shields or healing myself. Thankfully, with any defeat, the game will put you right back to before you initiated that combat, so you can go right back into the fight or spend some time reworking your cards.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/echo-generation-2-deck.jpg?itok=SV65VklI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p dir="ltr">At this level, I was already having fun toying with combos, so as more cards and more playable characters are added to the party, I'm excited for the future.</p><p dir="ltr">One aspect of the battles that does seem a bit underbaked is the reactions to enemy attacks. When an enemy is attacking, an icon will briefly appear that you need to press the interact button with before it disappears. At the end of my turn, I could start mashing the A button and clear the icon just as quickly as it appeared, allowing myself to always successfully block. I wonder if there will be enemies that will have icons that you want to not interact with, but for now, it seems a bit trivial.</p><p dir="ltr">Cococucumber continues to craft some of the prettiest games out there, with their high-quality voxel designs creating blocky characters and worlds, but ones that are filled with personality and detail. I sat back and watched blocky electricity pulse out of a mech after defeating it in awe.</p><p dir="ltr">For the few moments where there are things that aren't brick-based, it also really conveys the idea of "this is something strange in this world."</p><p dir="ltr">Knowing it would be carrying on the legacy of <em>Echo Generation</em> I was already excited for this sequel, and after sinking a few hours into the game, it's just not releasing soon enough.</p><hr><p><em><strong>TechRaptor </strong>previewed Echo Generation 2 on PC via Steam with a code provided by the publisher.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Code Violet</em>, the dino horror game that probably wanted to hoover up players still disappointed in the lack of a <em>Dino Crisis </em>remake or sequel, is getting a followup, and it's got a very good name, if nothing else.</p><p>As revealed by developer <a href="https://x.com/TeamKillMedia/status/2021293486377431222" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TeamKill Media on X</a>, the sequel, which is currently in development, will be called <em>Code UltraViolet</em>. It's hard to argue with sequel naming like that, although I'm sure TeamKill will be hoping this one garners a better reception.</p><p>For context, <em>Code Violet </em>is an action-horror game that sees protagonist Violet battling through swarms of hostile dinosaurs in a bid to uncover the secrets of Aion, a colony that "harnesses cutting-edge time-travel technology to abduct women from the past to be surrogates" in order to save humanity from extinction.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Code Violet </em>is getting itself a sequel somehow.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Presumably, <em>Code Violet</em>'s sequel must be happening because the game sold enough copies to make a followup viable, although if it did, I'm not sure everyone who bought it is entirely happy with their purchase.</p><p>A quick glance at the game's <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/code-violet/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Metacritic page</a> shows that it's currently sitting at an aggregate score of 29/100, which Metacritic rather drily says indicates a "generally unfavorable" reception, with user reviews coming in even lower at 26.</p><p>A number of professional critics and users alike describe <em>Code Violet </em>as the "worst game" they've ever played, with some describing it as "unplayable" and others using even less kind language than that. It looks like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/code-violet-pc-vulgar-mods" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3b4a9b19-13fb-46ea-8565-3704316c3d25" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">vulgar PC mods were the least of the dev's worries</a> after all.</p><p><em>Code Violet </em>fares a little better on its official <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012908" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation Store page</a>, where more than 4,000 reviewers scored it at a 2.88 out of 5 cumulatively, although you'll find similarly excoriating text reviews if you delve a little deeper.</p>
<p>In any case, we'll have to see whether TeamKill Media can improve things for <em>Code UltraViolet</em>. With a name like that, I have to admit I'm kind of rooting for the devs. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
