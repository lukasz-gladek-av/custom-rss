            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-duskbloods-fromsoftware-nintendo-switch-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls&nbsp;</em>developer FromSoftware has announced&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods</em>, a multiplayer-focused Switch 2-exclusive PvPvE game with more than a hint of the creator's other franchises about it.</p>

<p><em>The Duskbloods&nbsp;</em>was revealed as part of today's Nintendo Direct presentation, alongside the likes of Switch 2 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">launch lineup game&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">Mario Kart World</a>&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2" rel="nofollow">3D platformer&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></a>, which is coming in July.</p>

<p>The debut trailer for the game looks suitably&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne</em>-esque, with a lot of Victorian-era architecture looming over imposing-looking backstreets, although the arrival of a futuristic-looking train does throw the usual FromSoftware vibe off a little (in a good way!).</p>

Whether it's an imposing-looking cathedral with a massive stained-glass window or a horrific monster crawling towards the camera in an underground lair, it looks like you'll get your money's worth from this one.</p>

<p>While this trailer does show off some of the gameplay you can expect from&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods</em>, it's a typically elliptical FromSoftware creation, so it's not giving too much away. You'll see brief moments of gameplay rather than extended sequences.</p>

<p>Indeed, not much about the game is given away at all in its initial announcement; it'll revolve around something called "moontears", and blood appears to be a prominent theme in&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods</em>, but we'll likely learn more in the coming months.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for FromSoftware's&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods&nbsp;</em>right here.</p>




<p><em>The Duskbloods&nbsp;</em>is one of many games coming to the Switch 2 in the next year or so; others include ports of games like&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6</em>, as well as a new&nbsp;<em>Hyrule Warriors&nbsp;</em>game and many more.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods&nbsp;</em>when it launches exclusively for Switch 2 sometime next year. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>
