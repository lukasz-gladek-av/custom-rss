            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-57-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has announced the release date for&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.7, with the latest update for the gacha action RPG arriving later this month and bringing new characters, plus new story and more, with it.</p>

<p>Just like with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-56" rel="nofollow">previous</a>&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-5-5-release-date" rel="nofollow">updates</a>, you can expect this one to introduce new story for you to experience, including a continuation of the Archon Quest, which will introduce a "new unrest" brewing between the Traveler twins.</p>

<p>Perhaps more exciting, however, is the debut of Skirk, Childe's "enigmatic master" and a unique 5-star fighter. She wields "Abyssal power camouflaged as Cryo", according to HoYoverse, and she can switch between two combat styles for a choice of burst damage or more sustained output.</p>

Both of her combat modes will use that resource for their abilities. She can also buff Hydro and Cryo users, buffing herself in the process.</p>

<p>Skirk isn't the only character joining the roster for&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.7, however. Also entering the fray in this update is Dahlia, a 4-star Hydro-wielding support fighter who can shield his allies and boost their stats.</p>

<p>Skirk and Dahlia will feature in the first half of the update's Event Wishes, alongside a rerun of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/genshin-impact-shenhe-build-guide" rel="nofollow">Shenhe</a>. The second half, meanwhile, will play host to reruns of Mavuika and Emilie, so look out for them if you didn't add them to your team the first time around.</p>




<p>If you're a returning customer to&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>updates, then you probably know what's next. That's right: it's time for some juicy codes. Here are this update cycle's goodies! Remember to put these in without the colons at the end of the codes.</p>

<ul><li>MasterSkirk0618: 100 Primogems, 10 Mystic Enhancement Ore</li>
	<li>YourSpaceTime: 100 Primogems, 5 Hero's Wit</li>
	<li>VoidStar0618: 100 Primogems, 50,000 Mora</li>
</ul><p><em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>is available to play right now for free on <a href="https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation, Xbox Series X|S, and mobile devices</a>. Version 5.7 lands on June 18th.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tencent-reportedly-bought-a-15-stake-in-helldivers-2-dev-arrowhead-last-year.1209210/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/arrowhead-tencent-stake-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report has emerged which claims that Chinese gaming and tech giant Tencent purchased a 15% stake in&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>developer Arrowhead Game Studios last year.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tencent-has-acquired-15-75-of-arrowhead-game-studios/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Insider Gaming</a> (which in turn cites Swedish publications <a href="https://www.di.se/digital/spelsuccen-gor-729-mkr-i-vinst-tencent-koper-in-sig/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Dagens Industri</a> and <a href="https://www.di.se/digital/spelsuccen-gor-729-mkr-i-vinst-tencent-koper-in-sig/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Breakit</a>), Tencent paid roughly $83 million for the stake, which represents a fraction of Arrowhead's reported valuation of about $532 million.</p>

<p>Insider Gaming also says that Arrowhead chief creative officer Johan Pilestedt welcomed the deal, claiming that it will open up the Chinese market for Arrowhead. Pilestedt also apparently said that the Chinese player base is the "holy grail" in the gaming industry (a quote for which Insider uses machine translation).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-arrowhead-tencent.jpg?itok=_hrMT8gp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-arrowhead-tencent.jpg?itok=39bIK_xt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>developer Arrowhead can reportedly now count Tencent among its shareholders.</figcaption></figure><p>Arrowhead is far from the only Western game company in which Tencent has a stake. The company is one of Ubisoft's major shareholders, having recently had a major role in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft--report-new-gaming-entity-core-ip" rel="nofollow">creation of a new entity</a> that will handle much of Ubisoft's most popular IP.</p>

<p>Tencent also counts&nbsp;<em>Dying Light&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tencent-techland-majority-stakeholder" rel="nofollow">Techland</a>,&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls&nbsp;</em>studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tencent-and-sony-buy-over-30-shares-in-from-software" rel="nofollow">FromSoftware</a>, and&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>giant Epic Games among its investments, with the latter having landed Tencent in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/us-government-investigating-epic-games-riot-games-due-to-tencent" rel="nofollow">hot water with the US government</a> in the past.</p>

<p>That's not to mention Tencent's many collaborations with other studios in the gaming industry, like its&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-outlanders-mobile-rpg" rel="nofollow"><em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>mobile RPG</a> or its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-mobile-revealed" rel="nofollow">mobile version of&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-mobile-revealed" rel="nofollow">Final Fantasy XIV</a>&nbsp;</em>(which has yet to come to the West). Suffice it to say Tencent is a pretty big deal, even for the Western gaming industry.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with Arrowhead, meanwhile, its most recent (and by far its biggest) game is PS5 and PC exclusive&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-financials-helldivers-2-sales" rel="nofollow">passed twelve million sales last year</a>&nbsp;and which has a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/helldivers-2-board-game-fully-funded-in-12-minutes-on-gamefound" rel="nofollow">board game adaptation</a> on the way as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/arrowhead-tencent-helldivers-2-mech.jpg?itok=igpWSSDF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/arrowhead-tencent-helldivers-2-mech.jpg?itok=YUxI8iJ6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>is a big deal for Arrowhead.</figcaption></figure><p>Despite&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>'s monumental success, creative director Johan Pilestedt is already thinking about what to do next; in January, he <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-johan-pilestedt-sabbatical" rel="nofollow">announced he would take a "sabbatical"</a> before returning to work on the studio's next project.</p>

<p>It's unlikely that Tencent's investment in Arrowhead will result in any major creative changes for the company, but we'll have to wait and see what happens next. Stay tuned for more.</p>
