            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Specialist retro gaming studio Nightdive has announced that the original PC version of&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2&nbsp;</em>will be delisted later this week, but it's not all bad news.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/238210/view/503964319779651936" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on Steam, Nightdive says the original 1999 release will be delisted from PC storefronts on October 10th, and that's not just Steam, either; it's also GOG and anywhere else the original version of the game is available.</p>

<p>However, if you do want to play the 1999 version rather than Nightdive's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/system-shock-2-25th-anniversary-remaster-release-date" rel="nofollow">recent remaster</a>, all is not lost. If you pick up the remaster, you'll magically see the original appear in your library as well, and if you already own the remaster, you'll get a copy of the original version free of charge.</p>

<p>If you've somehow made it this far without ever hearing about&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2</em>, it's a hugely influential first-person shooter released in 1999 by Ken Levine's Irrational Games alongside legendary immersive sim studio Looking Glass.</p>

<p>The game takes place on the Von Braun, where an unknown infection is ripping its way through the ship. Naturally, it's up to you to figure out where this infection is coming from and why it's happening.</p>

<p>Gameplay-wise,&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2</em>&nbsp;is an immersive sim-style RPG shooter in which you can specialize in various different disciplines to help you explore the Von Braun and battle its many hostile inhabitants. You can hack your way through problems, specialize in combat, or take any number of other approaches.</p>




<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2&nbsp;</em>right now on PC via both <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/238210/System_Shock_2_1999/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/system_shock_2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a>, and the remaster is also available across several platforms.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A dash of classic Disney aesthetic mixed with nightmare fuel creatures is strung together by an evocative story of grief and growth in&nbsp;<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="0d49d913-b71c-4d34-9676-14c5be241406" href="https://techraptor.net/games/bye-sweet-carole" rel="nofollow"><em>Bye Sweet Carole</em></a>. Revolving around Bunny Hall orphanage, the combination of narrative segments and puzzle platformer gameplay invites you to immerse yourself in the world of Lana as she works through the disappearance of her best friend, Carole.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Bye Sweet Carole</em>&nbsp;begins with Lana waking up in a place she doesn't recall. If you grew up in the early Disney era, you may instantly feel nostalgic. The illustrations of the title, all hand-drawn, are reminiscent of <em>Snow White.&nbsp;</em>There are even cute birds that speak with her, telling her she has returned to her kingdom of Corolla. She begins to chase after a letter, then ends up getting chased by a mysterious tar creature through murky water.</p>

<p>This is the first taste of the two different ways the game plays out: a narrative scene and gameplay. Cutscenes are akin to short films. A narrator may set up the current information or recent changes, characters interact with each other, and memories are discovered. During gameplay, you're set in a specific place and have to solve different puzzles to move the story forward. This combination allows you to absorb the story as well as experience it.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bye-sweet-carole-design-mailbox.jpg?itok=-rCoTQHT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bye-sweet-carole-design-mailbox.jpg?itok=GtbX173D 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>What pushes Lana forward? A letter signed by her best friend Carole, who has gone missing in recent weeks. Seeking to find out what happened to her, she chases after the letter up a tree, over a wall, and through a pond. This need to obtain the letter and track down Carole is Lana's motivation throughout the game. You get snippets of Lana's life, her relationship with Carole, and experience more of the Kingdom of Corolla, the other world merging with the world of mortals. Divided by chapter, you'll find yourself exploring areas of the orphanage lost to time, following the letter through the remnants of Corolla, and facing off against the villainous Mr. Kyn.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the game continues, the length of time you spend in each chapter can increase. Puzzles become more intricate, or more items are necessary to unlock the next location. You're able to change form into a rabbit about a quarter of the way through&nbsp;the game, allowing you to bounce off walls, crawl through small spaces, or execute higher jumps.&nbsp;You're not alone on the journey, at least not completely. Some chapters will have a helper for Lana, allowing her to bypass difficult barriers on her path.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As I sat there playing, I began to get the distinct feeling that&nbsp;<em>Bye Sweet Carole</em>&nbsp;was similar to&nbsp;<em>The Babadook<b>,&nbsp;</b></em>at least in essence. Lana is a young girl overwhelmed by the world around her, and without her best friend by her side, she cannot deal with her emotions. She's forgotten about Corolla, her mother, and the events that surrounded Carole's disappearance. Her <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3489024b-2d33-41b0-bc6c-5882c3d0c913" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/interview/lost-words-beyond-page-grief" rel="nofollow">grief</a> has taken over everything else in her life. As she works to find any hint about Carole and help restore the Kingdom of Corolla, she begins to work through that grief.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bye-sweet-carole-hiding-hold-breath.jpg?itok=r4Jb9Ev7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bye-sweet-carole-hiding-hold-breath.jpg?itok=kzyJRxzH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>It's not all doom and gloom, though. There's plenty to explore and experience. Objects you can look at, use, or collect are highlighted as you go through each location. Running causes bottles or decorative plates to shatter on the ground. Hunters, those infected by Mr. Kyn's tar, give chase when they hear the slightest sound. Hiding places are abound, but you need to reach them and hold your breath to find safety.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even with enemies around every corner, there are only two real combat sequences in <i>Bye Sweet Carole</i>. Most of the action occurs when being chased or trying to avoid dying. Quick time events (QTEs) liven things up while searching an area. There are a few different events, including smashing a button to free yourself from a trap, moving the joystick to maintain balance, or timing dance moves to earn a perfect score. These mesh with the movement actions you take to keep you from simply watching the game tell the story.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bye-sweet-carole-quick-time-event.jpg?itok=tB8iNArv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bye-sweet-carole-quick-time-event.jpg?itok=BcT-Bv0Y 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Time to Slow Down</h2>

<p>While the title has some exciting chase moments, the overall pacing of&nbsp;<em>Bye Sweet Carole&nbsp;</em>is on the slower side. You're meant to walk throughout the different areas (unless you're being hunted), explore the various items you can interact with, and take in the cutscene sequences without skipping them. For those who enjoy fast-paced games, you'll potentially find yourself wanting more action as the game continues. You can skip cutscenes and conversations, but the impact of the story can be missed just by overlooking those small moments.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On top of the pacing not being everyone's cup of tea, there were a couple of bugs encountered in my playthrough. The most prominent was Hunters getting stuck in certain areas, instead of moving along a pre-established path. One enemy even had a shadow of itself appear, making it difficult to continue through the stealth necessary area. Some minor differences between the subtitles and spoken lines are also present. However, an indie studio crafting such a clean title with glitches that only impact the game in small ways is an impressive feat.</p>

<p>Even though the pacing may be a bit slow for my taste,&nbsp;<em>Bye Sweet Carole</em>&nbsp;is a narrative delight that shines a light on the confusion and despair that accompany grief, especially for children in a fast-changing world. Impactful, heartwarming, and thought-provoking, the story is etched in every aspect of the title. With easy-to-grasp mechanics and a variety of QTEs, the game is accessible to all types of players, not just experts in platforming or puzzles. Tied together with gorgeous illustrations, a well-written plot, and cleanly designed gameplay,&nbsp;<em>Bye Sweet Carole</em>&nbsp;is ready to be a success for developer Little Sewing Machine.&nbsp;</p>
