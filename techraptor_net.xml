            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Snapshot Games and publisher Arc Games have announced the first major&nbsp;<em>Frosthaven&nbsp;</em>Early Access update, and it's coming to the tabletop adaptation later this month.</p>

<p>As revealed in a press release, the Awakening Protocol update will serve as the first big content patch for the strategy RPG. Much of what it's bringing was first teased as part of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frosthaven-early-access-roadmap" rel="nofollow">roadmap announcement</a> back in early September.</p>

<p>First up, you're getting a new storyline in the form of the Unfettered arc, which will give you a chance to confront a "machine uprising" headed by a "mysterious and formidable leader".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/frosthaven-awakening-protocol-update-machine-uprising.jpg?itok=27OZZlwK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/frosthaven-awakening-protocol-update-machine-uprising.jpg?itok=IEsVKu4u 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Frosthaven</em>'s first major Early Access update will have you challenging a machine uprising.</figcaption></figure><p>In addition to the new storyline (about which Arc and Snapshot are remaining very tight-lipped for now), you can also expect three new playable heroes to be added to&nbsp;<em>Frosthaven&nbsp;</em>in the Awakening Protocol update, and they come with "bold new strategies".</p>

<p>Five new bosses are coming as well, consisting of "mechanical and unknown horrors", so you'll need to make sure your squad is at its strongest if you want to beat them. That's in addition to over 18 new quests, a new building, and lots of other extras.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Frosthaven</em>, it's a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frosthaven-video-game-adaptation-announced" rel="nofollow">video game adaptation</a> of the popular tabletop experience, which is itself a sequel to the iconic RPG&nbsp;<em>Gloomhaven</em>. For a time,&nbsp;<em>Frosthaven&nbsp;</em>was the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/frosthaven-kickstarter-is-most-funded-board-game-on-platform" rel="nofollow">most-funded tabletop project</a> on Kickstarter, before being overtaken by <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/brandon-sandersons-cosmere-rpg-kickstarter-raised-5-million-in-one-day" rel="nofollow">Brandon Sanderson's&nbsp;<em>Cosmere&nbsp;</em>RPG project</a>.</p>

<p>The video game version of&nbsp;<em>Frosthaven&nbsp;</em>promises "challenging yet satisfying gameplay" across both its single-player and multiplayer offerings, as well as "deep mechanics" that should feel intuitive to both newcomers and experienced veterans of the tabletop game.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[PowerWash Simulator 2 Release Date Revealed for Later This Month]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/powerwash-simulator-2-release-date</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>developer FuturLab has revealed the upcoming cleaning sim's release date, and it's much closer than you might think, so it won't be long before you can load up your power washer once again.</p>

<p>As announced via a brand new trailer,&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>will be launching on October 23rd. As far as we know, the game is due to launch on day one for Game Pass as well, although given <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-tiers-reworked-2025" rel="nofollow">recent developments</a>, that might not be quite such an enticing prospect anymore.</p>

<p>Announced back in March this year,&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>is, as the name suggests, the sequel to 2022's relaxing cleaning sim&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator</em>. Like its predecessor, this followup will let you loose on a variety of filthy environments, and it's up to you to make them clean once more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/powerwash-simulator-2-release-date-grime.jpg?itok=tqaHQAwT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/powerwash-simulator-2-release-date-grime.jpg?itok=4urDB8zd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There's so much grime and dirt in here it's practically painful.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, it wouldn't be much of a sequel if there weren't improvements and new features galore, and so you can expect to explore not only Muckingham but the environs beyond its borders this time around.</p>

<p>Those locations will be part of a brand new campaign that will take you to such aptly-named locations as Sponge Valley, Power Falls, and Lubri City. I wouldn't think too hard about that last one if I were you.</p>

<p>New multi-stage jobs will test your cleaning prowess over several different stages, and naturally, you can expect a range of new tools to help you tackle those jobs, including a new abseiling rig, a cherry picker, and a surface cleaner for bigger areas.</p>

<p>You can check out the new&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>release date trailer, which shows off some of the game's satisfying-looking cleaning action (as well as its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-powerwash-simulator-2-gameplay-trailer" rel="nofollow">frankly criminally adorable cat</a>), right here.</p>




<p><em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2968420/PowerWash_Simulator_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10011314" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/powerwash-simulator-2/9p45ggdtfnsm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and Nintendo Switch 2 on October 23rd. While you wait, you can refresh your memory of the first one with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/powerwash-simulator-review" rel="nofollow">our very own Blair's review</a>.</p>
