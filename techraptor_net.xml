            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today at San Diego Comic-Con, Critical Role and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1183ce14-1675-44b1-af00-4d7855d7f06c" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/chris-prynoski-talks-drunkards-druggies-and-delinquents-how-420-joke-became" rel="nofollow">Titmouse </a>announced the release date for the first season of <em>The Mighty Nein</em>. An animated TV show based on Critical Role's second streamed campaign focusing on the seven members of <em>The Mighty Nein</em>. The announcement of a <em>Mighty Nein</em> TV show came in early 2023 after reaching success with the first few season of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a49b5305-f71e-4b04-a989-6db6823aa8cc" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/critical-role-and-legend-of-vox-machina-s3-cast-discuss-changing-story" rel="nofollow"><em>The Legend of Vox Machina</em></a>, a similarly animated show based on the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3579fb91-ffa9-4c99-a750-de9f92ba642f" href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> group's first campaign.</p>

<p>The release date for <em>The Mighty Nein</em> on Prime Video will be November 19th. It will be releasing in more than 240 countries and territories worldwide. Alongside the release date announcement, a short sequence from the show was also released showing the majority of the player characters being interrogated. Here we get to see at a glance what each of the characters is about with Beau the monk showing off her guns, Nott the Goblin intoxicated and (poorly) flirting with her interrogator, and Jester being absolutely chaotic.</p>


<p>The description of the show provided reads as:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>The Mighty Nein</em> follows a group of fugitives and outcasts, bound by secrets and scars. But when a powerful arcane relic known as "The Beacon" falls into dangerous hands, they must learn to work together to save the realm and stop reality itself from unraveling.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In addition to the short clip fans were also treated to artwork of the full party of <em>The Mighty Nein</em> including our first look at Yasha, played by Ashley Johnson (The Last of Us Part II).</p>

<p>Interestingly, Mark Strong was credited in an episode of <em>The Legend of Vox Machina</em> for a single episode as an Assembly Mage, this will likely develop into a larger role as Trent Ikithon, a recurring foe for <em>The Mighty Nein.</em></p>
