            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/konami-raising-salary-fourth-year<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Konami has announced that it will raise base employee salaries in its home country of Japan for the fourth consecutive year.</p>

<p>In a news <a href="https://www.konami.com/news/ja/release/2025/0219/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on its website (for which we're using machine translation, since the original post is in Japanese), Konami says it will raise employee base salaries for all "full-time employees at domestic group companies" in order to create a "rewarding work environment".</p>

<p>Not only that, but new graduates' starting salaries will be raised from 300,000 yen to 305,000 yen per month. The changes will take effect starting from March 2026, with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/konami-salary-increase" rel="nofollow">last year's base salary increase</a> set to go into effect next month.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/konami-salary-increase-2026-silent-hill-2.jpg?itok=7X2dlvbK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/konami-salary-increase-2026-silent-hill-2.jpg?itok=iUPKDcjC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Konami had a pretty good year last year thanks to&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Konami says that its staff are the "source" of its "competitive edge", and that by increasing salaries, the company is hoping to "improve employee engagement and continue to strive to create better products and services".</p>

<p>As with last year, Konami does add the proviso that "some domestic group companies and some job types are not included", but it doesn't go into detail regarding which jobs these are.</p>

<p>All in all, Konami had a pretty solid 2024, it seems. The&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake was released in October last year, going on to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-1m" rel="nofollow">sell a million copies</a> within its first three days on launch and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">reaching two million</a> as of late January.</p>

<p>Not only that, but in October, FIFA <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fifa-konami-esports-partner" rel="nofollow">picked Konami as its new esports partner</a> after the organization's well-publicized split with EA, although it's worth noting that this doesn't mean Konami will be developing whatever FIFA's&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC&nbsp;</em>competitor turns out to be.</p>

<p>Set to launch in August (as revealed by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-state-of-play-recap-february-2025" rel="nofollow">the State of Play presentation last week</a>), the game represents the first major entry in the&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear&nbsp;</em>series since 2018's&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Survive&nbsp;</em>(discounting 2023's&nbsp;<em>Master Collection</em>).</p>
