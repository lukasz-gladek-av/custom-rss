            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>While the <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="8e948d2c-e718-4b87-9a04-0d0bc246614c" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/pokemon-legends-z-preview-another-reason-to-get-switch-2" rel="nofollow">Pokémon </a></em>formula has been slow-moving over the years, with <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ab965b69-179c-4525-9aa0-c19799509f61" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/pokemon-legends-arceus" rel="nofollow">Pokémon Legends Arceus</a></em>, a big change was made in exploration and story format. The release of <em>Pokémon Legends ZA</em> makes some steps even further from the formula, but also many closer. Do these differences make it a better <em>Pokémon </em>game, or something harder to recognize?</p>

<p><em>Pokémon Legends ZA</em> is set in the town of Lumiose City, which was a central setpiece for the events of <em>Pokémon X and Y</em> for the Nintendo 3DS, and now is the sole location for your <em>Legends ZA</em> adventure. You play as a newcomer, visiting Lumiose City for a holiday before you get wrapped up in taking part in a city-wide night-time battle tournament called the Z-A Royale, investigating mysterious Rogue Mega Evolution events, and exploring the city.</p>

<h2>Revisit Kalos And Become A Pokémon Master</h2>

<p>The start of the story is strong, introducing you to the primary cast of characters while also teaching you about the Pokémon-inhabited Wild Zones of the city. You'll meet characters like your rival Taunie/Urbain, fellow members of Team MZ, Naveen and Lida, and AZ, the mysterious hotel keeper, as well as some major players in the city, like Emma the detective.</p>

<p>There isn't any level of collecting badges; instead, your simple goal is to join a battle royal event called the Z-A Royal and work your way from Rank Z to Rank A (as the name implies). As you progress through the game, you're also introduced to the mystery of mega energy seeping out all over Lumiose City, which has been leading certain Pokémon to go rogue, leaving people in danger. This drive to become stronger, as well as the mystery of the rogue Mega Evolution, is the core thread that will pull you through the game.</p>

Your next objective might be to reach a new rank or to take out a rampaging Rogue Mega Pokémon. You can reach these objectives quite easily, but it's in the amount of exploration that can be done and side-quests to accomplish that you'll find yourself stopping to smell the roses and take in everything that the game has to offer.</p>

<p>Something I really enjoyed about the story of <em>Legends ZA</em> compared to other, more traditional, titles in the <em>Pokemon </em>franchise is that it wasn't that you got to spend 50-60% of the game completing your main objective of badges/Z-A Royale, then get an interlude story where the evil team tries to take over the world, and then back to completing your goal of being the very best, like no one ever was. Instead, the story is constantly being woven in and out of the Z-A Royale storyline, culminating in what might be one of <em>Pokémon</em>'s most impressive finale setpieces.</p>

<p>The story did a great job highlighting not just the protagonist's ability to be the greatest Pokémon trainer, but also managed to create a group that actually felt like they were friends with each other and not just the main character, and fill the city with a unique and colorful supporting cast of characters.</p>

<h2>A New Way To Battle</h2>

<p>One of the largest changes to the Pokémon formula is in the new active battles. Instead of a static turn-based experience, the combat in <em>Pokémon Legends ZA</em> lets you roam around with your Pokémon to your side, calling out attacks for it to you as it maneuvers into place, trying to hit your opponent while not getting hit yourself.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-legends-za-review-combat.jpg?itok=Ha0RsYOs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-legends-za-review-combat.jpg?itok=2PpkrCj_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>I am a huge fan of this gameplay style, possibly because it's the closest I'll ever expect we get to an anime-style Pokémon battle, but also because at its core it's not too different from classic Pokémon battling, and there's plenty of room to grow.</p>

<p>If you want, you can send out your Pokémon, and you and your opponent can stand statically, hitting each other until one of you faints. There are a number of things you can factor into your strategy that will allow you to deal more damage faster, or even avoid damage in certain scenarios.</p>

<p>Speed and range of attacks are far more important in <em>Pokémon Legends ZA</em>, as with the right loadout, you can get 2-3 attacks in while your opponent is still queuing up their second attack. Each move will have the Pokémon move to a specific spot or within close range. This means there's a new level of strategy to how you want to respond to your opponents' attacks, too.</p>

<p>When an enemy uses Fly, you can begin to move, and with enough skill, might avoid your opponent crashing down. Similarly, for massive attacks like Hyper Beam, you could find a way to avoid it by strafing or even putting the environment between yourself and the attacks. I loved learning the different ways I could fight with my Pokémon, how to best chain attacks into each other, and what type advantages I could come up with on the fly.</p>

<p>In Ranked Play, this causes the 4-player free-for-all battles to be truly chaotic. Moving from lobby to lobby, your team of three might be perfectly set up to sweep the enemy, or you could truly be out of luck as you get countered by something super-effective to you at every turn. There's nothing more satisfying than sniping an enemy's kill with a long-range flamethrower, and alternatively, there's nothing worse than being so close to the kill and having it stolen away.</p>

<p>I don't expect this combat to replace the classic formula, or even have anywhere near as much popularity, but as someone who never got into the competitive side of Pokémon, I was excited to Hyper Train some Pokémon to compete in Ranked Play.</p>

<p>The best use of the active combat is in the Raid-like Rogue Mega Evolution battles, where you need to fight an enraged Mega Pokémon. For these battles, you're paired with one of your story companions and end up on a battlefield to take on this gargantuan Pokémon.</p>

<p>The basic formula of the battle is to deal super-effective damage to the Mega Pokémon, siphon off some Mega Energy in the shape of dropped orbs, and then Mega Evolve your own Pokémon to deal as much damage as possible until they revert. While you're doing this, you'll also need to be dodging the Pokémon's attacks.</p>

<p>This Rogue Mega Pokémon doesn't just attack your Pokémon, but also focuses on the player. You'll be running, dodge rolling, and even recalling your Pokémon to keep them out of harm's way during battles.</p>

<p>Some of these Pokémon set off incredible effects like tornadoes that follow you around the stage, violent rocky shockwaves, and a classic massive beam of energy that follows you as you run from it.</p>

<p>The biggest downside of these Rogue Mega Encounters for me was that while they're repeatable, there was no way to enjoy them with a friend. As the Pokémon franchise has promoted Max Raids and Tera Raids, I was disappointed to learn that there wasn't any way to pair up with even a single friend and take on these gargantuan foes together, especially when there's already local battle multiplayer.</p>

<h2>The City Is Alive</h2>

<p>It's clear that <em>Pokémon </em>has taken inspiration from other recent Nintendo successes like <em>Breath of the Wild,&nbsp;</em>where, after completing the tutorial, the whole map is open to you. You've got a variety of Pokémon-filled areas to explore, as well as a multitude of side quests to immediately involve yourself even further with the city.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-legends-za-review-veritcality.jpg?itok=qwS9uaAL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-legends-za-review-veritcality.jpg?itok=XJcouFqN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Even on the ground level, at nearly any point, you can rotate in a complete circle and see one or possibly two Wild Zones, a shop or cafe, wild Pokémon, or an NPC with a side-quest ready to ask of you. This also felt like a lesson learned from <em>Breath of the Wild</em>: the world doesn't have to be the largest, but if you pack it densely, then players won't be able to stop getting sidetracked as they move from main objective to main objective. 99 times out of 100, I'll prefer a smaller but more densely packed world that one that can promise landscapes that you can walk in a straight line for hours in, but there's nothing to see or do.</p>

<p>The way that <em>Pokémon </em>has further enhanced Lumiose City is through the amount of verticality it has. You can walk along all of the main and side streets, discovering little parks or water features along the way, but you can also take to the roofs filled with Pokémon and hidden items. Unlocking elevators to different roofs and traversal options are other perks of progressing through the storyline, letting what seems like a static world at first grow in size while not physically getting larger.</p>

<p>Going into <em>Pokémon Legends ZA</em>, and honestly, even for the first hour or two while the game has you on rails, I was concerned that the map would be too small, and now that I'm 50-60 hours in, I couldn't have been more incorrect, as I keep turning corners and finding new interesting places.</p>

<h2>Side-Quest Variety Impressed</h2>

<p>What fuels a lot of your exploration is the Side-Quests, with around 100 in total for the whole game. Some of these are quite basic, can you battle with me or show me a certain type of Pokémon, while others are side-quests masquerading as tutorials teaching new players about the benefits or drawbacks of poison vs paralysis, or how moves like Protect are helpful.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-legends-za-review-side-quest.jpg?itok=4tWsPg50 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-legends-za-review-side-quest.jpg?itok=yNlAgmfJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>A number of side-quests that long for a lot of games can be a red flag to certain people; the strength of the side-quests in <em>Pokémon Legends ZA </em>comes down to two simple things.</p>

<p>The first is that there was a health variety in the types of things being asked of you. A fair number were battles, which for a <em>Pokémon </em>game didn't even entirely feel like a side-quest, while others would have you collect certain Pokémon, trade Pokémon, search for hidden Pokémon in a museum (one of my favorites), and even chase down fleeing Pokémon.</p>

<p><em>Legends ZA</em> also used side-quests as a way to gift the player with Pokémon such as Froakie, Fennekin, and Chespin in interesting and unusual ways.</p>

<p>The second major strength is that none of these side-missions were very long. Depending on how much time you have to sit down and play, you might be able to complete a night of Z-A Royale, or you might just want to finish 'one more' quest. These quick quests mean there's always just one more little thing for you to do, and then when you realize you still have a bit more time then you can squeeze in another.</p>

<h2><em>Pokémon</em>&nbsp;<em>Legends ZA</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Going into <em>Pokémon Legends ZA </em>I had a lot of fears. How will it run? Is Lumoise City going to feel too small? Will it be able to compare with the epic story of <em>Pokémon Legends Arceus</em>? Will the new combat style be fun?</p>

<p>Thankfully, I was impressed with pretty much every aspect of the game. <em>Pokémon Legends AZ</em> is an incredibly polished game from start to finish with an entertaining story that's fun for newcomers and veterans alike. Lumiose City might not physically expand, but with the introduction of new areas and Wild Zones throughout the story progression, you get to experience it growing as you do.</p>

<p>Best of all, the core mechanic of <em>Pokémon Legends ZA</em>, the new active combat, is incredibly fun. It was such a fun experience taking Pokémon and attacks I knew and seeing them played out in motion instead of stuck in place. It made the combat more engaging and opened up new levels of strategy for a lot of moves that might not otherwise get much love.</p>
