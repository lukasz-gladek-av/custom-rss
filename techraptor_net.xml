            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>launched almost a year ago, and since it released, players have been complaining about poor PC performance despite having machines more than capable (theoretically, at least) of handling things. Now, we might know why.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1qcy3hn/mh_wilds_bad_performance_mystery_solved/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">lengthy post</a> on Reddit, user de_Tylmarande outlines an experimental process by which they attempted to glean the reason behind <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' PC performance, which Capcom has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-optimizations-winter" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="69cb0344-d686-4265-ba86-2163d899fb4c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">acknowledged and pledged to fix</a> (the performance, not the post).</p><p>To boil the post down, de_Tylmarande essentially noticed that when playing <em>Wilds </em>on their friend's Steam account, which owns all of the available DLC, the frame rate was stable and there were no drops. On their own account, however, de_Tylmarande experienced frequent drops.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>The cause of <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' poor PC performance may have been solved.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This naturally led the user to conclude that <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' frame drops and PC problems are down to what they call "an insanely crooked and aggressive DLC ownership check function".</p><p>In order to prove their theory, de_Tylmarande created a sort of mod that essentially fools <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>into thinking the player owns all of its associated DLC. The mod doesn't actually unlock any of that DLC; instead, it just tricks the game into passing the check.</p><p>According to de_Tylmarande, once that mod was in place, "performance went through the roof". They stress that they don't recommend trying this solution and don't promote "using mods of this type" in <em>Wilds</em>, but that they did so in order to prove a point.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1qcy3hn/comment/nzlrkxg/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">response</a>, a user suggests that this issue might be an example of "good enough for now" code being left in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, then never being fixed, leading to unpredictable problems later down the line. It's entirely possible.</p>
<p>In any case, unless you're looking to create a mod like de_Tylmarande's yourself (which they don't suggest), it's unlikely you'll be able to solve this problem for yourself. Still, it's an interesting thing to ponder.</p><p>The poor PC performance players have reported didn't stop <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-8m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a0bfff7f-18bd-4b40-b07b-fe8c94d70a1a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">selling like hot cakes</a> in its initial <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-10m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3047bd12-37c9-4b65-bd39-064968be79fa" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">launch window</a>, although sales have since slowed, with Capcom blaming that slowdown not on the PC version, but <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-ps5-barrier-capcom" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a0c5ff11-5fb9-4929-804b-8a8d4f7adae0" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">the PS5 release</a>.</p><p>You can check out <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/monster-hunter-wilds/9NMT6XFN0LVD" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and you can read our very own Tyler's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/monster-hunter-wilds-review-new-frontier" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4b7be4a2-09a5-4299-a13c-a7bff937e081" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">review of the game here</a>.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ghost Ship Games has released a new narrated trailer for <em>Deep Rock Galactic </em>Season 6, which is due to arrive later this month, and the video shows off the season's new biome, as well as its new mission type and more.</p><p>As you've probably already surmised, <em>Deep Rock Galactic </em>Season 6 follows on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/deep-rock-galactic-season-5-release-date" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="cad42d6c-2b89-4f9e-a9c1-6ad9d91792fc" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">2024's Season 5</a>, so it's been about a year and a half since the last time the co-op shooter got itself a meaty new update like this one.</p><p>First on the agenda for Season 6 is the Ossuary Depths, a new biome that, as Ghost Ship <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/548430/view/491588382403592732" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">puts it</a>, resembles a cross between a "great cathedral" and a "burial catacomb". As you can imagine, it's full of the bones of grand beasts, as well as lots of moody underground scenery.</p><figure role="group">

</figure>
<p>While exploring the Ossuary Depths, you'll come across some of <em>Deep Rock Galactic </em>Season 6's new enemies, the Ossirans, and they're not big fans of dwarves encroaching on their home, as you can probably guess.</p><p>New enemy types include the Scrab, which will fly at you in swarms, as well as the lurking Pit Jaw, which will leap up from the ground in order to snap unsuspecting dwarves up in its jaws.</p><p>You might well have to contend with these enemies when you're taking on the new Heavy Extraction mission type, which will see you and your squad locating Resinite Mass in order to flag it for extraction.</p><p>You can check out the new narrated trailer for <em>Deep Rock Galactic </em>Season 6, which shows off some of these new features (plus lots more), right here.</p>
<p><em>Deep Rock Galactic </em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/548430/Deep_Rock_Galactic/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/deep-rock-galactic/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/deep-rock-galactic/9nhfvwx1v7qj" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox</a> (although not the Switch or the Switch 2, sadly). Stay tuned for more on this.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
