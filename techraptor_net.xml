            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The way that video games are made is often obfuscated, made in secret with proprietary information and NDAs until they're ready to be revealed in a controlled manner. Last week, I got the chance to speak with Samantha Béart about this along with discussing indie games, acting, and the importance of highlighting so many more integral roles that go into creating the video games we love.</p>

<p>Samantha Béart is an actor many will know for their performance as Karlach in <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2158b818-8ae7-45f2-997e-44a5977e48f4" href="https://techraptor.net/games/baldurs-gate-3" rel="nofollow"><em>Baldur's Gate III</em></a>, Cider in the recently released <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3797ae08-3d59-4c5b-82db-9754b9364db0" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/absolum-features-gorgeous-story-and-flashy-combat-to-keep-you-coming-back-over-and" rel="nofollow">Absolum</a></em>, and One in <a href="https://www.newtales.com/games/fading-echo/en-us" rel="nofollow"><em>Fading Echo</em></a>, an upcoming title by New Tales. Béart was also nominated for a BAFTA for their role as Karlach, and in 2023-2024 was a BAFTA Breakthrough for their work in "The Excavation of Hob's Barrow." Béart also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpHdHjoe1dk&amp;list=PLdETg9xOislGXARi19-Tfm8SOUH46RHrl" rel="nofollow">hosts a podcast called "<em>It Takes A Village</em>"</a> which looks to celebrate people who make games.</p>

<h2>First Consoles and Memorable Performances</h2>

<p>Knowing that Béart has been playing games their entire life, I wanted to start at the beginning and know what some of their first gaming experiences were. "I guess I saw a friend's older brother playing a Game Boy once and thought, I want to do that. [...] My parents weren't at all encouraging for me to play video games."</p>
<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed//QWMhix4cFsY"></iframe></p>

<p>"My first console was a CPC 464 Green Screen by Amstrad, because that was being thrown out by my best friend's brother, who was getting a Mega Drive. I relied on hand-me-downs, and I was saying to Arcade Hang the other day, like, this is forbidden. I just had to sneak in and try and play a little bit before I was dragged away."</p>

<p>Expanding further on that history, Béart reminisced that "It just was a really exciting, fun thing to do as a kid. I seemed to enjoy all genres, apart from CRPGs, they were a bit difficult when I was a kid, but, like, your beat-em-ups, and I liked a little bit of slots, car racing games, you know, that sort of thing."</p>

<p>To talk about the bridge between playing games, recognizing performances in games, and wanting to act in games, Béart brought up the iconic Ezio Auditore from <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4ace26a1-2106-434b-a8eb-d3b80f6fcc22" href="https://techraptor.net/games/assassins-creed-shadows" rel="nofollow"><em>Assassin's Creed II</em></a>. "When I was training, <em>Assassin's Creed Brotherhood</em> came out. I was training to be a Shakespearean actor, sort of the usual three-year conservatory training that British actors get, and in my downtime, I was playing video games and Ezio was just a revelation. Like discovering a new Shakespearean character."</p>

<h2>Taking a Leap of Faith</h2>

<p>Béart specifically highlighted how well realized they felt Ezio was, and "in terms of performance, it was the first time I think I really noticed performance beyond, you know, 'FINISH HIM,'" Béart laughed, reciting <em>Mortal Kombat's</em> iconic line.</p>

So then it was just basically cold calling different companies."</p>

<p>One of Béart's first roles was in Triumph Studios' <em>Age of Wonders 3</em>, where they played an Elven campaign leader. "It was a series of monologues, so easy from my perspective. [...] You'd have made a decision whether you're going to be good or bad, and then you hear that corresponding monologue. So that was a really nice, gentle way in."</p>

<p>Knowing how tightly knit the community of game developers and actors was, it was then by networking, "going to meetups and actually meeting developers, that's when it was starting to happen. I started appearing on panels and talking about being an actor in games."</p>

<p>Talking specifically about the smaller U.K. scene, Béart explained, "Because there are very few casting directors in acting, it's done through… I know a guy who knows a guy, and I've done the same for people that I wouldn't normally get to work with. We all help each other out here, you know, at this level."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"We don't really know the money people that hire and fire and destroy whole successful companies. But the actual people who make the games, they're absolute solid gold!"</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Acting in a Video-Game Performance</h2>

<p>To discuss the misconceptions behind the performance of a character, I wanted to know from Béart what more is going on behind the microphone that fans of games like <em>Baldur's Gate III</em>&nbsp;might not be aware of.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/baldurs-gate-iii-karlach_0.jpg?itok=7JC7V330 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/baldurs-gate-iii-karlach_0.jpg?itok=f0Ra7cI1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Béart immediately highlighted just how much mocap work had been done. "I still meet <em>Baldur's Gate</em> folks that don't know we did that. I spent hundreds of hours in a very unflattering suit doing that, so I'm not letting it go."</p>

<p>Delving even further into what goes on to make a performance like Karlach's shine, Béart added, "There are a lot of people that were involved in that. In the mocap, the engineers, directors, and cinematic department that had to animate that. All of those people we're kind of wiping them out by calling it voice."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The idea that it's just [voice acting] is not helpful to people coming in, and I think it's not fair to those of us who are doing all this other kind of work."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Béart did reaffirm, "I should say that I have every respect for voice actors. That ain't me, baby. You get me in the room and go 'do twenty different accents,' I'm gonna fall on my face. I'm going to sight-read, but it's going to be closer to a British regional accent."</p>

<h2>Playing One, the Aethermancer in <em>Fading Echo</em></h2>

<p>For Béart's next role, they were approached by the developers at New Tales. "I thought I was in a dream because <em>[Fading Echo]</em> was a straight-up offer, and they gave me everything. There's no NDA with the project, they told me everything, [...] and they had me at, 'Would you like to be the lead actor in this indie game?'"</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fading-echo-one.jpg?itok=66Jk4gxj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fading-echo-one.jpg?itok=jw3OiVcM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Béart explained that the team at New Tales is made up of former Blizzard developers, "So I knew they knew how to make a game, and they also said that folks from Critical Role would be involved." Actors such as Matt Mercer (Critical Role), Laura Bailey (Critical Role), and Jasmine Bhullar (Coffin Run) are also lending their voices to <em>Fading Echo</em>.</p>

<p>An added TTRPG connection was also made in that the world of <em>Fading Echo</em> was apparently "based on a TTRPG they wrote some time ago, and I guess if this is a success, we will get to see that as well."</p>

<p>I was interested to learn more about what it was for One, or for any of their roles, that made them know 'this is the character I want to play.' Béart told me, "If I believe they exist, if the writing is good."</p>

<p>Getting to be involved in these indie projects, Béart was highly complementary of everyone's skill and dedication. "I think every game is a miracle. I genuinely believe that. I don't know how they do it, I don't know how they ship those games and get them out."</p>

<h2><em>It Takes A Village</em>&nbsp;Highlights All Those Involved in the Game-Making Pipeline</h2>

<p>Something that continued to come up through my conversation with Béart was how much they recognize that they're a small part of a very talented larger process, whether it be singing the praises of all those involved in a mocap pipeline, to working with directors who surprise them by bringing out their best, even when not in their comfort zone.</p>

<p>Highlighting the work of others in the space was something Béart thought would help clear up a lot of problems in game dev. "I'm absolutely convinced that a lot of the problems we have in game dev is a lack of communication, and there's a lack of understanding about what people actually do in their roles.</p>

<p>"During the pandemic, I decided I wanted to have a very public conversation with casting directors, writers, anyone who worked with us. We did that and we found we discovered things, and I think a lot of actors [...] won't know what goes on behind the scenes because we're in a very NDA'd industry."</p>

"The composer might be casting, or the lead sound engineer might be doing some QA. We have to be very understanding about those roles.</p>

<p>"I wanted to say thank you, and I wanted to do a bit of career fair." Béart explained that that was what was called Game Voices Connect, and then that evolved into <em>It Takes A Village</em> after a three-year interim. "It is this wonderful sort of showcase in a way of saying thank you, as well as showing the world behind the scenes. People love behind the scenes, so it's nice to be able to provide some of that."</p>

<p>A new season of <em>It Takes A Village</em> will be released before the end of the year on Samantha Béart's YouTube channel and will include guests like Abubakar Salim, Sophie Knowles, David Menkin, and more.</p>

<h2>What Do People Get Wrong About Acting in Video Games?</h2>

<p>To close out our conversation and to continue the discussion of revealing what's going on behind the scenes, I was interested to hear what the biggest misconception about acting in video games was, based on the different takes they see on social media.</p>

<p>"It comes down to that lack of exposure about what we do. So I've started to liken it to being a session musician. They've done all the work on the outside, years of training, and then they come in the story, they sight-read, they knock it out in two takes. That's what we do."</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fading-echo-gameplay.jpg?itok=yShTBjFS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fading-echo-gameplay.jpg?itok=_K_efQC2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Béart spoke back on the idea that many actors will work to shape a character. "People think it's a collaboration, we sit there and we write with the writers, and we do chemistry tests, we get to know each other… No, you go in, you read the thing, and you're done. Which is why a lot of the people you interview can't remember what they've done, because they've said the line once or twice and then six months to a year for it to come out, you have forgotten.</p>

<p>"I think a lot of actors like to say they spent years on something, and it sounds like they were salaried for years. Like, <em>Fading Echo</em>, I could say I was on it for seven months, because they contacted me seven months ago, when in fact I've done two sessions, and I'm about to do a couple more so we can finish the game."</p>

<p>If you're interested in checking out Samantha Béart in more games, be sure to check out <em>Absolum</em>, available right now and&nbsp;<em>Fading Echo</em> when it releases "soon." And if you're interested in learning more about what goes on behind the scenes, then be sure to check out the currently available season of <em>It Takes A Village</em> along with their upcoming season when it releases later this year.</p>
