            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sometimes finding the correct box set for your Strike Team in Star Wars: Shatterpoint can be hard. But don't worry because we have you covered on that front, with a series of expansions that you should be keeping your eyes on to help you dominate the galaxy (or table). I just r<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/star-wars-shatterpoint-fall-2025-expansions-elegant-weapon-for-more-civilized-0" rel="nofollow">eviewed some newer releases from the line</a>, and now Asmodee USA sent me review copies of all the expansions mentioned below, so let's take a quick look!</p>

<h2>Plans And Preparations</h2>

<p>Admittedly, one of the main reasons that lured me towards this box was that it had Clone Commandos attached. This more or less worked in my favor because one of the main factions I'm trying to stick with is the Galactic Republic.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_172113252.portrait.jpg?itok=GproN-PH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_172113252.portrait.jpg?itok=Z501NKsD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Lots of plans.</figcaption></figure><p>Many of the keywords for the characters in this unit buff other Galactic Republic/Jedi characters. If you already have the Hello There or This Party's Over box, you can easily pair them together for real damage. If you want to get creative with it, Jedi Master Luminara Unduli works well with virtually anyone in the Galactic Republic without trying too hard.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_172128732.portrait-1.jpg?itok=Ndmh7iA0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_172128732.portrait-1.jpg?itok=hcRH5bkD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Lots of preparation.</figcaption></figure><p>Perhaps the thing I appreciated about this set was how dynamic the Clone minis were. They're posed extremely well, and one even comes with some slight cover to help make it feel more alive. Little details like that really help bring the whole set together.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_172213398.portrait.jpg?itok=ipzF1Nkn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_172213398.portrait.jpg?itok=fVgUdLpd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Best boys.</figcaption></figure><h2>Witches of Dathomir</h2>

<p>The Witches of Dathomir is a really interesting one, because they don't have a lot of synergy with many other troops, and the only one with the Separatist Alliance keyword is Savage Orpress.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_171820615.portrait.jpg?itok=zzAmPxMW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_171820615.portrait.jpg?itok=gX7TzRrd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Just in time for spooky season.</figcaption></figure><p>That being said, it's not all doom and gloom because everyone in this set does share the Force User keyword, so you can pair them up with others who buff characters with the same trait. With all of that said, though, I still couldn't think of a more fun unit to play. Mother Talzin has a lot of incredible abilities that buff other characters with the Dathomiran keyword, one of which allows them to heal right after a character has been injured. While Savage Opress is about getting up close and personal, the Nightsister Acolytes can support from afar.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_171907132.portrait.jpg?itok=dRXPipsV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_171907132.portrait.jpg?itok=yXPbSZu1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Get this guy up close for some serious damage.</figcaption></figure><p>This set, in particular, caters to many different play styles while encouraging you to try something new. Even if you're not entirely sold on them, each character in this unit can pack a serious punch in combat, and they are all some of the best models in the game. And I had the most fun when it came to painting these.</p>



<p>If I'm being perfectly honest, I had no business getting this set at all. The reason why I got this was 100% based on the rule of cool. Because if having a squad full of Ewoks fighting Vader and friends doesn't sound like a good time, I don't know what does.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_172626799.portrait.jpg?itok=9jWTjk75 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_172626799.portrait.jpg?itok=AGudJd4z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some Yubs.</figcaption></figure><p>What's unique about this set is that it comes with five models, but the trade-off is that each doesn't have a lot of health, so you have to be smart about how you use them. Thankfully, each character in this team is stacked to the brim with all sorts of abilities, and it does a great job at capturing the guerilla warfare vibes we see them do in the film.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_172635938.portrait.original.jpg?itok=rqBk4szT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_172635938.portrait.original.jpg?itok=fodno0Ir 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some Nubs.</figcaption></figure><p>To make things even better, they have a Battle Tactic card centered on trapping your opponent in one way or another. The only downside to this squad is that most of the synergy is based around other Ewoks, so if you pair them up with anything else, you won't get a lot of mileage out of them.</p>

<h2>High Ground Terrain Pack</h2>

<p>Terrain is one of those things that you can never have too much of, and the High Ground is a perfect addition for any game. As the name suggests, it offers a lot of elevated areas for your strike team to use.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_172732955.portrait.jpg?itok=MRfUKqdV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_172732955.portrait.jpg?itok=_EvrtvZJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>They said the thing!</figcaption></figure><p>The one thing I especially enjoy about this set is the four bridges it comes with, because it adds an extra layer to a fight when the objective marker is right below you. The great thing with Shatterpoint Terrain is that each pack can be perfectly paired with the other. They all fit together more or less like a puzzle piece, so you never really have to worry about one set being out of place.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_172748487.portrait.jpg?itok=r0fpMagl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_172748487.portrait.jpg?itok=XxQDRpV0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This is great for having a lot of elevated fights.</figcaption></figure><p>Hopefully, this tiny list made things a bit easier for you when deciding what to purchase in Star Wars: Shatterpoint. Many of these units can be used in various ways and offer unique play styles that encourage you to try new things. As I previously said, you can never go wrong with terrain because each offers something unique that adds flavor to the fight.</p>
