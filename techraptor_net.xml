            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/payday-pubg-crossover-starbreeze-krafton<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Starbreeze and Krafton have announced a&nbsp;<em>PUBG Payday&nbsp;</em>crossover, with the latter set to infiltrate the world of the former through what sounds like a new gameplay experience within&nbsp;<em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em>.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://corporate.starbreeze.com/en/press/press-releases/starbreeze-partners-with-krafton-to-expand-payday-into-pubg-battlegrounds/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official announcement on Starbreeze's website</a>, the studio says the crossover is about increasing "the visibility and reach of the&nbsp;<em>Payday&nbsp;</em>franchise", which Starbreeze aims to do by "bringing the heisting experience to a broader audience through&nbsp;<em>PUBG</em>".</p>

<p>It's a goal that Starbreeze rather desperately needs to chase right now, since&nbsp;<em>Payday 3</em>'s in a bit of a tight spot. Recently, <em>Payday 3</em> saw <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/payday-3-game-director-steps-down" rel="nofollow">its director step down</a> in the run-up to its first anniversary, and the game's poor performance also led to Starbreeze's CEO <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-studios-ceo-steps-down" rel="nofollow">quitting back in March</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pubg-payday-crossover-zipline.jpg?itok=n-GvAGi8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pubg-payday-crossover-zipline.jpg?itok=qXEtFWam 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Payday 3&nbsp;</em>is making its way to the explosive, high-octane world of&nbsp;<em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>According to the aforementioned announcement, the collaboration will involve "about a quarter of Starbreeze's development organization during a year" under what Starbreeze calls a "work-for-hire agreement".</p>

<p>It sounds, then, like Starbreeze will be creating the&nbsp;<em>Payday&nbsp;</em>content that will make its way into&nbsp;<em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em>. The two studios say they're "currently collaborating on the project's integration roadmap", and we'll get more updates later down the line.</p>

<p>It's been a rocky road for&nbsp;<em>Payday 3</em>, with Starbreeze admitting back in February that the game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-payday-3-performance" rel="nofollow">performing at "significantly lower levels"</a> than it wanted.</p>

<p>Perhaps more embarrassingly for Starbreeze,&nbsp;<em>Payday 2&nbsp;</em>is currently leagues ahead of&nbsp;<em>Payday 3&nbsp;</em>in the Steam player count stakes; at last count,&nbsp;<em>Payday 3</em>'s 24-hour player peak <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1272080/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">was 860</a>, while&nbsp;<em>Payday 2</em>'s stood at a <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/218620/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">far more respectable 38,324</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pubg-payday-crossover-payday-3.jpg?itok=fTOWGsuF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pubg-payday-crossover-payday-3.jpg?itok=3S0I-Y21 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Starbreeze isn't having the best time of it when it comes to&nbsp;<em>Payday 3</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Krafton, meanwhile, is in a very strong position when it comes to&nbsp;<em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em>. The game's 24-hour Steam player peak is <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/578080/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a princely 756,872</a>, which probably goes some way towards explaining why Starbreeze wants to integrate&nbsp;<em>Payday&nbsp;</em>into the battle royale hit.</p>

<p>With regards to the two studios' future plans, Krafton is currently working on a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-mobile-version-krafton" rel="nofollow">mobile version of survival hit&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em></a>, and it's also overseeing <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hi-fi-rush-2-krafton-ceo" rel="nofollow">a sequel</a> to&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>, the IP for which (along with developer Tango Gameworks) it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-acquires-tango-gameworks-and-hi-fi-rush-ip-with-plans-for-future-expansion" rel="nofollow">bought earlier this year</a>.</p>

<p>Starbreeze, meanwhile, is engaged in a multi-stage plan to try and improve&nbsp;<em>Payday 3</em>'s fortunes, and the studio is also working on a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-dnd-game-2026" rel="nofollow">multiplayer game using the&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;</em>IP</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-sales-2m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has revealed that&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake&nbsp;</em>sales have hit a big milestone less than a month after the JRPG remake's launch.</p>

<p>Per a press release, sales of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake&nbsp;</em>have reached the two million mark across all platforms. That number includes both physical shipments and digital sales.</p>

<p>It's not clear whether that number meets, exceeds, or falls short of Square Enix's sales expectations. However, the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-16-rebirth-profits-square-enix" rel="nofollow">recently stated</a> that both&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth&nbsp;</em>fell short of its projections, so it'll no doubt be looking for some successes to reassure shareholders.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-sales-world-map.jpg?itok=MIaAUDky 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-sales-world-map.jpg?itok=NnSjXec3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake</em>'s sales have hit a big milestone.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake&nbsp;</em>is, well, the clue's in the name. It's a remake of the classic 1988 RPG&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest 3</em>&nbsp;with a new coat of paint courtesy of Square Enix's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/trademark-for-octopath-travelers-hd-2d-filed-by-square-enix" rel="nofollow">trademark</a> HD-2D style.</p>

<p>The new remake (for it isn't the first remake of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest 3</em>) makes a number of changes, including the addition of difficulty options, voice acting at certain points in the game, and changes to the story.</p>

<p>Specifically, the narrative has been altered in order to make&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake&nbsp;</em>fit in better with the HD-2D remakes of the first two games, which are set to launch sometime next year.</p>




<p>As you'd probably expect,&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake&nbsp;</em>also contains a number of quality-of-life improvements, including increased movement speed, a minimap to help you explore the overworld, and more.</p>

<p>The battle system has also received a makeover; while it retains the basic essence of the original game's combat, you now view the action from a zoomed-out perspective, allowing you to see your characters as they fight.</p>

<p><em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2701660/DRAGON_QUEST_III_HD2D_Remake/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/dragon-quest-iii/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake/9P5ZQNN9WRL2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-version-14-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has revealed the&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 1.4 release date, and the update will bring major overhauls to some of the game's systems, as well as new characters and more, later this month.</p>

<p>Version 1.4, also known as "A Storm of Falling Stars", will officially arrive across all platforms on December 18th. Its biggest new feature is an overhaul to the way Main Story stages work; the story's TV mode will be "replaced with story stages", allowing you to jump straight into battles.</p>

<p>You can expect redesigned versions of Main Story stages from the Prologue through Chapter 3, and future story chapters will also work on this new system. You can also now play as all contracted Agents in the city, as well as walking through New Eridu with your Agents in the new Quality Time Mode.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zenless-zone-zero-version-1.4-release-date-characters.jpg?itok=dJeuXloO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zenless-zone-zero-version-1.4-release-date-characters.jpg?itok=ox1RwKhT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 1.4 will bring some pretty big changes to the game's systems.</figcaption></figure><p>As has been the case in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-version-13-release-date" rel="nofollow">previous</a>&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-version-12-release-date" rel="nofollow">updates</a>, new characters will also be joining the roster in&nbsp;Version 1.4.</p>

<p>Your first new character is the Frost Anomaly Agent Hoshimi Miyabi, who can deal huge damage with "swift movements and precise slashes". She's joined by Electric Agent Asaba Harumasa, who wields both a bow and a blade.</p>

<p>New combat modes will also be introduced in this update, including a major Hollow Zero update and the new Deadly Assault periodic operation. If you feel like testing your strategy skills, you can also check out the new Bangboo tower defense game in the Reverb Arena.</p>




<p>Version 1.4 of&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>will also bring <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-pro-announced-november" rel="nofollow">PS5 Pro enhancements</a> for the game, including "enhanced performance and ray-tracing technology" to make HoYoverse's latest action RPG look and feel even snazzier.</p>

<p><em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 1.4 launches on December 18th. The game is available to play right now for free on PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices.</p>
