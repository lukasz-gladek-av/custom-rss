            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There are many things that can currently run <em>Doom</em>; in fact, it might be quicker to list all of the devices that can't run the seminal 1993 FPS. Now, YouTuber Aaron Christophel has added one more item to the list of <em>Doom</em>-compatible appliances: a pressure cooker.</p><p>As spotted by the good folks at <a href="https://retrododo.com/modder-gets-doom-running-on-a-pressure-cooker/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Retrododo</a>, Christophel posted a video explaining how to "hack" the Krups Cook4Me pressure cooker in order to enable it to run a ROM of the original <em>Doom</em>. Do note that we're talking about the 1993 game here, not <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/doom-2016" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6653da9e-4b23-41d4-a815-ae67196955eb" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">the 2016 reboot</a>.</p><p>It turns out that running <em>Doom </em>on the Cook4Me is actually relatively easy. Opening up the device reveals that it has a Wi-Fi module inside, as well as around 128MB of RAM and Flash memory. That's more than enough to get things cooking.</p><figure role="group">

<p>I won't go into the technical details (you can watch Christophel's video for that!), but he uploads the ROM to the smart cooker's board, puts the machine back together, and within moments, he's slaying demons on the Cook4Me's tiny screen.</p><p>This is probably one of those situations wherein it's more impressive to watch <em>Doom </em>running on a pressure cooker than it actually is to play the thing. I'd imagine it's pretty cumbersome to try and navigate the game's labyrinthine levels using controls that just were not designed for that purpose.</p><p>Still, it's pretty cool to see id Software's contribution to gaming history still being honored (if that's the right word) by spreading its gospel to all devices and sundry.</p><p>You can check out Aaron Christophel's video to see how he managed to get <em>Doom </em>running on a pressure cooker right here. It's well worth a watch.</p>
<p>The Krups Cook4Me is far from the only place <em>Doom </em>is able to run (outside of the places it's meant to run, of course). The game has also been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/doom-notepad-is-now-thing" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="615fd2d5-c7a1-4259-a8c0-3f30da3df802" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">modded into Windows Notepad</a> and ported to devices like fitness bands, oscilloscopes, and printers.</p><p>Of course, the <em>Doom </em>franchise is still alive and well, with last year's <em>Doom: The Dark Ages </em>ripping and tearing across PC and consoles (and getting itself a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/doom-dark-ages-chelsea-flower-show" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ad90df29-2a6c-48a6-9ef5-b0c7c81e1bd9" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Chelsea Flower Show installation</a> into the bargain).

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Questline and publisher Awaken Realms have announced that their open-world RPG <em>Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon </em>has reached a big new sales milestone after launching in May last year.</p><p>As revealed in a <a href="https://x.com/TaintedGrail_AR/status/2013682512816402788" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">social media post</a>, (and an accompanying trailer), <em>Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon </em>sales have hit the million mark, which isn't too bad for what is essentially an indie RPG following in the footsteps of the likes of <em>Skyrim</em>.</p><p>Of course, this figure applies across all platforms on which the game is currently available, so it takes into account console sales as well as PC numbers, but even still, that's quite the achievement for Questline and Awaken Realms. I don't doubt they'll be over the moon with this milestone.</p><figure role="group">

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new update has been released for remastered platformer <em>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</em>, and it's bringing enhancements for the Switch 2, the ability to play as Dixie Kong, and more.</p><p>As revealed in a <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/2013781050707558700" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">social media post</a> by Nintendo, the update allows you to play as Dixie Kong instead of Diddy Kong in either single-player mode or co-op play, so if you prefer swinging through the air with your helicopter hair, this is the update for you.</p><p>Not only that, but there's a brand new mode available by the name of Turbo Attack, and, as the name suggests, it'll allow you to run through speedier versions of <em>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</em>'s existing levels for an extra layer of challenge.</p><figure role="group">

<p>If you happen to be playing the game on Switch 2, then this update will also introduce "enhanced resolution, higher-definition graphics, and quicker load times", and what's more, you're getting all of that for free, which is more than you can say for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch-2-edition-free-update" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d3f0290f-c6b5-44ad-83e5-8a42cbb6e299" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">some</a> Switch 2 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-switch-2-500k-sales" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="91a21696-562a-4257-aaec-a7380b13a7fc" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">upgrades</a>.</p><p>In case you're unfamiliar with <em>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</em>, it is, as the name implies, an "HD" remaster of Wii platformer <em>Donkey Kong Country Returns</em>, although it'd perhaps be more accurate to call it a remaster of the 3DS version.</p><p>The game packs in all of the levels from the original release, plus the extra content the 3DS version offered, including the extra difficulty modifiers and items offered by New Mode to make things just a little less tricky.</p><p>You can check out a trailer that shows off the new content in this <em>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD </em>update right here.</p>
