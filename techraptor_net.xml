            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Digital Sun has returned to deliver <em>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault</em>, the anticipated sequel to their 2018 action RPG roguelike, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/moonlighter" rel="nofollow"><em>Moonlighter</em></a>, which launches into Early Access for PC via Steam, PC Game Pass, and the Microsoft Store. The developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/moonlighter-2-early-access-release-date" rel="nofollow">intended to release <em>Moonlighter 2</em> on 23rd October 2025</a>; however, due to a plethora of great gaming releases that month, the developer moved its release to November.</p>

<p>According to the developer, the game is expected to release its full version for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/moonlighter-2-announced-2025" rel="nofollow">all platforms, including consoles</a>, at a date to be announced at a later time. But for the time being, we get to enjoy our time as a relic shopkeeper named Will, who has to make his way in a distant village and earn coin to his name while uncovering secrets about an ancient artifact that appeared in Tresna.</p>

<h2>All Hands Back On Deck At The Moonlighter</h2>

<p>Players who have yet to be introduced to the <em>Moonlighter</em> series, the first game took place in Rynoka, where they followed a young orphaned boy, Will, who set off on an adventure by exploring various dungeons located near his home. Exploring these dungeons allowed Will to acquire relics of different rarities, which he brought back to his family shop called the Moonlighter; however, one such discovery was a corpse with a peculiar note suggesting that there are four keys to be acquired from four guardians.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/moonlighter-2-endless-vault-screenshot-962.jpg?itok=ze3hfCnm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/moonlighter-2-endless-vault-screenshot-962.jpg?itok=s8S90mO2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Don't worry if you haven't played Moonlighter as the opening scene for Moonlighter 2 recounts the events from the first game!&nbsp;(Picture: Digital Sun / Ashleigh Klein)</em></figcaption></figure><p>After collecting those keys, unlocking the final dungeon, discovering interdimensional shenanigans, and encountering a government organization, Will returns home with the news of no longer being able to explore these dungeons again. This is where the sequel, <em>The Endless Vault,</em> picks up the story as Will finds himself in a new location, the vibrant village of Tresna, with new and familiar allies to be acquainted with and dungeons to explore.</p>

<p>As for the story, well, Will and a few other villagers have found themselves stranded in Tresna due to ongoing events in Rynoka, which are preventing them from returning home, and Will can learn more about them by accepting quests and progressing with the game itself! But as we're starting over with no coin to our name, it's back to business as we must discover and clear dungeons to seek our priceless relics to sell in our little shop (yes, The Moonlighter shop is back)!</p>

<p>Aside from exploring and clearing dungeons, finding precious treasures, and selling them in their shop, Will will be given opportunities to upgrade his weapons, armor, and perks, and acquire stunning pieces of furniture and decor items for the shop. Then there's the mysterious appearance of an ancient artifact, known only as The Endless Vault, providing a unique set of challenges and rewards for Will to take on.</p>

<p>Progress through the game in its opening hours to learn that it provides Will with a series of challenges, and after meeting its requirements, it will offer a reward and continue with these challenges for higher rewards. This reward will be valuable, especially as it can help boost the town's prosperity through upgrades that not only increase the town's morale but also enhance the wealth to be shared among the villagers.</p>

<h2>Battling Upon The Heat Of The Dungeons</h2>

<p>Once again, we'll remind players that the game is launching in Early Access, so technical issues, bugs, and glitches are to be expected during this period, as the developer will continue working on the game right up until its eventual full release. Nevertheless, in terms of gameplay, there aren't many differences between <em>Moonlighter</em> and <em>Moonlighter 2</em>; however, both games stand out in offering unique and refreshing takes on the action RPG roguelike genre.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/moonlighter-2-endless-vault-screenshot-946.jpg?itok=1lC-ohLW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/moonlighter-2-endless-vault-screenshot-946.jpg?itok=6VrPop9Z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Players (and Will) are sure to encounter some unique enemies and mini bosses during the dungeon run so be on the alert!&nbsp;(Picture: Digital Sun / Ashleigh Klein)</em></figcaption></figure><p>At the heart of <em>Moonlighter 2</em> is the quest to seek out precious treasures and relics that are at the center of the gameplay loop, as players will be actively spending most of their time defeating rooms of enemies to obtain them. During our hands-on experience, we immediately knew that no two dungeon clears will ever be the same, as each time players step inside a dungeon, the layout will procedurally change.</p>

<p>Each layout will feature a combination of Uncommon and Rare chests, weapon perks, unique dungeon events, blacksmith upgrades, and plenty of Elite enemies, mini bosses, and the dungeon boss to encounter. This allowed us to spend as much time in the first dungeon to get accustomed to the controls and combat mechanics to master clearing rooms without taking as much damage as possible, learn every enemy attack, and, of course, acquire as many relics and other treasures returning to the shop and sell them to customers (more on that later).</p>

<p>When embarking on a new dungeon run, every room will be randomized, and once cleared, they can follow its predetermined route by selecting which room to explore and learn what lies ahead, indicated by a map legend provided. Every room will have unique traps that can assist players, like fly traps, to knock enemies into them by using their backpack or attacking plants&nbsp;that will fire projectiles at enemies for extra offense.</p>

<p>These new enemies are no pushovers either (as implied by our death count), as players will encounter a myriad of adorable and imposing enemies that will attempt to prevent players from reaching the treasure at the room's exit. Luckily, there are perks to acquire for their weapons and their combat skills by exploring the Perk Rooms, which grant them unique buffs and status effects to inflict, which, personally, we do love the Wound (bleed) effect on our sword and gun, which helped us clear enemies more efficiently in our runs.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/moonlighter-2-endless-vault-screenshot-963.jpg?itok=GWxOko6A 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/moonlighter-2-endless-vault-screenshot-963.jpg?itok=FSu-JLvD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>We sure do love a good Bleed build if you wish to inflict additional damage to enemies with the Wound status effect.&nbsp;(Picture: Digital Sun / Ashleigh Klein)</em></figcaption></figure><p>But do watch out, as the survivability will also be tested, as once the health has been depleted, players can opt to restart their dungeon run or return "home" to sell their acquired loot at the Moonlighter shop. Unlike the first game, players won't have to worry about losing their found relics and treasures should they fall in combat, as all items will lose some rarity stars, but also, armored relics will lose their shield too, a slight change from Moonlighter that players should be pleased about.</p>

<h2>Shop Til You Drop!</h2>

<p>Now, the game's perfect blend of shopkeeping and roguelike mechanics is what drew many players to the first game and will likely do the same for the sequel. The developers aimed at improving the formula by retaining most of what worked in <em>Moonlighter</em> and adjusted it for the sequel with the addition of new features to make the shopkeeping gameplay aspect more rewarding, like customization options, strategic decision-making through systems like resource management, and the aforementioned varied yet dynamic dungeon runs.</p>

<p>Yes, players can finally customize The Moonlighter shop after obtaining the K33PER bot, which offers various services to Will when interacting with the bot inside the shop. Players can rearrange the layout of display floor cases, place unique decor pieces that can improve the items' rarity or boost their pricing, change the wall and flooring, and more, as these options can be acquired by either finding recipes within the dungeons or spending Blob Vouchers by talking to Ms. Scratch.</p>

<p>Lastly, players will be able to gain temporary perks available at the cash register when making sales at The Moonlighter, and these can vary between gaining tips on top of sales, adding more rarity stars to their precious relics, or boosting Gold when making sales. Like with <em>Moonlighter</em>, players will get a feel for their customers when it comes to pricing their discovered treasures by adjusting the prices to see what appeases them before allowing them to leave as a satisfied customer with their desired item and a bargain, of course.</p>

<h2>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/moonlighter-2-endless-vault-screenshot-953.jpg?itok=sdd6A-Km 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/moonlighter-2-endless-vault-screenshot-953.jpg?itok=ZdVfL_6Q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Even during a dungeon run, there's always time for a quick splash in a healing pool.&nbsp;(Picture: Digital Sun / Ashleigh Klein)</em></figcaption></figure><p><em>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault</em> has a strong start to its Early Access launch based on what developer Digital Sun has produced for players. Over the course of this preview, we've found a rhythm of delving into dungeons to clear out enemies, discover recipes, and valuable crafting materials, but also pushing our limits on survivability on every run.</p>

<p>As mentioned before, no dungeon run is the same, as the procedural generation makes our time spent in the dungeon all that exciting but equally terrifying with the enemies we may or may not encounter. The perks available in these dungeons do help in defeating all more efficiently, but now and then, we experienced some technical errors, from input latency bugs to general performance issues, but it wasn't prolonged enough to drop us out of the game entirely.</p>

<p>Outside of exploring dungeons, we poured plenty of time into rearranging our shop layout, placing unique decor pieces to increase our sales and item rarity, which was a great change of pace, gameplay-wise, and the developers did a marvelous job of being able to strike a balance between dungeon crawling and shopkeeping.</p>

<p>With <em>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault</em> is still in development while in Early Access, we'll be pushing our limits as a merchant and combative hero as we have found a new roguelike experience since <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/blue-prince-review-i-finished-game-50-hours-ago-and-theres-still-puzzles-to-solve" rel="nofollow">Blue Prince</a> to put multiple hours into by meticulously working out our pricing guide and resource management, mastering enemy and boss attack patterns, and reaping the rewards of our successes.</p>

<hr><p><strong><em>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault </em></strong><em>was previewed on PC over the course of 12 hours with a code provided by the developer - all screenshots were taken during the course of the preview.</em></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-update-17</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stalker-2-update-1-7-brings-brand-new-difficulty-mode-a-life-improvements-and-more.1355788/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GSC Game World has released&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>Update 1.7, also known as "Expedition", and it's bringing a brand new difficulty mode with it, as well as further fixes and improvements for the A-Life system and much more.</p>

<p>The new Master difficulty mode is, as you'd probably expect, not for the faint of heart; GSC Game World describes it as a mode for "the most skilled players", and it brings "harsher conditions and limited saves", according to the developer.</p>

<p>Additionally, there's a brand new Expedition mode modifier that will introduce those conditions to any difficulty level, so if you feel like challenging yourself but don't want to commit to a Master run, the Expedition mode should allow you to do so.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stalker-2-update-1.7-expedition.jpg?itok=rM7oOjg2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stalker-2-update-1.7-expedition.jpg?itok=h5Owmbbt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Stalker 2</em>'s latest update is red meat for the difficulty hounds.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not up for trying out Master or Expedition, don't worry; there are a host of other improvements and changes that have been introduced in this update, including further fixes to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-a-life-20-gsc-game-world" rel="nofollow">A-Life system</a>, which has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-update-15-a-life-new-threats" rel="nofollow">changed considerably</a> since the game's launch last year.</p>

<p>New features for A-Life include the ability for factions to expand their territories, which means that&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>'s landscape is constantly shifting in terms of who's in charge of where. Factions will also defend their lands from hostile encroachment.</p>

<p>Additionally, it should now be a little easier to fight in a swamp; GSC Game World says&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>enemies will "have real problems detecting you in tall grass or reeds", and that their shots will be less accurate when they're shooting at you in these conditions as well.</p>

<p>If you'd like to see everything that's new as part of this update, you can check out the full&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>Update 1.7 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/596291616874954993" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">patch notes right here</a>.</p>




<p>This isn't the first time GSC Game World has found itself in the news over the last few days; the developer recently issued a DMCA claim to survival game&nbsp;<em>Misery</em>, although it looks like the issues raised therein have been ironed out now, since&nbsp;<em>Misery</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/misery-steam-return" rel="nofollow">returned to Steam last week</a>.</p>

<p><em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/stalker-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and it's also landing on <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10014084" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a> this week. You can check out our very own Robert's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/stalker-2-review" rel="nofollow">review of it here</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-soul-aside-update-wave-battles</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lost-soul-aside-update-brings-wave-based-battle-mode-and-more-tomorrow.1355785/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and developer Ultizero Games have announced a major&nbsp;<em>Lost Soul Aside&nbsp;</em>update that's arriving tomorrow, and it's bringing a wave-based battle mode and a host of gameplay improvements with it.</p>

<p>As outlined in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/17/new-lost-soul-aside-update-out-tomorrow-includes-wave-based-surge-of-voidrax-mode/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation Blog post</a>, the new Surge of Voidrax mode pits you against 100 waves of enemies back-to-back. All of the main game's skills and weapons will be unlocked from the beginning in this mode.</p>

<p>Waves will consist of "classic bosses and diverse monsters", according to Ultizero Games, and you'll be able to refill your supplies and boost your power between each wave, thus helping you to prepare for what's to come.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lost-soul-aside-update-november-combat.jpg?itok=_c91wmg6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lost-soul-aside-update-november-combat.jpg?itok=D3CEkgXg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Lost Soul Aside&nbsp;</em>is getting a big free update tomorrow.</figcaption></figure><p>Clearing waves will grant you access to unique cosmetic rewards, and you'll get them upon clearing "specific waves for the first time", so you won't have to beat the entire mode to check out the new looks.</p>

<p>It's not just the Surge of Voidrax mode coming in this update, either. There are also a range of gameplay improvements and tweaks coming to&nbsp;<em>Lost Soul Aside&nbsp;</em>tomorrow, the first of which allows you to skip the game's prologue and jump straight into combat if you wish.</p>

<p>A new Voidrax Pathfinder system has been added to help you with "complex puzzles or challenges", too, so if you're stuck on some part of&nbsp;<em>Lost Soul Aside</em>, this sounds like it'll be for you. Let's hope <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/god-of-war-ragnarok-please-shut-up-mod" rel="nofollow">this isn't a&nbsp;<em>God of War Ragnarok&nbsp;</em>situation</a>, though.</p>

<p>You can also expect a range of new skins, "completely revamped" cutscenes with new animations and improved effects, and refined combat actions, as well as customizable controls. In short, tomorrow's update should hopefully give you a reason to jump back into&nbsp;<em>Lost Soul Aside&nbsp;</em>or to check it out for the first time.</p>




<p><em>Lost Soul Aside&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3378960/Lost_Soul_Aside/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/lost-soul-aside/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and its major Surge of Voidrax update launches for both platforms tomorrow.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-colossal-order-iceflake-studios-paradox</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cities-skylines-2-developer-changes-as-paradox-parts-ways-with-colossal-order.1355779/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Cities: Skylines 2&nbsp;</em>publisher Paradox Interactive has announced that it's parted ways with the game's developer, Colossal Order, and that a new studio will be taking over ongoing development on the city-builder.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/an-update-on-cities-skylines-ii.1873154/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">update</a> on the game's official forum, Paradox says the decision for itself and Colossal Order to split was a mutual one, and that said decision was made "thoughtfully and in the interest of both teams" in order to ensure "the strongest possible future" for&nbsp;<em>Cities: Skylines</em>.</p>

<p>The new developer will be Iceflake Studios, whose name you may know from post-apocalyptic city-building sim&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/surviving-aftermath" rel="nofollow"><em>Surviving the Aftermath</em></a>. Paradox says Iceflake is already "hard at work getting into the nuts and bolts of&nbsp;<em>Cities: Skylines 2</em>".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cities-skylines-2-developer-changing-iceflake-studios-paradox.jpg?itok=nZiiJZde 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cities-skylines-2-developer-changing-iceflake-studios-paradox.jpg?itok=kN6w4ldz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Cities: Skylines 2&nbsp;</em>developer Colossal Order is moving on to other things.</figcaption></figure><p>Before Colossal Order departs&nbsp;<em>Cities: Skylines 2</em>, however, the developer will "implement a few additional updates", including the addition of bikes to the game, as well as new Old Town buildings and lots of bug fixes and improvements.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to a beta version of asset support for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-editor-weekly-patches" rel="nofollow">the game's Editor</a> "before year-end", but after that, development will switch to Iceflake, who will take over starting from the beginning of next year.</p>

<p><em>Cities: Skylines 2&nbsp;</em>was released in late October 2023, and it's fair to say the game wasn't exactly received well at launch (by its community, at the very least), with players <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-will-support-mods-on-consoles-devs-promise-performance-improvements" rel="nofollow">complaining</a> about poor <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-gets-first-of-several-patches-to-improve-performance-following-flawed" rel="nofollow">performance</a>.</p>

<p>Colossal Order and Paradox subsequently implemented a number of updates aimed at addressing common performance woes, but whether they've been successful is a matter of opinion; the game is still <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/949230/Cities_Skylines_II/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow">sitting at a Mixed rating</a> on Steam at time of writing.</p>




<p>That's without mentioning&nbsp;<em>Cities: Skylines 2</em>'s long-in-development console versions, which have been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-console-delay" rel="nofollow">delayed</a> a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-ps5-xbox-release-delayed-again" rel="nofollow">number</a> of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-console-versions-not-before-summer" rel="nofollow">times</a>&nbsp;and which still don't have anything approaching a release date yet.</p>

<p>Perhaps Iceflake Studios will be able to fix the common issues that still appear to plague&nbsp;<em>Cities: Skylines 2</em>, but we won't be finding out until next year. You can grab the game right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/949230/Cities_Skylines_II/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>.</p>
