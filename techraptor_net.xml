            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the heart of the great forests, within long-buried lairs, and at the very edges of the world, they wait. Ravening hordes of inhuman creatures biding their time, plotting the downfall of every ordered kingdom, salivating in anticipation of the bountiful slaughter soon to come.&nbsp;In this dark and bloody age, bold deeds and great courage are called for.</p>

<p>You have chosen to take up a hopeless fight, to stand when the coward would flee and the wise would kneel. You must oppose the swelling tide of strife and war, of flame and fury, or be smothered by it. Let others wallow in their false peace, let them hate you trying to drag them from it. For if you are skilled and lucky, if you choose worthy allies, take up stalwart arms or master perilous magics, you may even live to see your grim work done. Welcome to <em>The Old World RPG</em>, and your journey starts with the&nbsp;<a href="https://cubicle7games.com/warhammer-the-old-world?utm_campaign=Reviewer+&amp;utm_content=+&amp;utm_id=The+Old+World&amp;utm_medium=Reviewer+&amp;utm_source=Reviewers+" rel="nofollow"><em>Warhammer The Old World RPG</em> Player's Guide</a>.</p>

<p>This is the first release planned for the <em>Warhammer The Old World RPG</em>, but we have covered several of Cubicle 7's other <em>Warhammer</em> RPGs in the past, including the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-fantasy-roleplay-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow">Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay Starter Set</a>, and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/age-of-sigmar-soulbound-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow">Warhammer Age of Sigmar Soulbound Starter Set</a>.</p>




<h2>The Older World</h2>

<p>For those new to the setting, it's worth noting the differences between the various Cubicle 7 fantasy <em>Warhammer</em> RPGs, for which there are now 3. <em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar Soulbound</em>&nbsp;is set in the latest edition of <em>Warhammer, Age of Sigmar, </em>or<em> AoS </em>for short, the current setting of Games Workshop's fantasy wargame. Here things are slightly different from the original <em>Warhammer</em>, and the narrative has moved on, and some race names have changed (along with some new races added, and some races removed).</p>

<p><em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay</em>, <em>WFRP</em> for short, is set in the original <em>Warhammer</em> fantasy setting, which no longer has an active wargame supported by Games Workshop. <em>The Old World</em>&nbsp;is set 300 years before the original <em>Warhammer Fantasy</em> setting, prior to the rise to power of some races. This makes it a prequel setting for <em>Warhammer</em>, like the <em>Horus Heresy</em> is to <em>Warhammer 40,000</em>. Both the <em>Horus Heresy</em> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-old-world-review-hit-refresh" rel="nofollow">The Old World</a> have wargames currently produced by Games Workshop, and Cubicle 7 has announced an upcoming RPG set in the <em>Horus Heresy</em>.</p>

<p>The <em>Warhammer The Old World RPG</em> Player's Guide provides players with the background for life in the Old World, with a focus on the Empire, and in particular, Talabecland, and within it, the town of Talagaad, which is the core setting for the initial <em>Old World</em> products. It details the other provinces of the empire, and the lands beyond, as well as a large section on religion and magic, but the core focus is character creation and the rules, and if it's going to be anything like <em>Soulbound</em> or <em>WFRP,</em> there will be plenty of supplements detailing the various areas of the Old World.</p>

<p><em>Warhammer The Old World RPG</em> uses a D10 system, which is entirely different from the D6 system that <em>Soulbound </em>and<em> Wrath and Glory</em> use, or the D100 percentile system that <em>Imperium Maledictum </em>and<em> WFRP</em> use. In<em> The Old World RPG,&nbsp;</em>players&nbsp;roll a number of 10-sided dice (D10) equal to their characteristic, like weapon skill, reason, strength, etc. Each score that rolls under their skill number is a success. So if you had a melee skill of 5 and a weapon skill characteristic of 3, you would roll 3 dice, and each score of 5 or less would be a success.</p>

<p>What I like most about the system is that there's a load of Lore skills that your character can take, and each can provide bonuses to tests if the lore can be leveraged. This can be as simple as knowledge of a city when making an athletics or a stealth test. You can use your knowledge of the city to your advantage when trying to outrun or sneak up on an opponent. Some skills are also dependent on lore. The use of blackpowder weapons is one example, where you need the lore skill to use the physical skill.</p>

<p>Tests are modified by adding or removing dice. If a fellow player uses their action to help you, for each success on their roll, you get an additional dice, or if you're firing a bow at someone who's in cover, you'll lose dice from your roll. Tests can also be grim or glorious, depending on whether the dark gods are working against you or if the odds are substantially in your favor. For glorious rolls, you can reroll all your failed rolls in your test, and if the test is grim, you have to reroll all of your successes.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-the-old-world-roleplaying-game-players-guide-3.jpg?itok=ke3OhbzX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-the-old-world-roleplaying-game-players-guide-3.jpg?itok=u9rqS8Fg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Credit:&nbsp;<em>Warhammer The Old World RPG</em> Player's Guide.</figcaption></figure><h2>Old World Optionality</h2>

<p><i>The Old World RPG </i>character creation has a lot of options for variety in the player's guide. You can play 1 of 6 races, a human, from either the Empire or Bretonnia, a dwarf, a halfling, or a Wood or High Elf. There are then 30 careers to choose from, some of which are locked to races. Only Wood Elves can be Waywatchers, only Empire Humans can be Priests, and only Dwarves can be Brewguards, for example.</p>

<p>You can then add further detail to your character with 59 available talents. Some of these have prerequisites, like race, characteristics, or other talents. These are initially gained during character creation by rolling on a table associated with your chosen race, but they can also be bought with experience points at the final stages of character creation or during play.</p>

<p>Status also plays a huge part in the game, and each class has a tier associated with it, Brass, Silver, or Gold. This tier details your starting equipment options and assets, how much money you have to spend during game sessions, and also how other characters will interact with you. Brass NPCs may respect or fear a Gold character, but they will struggle to blend in, just as Brass characters will find Gold settings awkward.</p>

<p>Your life beyond the adventure is also featured in games, and every few sessions, players take part in endeavors, such as learning skills and spells, resting, or wandering the wilds. If you test a skill during an endeavor, each failed roll is marked on your character sheet, and when those marks are higher than your skill, your skill goes up and the marks are removed. Experience points are also gained during play, and these can be used to gain talents or increase skills, but I like the endeavor system for grounding characters and showing what their lives are like between their glorious adventures.</p>

<p>The <em>Old World RPG</em> Player's Guide is entirely aimed at the players of the game. To play the game, you will also need a Gamemaster, who will run the game, and they need the Gamemaster's Guide, which details how sessions work and provides a whole host of details on the setting and rules, and stats for NPC adversaries and monsters.</p>

<p>A big part of creating a group of characters is how they are all connected, and a Grim Portent session shows how they are and what they are facing. It's mentioned in the Player's Guide, but the Gamemaster's Guide shows how to run this session and how to tie it in to your campaign.</p>

<p>Cubicle 7 has a whole host of releases planned for the initial wave of <a href="https://cubicle7games.com/warhammer-the-old-world?utm_campaign=Reviewer+&amp;utm_content=+&amp;utm_id=The+Old+World&amp;utm_medium=Reviewer+&amp;utm_source=Reviewers+" rel="nofollow">Warhammer The Old World RPG</a> physical products. Anyone purchasing the Player's Guide now will get access to the PDF, and those purchasing the Gamemaster's Guide will get a digital copy later this month. Other physical products planned for a Q1 2026 release include character sheets, maps of the Grand Duchy of Talabec, where the initial releases are planned, and several reference card packs to save you looking through the rulebooks mid-action in-game. There are also several bundles available, including a Collector's Edition for those who want to go all in.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Critical Role has announced an official videogame partnership. The multimedia company has announced it will be collaborating with AdHoc Studio on several upcoming videogame projects. One of them is an official Critical Role videogame.</p>

<h2>The AdHoc Studio Critical Role Videogame Announcement</h2>

<p>In an official press release, Critical Role's CEO Travis Willingham discussed the reasoning behind their collaboration with AdHoc Studio. According to Willingham, he was auditioning for a role in the studio's upcoming narrative-driven superhero workplace drama game, <em>Dispatch.&nbsp;</em>Afterwards, more in-depth talks happened, resulting in a partnership which includes official Critical Role videogame development.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dispatch-game-dialogue-screenshot.jpg?itok=8hZ74aQ7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dispatch-game-dialogue-screenshot.jpg?itok=zeL7O1ub 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><blockquote>
<p>"Just from looking over the audition and game materials, I knew there was something special about what AdHoc was creating and I immediately reached out,” said Willingham. “The design, tone, style and storytelling of DISPATCH jumped off the page, and I knew given the pedigree of the folks at AdHoc, this was a team we wanted to collaborate with. Critical Role is always looking to build with people who are innovating around new ways to deliver story, character and worldbuilding, and AdHoc fits that perfectly.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As part of this partnership, Critical Role will collaborate with AdHoc on future Dispatch brand development. This will include merchandise, tabletop gaming, and more. In addition, both AdHoc and Critical Role will help co-develop the first videogame set in Critical Role's fantasy setting of Exandria, showcasing AdHoc's design strengths in deep, player choice-driven storytelling.</p>

<p>AdHoc's pedigree in videogame narrative cannot be understated. The studio was founded by several veterans of Telltale Games, the studio responsible for their critically-acclaimed videogame adaptations of <em>The Walking Dead</em> and <em>The Wolf Among Us</em> set in the <em>Fables</em> universe.</p>

<p>Considering the voice cast of Dispatch includes two other key members of Critical Role, Matt Mercer and Laura Bailey, there is clear vested interest in AdHoc from a creative and design perspective.</p>

<p>A Critical Role videogame has been something the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-confirms-video-game-is-coming" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">has wanted to do</a> for a while. Given breadth of the world of Exandria, told throughout <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-concludes-campaign-3-with-epic-8-hour-finale-new-godly-exu-announced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">three major campaigns</a> and several spin-offs spanning ten years, there is plenty of material to pull from.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Vile: Exhumed Review - Dirty Computer]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/vile-exhumed-review-dirty-computer</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/vile-exhumed-review-dirty-computer.1248960/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>is an operating system sim in the mold of games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hypnospace-outlaw" rel="nofollow">Hypnospace Outlaw</a>&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Simulacra</em>, and it asks a simple question: What kind of secrets could the innocuous facade of a distinctly '90s-inspired Windows 2.0-style interface be hiding?</p>

<p>Structurally, solo developer Cara Cadaver's game has you trawling through the primitive menus and basic graphics of an old PC, searching for the truth behind the disappearance of adult film actress Candy Corpse.</p>

<p>Just like the OS itself, though,&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>is hiding a lot from you at the outset, and things are not as simple as that setup implies. If you want to find out what might have happened to Candy, you're going to have to put your digital detective hat on, and happily, it's worth doing so, even if you'll be left wanting more at the end.</p>

<h2><em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>Is a Very Convincing '90s PC Sim</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vile-exhumed-review-calculator.jpg?itok=VNaMJplg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vile-exhumed-review-calculator.jpg?itok=0QO1fPgO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Agh! My eyes! The numbers!</figcaption></figure><p>There's a refreshing lack of adornment to&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed</em>. As soon as you boot it up, you'll be faced with a simple login screen that asks you to enter a 4-digit PIN. There's no fluff, no introductory cutscene explaining who the key players in this story are, and no tutorials to be found either.</p>

<p>That works to its credit; since&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>doesn't mess around, you're free to "enjoy" its unsettling, eerily quiet atmosphere right from the get-go. The silence of the operating system is almost oppressive, broken only by the sound of clicking as you navigate clunky menus and positively atavistic-looking websites.</p>

<p>I never felt like Cadaver's game jumped the shark, either. Its PC simulation remained convincing until the very end, helped along by the eldritch glow of the CRT monitor filter overlaying the "action," so to speak.</p>

<p>If you don't have any nostalgia for old-school operating systems, then&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>might not be able to weave its strange magic for you, but I thoroughly enjoyed the matter-of-fact, no-nonsense style in which this ancient PC coughed up its secrets.</p>

<h2>You'll Find a Timely Story in&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vile-exhumed-review-forum.jpg?itok=mStteqII 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vile-exhumed-review-forum.jpg?itok=Sh7u5tPt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Vile: Exhumed</em>'s story doesn't pull its punches.</figcaption></figure><p>Those secrets are worth discovering, too. While&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>is nominally the story of Candy Corpse and her disappearance, there's more to discover inside this particular computer's memory, not least to whom it belongs and why you're digging through it.</p>

<p>Unlike the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Simulacra&nbsp;</em>or its <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/simulacra-2" rel="nofollow">slightly disappointing sequel</a>,&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>doesn't resort to cheap jump scares, nor does it descend into the valley of daft pseudo-supernatural horror.</p>

<p>The scares are much closer to home, and while I don't want to spoil anything, the Steam page does make clear mention of "themes of sexual content, violence, and abusive and harmful language," so you know what kind of realm we're in here.</p>

<p>Since you're free to explore the operating system in whatever order you choose,&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed</em>'s story will likely unfold in a non-linear fashion, and discovering what happened to Candy is just one part of filling in the wider picture.</p>

<p>Great horror is grounded in the real, and that's certainly the case with&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed</em>. If its story ever threatens to feel silly or outré, the fact that many of its themes still disappointingly resonate in the real world only add to the threat.</p>

<h2><em>Vile: Exhumed</em>'s Operating System Is Filled With Secrets</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vile-exhumed-review-password.jpg?itok=3LoXQWs9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vile-exhumed-review-password.jpg?itok=-iFvlUpR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Good luck working this one out.</figcaption></figure><p>Discovering the narrative feels chilling thanks to the plethora of secrets contained within&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed</em>'s operating system. Some applications will give up their secrets readily, while others require passwords or authentication to access.</p>

<p>You're left to discover many of these keys by yourself, although hints are frequently available. Making discoveries therefore feels like pulling off great detective work, evoking the quiet satisfaction of getting an old, irascible computer to do what you want in the process.</p>

<p>Some of those secrets can feel a little too esoteric for their own good, however. I never managed to work out what lurked behind the innocuous-seeming perfume website, for instance, and there are a couple of other head-scratchers that defeated me as well.</p>

<p>Still, if you're the type to pore over games hunting for every scrap of information, then&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>should give you a good couple of hours of entertainment. Unfortunately, however, that's all it's going to give you.</p>

<h2>Frankly, There's Just Not Enough of&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vile-exhumed-review-ffvr.jpg?itok=Jy1QxqQ9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vile-exhumed-review-ffvr.jpg?itok=ybKZ1h8m 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I wanted to spend more time in&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed</em>'s meticulously constructed operating system.</figcaption></figure><p>If I have a core criticism of&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed</em>, it's that there's just not enough of it. Just when things are starting to move along and adrenaline is starting to build, it's over. The ending is a pretty abrupt one, too, although it feels appropriate given what you're likely to have learned beforehand.</p>

<p>Discovering the story of Candy by digging through old websites and deducing passwords is a hugely enjoyable (if that's the right word) experience, so the fact that there's just so little of it is heartbreaking for me.</p>

<p>Cadaver has made it clear&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>is designed to be played in a single sitting, and there's no save function, nor does it allow you to continue playing after the credits. I sort of understand why from a narrative perspective, but I'd have loved the chance to continue spending time with this throwback machine.</p>

<p>Still, I will always prefer a game that leaves before its time to something that massively outstays its welcome. In being so shockingly brief,&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>avoids the pitfalls of puzzle games that keep going long after their best ideas are spent.</p>

<h2><em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vile-exhumed-review-vns.jpg?itok=K0T8_eCC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vile-exhumed-review-vns.jpg?itok=VCMzvbqH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>has plenty of "delights" to offer retro puzzle connoisseurs.</figcaption></figure><p>Cara Cadaver has crafted a very neat little puzzler in&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed</em>. On one level, it's a great simulation of a time before user-friendliness and "idiot-proof" operating system design, and on another, it's an unsettling tale of violence and abuse that may well stay with you (it certainly has with me).</p>

<p>I'd love to see what Cadaver can craft in a larger, more open-ended sandbox environment, but if you're looking for a (very) tightly-plotted experience that doesn't stick around after it's not welcome,&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>will provide.</p>
