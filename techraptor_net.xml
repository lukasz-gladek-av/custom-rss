            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/borderlands-4-will-have-less-toilet-humor-narrative-director-says.1063446/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/borderlands-4-toilet-humor-narrative-director<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Borderlands 4</em>&nbsp;narrative director Sam Winkler has revealed that he intends to tone down what he identifies as an "overabundance of toilet humor" in the series' previous game.</p>

<p>Speaking <a href="https://x.com/ThatSamWinkler/status/1868741632449036648" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">to a follower</a> on social media platform X, Winkler says that while he's "not at liberty" to discuss the narrative content of&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>at the moment, he remains "firm" in his "criticism of&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 3</em>'s overabundance of toilet humor".</p>

<p>Another&nbsp;<em>Borderlands&nbsp;</em>fan then humorously asks Winkler if they'll be able to "use the poop poop farty 4000" to "clean up porta-potties with my companion skibidi toilet", which is a sentence that physically hurt me to write, even though I'm quoting someone else's sarcastic observation.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/borderlands-4-toilet-humor-narrative-director-psycho.jpg?itok=Ey-BmeCK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/borderlands-4-toilet-humor-narrative-director-psycho.jpg?itok=wbmQTnEb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>will focus less on "toilet humor", its narrative director says.</figcaption></figure><p>In response to this painfully-worded question (for which props must begrudgingly go to the post's writer Moxsy), Winkler says that while he can't guarantee there will be "no toilets", he'll "cry real tears" if "the word skibidi ships in the game".</p>

<p>He goes on to say that writer Paul Tassi joked&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>would feature a gun called "Hawk 2A" (a reference to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2024/06/28/hawk-tuah-meme-explained-how-woman-in-viral-interview-made-a-reported-65000-and-prompted-tiktok-craze/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the famous Hawk Tuah meme</a>) and that this suggestion prompted a fellow dev to ask if that gun was real.</p>

<p>That question, Winkler said, made him want to "put [his] hand down the sink grinder", so it sounds like&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>will also de-emphasize the kind of meme humor for which the series has become known.</p>

<p>With all of that said, the thread originally began with Winkler praising&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em>'s contract writers as "some of the funniest people [he knows]", so the game definitely won't be a serious grimdark take on the series.</p>




<p>The first gameplay trailer for&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>was revealed during this year's Game Awards, alongside the likes of an&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/okami-2-hideki-kamiya" rel="nofollow"><em>Okami&nbsp;</em>sequel</a>, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-2025" rel="nofollow">co-op survival spinoff of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em></a>, and Naughty Dog's new game&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/naughty-dog-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet" rel="nofollow"><em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</em></a>.</p>

<p>Gearbox describes the game as a "mayhem-fueled looter shooter" packed with "billions of weapons, outrageous enemies, and intense co-op action", which sounds about right for the&nbsp;<em>Borderlands&nbsp;</em>series.</p>

<p><em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>is set to come to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/borderlands-4/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/borderlands-4/9MX6HKF5647G" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> next year.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-nightreign-will-pit-you-against-dark-souls-enemies-director-confirms.1063443/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-dark-souls-enemies-confirmed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>will, in fact, pit you and your friends against&nbsp;enemies from the&nbsp;<em>Souls&nbsp;</em>series, game director Junya Ishizaki has confirmed.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202412/27477" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Famitsu interview</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-will-feature-enemies-from-dark-souls-director-confirms" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>), Ishizaki says that some&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls&nbsp;</em>enemies will appear to fight you in&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, although it seems like there won't be too many; the game's enemy roster will largely be made up of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>enemies, Ishizaki says.</p>

<p>He goes on to say that he got permission from&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls&nbsp;</em>creator Hidetaka Miyazaki and&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls 2&nbsp;</em>director Yui Tanimura to include enemies from their respective works in <i>Nightreign</i>, so it looks like you can expect&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls 2&nbsp;</em>enemies alongside iconic foes from the other two games.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-dark-souls-enemies-combat.jpg?itok=cMqza9I9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-dark-souls-enemies-combat.jpg?itok=4l-M7hwg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>will feature&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls&nbsp;</em>enemies, as well as those found in the original&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Eagle-eyed observers had already spotted&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls 3</em>'s Nameless King boss in the&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>debut trailer, as well as a boss that looked suspiciously like&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls</em>' Centipede Demon, and now it looks like those won't be the only&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls&nbsp;</em>callbacks in the game.</p>

<p>Ishizaki doesn't mention whether any&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls&nbsp;</em>enemies will be appearing in&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>, but given that the&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls&nbsp;</em>IP is owned by Sony and not by FromSoftware or Bandai Namco, it's unlikely.</p>

<p>As for why&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls&nbsp;</em>enemies turn up in&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>, Ishizaki's answer is rather amusing; he puts it down to the influence of the game's villain, the Night King, which rather smacks of "a wizard did it" to me.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, it's an upcoming co-op survival action game created by FromSoftware and based on the 2022 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-25-million" rel="nofollow">smash hit</a>&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>.</p>




<p>Announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-2025" rel="nofollow">during the Game Awards ceremony last week</a>,&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>eschews FromSoftware's typical Soulslike formula, opting instead for a sort of&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter</em>-inspired roguelite approach that sees players banding together to survive three days and nights of increasingly difficult encounters.</p>

<p>The game's announcement came less than two weeks after FromSoftware head Hidetaka Miyazaki <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-2-not-happening-fromsoftware" rel="nofollow">said there were no plans</a> to expand the&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>IP in the future, but then his games are well-known for featuring duplicitous or obscure NPCs, so perhaps we shouldn't be surprised.</p>

<p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>launches next year for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2622380/ELDEN_RING_NIGHTREIGN/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10010877" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and Xbox.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nihon-falcom-founder-and-chairman-masayuki-kato-dies-aged-78.1063332/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nihon-falcom-chairman-masayuki-kato-dies<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nihon Falcom founder and chairman Masayuki Kato has passed away at the age of 78, the studio has revealed. His cause of death has not been stated.</p>

<p>Per an announcement by Nihon Falcom (with translation from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/1hg50yo/comment/m2gmzk3/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Reddit user TheBlueDolphina</a>), Kato died on December 15th, which is also when he "resigned from his position as Director" at the company. That might sound obvious, but I'm guessing confirming this is some kind of requirement with regards to corporate structure.</p>

<p>Kato's death will be marked by a funeral and a wake that are open only to close family members "in accordance with the wishes of the bereaved family", Nihon Falcom's statement reads. The studio is also "respectfully" declining condolence gifts or physical messages of sympathy.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nihon-falcom-chairman-dies-ys-x.jpg?itok=ZQJ-kNcH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nihon-falcom-chairman-dies-ys-x.jpg?itok=DtqOkBVo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nihon Falcom is known for franchises like&nbsp;<em>Ys&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Heroes</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Nihon Falcom was founded by Masayuki Kato back in 1981, with the studio <a href="https://shmuplations.com/ys/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">named for&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em>' Millennium Falcon spaceship</a> (and the N being swapped for an M due to the popularity of the "com" suffix at the time).</p>

<p>The company's early games would prove hugely influential in shaping the then-nascent JRPG and action RPG genres; with franchises like&nbsp;<em>Ys</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Heroes</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Dragon Slayer</em>, the company arguably laid the groundwork for later giants like&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest</em>.</p>

<p>Today, Nihon Falcom is perhaps best known for the still-ongoing&nbsp;<em>Ys&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Heroes&nbsp;</em>franchises, the latter of which has birthed the popular&nbsp;<em>Trails&nbsp;</em>sub-series to which luminaries like&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Trails of Cold Steel&nbsp;</em>belong.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nihon-falcom-trails-of-cold-steel.jpg?itok=9K48phDZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nihon-falcom-trails-of-cold-steel.jpg?itok=MZqYu2jc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Trails&nbsp;</em>sub-series is just one of Nihon Falcom's exports.</figcaption></figure><p>While Kato remained the chairman of Nihon Falcom, he wasn't its president; that role is filled by Toshihiro Kondo, who said back in October that the studio was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nihon-falcom-considering-ai-translation" rel="nofollow">considering utilizing generative AI</a> for speedier translations.</p>

<p>It's not clear how the day-to-day running of Nihon Falcom will be affected by Kato's death, but for now, we can simply mourn the loss of one of the JRPG world's most influential figures. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dauntless-awakening-update-apology</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dauntless-devs-apologize-for-awakening-update-promise-immediate-adjustments.1063311/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dauntless-awakening-update-apology<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>developer Phoenix Labs has apologized for the game's recent Awakening update, pledging "immediate adjustments" for some of the patch's more controversial features.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://playdauntless.com/news/reflections-what-comes-next/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>website titled "Reflections on the Launch and What Comes Next", Phoenix Labs says it "hear[s]" players' frustration with Awakening and that it "sincerely apologize[s]" to players who felt their "time, effort, and trust were overlooked".</p>

<p>Phoenix Labs goes on to say that while its goals for Awakening were "ambitious", it acknowledges that the release of the update caused "frustration and confusion" and that it's "committed" to earning players' trust back.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dauntless-awakening-update-apology-snow.jpg?itok=icU89lxi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dauntless-awakening-update-apology-snow.jpg?itok=ka4wuZwz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dauntless</em>' Awakening update caused "frustration and confusion", developer Phoenix Labs has admitted.</figcaption></figure><p>In order to "respect [players'] lost progress and investment", Phoenix Labs says it'll be awarding 300,000 Rams and 5,000 Combat Merits to returning players, as well as up to 500 Peerless Aetherite "based on your weapon crafting in the pre-Awakening game".</p>

<p>Additionally, all game modes will be unlocked from the jump for returning players in an upcoming update, so you won't have to complete the new questline to unlock your favorite mode.</p>

<p>Phoenix Labs also says it's currently working on "immediate adjustments...to address progression, monetization, and technical issues", which were three of the biggest areas players identified as frustrations with Awakening.</p>

<p>Throughout the rest of the post, Phoenix Labs goes into detail regarding how it plans to reimburse players' time, detailing what initiatives are in place to fix&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>and make it appealing to returning players again.</p>




<p>In case you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Dauntless</em>' Awakening update, it launched earlier this month, with the Steam version of the game also arriving on the same date.</p>

<p>Handily, that means&nbsp;<em>Dauntless</em>' <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/331370/Dauntless/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam reviews</a>, which are currently sitting at Overwhelmingly Negative,&nbsp;pretty accurately reflect players' feelings about Awakening. Complaints include new paywalls where none previously existed, as well as massive changes to weapon crafting, technical problems, and much more.</p>

<p>Suffice it to say that although&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>managed to rack up <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dauntless-boasts-over-four-million-players-in-first-week" rel="nofollow">more than four million players</a> in its opening week, numbers have dwindled massively since then, and the Awakening update hasn't exactly restored trust in Phoenix Labs.</p>

<p>Hopefully, the changes outlined in the developer's blog post can bring players back, but I wouldn't be surprised if this was the beginning of the end for&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>either. You can play the game right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/331370/Dauntless/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/dauntless/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/dauntless/9nq0v4dwrk49" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/dauntless-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> for free.</p>
