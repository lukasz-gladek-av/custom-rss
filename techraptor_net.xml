            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Another GameCube game has been added to the Nintendo Switch Online library, and this time, it's the turn of classic turn-based strategy epic <em>Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</em>.</p><p>Just like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wario-world-nintendo-switch-online" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6472b9f8-3b35-41d5-9c98-1ffee343faf2" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">every other</a> GameCube <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/luigis-mansion-nintendo-switch-online" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="559128f7-0f60-43f5-a4e0-64e6a9d1d5b0" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">game</a> on the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chibi-robo-switch-online" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5eda1a19-710c-4126-8f24-86dd16fbc1ae" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">service</a>, <em>Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance </em>is only available if you're a Switch 2 owner with the Expansion Pack addon for your Switch Online membership, but if you do fulfil those criteria, you can check it out right now.</p><p><em>Path of Radiance </em>was released all the way back in 2005 (and, incidentally, was my introduction to the <em>Fire Emblem </em>series, as I'm sure it was for many). The game follows Ike, a mercenary who gets caught up in a conflict between nations and who must help a princess reclaim her throne.</p><figure role="group">

<p>Much like its predecessors (and, indeed, its successors), <em>Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance </em>is a turn-based strategy RPG in which you'll be issuing commands to your characters and trying to keep them alive throughout various combat scenarios.</p><p>The game features permadeath, so if any of your troops fall during a battle, they're gone for good. Even plot-critical characters can fall in this way, although they'll be gravely wounded rather than dead, so you'll still see them during cutscenes.</p><p><em>Path of Radiance </em>is the first <em>Fire Emblem </em>game to feature fully-rendered 3D graphics, as well as voice acting and FMV cutscenes, but it's not the first title to come to the West; that honor goes to 2003's eponymous <em>Fire Emblem </em>(which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fire-emblem-nintendo-switch-online" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a7f1d4bf-fa55-4e28-a6da-a9eb0190b12d" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">also on Switch Online!</a>).</p><p>You can check out a trailer for <em>Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</em>'s Switch Online release right here. The trailer's in Japanese, but the game is available across the world, so you won't exclusively be playing the Japanese version.</p>
<p><em>Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance </em>is available right now to Nintendo Switch Online subscribers with a Switch 2 and the Expansion Pack addon. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Larian Studios' Swen Vincke has walked back the company's stance on using generative AI during concept art development, but that doesn't mean the tech won't be used elsewhere in the upcoming <em>Divinity</em>'s development.</p><p>As part of an AMA on Reddit (as spotted by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stephentotilo.bsky.social/post/3mbym4rw3ic2y" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Stephen Totilo on Bluesky</a>), Vincke <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nyl9tdz/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">responded</a> to a user's questions about his feelings on generative AI, saying that Larian had "decided to refrain from using gen AI tools during concept art development" in order to prevent "discussion about the origin of the art".</p><p>However, Vincke followed that comment up by saying that he still thinks generative AI can "improve the speed" with which Larian experiments and "refine[s] ideas", leading to a "more focused development cycle, less waste, and ultimately, a higher-quality game".</p><figure role="group">

<p>Vincke says Larian won't use what he calls "creative assets" without "being 100% sure about the origins of the training data and the consent of those who created the data". He says if generative AI is used to create assets, it will be "trained on data [Larian owns]".</p><p>There is, however, a question mark (as <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/twilightvulpine.bsky.social/post/3mbypouyzb22c" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">pointed out by one Bluesky user</a>) around whether such a thing is possible; it's likely that any gen AI model used by Larian will be based on pre-existing models, which have often been trained on data of questionable origin.</p><p>The generative AI debate continues to rage in the gaming sphere. Some companies, like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-partners-with-generative-ai-company-to-enable-dynamically-generated-stories-quests" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="19d43f27-7ba5-4ecd-92ba-6d04beac862a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Xbox</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-hopes-to-use-generative-ai-to-drive-more-monetization-and-make-development-30-more" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="746600ea-ef36-4d95-b141-ab37281d9e3e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">EA</a>, have wholeheartedly embraced it, while others, including the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hooded-horse-no-gen-ai-contracts" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4bf049e2-a4f8-41a0-b834-8030bfbcc977" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Manor Lords </em>publisher Hooded Horse</a>, have denounced the tech in no uncertain terms.</p><p>Generative AI isn't going anywhere anytime soon, though, it seems; our very own Don's research has revealed that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/almost-20-of-top-new-sellers-on-steam-in-2025-used-generative-ai" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="16d0c419-db96-434f-99c7-9e50c881e987" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">almost 20% of Steam's top sellers in 2025</a> used generative AI in some way, shape, or form.</p><figure role="group">

Bender says he "fucking hate[s] gen AI art" and that it has "made [his] life more difficult in many ways" due to its tendency to "infest shit in a way it shouldn't".</p><p>He says "no fucking AI assets" is now written into Hooded Horse's contracts with developers, although I would assume that the terms used are perhaps a little more legally friendly than that. Still, perhaps they're not. Wouldn't that be a fine thing?</p><figure role="group">

<p>Bender says he and his team are "constantly having to watch and deal with [generative AI usage] and try to prevent it from slipping in", calling the technology "cancerous" (in the sense that it grows and takes over large portions of development if undealt with).</p><p>The Hooded Horse lead goes on to say that he "wouldn't be able to face" the publisher's marketing artists if the studio used generative AI, but that Hooded Horse is also "committed ethically, for all the reasons you know, against [gen AI]".</p><p>Hooded Horse's position is by no means shared by every company in the industry.
