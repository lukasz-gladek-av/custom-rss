            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the things essential to a healthy relationship with games, both as a player and creator, is the occasional trips to the shop. Branch out, check the shelves, and when you pick up your usual, there’s a face staring at you that you’ve seen before, but not like this – not with such a sly smile. That’s how <em>Livber: Smoke and Mirrors</em> came into mind.</p>

<p>This is the debut commercial title from Turkish developers InEv Games, a psychological horror VN that’s been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DiscoElysium/comments/1l33564/would_you_look_at_my_disco_elysiuminspired/" rel="nofollow">making the rounds through gaming circles</a> with comparisons to titles like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/disco-elysium" rel="nofollow">Disco Elysium</a> </em>-- a noble partner. You play as Elbek, a young man living in Gaia who, five years ago, condemned his lover Lilith to be killed after witnessing her practicing black magic. All those years later, and with a letter inviting him to their former home, you retrace the steps that lead not just to their love, but also to Elbek’s beginnings.</p>

<p>Despite the initial comparison to <em>Disco Elysium</em>, you’d be hard-pressed to find much more beyond its presentation. As a VN, <em>Livber </em>stays in that static area, showcasing still, but nonetheless compelling, imagery, with the narrator a character in and of itself. Quite often, they and Elbek will find themselves casting diatribes between each other, in what becomes the center piece of the story.</p>



<p>In reality, <em>Livber </em>bears more resemblance to legitimate cinema. Films that came to mind in the initial stretches of the game were titles like Andrzej Żuławski’s <em>Possession</em>, and Pedro Almodóvar’s <em>The Skin I Live In</em>, and I could conceivably draw a path to the two. What inspirations <em>Livber </em>wears on its sleeves tend to dissipate over time, forming into something else that’s a lot more absorbing, especially in those face-offs between Elbek and his past.</p>

<p>Of course, that isn’t to downplay Elbek and Lilith’s history either. Early on, it’s quite clear that animosity is the name of the game, surprisingly for both parties. With Elbek, this antipathy comes across as quite immature, even when things become more fleshed out and developed, while Lilith? Lilith seems to play the host, an unjust, albeit obviously unhinged, curator.</p>

<p>That established conflict pays off in hefty dividends quite early on, but as you get a grasp of the world of <em>Livber </em>– with InEv being so kind as to provide on-the-spot glossary definitions for Gaia’s history – that conflict fades into something much more nebulous. Soon enough, it turns into an entire extension of testing Elbek to his limits, with callbacks, consternations, and commitments, most of which come from the narrator.</p>



<p>It’s a valid path to take, however, the writing doesn’t do much of a stellar job at convincing you of the stakes, in what is <em>Livber</em>’s weakest aspect narratively. There are bigger schemes at play here, but in terms of portraying what is happening, the lexicon used to describe it is quite restrictive. You’ll see a lot of repeated adjectives, for repeated objects of permanence – lidless eyes, constant mentions of black sludge, cooling air, so on and so forth.</p>

<p>This can be an issue, considering how <em>Livber </em>is exceptionally proud of its density. Claiming to have 60,000 words written for the title, InEv quickly finds struggles in emphasizing a lot of it with that unique flavor. That variety in path branching, or different contexts, can’t or won’t amount to much if it’s going to be emblazoned with the same descriptives.</p>

<p>There’s an exercise at first where the sound design is trying to run in tandem with the writing, which would’ve excused both at any point should one dip in quality. You hear it in the first couple of scenes, these howling winds, cutlery scraping across crude crockery, the loop brilliantly maddening. It’s not long before the game forgets this however, and sooner rather than later, you’re sitting in silence, with an overbearing soundtrack to boot.</p>



<p>In its purest essence, <em>Livber </em>has all the pieces to succeed, each and every single one of them showing their brilliance at different instances, but rarely will they all intertwine. Lilith’s sheer anger is portrayed with such a brooding quiet at first, when she slowly and succinctly explains her past, and the way she dances into Elbek’s mind. It’s quite mesmerizing, as much as it is antagonizing.</p>

<p>That quickly stops, as suddenly, all that arises is directionless braying that repeats and insists upon an establishment that feels like we should've been prepared before the insanity kicked in. It doesn’t feel like there are points where Elbek is allowed to stand steadfast with his own testimony, with the choices you make, but instead, a narrator who really oversteps their boundaries as a questionable entity. It’s an annoying concept, especially when <em>Livber </em>WANTS Elbek to establish the world around him also.</p>

<p>There are also repeated instances of what I can only describe as “creepypasta writing”. At its worst, its juvenile conceptions of madness – TyPiNg lIIIIIIIIKe ThiS….. – the kind of grating annoyances that’d upend a <em>Pokémon&nbsp;</em>ROM hack where Red says a curse word. It tends to overturn the generally surrealistic setting of <em>Livber</em>’s scenarios, and makes it all feel modernistic, in a relatively periodic title, with timelines and codexes to consider.</p>



<p>It’s hard to extract any sympathy for… anyone presented by the end of it. It’s truly, awfully difficult to come to any conclusions for the characters, other than “where have you been?”, “what have you done?”. Despite that glossary of Gaia and Livber coming in handy quite often, those two concepts don’t get the limelight they should contextually receive, especially when discussing the prejudice and distressing wrath Lilith faced at the hands of others.</p>

<h2><em>Livber: Smoke and Mirrors&nbsp;</em>| Final Verdict</h2>

<p>I think <em>Livber </em>had a blueprint to succeed greatly. Those first few scenes where InEv is building the track are fascinating, but we’re on a road to nowhere. Despite its density, it’s underwritten, despite its history, it’s unexplained, and despite that fire, the fuel is lost in the agency to bring an unnecessarily airbrushed conclusion. Quick to stick to a plan that never involved you.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Tales of Xillia Remastered Review - Seeing Double]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/tales-of-xillia-remastered-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tales-of-xillia-remastered-review-seeing-double.1344463/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s hard to believe it’s been nearly 15 years since the original release of <em>Tales of Xillia</em>, but here we are. That’s notable because it marked the 15th anniversary of the Tales of series, and today Bandai Namco is celebrating 30 years of these stories.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It’s an appropriate time to revisit an anniversary game for this reason, thus the release of <em>Tales of Xillia Remastered</em>, which marks not only this particular milestone but also the game’s first time outside of its original PlayStation 3 version.</p>

<p>Much like its recent cousin, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/tales-of-graces-f-remastered-review-spirited-journey" rel="nofollow"><em>Tales of Graces f Remastered</em></a>, <em>Tales of Xillia Remastered</em> promises visual updates and a number of quality of life updates across the board. Similarly, it’s not a remake, so if you’ve played it on PS3 already, you know what to expect, or at least I did going into it.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xillia_05.jpg?itok=kQfBVYNo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xillia_05.jpg?itok=usVnEX-4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>For those who haven’t, however, <em>Tales of Xillia</em> is a game whose strength relies on its characters and particularly its dual protagonists – Jude Mathis and Milla Maxwell.</p>

<p>From the onset, the game invites you to choose one of the two to follow for the length of the story. For those new to Xillia, it’s Jude who will provide most of the context up front. Milla has a different perspective, but from a narrative standpoint, I think it makes more sense to go with her on a second run through.</p>

<p>The story itself still plays up both protagonists along the way, as well as the development of their relationship with each other and the other characters they meet during their journey.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Tales of Xillia</em> begins with a watercolor-scape of a world known as Rieze Maxia. Right away, we’re introduced to Jude (or Milla if you’ve gone that route), a medical student who is looking for his missing teacher. He eventually encounters Milla as she saves him from becoming a military experiment designed to power a spirit-stealing weapon known as the Lance of Kresnik.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xillia_02.jpg?itok=rACqKgD3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xillia_02.jpg?itok=uG6k-fRA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>When Milla’s own elemental companions get absorbed instead, the pair end up on the run, and a series of circumstances has them clashing with a king who believes in the Lance’s power.</p>

<p>This is only the tip of the iceberg, however, as a greater plot and even a terrorist organization reveal the world isn’t as small as it seems.</p>

<p><em>Xillia</em>’s main story is fairly straightforward, and I think it leans on the usual Tales of tropes to decent success. Its biggest strength is the colorful cast of characters – Alvin, Leia, Elize, and Rowen – who all bring their own individual stories and how they gel with each other over the course of the story in a way that allows for emotional investment on the part of the player.</p>

<p>Alvin in particular remains one of the standouts for me, even if his motivations are a little too easily read and he’s ultimately kept around for his usefulness. My only real complaint is that things could have been fleshed out a little further. There are a lot of interesting ideas that are only surface-level, and a deeper exploration could have gone a long way to fleshing out the world’s lore.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xillia_04.jpg?itok=WpllhRPP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xillia_04.jpg?itok=aCHgI6ME 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>Xillia</em>’s battle system (known as the Dual Raid Linear Motion Battle System) remains as fast and as fun as ever, with four characters placed into action combat. One character can be controlled by the player while the other three are directed by the computer – a feature which can be strategized properly in the menu settings.</p>

<p>Battles themselves happen in real time, so attacking with weapons or artes consumes Technical Points. What makes <em>Xillia </em>stand out from other games in the series is the ability to link up with a partner character, with which they can then perform linked artes and other unique abilities, provided the Linked Artes Gauge on the side of the screen is full.</p>

<p>Doing so can trigger Over Limit, which means the characters have immunity to stagger, and unlimited artes during the duration of the battle.</p>

<p><em>Xillia</em> makes use of Skills in its systems as well, which can be obtained by leveling up the skill tree-like Lilium Orb using earned GP.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xillia_03.jpg?itok=hc0VECQv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xillia_03.jpg?itok=YzxiD6VP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>I think it’s all very streamlined in a way. You can customize a lot of the character attributes to the style you want to play. For example, I built Jude to focus more on attacking, while characters like Elize and Leia were more suited for healing. Milla, Alvin, and Rowen were more balanced between the two, but you can do whatever you want for the most part.</p>

<p>The remaster takes this up a notch by including the Grade Shop right away, which is a sort of New Game+ give yourself all the cool abilities upfront addition.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other add-ons include the ability to autosave anywhere, toggling enemy encounters on the field, a retry feature for normal battles, subtitles for battle scenes that weren’t previously available, and a whole host of smaller map additions, and the ability to skip cutscenes. A lot of this stuff is super helpful for both returning fans and for that inevitable second playthrough to see both sides of Jude and Milla’s story.</p>

<p>From a visual standpoint, <em>Tales of Xillia Remastered</em> is about what I remember it being like on PS3, just ported up to work on PlayStation 5. That means they didn’t really redo much at all in terms of the models or the sparse environments. The colors do look a little more vibrant, and the framerate is solid, so that counts for something. Unfortunately, the English audio quality still sounds compressed in some areas, particularly with Milla's voice.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xillia_06.jpg?itok=Wk2QR1y1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xillia_06.jpg?itok=UPUOnohR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>It’s pretty much what you’d expect from a typical remaster – and that’s not a bad thing. It’s not like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/final-fantasy-vii-crisis-core-reunion-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Final Fantasy VII: Crisis Core Reunion</em></a>, where they put a whole new coat of paint on old bones, and that’s just fine. <em>Xillia</em>’s life as a PS3 game was built on those limitations, so they had to get creative with the art style, and that still holds.</p>

<p>Overall, <em>Tales of Xillia Remastered</em> is a fine game. If you’ve never played it before, it’s finally out there for you to play on modern systems. For returning fans, the quality of life improvements make getting back into it a breeze.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While the story isn’t as fleshed out as it could be, the snappy gameplay systems make <em>Tales of Xillia Remastered</em> an easy choice for those looking to pick up a relatively short RPG.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Epic and Google Look Set to Bury the Fortnite Hatchet Soon]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-google-fortnite-joint-proposal</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/epic-and-google-look-set-to-bury-the-fortnite-hatchet-soon.1344340/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic's Tim Sweeney has revealed that Google has made what he calls an "awesome" proposal to open up the Android operating system, thus setting the stage for a potential burying of the hatchet (if you'll forgive the mixed metaphors).</p>

<p>Speaking <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1985920786545123613" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on X</a> earlier today, Sweeney said the proposal would "double down on Android's original vision as an open platform" by streamlining "competing store installs", reducing developer service fees on the Play Store, and enabling third-party "in-app and web payments".</p>

<p>Sweeney goes on to describe this proposal as a "comprehensive solution" which he contrasts against Apple's "model of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-apple-500-million-euro-fine" rel="nofollow">blocking all competing stores</a> and leaving payments as the only vector for competition".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fortnite-epic-apple-proposal-tim-sweeney.jpg?itok=0lTmU7AU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fortnite-epic-apple-proposal-tim-sweeney.jpg?itok=bYx_7HKU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>studio Epic's long battle with Google could be over soon.</figcaption></figure><p>Google's Sameer Samat, president of the Android ecosystem, <a href="https://x.com/ssamat/status/1985920218602918343" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">echoes</a> Sweeney's comments. He says the proposal is aimed at "expanding developer choice and flexibility, lowering fees, and encouraging more competition all while keeping users safe".</p>

<p>Samat goes as far as to say that if the proposal is approved in court, it would "resolve [Epic and Google's] litigations", so if the proposal goes through, it'll mark an end to the protracted legal battle that began all those years ago.</p>

<p>Epic and Google's battle started in 2020, when&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-sues-google-over-fortnites-removal-from-play-store" rel="nofollow">removed from the Play Store</a>&nbsp;after Epic attempted to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-slashes-up-to-20-off-purchases-on-all-platforms" rel="nofollow">bypass Android's proprietary payment system</a> in order to offer direct discounts on several in-game purchases.</p>

<p>In response, Epic sued Google (as well as Apple, who took similar measures), leading to a lengthy court battle in which Epic accused both companies of holding a mobile duopoly and discouraging competition.</p>




<p>The proposals must now be approved by US District Judge James Donato, who's presiding over the Epic vs. Google case. According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/google-proposes-app-store-reforms-settlement-with-fortnite-maker-epic-games-2025-11-05/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Reuters</a>, Donato is scheduled to meet with lawyers for "a previously scheduled hearing" tomorrow, so the new proposals may be discussed then. Stay tuned for more.</p>
