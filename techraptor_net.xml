            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/delta-force-console-versions-delayed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Team Jade and publisher TiMi Studio Group have announced that the console versions of tactical shooter&nbsp;<em>Delta Force&nbsp;</em>will be delayed beyond 2025's first quarter.</p>

<p>During the sixth volume of the developer's "Ask Shadow Anything" Q&amp;A sessions, game director Shadow Guo provides an update on the PlayStation and Xbox versions of the game, which were originally scheduled to launch sometime early this year.</p>

<p>According to Shadow, although development on&nbsp;<em>Delta Force</em>'s console versions is "going well", the release date has been postponed so that the developer can ensure "input fairness" for players of "different skill levels".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/delta-force-console-delayed-q1-aiming.jpg?itok=iX32dv97 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/delta-force-console-delayed-q1-aiming.jpg?itok=kpkRLXl4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Delta Force&nbsp;</em>isn't coming to consoles in the first quarter of this year.</figcaption></figure><p>Shadow says one of the main challenges of making a tactical shooter for consoles is making sure that players can "have a fair and balanced aiming experience", and that this is a "key issue" the team is currently hoping to solve.</p>

<p>It's not all that's holding the console versions of&nbsp;<em>Delta Force&nbsp;</em>back, though. Shadow also says the team is currently working on "optimizing the UI and overall interactions in the Operations mode", going on to say that adapting the UI for consoles in this regard is "complex".</p>

<p>If you're disappointed in the delay, Shadow says that a detailed roadmap regarding console development for&nbsp;<em>Delta Force&nbsp;</em>will soon be released, giving you a glimpse into "the progress and tasks we complete periodically".</p>

<p>As for the rest of the video, Shadow provides updates on hot-button issues like a kill cam, addressing performance issues, and progression wipes for the Operations mode. You can check out the full Q&amp;A session (don't worry, it's pretty short!) right here.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Delta Force</em>, it's a free-to-play tactical shooter based on the long-running shooter series of the same name.</p>

<p>The game comes complete with a range of multiplayer modes, as well as a campaign that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/delta-force-campaign-january" rel="nofollow">retells the events also depicted in the 2001 movie&nbsp;<em>Black Hawk Down</em></a>. Said campaign launches tomorrow, having been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/delta-force-campaign-delayed" rel="nofollow">delayed from its original release window</a>.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Delta Force&nbsp;</em>right now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2507950/Delta_Force/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">for free on PC</a>. Console versions are also on the way, but as today's Q&amp;A revealed, we don't quite know when yet. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-marine-2-devs-hasbro-tentpole-ip</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/space-marine-2-devs-working-on-new-aaa-game-using-tentpole-hasbro-ip.1114551/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-marine-2-devs-hasbro-tentpole-ip<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hasbro has announced that the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>development team is currently working on an AAA game based on one of the tabletop giant's "tentpole" IPs.</p>

<p>The news comes courtesy of an earnings call to mark Hasbro revealing its fourth-quarter financials earlier today (thanks, <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/02/saber-interactive-developing-aaa-game-based-on-tentpole-hasbro-ip" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gematsu</a>). In that call, CEO Chris Cocks said the new game, which will be developed by&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>studio Saber, will combine "high-octane single-player action and amazing multiplayer".</p>

<p>Cocks went on to say that the game will utilize Saber's Swarm technology, presumably referring to the Swarm Engine on which&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>runs, alongside games like&nbsp;<em>SnowRunner&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>World War Z</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/space-marine-2-devs-hasbro-tentpole-ip-shooting.jpg?itok=-4Dr23Sw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/space-marine-2-devs-hasbro-tentpole-ip-shooting.jpg?itok=V0ZNWTKF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Space Marine 2</em>'s development studio will be working with Hasbro on one of the latter's "tentpole" IPs.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that the Swarm tech to which Cocks refers doesn't necessarily mean we'll be seeing the same kind of massive hordes of enemies present in both&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>World War Z</em>; it's the name for the engine, after all, rather than just that one feature.</p>

<p>As for which IP Cocks is referring to, Hasbro is naturally playing those cards very close to its chest, and I use those words advisedly.</p>

<p>IPs the company controls include&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-movie-is-coming-courtesy-of-hasbro-and-legendary-pictures" rel="nofollow">getting a Legendary Pictures-produced movie</a>, potentially making it a solid candidate for a new AAA video game.</p>

<p>Other potential IPs might include&nbsp;<em>Transformers</em>, although the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/transformers-reactivate-canceled-as-splash-damage-staff-at-risk-of-redundancy" rel="nofollow">cancellation of Splash Damage's&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/transformers-reactivate-canceled-as-splash-damage-staff-at-risk-of-redundancy" rel="nofollow">Transformers: Reactivate</a>&nbsp;</em>might put a dent in that theory, as well as&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>,&nbsp;<em>Power Rangers</em>, and, uh,&nbsp;<em>Peppa Pig</em>. Yeah, it's probably that last one.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/power-rangers-ritas-rewind-hasbro-ip.jpg?itok=7s_77ECX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/power-rangers-ritas-rewind-hasbro-ip.jpg?itok=tyaykkAP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Could a new AAA&nbsp;<em>Power Rangers&nbsp;</em>game be on the cards?</figcaption></figure><p>If Hasbro and Saber are working on a single-player&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;</em>game, then it'll be in good company, slotting alongside the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-dnd-game-2026" rel="nofollow">live service multiplayer game</a> currently in the works at&nbsp;<em>Payday 3&nbsp;</em>studio Starbreeze.</p>

<p>Of course, if it is&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>-related, Saber and Hasbro will have to make sure they don't repeat the mistakes of the genuinely awful&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dungeons-dragons-dark-alliance-delisted-february" rel="nofollow">being delisted next week</a>.</p>

<p>It is, however, probably safe to assume that we're not about to see a major AAA game based on&nbsp;<em>Monopoly&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Cluedo</em>, as sad as I am about that. It's also unlikely we'll hear anything more about this one for quite a while, so stay tuned.</p>

<p>Lots of recent features added to&nbsp;<em>GTA 5&nbsp;</em>on consoles, like kernel-level anti-cheat for&nbsp;<em>GTA Online&nbsp;</em>and "proactive voice chat moderation", will also be available for the PC version, as well as a number of technical enhancements.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gta-5-pc-upgrades-ps5-xbox-wildlife.jpg?itok=znCYPdyz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gta-5-pc-upgrades-ps5-xbox-wildlife.jpg?itok=kfWZt36H 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>GTA 5&nbsp;</em>is finally getting those PS5 and Xbox Series X|S enhancements on PC, including wildlife photography and more.</figcaption></figure><p>Those technical improvements include ray tracing support, as well as support for AMD and Nvidia's upscaling methods FSR and DLSS. Of course, you'll need compatible hardware to take advantage of these enhancements.</p>

<p>Loading times should also be improved if you're playing on an SSD and using DirectStorage, and the game will now also support "higher resolutions, higher aspect ratios, and higher framerates" across the board.</p>

<p>If you're a PS5 controller owner, you'll be happy to know that&nbsp;<em>GTA 5&nbsp;</em>will now support the DualSense controller on PC, complete with adaptive trigger compatibility.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dune: Awakening Brings Open-World Survival to Arrakis in May]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dune-awakening-brings-open-world-survival-to-arrakis-in-may.1114491/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Funcom has revealed the&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>release date, and if you're eager to begin your journey of survival on the desert world of Arrakis, then you can get stuck into the character creation tool right now.</p>

<p>As revealed in a new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>launches on PC on May 20th. Unfortunately, it won't be landing on consoles at the same time; Funcom says a PS5 and Xbox Series X|S release date for&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>has yet to be revealed.</p>

<p>As a sweetener, however, you can try out the game's character creation tool right now. It also comes complete with a benchmark tool, so you can check whether your PC is beefy enough to run the game in the first place.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dune-awakening-release-date-combat.jpg?itok=1B-mbdvd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dune-awakening-release-date-combat.jpg?itok=fFNP_ldX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>officially lands on PC in May.</figcaption></figure><p>When it launches,&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>will set you back $49.99 or your regional equivalent. Pre-orders aren't live just yet, but when they do go live, pre-ordering the game will net you the Terrarium of Muad'Dib, which you can use to decorate your base with an adorable little desert mouse.</p>

<p>Additionally, if you check out the character creator and benchmark tool for&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>ahead of launch, you'll get a Frameblade knife skin that you'll be able to redeem once you pick up the full game. Of course, you can transfer your created character into&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>when it launches.</p>

<p>Using the tool, you can not only make your character, but also decide which caste, home planet, and mentor you want. Which mentor you pick will determine your starting abilities, but you'll be able to mix and match as well, so you can be a Swordmaster with some Bene Gesserit abilities if you want.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening</em>, it's an open-world survival game with an emphasis on multiplayer. The game takes place on the desert planet of Arrakis and sees you "embark[ing] on a journey from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-reveals-spectacular-gameplay-and-details" rel="nofollow">scavenging and survival to controlling the planet itself</a>".</p>




<p>Funcom says&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>will be perfect for both fans of Frank Herbert's original&nbsp;<em>Dune&nbsp;</em>novels and those who've never picked up one of the books or watched one of the movies.</p>

<p><em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172710/Dune_Awakening/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> on May 20th. You can check out our hands-off preview of the game from back in March last year <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/dune-awakening-preview-pax-east-2024" rel="nofollow">right here</a>.</p>
