Others, it's for the thrill of competition. Whatever the reason is, multiplayer games are often the throughline of most people's year with games. Here are our best of 2025.</p><p>Here are the nominees for TechRaptor's 2025 Best Multiplayer Award for exceptional multiplayer gameplay and design.</p><ul><li>Battlefield 6</li><li>Elden Ring Nightreign</li><li>Mario Kart World</li><li>Peak</li><li>Split Fiction</li></ul><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/awards" rel="nofollow">Check out here</a>&nbsp;for our other award categories.</p><hr><h2>Third Place - Split Fiction</h2><p>Developer: Hazelight Studios | Release Date: March 6th, 2025</p><p>Written by Robert Scarpinito</p><p>Josef Fares may forever be the man who publicly hated on the Oscars once, but let's not forget that he and his studio champion unique multiplayer experiences. <em>Split Fiction</em> is the latest of his games, and it's filled to the brim with gameplay that puts cooperation centerstage.</p><p>It starts off easy, with each player getting access to a couple unique mechanics. These mechanics compliment each other, often requiring a one-two punch to solve a puzzle or beat an enemy. It's simple, but the game layers on challenges to mix things up. These mechanics change every level and evolve over the course of each level, keeping things fresh.</p><p>Each stage swaps back and forth between fantasy and sci-fi for narrative reasons, and homages to other franchises are peppered throughout. It all culminates with a fantastic interdimensional setpiece that puts the marketing behind<em> Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</em> to shame.</p><p>That doesn't even scratch the surface of some of the more unique gameplay moments in <em>Split Fiction</em>. Everyone loves the motorcycle chase scene with the CAPTCHA mini game, but no one talks about when the game turns into pinball or <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> for a minute.</p><p>Few games go in this hard on a crafted two-player co-op experience, and <em>Split Fiction</em> is an easy recommendation for two people to enjoy each other's company over a game.</p><h2>Second Place - Battlefield 6</h2><p>Developer: Battlefield Studios | October 10th, 2025</p><p>Written by Austin Suther</p><p>In late 2021, <em>Battlefield </em>took a bit of a nosedive with the release of <em>Battlefield 2042</em>, which was widely considered one of, if not the worst entries in the series. Following that incident, Respawn developer Vince Zampella (whose legacy cannot be overstated enough) was called in to oversee the <em>Battlefield </em>series. Zampella unfortunately passed late last year, but there is no doubt in my mind he played a pivotal role in turning this series around with <em>Battlefield 6</em>.</p><p>With <em>Battlefield 6</em>, we’re met with a robust multiplayer experience comprising an absolute TON of guns and customizations, giving us some of the weightiest and most visceral combat in the series. Playing on a giant map with dozens of other players, or getting together with your own squad of friends to accomplish objectives, feels like the good ol’ days that made <em>Battlefield </em>such a coveted franchise.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Winner - Peak</h2><p>Developer: Aggro Crab, Landfall | Release Date: June 16th, 2025</p><p>Written by Robert Scarpinito</p><p>The term "friendslop" was coined recently to describe a game like <em>Peak</em>, but it undermines just how great of an experience <em>Peak</em> is. It's silly, challenging, and rewarding. Most games are generally better with friends, but <em>Peak </em>transforms into something that feels like lightning in a bottle.</p><p>Climbing the newly generated mountain every day requires a lot of effort, teamwork, and communication, which all can breed frustration and stress in multiplayer environments. But with its cartoony presentation and lighthearted atmosphere, the vibes stay relaxed.<br>Ingenious items keep the gameplay exciting, where every situation can be answered with the perfect item. The limiting inventory adds just enough tension to keep things engaging, especially with how it forces you to communicate—and opens the door for some mischievous item misuse.</p><p>Even failure is funny in <em>Peak</em>. Nothing beats hearing your friend fall as the spatial audio does its magic. Coming back as a ghost is great too, giving everyone the ability to participate and make color commentary, regardless of skill level.</p><p>For what feels like a silly joke, for what amounts to a "friendslop" game, <em>Peak</em> exemplifies what a perfect casual game night should be. This isn't for the sweaty leaderboard chasers; this is for the silly group of friends who love a good laugh.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
