            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-physical-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The physical version of celebrated action RPG&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>finally has a release date, so mark your calendar if you've been waiting to check this one out on disc.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://x.com/PMStudiosUSA/status/1854901792414241099" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a> by physical game company PM Studios, the physical version of&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>arrives on PS5 on December 12th. Naturally, the PC version's not getting a physical edition; after all, when was the last time your PC had an honest-to-goodness disc drive?</p>

<p>If you're worried that the physical version of the game will just be one of those empty-box-with-no-actual-disc-inside deals, you needn't be. PM Studios <a href="https://x.com/PMStudiosUSA/status/1854909999048458693" rel="noopener" target="_blank">has confirmed</a> that the box will, in fact, contain a proper disc, and not just a code.</p>

You can claim this equipment from the Keeper's Shrine menu.</p>

<p>If&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>'s physical launch is anything like as successful <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-expansion-sales-18m">as the digital version was</a>, then we can likely expect this release to break a couple more sales milestones, which will no doubt make developer GameScience happy.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>, it's an action RPG developed by Chinese studio GameScience and based loosely on the classical novel&nbsp;<em>Journey to the West</em>.</p>

<p>Rather than Wukong himself, you control the Destined One, a distinctly simian warrior whose destiny is to follow in the footsteps of the legendary trickster god. Along the way, you'll meet plenty of colorful characters and visit lots of beautiful locations inspired by classical Chinese mythology.</p>




<p><em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>is a Soulslike, so you can expect tough boss fights and plenty of semi-linear exploration, although the game goes a little easier on the difficulty than the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/elden-ring"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2358720/Black_Myth_Wukong/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/black-myth-wukong/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>. The physical version of the PS5 release is due to arrive on December 12th.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-52-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/genshin-impact-version-5-2-release-date-and-new-content-revealed.1030869/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-52-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has announced the&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.2 release date, as well as what new characters and features you can expect when the update arrives.</p>

<p>Following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-51-release-date">last month's Version 5.1</a>,&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.2 officially arrives on November 20th, alongside the long-awaited Xbox Series X|S version of the game. There's still no word on when - or, at this point, whether - the game will be appearing on Switch, however.</p>

<p>In any case, Version 5.2 will introduce two new Saurians to get to grips with: Qucusaurs and Iktomisaurs. They'll help you to reach new areas, find hidden treasure, and even engage enemies in combat, and they'll be introduced alongside two new Natlan clans, the Flower-Feather Clan and the Masters of the Night Wind.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/genshin-impact-version-5.2-release-date-iktomisaur.jpg?itok=BM4koSco 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/genshin-impact-version-5.2-release-date-iktomisaur.jpg?itok=2_tjJBUa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Adorable new Saurians are waiting for you to discover them when&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.2 arrives later this month.</figcaption></figure><p>As you've probably guessed, this update's two new characters each hail from one of the above clans. Chasca, the Peacemaker of the Flower-Feather Clan, is a five-star Anemo bow user who can "float and attack mid-air".</p>

<p>She's joined by Ororon, a four-star bow user who wields the Electro element. He can deal damage, taunt enemies, and even boost your team's gliding speed, making him invaluable in exploration as well as combat.</p>

<p>Both characters will debut as part of the first half of Version 5.2's Event Wishes, alongside a rerun of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-celebrates-version-40-release-with-lyneys-gameplay-trailer">Lyney</a>. In the second half of the update's cycle, you can expect reruns of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zhongli-conducts-in-lovely-genshin-impact-anime-style-trailer-teasing-upcoming-concert">Zhongli</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-reveals-handsome-new-characters-neuvillette-wriothesley">Neuvillette</a>.</p>

<p>Naturally, you can also look forward to new story quests, a brand new boss to take on, and "an array of quality-of-life updates" to make your&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>gameplay experience smoother.</p>




<p>Don't worry; I haven't forgotten today's codes, either. Here's what you need to input to get some free stuff following today's&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Special Program.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/humankind-developer-amplitude-studios-splits-from-sega-and-goes-indie.1030866/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amplitude-studios-sega-split-indie<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Humankind&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Endless Dungeon&nbsp;</em>developer Amplitude Studios has announced that it's split from Sega and gone independent, with the studio describing the move as a return to its "roots".</p>

<p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1124300/view/4465975096247320950" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on Steam</a>&nbsp;(which can be seen across all of Amplitude's games on the platform), Amplitude says its journey with Sega "has been amazing", but that ownership of the studio has returned "to some of our original founders and members of the team".</p>

<p>According to Amplitude, its parting with Sega happened on "good terms", and the studio remains committed to "working closely with our players", which it says is still very much at the "heart of our philosophy".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/amplitude-studios-sega-split-endless-legend.jpg?itok=q48AdpjT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/amplitude-studios-sega-split-endless-legend.jpg?itok=ZeWbq08T 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Endless Legend&nbsp;</em>developer Amplitude Studios has said goodbye to its former owner Sega.</figcaption></figure><p>In the aforementioned Steam post, Amplitude founder Romain de Waubert de Genlis says the studio currently has two projects in development, describing them as "exciting", although he doesn't elaborate on what they might be.</p>

<p>He also says Amplitude is "backed by strong and meaningful franchises", and that the decision to go independent allows the studio to "be more agile in our approach".</p>

<p>Amplitude Studios was first founded back in 2011, with ex-Ubisoft staffers de Waubert de Genlis and Mathieu Girard setting up the company. The first game released by Amplitude was 2012's&nbsp;<em>Endless Space</em>, which kicked off the&nbsp;<em>Endless&nbsp;</em>series of strategy-focused games.</p>

<p>Said series continued with 2014's turn-based 4X game&nbsp;<em>Endless Legend</em>&nbsp;and tower defense roguelike&nbsp;<em>Dungeon of the Endless</em>, which was released in the same year. Following these releases, Sega snapped up Amplitude in 2016.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/amplitude-studios-sega-split-dungeon-of-the-endless.jpg?itok=WdVRWsbJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/amplitude-studios-sega-split-dungeon-of-the-endless.jpg?itok=h_pO6JOy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Amplitude Studios is working on two new games, although we don't know what they are yet.</figcaption></figure><p>Amplitude's first game under Sega's wing was 2017's&nbsp;<em>Endless Space 2</em>, a followup to the developer's debut game, and that was followed up by an experimental visual novel,&nbsp;<em>Love Thyself - A Horatio Story</em>, which is again set in the&nbsp;<em>Endless&nbsp;</em>universe.</p>

<p>It wouldn't take long for Amplitude to return to strategy development, though, with 2021's&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/humankind">Humankind</a>&nbsp;</em>(not to be confused with&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/ancestors-humankind-odyssey"><em>Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey</em></a>) attempting to rival&nbsp;<em>Civilization&nbsp;</em>in terms of scope and system complexity.</p>

<p>The studio's most recent project is&nbsp;<em>Endless Dungeon</em>, a successor to-come-reimagining of <i>Dungeon of the Endless&nbsp;</i>that features a new 3D art style and plenty of additional mechanics to wrap your brain around.</p>
