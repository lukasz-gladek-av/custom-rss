            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-marine-2-2025-outline-pvp<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>publisher Focus Entertainment has shared what's coming to the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k&nbsp;</em>shooter in 2025, and if you're a fan of the PvP game modes, you'll be pleased with the roadmap.</p>

<p>In a new <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/135-december-community-update" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">December community update</a>, Focus first looks at the last few months for&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>, highlighting things like major updates and the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-player-count-5m" rel="nofollow">rather impressive sales figures</a>.</p>

<p>Following the 2024 recap, Focus then moves onto highlighting what you can expect from next year in&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>, and the first thing on the agenda is more PvP content. The publisher says it knows PvP fans feel "left out", and so next year will bring a new map, custom lobbies, and more.</p>

New Operations and enemies are also on the way for you to tackle.</p>

<p>We also got a look at the next champion making his way to&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>, and it's a Salamander sniper. Focus acknowledges that the Raven Guard Chapter would have been "an obvious choice" for a sniper, but that the studio has "different plans" for the Raven Guard.</p>

<p>More customization options are also coming, alongside a new Datavault option on the Battle Barge. It'll allow you to read "unlockable information on most elements from the game", in case you want to brush up on your&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>lore.</p>




<p>In case you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>, it's a third-person shooter set in the grim darkness of the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k&nbsp;</em>universe.</p>

<p>The game sees protagonist Demetrian Titus returning from the first game. Having spent time with the Deathwatch in order to prove himself free of heresy, Titus is re-inducted into the Ultramarines and tasked with eradicating a Tyrannid infestation on the planet Kadaku.</p>

<p>Like its predecessor,&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>emphasizes both close-quarters combat and ranged weaponry, and it's also got a renewed focus on co-op play. Fittingly enough, its credits also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-credits-totalbiscuit" rel="nofollow">feature a rather touching tribute</a> to a man who championed the original title.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/root-review-woodland-warfare<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Having recently covered Leder Games' brand new tabletop title, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/arcs-review-fun-unbridled-space-chaos" rel="nofollow"><em>Arcs</em></a>, and loved it, I wanted to go back and try out another of their games that I had heard great things about but had never covered on the site. So in this article, which is somewhat of a retro review (if you can consider 2018 retro), but still an extremely relevant title, we're stepping away from the space theme of <em>Arcs</em>, and moving into woodland combat with the creatures that dwell there, in our <em>Root</em> review.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, we've also reviewed Leder Games' <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/arcs-review-fun-unbridled-space-chaos" rel="nofollow"><em>Arcs</em></a>, and its <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/arcs-expansions-review-blighted-reach-and-leaders-and-lore" rel="nofollow">expansions</a>, which add an entirely different dynamic to what is already an incredibly interesting game.</p>

<p><em>Root</em> has a very interesting concept, and as a long-term player of the <em>Legend of the 5 Rings</em> card game, one I'm very familiar with, in that every player is almost playing a different game. Root has a set of core mechanics for movement and combat, and you all play on the same map, but each of the games' 4 playable factions has different goals and ways of playing, which we'll discuss below in the Factions section.</p>

<p>The game itself follows 3 phases, birdsong, daylight, and evening, with the actions available to each player listed on their faction boards. The most common available actions are moving, recruiting warriors, and battling. When you battle, the player whose turn it is picks a clearing on the map where they have warriors and rolls 2 dice. The higher number rolled is the number of hits the attacker does, and the lower number is the amount your opponent does, but you can't deal more hits than you have warriors in that area.</p>

<p>The dice used are custom dice, with 12 sides, but with only the numbers 0 to 3. This means that although you're controlling the battle and do have an advantage that you get the higher dice, it's still likely that you could roll the same number on both dice. The control comes from picking battles where your opponent will be limited on the damage they can do back with the number of troops they have.</p>

<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/root-6.jpg?itok=qbExEvsL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/root-6.jpg?itok=_7WgyKPE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The core <em>Root</em> game has 4 factions, each with their own faction board and unique way of playing.</figcaption></figure><h2>Does Root Have Different Factions?</h2>

<p><i>Root </i>has 4 different factions in the core box, each with its own unique style of play.</p>

<ul><li>Marquise de Cat - The Cat is the most straightforward faction to play, building and attacking in a show of might. They have a keep that protects the clearing it is placed in and can discard cards from their hand&nbsp;to return defeated warriors to their keep.</li>
	<li>Eyrie Dynasties - The birds are slightly more complicated than the cat. Each turn they place a card in an area known as The Decree, which has spaces for Recruit, Move, Battle, and Build. For each card that is placed there, you must complete an action in a clearing matching the suit of that card. This means that with each turn, the birds get an increasing number of actions. If at any point they can't complete an action, they fall into Turmoil, which loses them victory points, resets the degree board, and gives them a new leader, where they start building up cards again. It takes some planning, and your opponents are always working against you to block your decree.</li>
	<li>Woodland Alliance - This band of resistance fighting rebels are my favorite to play, they take a guerrilla war to the Marquise and Dynasties. Each turn they gain supporter cards which they&nbsp;can&nbsp;spend to spread sympathy tokens to clearings, which they can then cause revolts in. If an opposing player moves into a clearing with a sympathy token or removes one, they have to give you a card from their hand which goes into your supporters pool.</li>
	<li>Vagabond - The Vagabond is the most unique, in that the player controls a single game piece, which moves around, completing quests, and gaining victory points for improving relationships with the other factions or removing pieces from those hostile to them. The Vagabond is the most fun in a 4-player game, any less, and they tend not to be able to do many of their tricks, especially in 2-player games where your opponent is actively working against you.</li>
</ul><figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/root-3.jpg?itok=dTio9LUg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/root-3.jpg?itok=ZRejsqFU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The core gameplay of <em>Root</em> uses cards to build and craft, with the card suits matching clearing areas on the map.</figcaption></figure><h2>How Long Does It Take To Learn To Play Root?</h2>

<p>The core <em>Root</em> box comes with 3 rulebooks, the first is a straightforward walkthrough of the start of a game, for players who learn by doing, then there's a quick-start guide to get the core rules across and get you playing, and finally, there's a full rules reference, that also includes sections on some of the <em>Root </em>expansions. To learn the core mechanics, whichever way you choose to learn, is pretty quick, and not particularly complicated. What takes time, is learning the different factions, and it's not a simple matter of just learning yours, it's about learning the factions you will be playing against, especially as the Alliance and Vagabond.</p>

<p>The learning curve for <em>Root</em> then becomes about playing multiple games with each faction, and with varying player numbers with different factions in use to learn how best to use them. Most players aren't going to want to main the same tabletop board game to gain that experience While it can be played casually, you'll find that the player with the most experience has a huge advantage over the other players.</p>

<p><em>Root </em>is at its best with 4 experienced players. It's a lot of fun learning the game to get to that point, but then it really shines when 4 players who know what it's about take to the woodland to battle it out.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/root-5.jpg?itok=O96tzaIM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/root-5.jpg?itok=eaGE63I4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Combat in <em>Root</em> requires rolling 2 dice, with the higher dice being hits dealt, and the lower hits recieved, with both rolls capped by how many warriors are in the clearing.</figcaption></figure><h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On Root?</h2>

<p><i>Root </i>is a truly incredible game, but most players won't want the time buy-in required to get to the point where it's at its peak. It's fun learning the different factions, and it can create some truly memorable moments with very satisfying experiences. But to get there you will need 4 players who've played 2 or 3 games with each faction. At lower player counts, it's fun experimenting with the different faction game combinations, but you can really feel the difference at 4 players.</p>

<h2>Should I Buy Root?</h2>

<p>Don't be fooled by the cutesy artwork <em>Root</em> uses, there's a fairly deep strategic game hidden behind the theme, and it becomes apparent when you first play. It does require some buy-in time-wise to get into the strategy (even though the rules are quick to learn), so might not suit a group who just want a quick pick-up-play game as it's at its best with 4 experienced players who don't mind playing with different styles, rather than an asymmetric strategy game.</p>
