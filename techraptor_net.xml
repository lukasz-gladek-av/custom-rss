            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-chronicle-update-june<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Kinetic Games has revealed the release date for the next major&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>update, which will bring a rework to the evidence system and more next month.</p>

<p>Arriving on June 24th, the Chronicle update will introduce "a total overhaul of evidence collection", according to Kinetic, along with three new evidence types, a redesign for the journal, and a new UI for the main menu.</p>

<p>One of the new evidence types, Sound, will require you to use the brand new Sound Recorder device to capture subtle audio cues in your environment. Each tier allows you to detect "deeper layers of audio", with ghost events, Spirit Box responses, and paranormal sounds all available to be recorded.</p>

The "Photos" tab is being replaced by one titled "Media", which will house your proof, including photos and videos you've taken, as well as the new Sound category.</p>

<p>If you want to complete an investigation, you'll have to fill your journal with different types of evidence, and you can look forward to "new paranormal moments to capture", including EMF spikes and "fleeting glimpses of otherworldly forms".</p>

<p><em>Phasmophobia</em>'s Chronicle update also brings an overhaul to the way evidence works; the first instance of each media type captured will be marked as "Unique", while subsequent captures will be marked as "Duplicates", and smaller rewards will be given for those.</p>

<p>Other changes in Chronicle include a reworked leveling and progression system (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-ascension-update-release-date" rel="nofollow">yes, another one</a>), as well as a new main menu UI that should make navigating&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia</em>'s options easier.</p>

<p><em>Phasmophobia</em>'s Chronicle update lands on June 24th.

            <title><![CDATA[Atomfall Wicked Isle DLC Brings New Area and More Next Week]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atomfall-wicked-isle-dlc-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/atomfall-wicked-isle-dlc-brings-new-area-and-more-next-week.1201566/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atomfall-wicked-isle-dlc-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rebellion has announced that the first major piece of story DLC for&nbsp;<em>Atomfall</em>,&nbsp;<em>Wicked Isle</em>, will be launching next week. It'll be purchasable separately if you don't own the Deluxe Edition, but if you do, you'll already have access to it.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Wicked Isle&nbsp;</em>launches on June 3rd. It'll add&nbsp;a new location to&nbsp;<em>Atomfall&nbsp;</em>in the form of Midsummer Island, and while you're there, you'll also uncover new weapons, new leads, and even new endings.</p>

<p>As you've probably already surmised,&nbsp;<em>Wicked Isle&nbsp;</em>is built heavily around&nbsp;<em>Atomfall</em>'s folk horror elements; if you haven't played the main game yet, I won't spoil, but suffice it to say you're not just dealing with bandits and trigger-happy military types.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/atomfall-wicked-isle-dlc-release-date.jpg?itok=pWwwjFPe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/atomfall-wicked-isle-dlc-release-date.jpg?itok=8pakGODG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Atomfall</em>'s Wicked Isle DLC is coming next week.</figcaption></figure><p>Head of design Ben Fisher says that because Midsummer is closer to the Windscale plant than the rest of&nbsp;<em>Atomfall</em>'s world, "the levels of infection in both the people and the environment are higher than on the mainland".</p>

<p>As such, you'll be encountering new enemy factions, some of which may be too infected to reason with. A new pirate bandit faction will also be present on Midsummer, and it'll be up to you how you deal with them.</p>

<p>New weapons include a blunderbuss, a new bow, and "the Beekeeper's Staff", which feels to me like a not-so-subtle reference to Nic Cage's terrible 2006 remake of the British folk horror classic&nbsp;<em>The Wicker Man</em>.</p>

<p>Not only that, but new skills will also be available, and you'll be able to use your new upgraded metal detector to help you find loot caches with even more useful stuff in them. In short, if you love&nbsp;<em>Atomfall</em>, you'll probably love this as well.</p>




<p>Released <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atomfall-release-date" rel="nofollow">back in March</a>,&nbsp;<em>Atomfall&nbsp;</em>proved popular at launch, reaching <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atomfall-player-count-1m-stats" rel="nofollow">a million players by its first weekend</a> (having been released on the Game Pass service on day one).</p>

<p>You can check the game out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/801800/Atomfall/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/atomfall/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/atomfall/9NC4WDL5KZBL" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.&nbsp;<em>Wicked Isle&nbsp;</em>will be launching across all three platforms on June 3rd.
