            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Postmark Games has launched a new Kickstarter campaign. The small indie studio, known for small print-at-home tabletop games, has launched the campaign for <em>52 Duels</em>, a card combat game that uses a standard deck of playing cards.</p>

<h2>The <em>52 Duels</em> Kickstarter Campaign</h2>

<p>According to the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/postmarkgames/52-duels-a-fight-with-playing-cards-for-1-or-2-players/description" rel="nofollow">campaign page</a>, <em>52 Duels</em> is a two-player competitive dueling game. Each player picks one of several heroes. From there, you take turns launching attacks, blocking damage, using items, and levelling up your hero's unique skills. If you can bring your opponent's deck down to nothing, you win.</p>

The game's rules are tracked on a single sheet of paper. No cutting or assembly required. And all you need to play are two standard 52-card poker decks.</p>

<p>This economical approach is consistent with Postmark Games' body of work. <em>52 Duels</em> is clearly connected to their last project, <em>52 Realms</em>, which brings the thrill of an OSR-esque dungeon crawl with just a deck of cards, as well as printable microgames like <em>Aquamarine</em>, <em>Voyages</em>, and <em>Waypoints</em>.</p>

<p>There is only one pledge level available for the <em>52 Duels</em> Kickstarter. For just $7, you get PDFs and PNGs of the game's rules and four playable heroes, in both color and low-ink versions, in A4 and Letter formats. In addition, the game will receive long-term support from the developers, including new playable heroes, which will be added to your pledge at no additional cost.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, the <em>52 Duels</em> Kickstarter campaign has been a great success. It has raised&nbsp;<span><span>$5,916, which is more than four times its initial funding goal of $1,321. The campaign ends on December 14.</span></span></p>
