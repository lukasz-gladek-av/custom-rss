            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gears-of-war-reloaded-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft has announced&nbsp;<em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em>, a remastered version of the seminal 2006 third-person shooter, and it marks the third-person shooter series' debut on PS5.</p>

<p>Per an Xbox <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/05/gears-of-war-reloaded-release-date/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>,&nbsp;<em>Gears of War: Reloaded&nbsp;</em>lands on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5 on August 26th. It's a "faithfully remastered and natively optimized" version of the original&nbsp;<em>Gears of War</em>, which is to say it's essentially a new version of 2015's&nbsp;<em>Gears of War: Ultimate Edition</em>.</p>

<p>You can expect all the usual current-gen bells and whistles: 120fps and 4K support, cross-play and cross-progression, and all of the original game's DLC, including the bonus Campaign act and "a full roster of classic characters and cosmetics unlockable through progression".</p>

<p>It'll support two-player campaign co-op play, as well as up to eight players in multiplayer modes, all of which can be enjoyed across different platforms. Signing into a Microsoft account also allows you to enjoy cross-progression, so you can pick up where you left off on any platform.</p>

<p>Thanks to the Xbox Series X|S and PS5's SSDs, you can also enjoy a campaign with "zero loading screens", according to Microsoft, as well as a host of visual improvements like enhanced post-processing and better shadows.</p>

<p>If you already bought&nbsp;<em>Gears of War: Ultimate Edition</em>, don't worry; you'll be getting this one as a free upgrade, although you can't rush out and buy the game now, because that only applies to purchases made before 4pm UTC today (which is about twenty minutes ago at time of writing).</p>

It'll cost you $40, unless you already own&nbsp;<em>Ultimate Edition</em>, but it'll also be on PC Game Pass and Game Pass Ultimate on day one.</p>
