            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crowbar-collective-rogue-point<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Black Mesa&nbsp;</em>developer Crowbar Collective has announced&nbsp;<em>Rogue Point</em>, a co-operative multiplayer roguelite shooter that the studio says will offer "hundreds of ways to play". It'll be published by British veteran studio Team17.</p>

<p>According to a press release,&nbsp;<em>Rogue Point&nbsp;</em>takes place in a world where the mysteriously-named "CEO", the richest man in the game's world, has died. Using an app called MERX, corporations are attempting to carve up his empire by hiring mercenary teams to fight one another.</p>

<p>Contrary to what you might believe, it doesn't seem like you're playing as one of these armies. Rather, you'll play as members of the titular Rogue Point, an "elite, independent vigilante squad" aiming to put an end to MERX and save the day.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rogue-point-crowbar-collective-shootout.jpg?itok=hnXDYDkR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rogue-point-crowbar-collective-shootout.jpg?itok=pRQ6C-RW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Rogue Point&nbsp;</em>pits you against armies of merciless mercenaries.</figcaption></figure><p>Along with up to three friends, you'll take part in what Crowbar Collective and Team17 call "challenging missions", making your way through a campaign in which "no two playthroughs are alike", which is, of course, the standard roguelite boast.</p>

<p>As you play, you'll unlock gameplay modifiers and gear that will help you create "loadouts specific to the needs of the mission", and you'll also come up against MERX classes which will "challenge you in new and surprising ways".</p>

<p>The two studios are also talking up what they call the "Parametric Design System", which they say contributes to "new strategies and challenges with every play" across four "diverse" locations.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Rogue Point</em>, which shows off some of the tactical gameplay you can expect from the co-op shooter, right here.</p>




<p><em>Rogue Point&nbsp;</em>will serve as developer Crowbar Collective's second game, following on from&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/black-mesa" rel="nofollow"><em>Half-Life&nbsp;</em>remake&nbsp;<em>Black Mesa</em></a>, which was finally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-mesa-release-date-finally-set-for-march-2020" rel="nofollow">released back in 2020</a> after enjoying a rather <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-mesa-finally-adds-xen-levels-roadmap-to-10" rel="nofollow">protracted development cycle</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, unlike&nbsp;<em>Black Mesa</em>,&nbsp;<em>Rogue Point&nbsp;</em>isn't a remake, so it'll be interesting to see how Crowbar Collective handles its first original IP. There's no release date yet, but&nbsp;<em>Rogue Point&nbsp;</em>is set to arrive on PC via Steam when it does launch.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stellar-blade-nier-automata-crossover-and-photo-mode-coming-next-week.1032615/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-nier-automata-crossover<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and Shift Up have announced the release date for the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade Nier: Automata&nbsp;</em>crossover, as well as when you can expect the former's photo mode to arrive.</p>

<p>Both the crossover and the photo mode will be added to&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>in an update on November 20th, and they'll both be completely free as well, so you won't have to pay to let Eve cosplay as everyone's favorite blindfolded android.</p>

<p>According to Shift Up CTO Dong Ki Lee,&nbsp;<em>Nier: Automata&nbsp;</em>"significantly inspired&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade</em>", and the collaboration between&nbsp;the latter's director Kim Hyung Tae and the former's Yoko Taro was "marked by mutual respect and creativity".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stellar-blade-nier-automata-crossover-costumes.jpg?itok=QXY2pXv6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stellar-blade-nier-automata-crossover-costumes.jpg?itok=dBMWsizy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Stellar Blade</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Nier: Automata&nbsp;</em>crossover will arrive next week.</figcaption></figure><p>The crossover will introduce a host of costumes for&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>based on&nbsp;<em>Nier: Automata&nbsp;</em>characters like 2B and A2, as well as&nbsp;<em>Nier&nbsp;</em>stalwart Emil, who will be the proprietor of a shop from which you can buy "eleven different collaboration-special items".</p>

<p>It's not just the&nbsp;<em>Nier: Automata&nbsp;</em>crossover, either. This update is also adding a photo mode to&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade</em>, allowing you to pause the action and take photos of the game's characters, landscapes, and more.</p>

<p>The photo mode will, of course, come complete with lots of different filters and options, so even if you don't quite have that perfect shot lined up, you should be able to get what you need by tweaking a few menu toggles here and there.</p>




<p>This update will also introduce various quality-of-life improvements and gameplay tweaks to&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade</em>, including new character customization options for Eve, new battle features, and more. You can see a list of what's new <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/11/stellar-blades-nier-automata-dlc-photo-mode-launch-nov-20/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">via the PlayStation Blog</a>.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade</em>, it's an action game created by&nbsp;<em>Goddess of Victory: Nikke&nbsp;</em>developer Shift Up, although unlike that game,&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-sony-publishing-deal" rel="nofollow">a console exclusive</a> and not a mobile gacha RPG.</p>

<p>You play as Eve, a survivor of an apocalyptic war against aliens known as the Naytibas, and you must reclaim Earth from its new alien occupiers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The game proved popular among players, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-sales-one-million" rel="nofollow">selling a million copies</a>&nbsp;just a few months after its launch, although the much-talked-about PC port remains unannounced at time of writing.</p>

<p>You can pick up&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/stellar-blade/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[Dark Minimalist RPG Songs of Rats Revealed for Next Year]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/songs-of-rats-dark-indie-rpg</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dark-minimalist-rpg-songs-of-rats-revealed-for-next-year.1032573/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/songs-of-rats-dark-indie-rpg<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Salient Games and publisher Tesseract Studios have announced&nbsp;<em>Songs of Rats</em>, an "indie dark role-playing game inspired by choose-your-own-adventure books". It's coming to PC sometime early next year.</p>

<p><em>Songs of Rats&nbsp;</em>takes place in a cluster of broken-down spaceships and space stations "crushed and combined into one massive structure" known as the Wreckage. Bizarrely, due to "advanced self-repair technology", the Wreckage has become a haven for its inhabitants.</p>

<p>You must venture into the darkest, deepest corners of this "dangerous yet livable labyrinth" in order to uncover "the dark secrets of fallen civilizations", together with a team of fellow explorers that will help you to navigate the Wreckage's many dangers.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/songs-of-rats-announced-mutants-battle.jpg?itok=rtgbYN2L 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/songs-of-rats-announced-mutants-battle.jpg?itok=MWG2kHli 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Songs of Rats&nbsp;</em>has a deliberately lo-fi, grainy aesthetic.</figcaption></figure><p>As a roguelike,&nbsp;<em>Songs of Rats&nbsp;</em>will feature an ever-changing world, along with a range of "strange, human and inhuman enemies" with which to do battle. It wouldn't be much of an eldritch superstructure without them, after all.</p>

<p>Exploring will not just get you combat encounters with horrors; it'll also net you bonuses that you can use to upgrade your character, making you better-equipped to survive the dangers of the Wreckage.</p>

<p>Largely speaking,&nbsp;<em>Songs of Rats&nbsp;</em>tells its story through text and evocative lo-fi images rather than hoity-toity fully-3D graphics, so if you've got any degree of nostalgia for the old days of RPGs, then this one will likely serve you well.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Songs of Rats&nbsp;</em>right here. It gives a good sense of the strange, chilly sci-fi aesthetic the game is going for.</p>




<p>Aesthetically,&nbsp;<em>Songs of Rats&nbsp;</em>shares a fair amount in common with 2022's <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/norco" rel="nofollow">retro-style adventure game&nbsp;<em>Norco</em></a>, although it's perhaps a little closer to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/classic-gold-box-rpgs-to-hit-steam-later-this-month" rel="nofollow">old-school dungeon-crawlers</a> like&nbsp;<em>Eye of the Beholder&nbsp;</em>on the gameplay front.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Songs of Rats&nbsp;</em>launches on PC via Steam sometime in the first quarter of 2025. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3300470/Songs_of_Rats/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wishlist it here if you like</a>.</p>
