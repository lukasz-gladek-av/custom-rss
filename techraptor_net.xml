Tabletop studio Maestro Media and developer Supercell have announced <em>Clash of Clans: The Epic Raid</em>, which will bring the comedic tactics game to gaming tables via a Kickstarter campaign this Summer.</p>

<h2><em>Clash of Clans: The Epic Raid</em> is Coming to Kickstarter</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, <em>Clash of Clans: The Epic Raid</em> will adapt the 2012 mobile game enjoyed by millions into a rewarding strategic tactics board game. Players will build bases, deploy troops, and raid opponents in fast-paced battles designed to capture the excitement of the source material.</p>

The game will include miniatures of different <em>Clash of Clans</em> units and outposts. The map will be composed of hexagonal tiles. There is even some resource management elements used for building defenses and recruiting new units.</p>

<p>The lead designers of <em>Clash of Clans: The Epic Raid</em> are Eric M. Lang and Ken Gruhl. Lang is an award-winning board game designer who has a history of adapting beloved video game properties to the tabletop format. His work includes <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bloodborne-board-game-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Bloodborne: The Board Game</em></a>, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/mass-effect-board-game-review-back-to-reaper-war" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Mass Effect </em>board game</a> that was the source of bad-faith <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/mass-effect-board-game-designer-harrassed-over-culture-war-review-bombing" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">culture war controversy</a>, and <em>Ankh: Gods of Egypt.</em></p>

<p>Gruhl's design history is also impressive. His work includes the compact, co-op citybuilding game 60-Second City, and the quirky card game <em>Happy Salmon</em> published by Exploding Kittens.</p>

It was the first in a shifting design model for mobile games in 2010s with its free-to-play model. A now ubiquitous model where players can install the game for free, but could speed up more tedious areas of play with premium currency bought with real-world money.</p>

<p><em>Clash of Clans: The Epic Raid</em> will be going live on Kickstarter June 17. If you are an early backer, you will receive a special Golden Barbarian King miniature at no additional charge.</p>
