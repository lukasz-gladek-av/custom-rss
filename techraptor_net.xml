            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Riot Games has announced the Early Access release date for&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>fighter&nbsp;<em>2XKO</em>, and if you want to check the game out, you'll be able to do so very shortly indeed.</p>

<p>As part of a new video detailing what's going on with the game,&nbsp;<em>2XKO&nbsp;</em>executive producer Tom Cannon revealed that the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/league-of-legends-fighting-game-officially-named-2xko-as-spectacular-new-gameplay-is" rel="nofollow">free-to-play two-on-two fighter</a> will launch on PC via Early Access on October 7th.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there's no word yet on when you can expect the game to land on consoles, although it is due to launch on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S as well as PC. We'll have to wait a little longer to find out when console players can curb stomp Yasuo to their hearts' content.</p>

<p>Each season will bring a new champion, and that includes Season 0, so there's still one more character to be announced for the game; Riot says you should keep an eye out for the trailer and dev update revealing that champ "soon".</p>

<p>When&nbsp;<em>2XKO&nbsp;</em>launches in October, it will bring with it "a full season of content", including combo trials for each character to help you get to grips with their movesets.</p>

<p>Throughout the Early Access period, Riot says it will be introducing features like a battle pass and a ranked play system, as well as "balance tuning", which, if I know the&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>community, will be heavily requested from day one.</p>




<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>2XKO&nbsp;</em>when it launches on PC via Early Access on October 7th. There's no word yet on PS5 or Xbox Series X|S release dates, so stay tuned for more on this and all other things&nbsp;Riot Games.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nioh-3-release-date-seemingly-leaked-via-japanese-amazon-listing.1306968/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The&nbsp;<em>Nioh 3&nbsp;</em>release date may have leaked ahead of a potential spot in today's PlayStation State of Play showcase, if two listings on Amazon Japan are to be believed.</p>

<p>While the listings have been removed, they weren't taken down quickly enough to avoid being spotted by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/nioh-3-launches-february-6-2026" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gematsu</a>, and they appear to point to a release date of February 6th for the upcoming Soulslike action RPG.</p>

<p>Listings for both the standard edition and the Treasure Box edition of&nbsp;<em>Nioh 3&nbsp;</em>were spotted on Amazon Japan, and both of them bear the same release date.&nbsp;<em>Nioh 3&nbsp;</em>is currently slated for an early 2026 launch, so while these dates might be placeholders, they feel a little too specific for that.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nioh-3-release-date-amazon-japan-leak-boss.jpg?itok=vPhbEpQk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nioh-3-release-date-amazon-japan-leak-boss.jpg?itok=yk4uJj15 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It looks like&nbsp;<em>Nioh 3&nbsp;</em>is launching this February.</figcaption></figure><p>In case you're interested,&nbsp;<em>Nioh 3</em>'s Treasure Box edition will apparently include goodies like an art book, a soundtrack CD, and a furry key chain (that's a key chain with fur on it, rather than the alternative).</p>

<p>While it hasn't been confirmed that&nbsp;<em>Nioh 3&nbsp;</em>will feature during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-state-of-play-september-2025-confirmed" rel="nofollow">today's State of Play show</a>, the game is currently a PlayStation 5 console exclusive, and Amazon Japan listings appearing now (and then being removed) seems to suggest that they were supposed to go live following an announcement.</p>

<p>It's possible that&nbsp;<em>Nioh 3</em>'s release date will instead be announced during tomorrow's Koei Tecmo Tokyo Game Show program, which will be dedicated to&nbsp;<em>Nioh 3</em>, although a release date reveal during State of Play followed by a TGS gameplay deep dive seems more likely to me.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Nioh 3&nbsp;</em>is, well, it's the third game in Koei Tecmo and Team Ninja's&nbsp;<em>Nioh&nbsp;</em>series, which marries fast-paced hack-and-slash gameplay with Soulslike exploration and boss battles.</p>




<p><em>Nioh 3&nbsp;</em>is set for release sometime early next year (and probably on February 6th) for PC and PlayStation 5. Stay tuned for more on this.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/genshin-impact-to-honkai-nexus-anima-can-hoyo-fans-keep-up</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/from-genshin-impact-to-honkai-nexus-anima-can-hoyo-fans-keep-up.1306965/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As <em>Genshin Impact</em>'s fifth anniversary draws near, it's clear that HoYoverse has big plans in store for their most prolific game. <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-luna-i" rel="nofollow">The Song of the Welkin Moon arc has only just begun with the Luna I update</a>, but it's a strong indicator of where the developers plan to take <em>Genshin </em>in the coming years.</p>

<p>Surface-level improvements include more expressive character animations, more visually distinct playable areas and NPCs within the same region, and being able to interact with playable characters in the open world via the Anecdotes system.</p>

<p>Chances are that there are behind-the-scenes upgrades too as new characters are starting to get their own unique elemental sub-reactions, bosses are getting more complicated mechanics, and there's even going to be a brand new game mode called "Miliastra Wonderland" where players can create custom game modes and maps for others to enjoy.</p>

<p>Given that <em>Genshin's</em> Luna I update comes with the caveat of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-ps4-support-ending" rel="nofollow">ceasing operations for the PS4 version of the game</a>, it wouldn't be too much of a stretch to claim that it is also&nbsp;a modernization package in disguise. While the limitations of mobile hardware will likely prevent the developers from going too crazy, this does suggest that HoYoverse wants Genshin to be their "big tent" game with a bit of something for everyone.&nbsp;</p>




<h2><em>Genshin Impact</em>&nbsp;| The Only One Who Can Kill Me is Me</h2>

<p>Ironically, the biggest speed bump in <em>Genshin Impact's</em> new era is going to be HoYoverse itself. Currently, HoYoverse is running five different live-service games at once. When <a href="https://hna.hoyoverse.com/en-us" rel="nofollow"><em>Honkai: Nexus Anima</em></a> releases in the future, there are going to be six concurrently running live-service games that will likely have a significant amount of audience overlap.</p>

<p>Most of the promotional material for <em>Nexus Anima</em> shows that it's going to bring together characters from all of HoYoverse's IPs. The obvious problem is that with six different games running at once, fans are going to have to start rationing their time more aggressively.</p>

<p>Of course, no one is forcing anyone to play all six games at once. If we are limiting the discussion to <em>Genshin Impact</em>, <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/en-us/" rel="nofollow"><em>Honkai: Star Rail</em></a>, and <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/en-us/main" rel="nofollow"><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em></a>, one can feasibly play all three without much trouble. That's (presumably) not an entirely realistic picture of the games' audience though. Chances are that most people are playing other games at the same time.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/genshin-impact-talent-mat-domain.jpg?itok=PNkuGSed 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/genshin-impact-talent-mat-domain.jpg?itok=ElMoOmDI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Guess everyone will have to wait until Sunday for their materials.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Genshin Impact |&nbsp;</em>Farming Isn't Much, But It's Honest Work&nbsp;</h2>

<p>HoYoverse would probably love it if people took breaks from games developed by other studios, but that seems unlikely. Even with the Luna I update, <em>Genshin </em>retains some odd mechanics that other HoYoverse games have seemingly abandoned. The most annoying example would probably be how the developers insist on locking character and weapon upgrade materials to certain days of the week.</p>

<p>Smaller, otherwise inconsequential annoyances build up over time as well. <em>Genshin </em>still lacks a stamina overflow mechanic. You have to manually convert resin to Condensed Resin, albeit at better rates with the Luna I update. You can't directly upgrade lower tier materials into higher tier materials from the character screen. There's no way to downgrade higher tier materials either.</p>

<p>There's also the fact that you have to manually collect character level-up materials, another practice that has been minimized with HoYoverse's subsequent games. Granted, this is more of a quirk of open-world games more than a fault of <em>Genshin </em>itself, yet all signs point to <em>Honkai: Nexus Anima</em> having its own open-world portion to some degree.</p>

<p>If <em>Honkai: Nexus Anima</em> is swooping in with its own open world with potentially improved comparable features, then <em>Genshin's</em> main selling point might start to look like an inconvenience. People will still play <em>Genshin </em>for the story or the user-generated content, but if building characters becomes a hassle, then they might not really bother with farming enemies and collecting random flowers.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/genshin-impact-nod-krai-fatui-boss_0.jpg?itok=s7-UmxTq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/genshin-impact-nod-krai-fatui-boss_0.jpg?itok=aljE2gpz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>At least you can brute force his shields... for now.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Genshin Impact |&nbsp;</em>HP Inflation? In This Economy? It's More Likely Than You Think</h2>

<p>If people aren't putting in the effort to build characters, then that would imply that they don't really need to play the endgame modes to completion, and if they're not playing the endgame modes, then there's less of a need to pull characters. Pulling characters for their open world mobility is an option, although whether this represents a sizable portion of the audience is anyone's guess.</p>

<p>Something has to make way eventually. <em>Honkai: Star Rail's</em> combat can be entirely automated. <em>Zenless Zone Zero's </em>non-endgame activities let you spend an entire day's worth of stamina in literal seconds. You could build up endgame-ready characters almost passively in both games and then focus on the story or events. <em>Genshin </em>has no such luxury, and it's starting to become quite noticeable now thanks to both Imaginarium Theater and the Luna I era of boss mechanics.</p>

<p>It's not as if HoYoverse is allergic to porting mechanics from one game to another. The ability to build your own Artifact didn't originate from <em>Genshin</em>, and <em>Genshin's </em>improvements to the mechanic has made its way to other HoYoverse games to some degree. The same goes for the in-game character guides and the Anecdotes feature.</p>

<p>Alternatively, HoYoverse may be counting on<em> Honkai: Nexus Anima</em> to pressure <em>Genshin's</em> player base to spend more. If there's less time to play, then people might be willing to part with some money to bypass the more tedious activities so that they can concentrate on story and endgame activities. The mechanism already exists in the game, people just have to be desperate enough to spend.</p>




<h2><em>Genshin Impact |&nbsp;</em>Hold Up, Let HoYo Cook</h2>

<p>None of this precludes the existence of a middle ground. <em>Honkai: Nexus Anima</em> may have open world elements, but its core gameplay loop appears to revolve around minigames and autochess. Neither particularly encroaches upon <em>Genshin's&nbsp;</em>territory, and it's hard to imagine a scenario where autochess requires any huge commitment of time or attention.</p>

<p>Furthermore, as we've seen with the release of&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> and <em>Zenless Zone Zero</em>, people can just bounce around and take breaks whenever there's a relative lull in content. You might miss out on some premium currency or an event here and there, but if you're planning to play these games over the course of years then it's almost irrelevant.</p>

<p>Regardless, HoYoverse might want to consider ironing out some of <em>Genshin Impact's</em> more annoying quirks to keep people happy in the long run. The Luna I update is certainly a step in the right direction, offering both meaningful content and mechanics that can be used to reduce the tedium of farming (albeit only in the current event).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The real test would be when&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Nexus Anima</em>&nbsp;releases. Will people stay with <em>Genshin Impact</em> in spite of its somewhat archaic approach to character building, among other annoyances, or will&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Nexus Anima&nbsp;</em>be a good enough open-world replacement? Or will both games be able to coexist? Even if players can manage with an additional game, what about the next game, or the one after that? Only time will tell.</p>
