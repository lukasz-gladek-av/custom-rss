            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-2-console-summer-roadmap<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>11 bit studios has announced that the&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>console ports will be arriving in summer, and that you can look forward to a major free update for the game in just a couple of months.</p>

<p>Back in November, 11 bit <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-2-roadmap" rel="nofollow">shared the first</a>&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>roadmap, which promised a free update, console ports, and the game's first major DLC sometime this year. Now, the studio has released a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1601580/view/498314610455086104" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">revised roadmap</a> that gets much more specific.</p>

<p>First up, a major update is coming on May 8th. 11 bit simply says this update will "adjust the City's management, paying homage to the order established by the first New Londoners". How mysterious!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/frostpunk-2-console-summer-roadmap-updated.jpg?itok=jlHnQTFn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/frostpunk-2-console-summer-roadmap-updated.jpg?itok=P0dX5UaI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Frostpunk 2</em>'s console ports are officially coming in summer.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as the major new update and the console port release timing, 11 bit studios also announced a broad release window for&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2</em>'s first DLC&nbsp;<em>Spectrum</em>. It's launching in fall, apparently.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, both the&nbsp;<em>Aurora&nbsp;</em>DLC and&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2</em>'s as-yet-unnamed third major expansion still don't have release windows more specific than this year and next, respectively, but at least we know roughly when the first one's coming.</p>

<p>When&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>does arrive on consoles, it'll be coming to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. You won't be getting any last-gen ports of the game, unfortunately, so PS4, Xbox One, and Switch owners are out in the cold (or not, as the case may be).</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2</em>, it's the followup to 11 bit studios' 2018 city-building survival sim&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk</em>. Like its predecessor,&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>tasks you with building a city and tending to its citizens' needs amidst a harsh, everlasting winter.</p>




<p>Released in September, the game took <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-2-profitable-sales-350k" rel="nofollow">just a few days to become profitable</a> for 11 bit studios, so it's no wonder console ports and DLC are proceeding apace.</p>

<p>However, things aren't quite as rosy elsewhere in 11 bit land; back in December, the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/11-bit-studios-layoffs-project-8" rel="nofollow">canceled its console-focused game&nbsp;<em>Project 8</em></a>, while ambitious-looking upcoming sci-fi adventure&nbsp;<em>The Alters&nbsp;</em>has been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-alters-delayed-again-2025" rel="nofollow">delayed to a nebulous point in 2025</a>.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1601580/Frostpunk_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, and PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S versions of the game are due to arrive in summer.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-pocketpair-monster-hunter-wilds-day-off<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>developer Pocketpair has announced that it's giving most of its staff the day off on Friday, and while a concrete reason isn't stated, it's almost certainly because that's the day on which&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>comes out.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/palworld-developer-pocketpair-gives-employees-special-holiday-that-just-so-happens-to-coincide-with-monster-hunter-wilds-release/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Automaton Media</a>, a notice on the Japanese Pocketpair X account states that the studio's bosses have been receiving "mysterious" messages from staff, who claim they'll be "unwell tomorrow".</p>

<p>Pocketpair then says that because it's expecting a large volume of employees to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-release-date" rel="nofollow">call in mysteriously sick on Friday</a>, it's decided to give the majority of its staff the day off. However, the studio also says that updates for&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>and <i>Craftopia</i>&nbsp;will be unaffected by this holiday.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-pocketpair-palworld.jpg?itok=m-gZo3Mr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-pocketpair-palworld.jpg?itok=wVW-pyUi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This is probably what a lot of Pocketpair employees will be seeing on Friday.</figcaption></figure><p>As Automaton points out, Pocketpair actually did the same thing back in 2022 for the&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>release date, so it's clear the studio understands just how badly its staff is going to want to play these massive, time-consuming epics.</p>

<p>It looks like Pocketpair isn't the only one that wants to play&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, either. The game's first open beta, which took place in November, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-steam-records" rel="nofollow">broke Steam records</a> for the franchise, and that's including fully-released games.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, it's the latest game in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>series of, er, monster-hunting action RPGs.</p>

<p>Taking place in the dusty Forbidden Lands, the game features a greater emphasis on storytelling, as well as the classic epic struggles with giant monsters you've come to know and love from the series.</p>




<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>for yourself when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/monster-hunter-wilds/9NMT6XFN0LVD" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on February 28th (i.e. tomorrow).</p>

<p>If you want to prepare yourself for the game, you can take a look at its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-global-release-timings" rel="nofollow">global release timings here</a>, and make sure to read <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/monster-hunter-wilds-review-new-frontier" rel="nofollow">our own Tyler's review</a> to find out what he thought of&nbsp;<em>Wilds</em>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/4a-games-reburn-la-quimera</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metro-dev-4a-games-rebrands-to-reburn-and-reveals-brand-new-pc-fps.1120545/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/4a-games-reburn-la-quimera<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Metro&nbsp;</em>series developer 4A Games has announced that it's changing its name, and that its next project will be a narrative-led first-person shooter based on an entirely original IP.</p>

<p>Per a press release, 4A Games' new name is Reburn, and it's currently hard at work on&nbsp;<em>La Quimera</em>, a game the studio describes as an "action-packed first-person shoter with a heavy focus on narrative, world design, and characters".</p>

<p>Unlike the&nbsp;<em>Metro&nbsp;</em>series' oppressive subterranean tunnels,&nbsp;<em>La Quimera&nbsp;</em>will take place in "a fictional Latin American megalopolis" and will revolve around a "down-on-their-luck PMC outfit".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/4a-games-reburn-la-quimera-aiming.jpg?itok=1KNYrj3i 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/4a-games-reburn-la-quimera-aiming.jpg?itok=ALSsfXh4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>La Quimera&nbsp;</em>is the next project from Reburn (formerly known as 4A Games).</figcaption></figure><p>Rather impressively, Reburn says it's working with filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn for the "world and narrative" of&nbsp;<em>La Quimera</em>. Refn is best known for movies like&nbsp;<em>Drive&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Neon Demon</em>, as well as 2008's prison drama&nbsp;<em>Bronson</em>.</p>

<p>The studio promises that the game's world will combine "Latin American folklore with highly advanced weaponry and technology", which, I suppose, is where the title comes from.</p>

<p>You'll be able to play&nbsp;<em>La Quimera&nbsp;</em>in single-player, but if you want to, you can also team up with up to two friends for three-player co-op. Seems a little strange to stop at three, but hey, if it's good enough for&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-2025" rel="nofollow"><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></a>, it's good enough for&nbsp;<em>La Quimera</em>, I guess.</p>

<p>Reburn says you can expect the same kind of "tense gunplay and intimate storytelling" you're familiar with from the&nbsp;<em>Metro&nbsp;</em>series, as well as "highly detailed environments, characters, and weapons".</p>




<p>It's likely that&nbsp;<em>La Quimera&nbsp;</em>is one of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/4a-games-zen-studios-embracer" rel="nofollow">two AAA titles</a> that 4A Games is apparently working on for its parent company Embracer Group, with the other presumably being the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metro-exodus-developers-still-working-on-next-game-despite-war-in-ukraine-sdk-released" rel="nofollow">next game in the&nbsp;<em>Metro&nbsp;</em>series</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Whatever the case may be,&nbsp;<em>La Quimera&nbsp;</em>is slated to arrive on PC via Steam, although it doesn't have a release date yet. No console version appears to be planned for now. Stay tuned for more.</p>
