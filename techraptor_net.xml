            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>NetEase has released the first trailer for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>Season 3, and while it's just an animated teaser, it does reveal who the next two playable characters to join the roster will be.</p>

<p>The trailer sees none other than Phoenix, also known as Jean Grey, battling a "new queen" awakened by the symbiotic supervillain Knull. The story for the season will see Grey and the Phoenix Force battling "the god of the symbiotes".</p>

<p>However, she won't be able to do battle with Knull alone, according to NetEase. She's going to need the help of "a warrior of two worlds who lives to fight against the tide of night", which, if you haven't guessed yet, refers to the vampire hunter Blade.</p>

<p>Phoenix and Blade's presence won't come as a surprise to anyone who's been paying attention to the discourse; both characters were <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/comments/1lml6bd/twitch_leaked_the_next_two_marvel_rivals/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">leaked</a>, along with their full movesets, a few days ago.</p>

<p><em>Marvel Rivals</em>' third season, also called The Abyss Awakens, is set to arrive on July 11th, bringing the aforementioned two playable characters with it. If <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-season-2-emma-frost-ultron" rel="nofollow">previous</a>&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-modding-clampdown" rel="nofollow">seasons</a> are anything to go by, there will probably be a host of balance changes too.</p>




<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>itself, it's an<i>&nbsp;Overwatch</i>-style hero shooter that features a roster full of Marvel characters, some of whom are more obscure than others.</p>

<p>On the one hand, favorites like the aforementioned Iron Man and Black Widow, as well as others like Spider-Man and Thor, are present, but you'll also find more off-the-beaten-path characters like Magik and Jeff the Land Shark here.</p>

<p><em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>is available to play for free right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2767030/Marvel_Rivals/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/marvel-rivals/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/marvel-rivals/9n8pmw7qmd3d" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. Season 3 launches on July 11th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has revealed the development team behind&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>in a rare moment of transparency, and one of the studio's biggest successes on the original Switch was created by the same team.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-donkey-kong-bananza-is-being-made-by-the-mario-odyssey-team" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer report</a>,&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>was created by the same team who worked on&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, which, at <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250508_4e.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">last count</a>, had sold over 29 million units. It's safe to say, then, that&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>is in safe hands, opposable gorilla thumbs and all.</p>

<p>If you need a reminder of what we thought of&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Odyssey&nbsp;</em>back in 2017, it's one of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/every-game-techraptor-scored-10-10" rel="nofollow">few games</a> to which we awarded a full 10 out of 10 score, with our very own Andrew <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/super-mario-odyssey-review-pure-joy" rel="nofollow">calling it</a> "one of the best&nbsp;<em>Mario&nbsp;</em>games ever made". It's hard to disagree with him on that score, quite literally.</p>

<p>The game will see Donkey Kong setting out to recover the "Banandium Gems" from the evil VoidCo., which seeks to exploit them in order to reach the planet's core, which is said to grant wishes.</p>

<p>He'll have assistance from a younger version of Pauline, who can sing in order to assist DK in various ways. She's also part of&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>'s two-player mode; she can throw out damaging explosions if a second player is controlling her.</p>

<p>You'll also be able to destroy much of&nbsp;<em>Bananza</em>'s scenery, which you'll need to do in order to uncover secrets and defeat enemies, as well as to open up your options for exploration.</p>




<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>when it launches exclusively on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/Donkey-Kong-Bananza-2785804.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch 2</a> on July 17th.</p>
