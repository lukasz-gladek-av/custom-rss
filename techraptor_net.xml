            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/keiji-inafune-level-5-departure<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Industry legend Keiji Inafune left Level-5 last year, the&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;</i><em>Professor Layton&nbsp;</em>developer has revealed.</p>

<p>In a new <a href="https://www.level5.co.jp/blog/en/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">entry</a> on the Level-5 "Five-Star Workshop Devlog", Level-5 CEO Akihiro Hino describes the "unexpected challenge" faced by upcoming RPG&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-release-date" rel="nofollow">set for a May release</a>&nbsp;after having <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-girl-who-steals-time-delayed" rel="nofollow">suffered</a> numerous <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-girl-who-steals-time-delayed-indefinitely" rel="nofollow">delays</a>.</p>

<p>Hino says that Inafune, who was serving as a producer on the project, left Level-5 "in mid-2024", causing the studio to "reassess and restructure the project". Inafune's departure, together with "harsh evaluations" from early playtesters, led Level-5 to undertake a "complete overhaul" of <em>Fantasy Life i</em>.</p>

<p>If you need a refresher, Keiji Inafune worked with Capcom from the late 80s through to 2010, helping to create enduring franchises like&nbsp;<em>Mega Man</em>,&nbsp;<em>Dead Rising</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Onimusha</em>, among others.</p>

<p>He left Capcom in 2010 and created Comcept, the studio that would go on to release the much-maligned&nbsp;<em>Mighty No. 9</em>, as well as games like&nbsp;<em>Soul Sacrifice&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>ReCore</em>.</p>

<p>Comcept was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/level-5-acquires-keiji-inafunes-comcept" rel="nofollow">acquired by Level-5 in 2017</a>, providing development assistance on Level-5 games like&nbsp;<em>Megaton Musashi</em>&nbsp;as well as spearheading the development of the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</em>.</p>




<p>It's not clear what Inafune will do next; he hasn't made any kind of official announcement regarding his departure. He could, however, take the route <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/yakuza-creators-team-up-to-create-nagoshi-studios" rel="nofollow">followed</a> by some of his <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-bloodborne-and-final-fantasy-16-designer-velux" rel="nofollow">colleagues</a> and start up his own studio, perhaps with backing from a company like NetEase (although that may be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-studio-shockingly-closed-by-netease-laying-off-everyone" rel="nofollow">becoming more difficult</a>).</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em>is set for release on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2993780/FANTASY_LIFE_i_The_Girl_Who_Steals_Time/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10013482" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time/9pp7tdrdzghd" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/FANTASY-LIFE-i-The-Girl-Who-Steals-Time-2339978.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> on May 21st.</p>
