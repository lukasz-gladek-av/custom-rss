            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The&nbsp;<em>Rock Band 4&nbsp;</em>development team has announced that the rhythm game will be delisted in just a few days, so if you haven't played it yet and you want to, make sure you pick it up sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>In a message on the game's Discord server (as spotted by ResetEra user <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/rock-band-4-delists-october-5th-pre-2015-dlcs-as-well.1313488/#post-145880428" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Big Yoshi</a>), the folks behind&nbsp;<em>Rock Band 4&nbsp;</em>say that because the "core licenses" for the game's music are expiring,&nbsp;<em>Rock Band 4&nbsp;</em>will be removed from both the PlayStation and Xbox storefronts.</p>

<p>As is often the case with digital delisting, if you've already bought the game, then you can continue to download and play it at your leisure, and naturally, that goes for if you've got a boxed copy of&nbsp;<em>Rock Band 4&nbsp;</em>as well.</p>

<p><em>Rock Band 4&nbsp;</em>was originally released back in 2015, and at time of writing, it's still the most recent mainline entry in the series. Like previous&nbsp;<em>Rock Band&nbsp;</em>titles, the game sees players teaming up on instrument peripherals to take on a variety of songs across different genres (despite the name).</p>

<p>It's also the last game in the series (assuming it continues in any form, that is) to be developed by original creator Harmonix, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rock-band-developer-harmonix-acquired-by-epic-games-will-make-fortnite-content" rel="nofollow">purchased by Epic Games back in 2021</a>&nbsp;and which is now responsible for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-festival-launches-with-over-600000-concurrent-players-as-lego-fortnite-passes" rel="nofollow">very&nbsp;<em>Rock Band</em>-esque&nbsp;<em>Fortnite Festival</em></a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-tiers-reworked-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-pass-tiers-rejigged-yet-again-ultimate-now-costs-30-a-month.1313695/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Xbox has announced another shakeup to the way Xbox Game Pass tiers work, and you're now going to be forking over a lot more cash if you want an Ultimate subscription.</p>

<p>As detailed in an Xbox Wire <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/01/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-premium-essential-plans/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a>, there will now be three core tiers of Game Pass: Essential, Premium, and Ultimate (and yes, that wording will probably seem rather familiar if you're a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-spartacus-revealed-as-playstation-plus-overhaul" rel="nofollow">PlayStation Plus devotee</a>).</p>

<p>The PC Game Pass tier is disappearing; all three tiers will now go across PC and console. The Essential tier is, as you'd imagine, the cheapest on offer, and it grants access to "50+ games", unlimited cloud gaming, and console multiplayer for $10 per month.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-game-pass-changes-2025-new-tiers.jpg?itok=3vTgJtch 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-game-pass-changes-2025-new-tiers.jpg?itok=HcvZe2Uh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Xbox is overhauling its Game Pass subscription service.</figcaption></figure><p>The second tier is Premium, which will cost you $14.99 per month and grant you access to Xbox-published games "within a year of launch", although that appears to exclude games in the&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>series.</p>

<p>You'll also get the same benefits as the Essential tier, although you'll enjoy "shorter wait times" for cloud gaming. Naturally, the benefits for the Premium and Essential tiers are also rolled into Ultimate, which is the only tier whose name hasn't changed.</p>

<p>What has changed is the pricing; you'll now be coughing up an eye-watering $30 per month for Game Pass Ultimate, and in return, you'll get "75+ day one games a year, including all Xbox-published games day one". As a reminder, Ultimate subscribers already get this benefit for $20 a month.</p>

<p>Other Ultimate benefits include access to the Ubisoft+ Classics range and a&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>Crew subscription, as well as "best quality" cloud gaming with "shortest wait times".</p>




<p>These changes, which come into effect immediately, are the second major Game Pass overhaul in under two years, although this one's arguably more drastic than the one <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-price-hike-new-tier" rel="nofollow">put into effect back in July last year</a>.</p>

<p>The changes also come shortly after Xbox <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-largest-investment-2025" rel="nofollow">declared</a> that this year marks its "largest investment" in the Game Pass service, although that hasn't stopped former Xbox staffers and other industry luminaries from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-shannon-loftis-comments" rel="nofollow">questioning the service's worth</a> to creators.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/digimon-story-time-stranger-smt-with-better-evolution-system</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/digimon-story-time-stranger-review-smt-with-a-better-evolution-system.1313620/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It has now been almost eight years since the last release of a <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bf5f5761-dd71-4920-a357-fb1776081165" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/digimon-story-cyber-sleuth-review-digimon-are-champions" rel="nofollow"><em>Digimon Story</em></a> title. This line of RPGs, not to be confused with the Monster Sim <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1404da97-a827-4374-bf72-f779c1d461a1" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/digimon-world-next-order-review-were-going-digital" rel="nofollow"><em>Digimon World</em></a> titles, puts players in the shoes of a human who befriends Digimon, trains them up to be big and powerful, and ultimately saves the world. In <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em>, the world you explore is bigger, the roster of available Digimon is larger, and the scope of the story has increased just as much.</p>

<p>In <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger,</em> you take on the role of a protagonist investigating a phenomenon known as Digimon, protecting the secret of their existence from the world. On your latest mission, you encounter a strange phenomenon and end up being transported back in time eight years.</p>

<p>Starting with a simple investigation in the presence of Digimon in the past, the scope of the story explodes fast, allowing you to explore Shinjuku and Akihabara, expanding to not only include a vast Digital World filled with various themed areas, but also further exploration through time.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-exploration.jpg?itok=YWaysTo7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-exploration.jpg?itok=xZtGw0Zw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Watch out, I hear there's a strange guy dressed as a Dinosaur...</figcaption></figure><h2>The Time Stranger Was The Friend You Became Along The Way</h2>

<p>Alongside your drive to understand the time-travelling phenomenon, another mysterious part of your party is Aegiomon, a Digimon born into the human world who seems to have a great destiny ahead of him and a force of 'evil' Digimon known as Titans to fight back against.</p>

<p>The story of<em> Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> is big. The world is filled to the brim with characters full of personality and motive that make everywhere you go feel alive. Having had a chance to play through the demo, but also part of the game at SGF, I had a feeling the story between the opening Government Building and when you'd arrive at Central Town would be an hour or so, but getting to spend about 5-6 hours in the real world before you even set in the Digital World really set a tone for how much larger this game would become.</p>

<p>As you progress from the real world to each of the digital regions, you'll get to meet interesting characters like the Bearmon brothers, a Shellmon who wants to heal Digimon no matter whose side they're fighting for, and the leader of a forest village who likes to party, shirking off the responsibilities of watching over everyone to his second in command.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-bar-scene_0.jpg?itok=q_2_BmZ5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-bar-scene_0.jpg?itok=DlhhX9PP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Three Digimon walked into a bar...</figcaption></figure><p>Getting to spend so much time in these worlds, you don't just get to grow with Aegiomon and your own party of Digimon, but see each of these important characters grow in their own ways. After spending 50+ hours in this world, seeing the growth and continued involvement of these characters pays off time and time again. It's hard to say much without giving things away, but just know there's very little 'small' characters in this unique adventure.</p>

<p>While the overall adventure was very much worth it, there were definitely times around the back third of the game where you'd revisit areas, and it did feel a bit like you were retreading familiar ground. These areas could have been tightened up a bit, but overall, the payoff of revisiting these areas was worth it.</p>

<h2><em>Digimon Story: Time Strangers</em> Is A Mix Of <em>Tamers </em>And <em>Savers</em></h2>

<p>For fans of Digimon, who know that the tone between Digimon adventures can be a bit all over the place, I feel like <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger </em>was a healthy mix of <em>Digimon Tamers</em> thematically, while also taking a lot from <em>Digimon Savers</em>.</p>

<p>Side-quests are a harder part of the story to judge. For the most part, the side-quest gameplay was uninspired, having you travel between a few places and then fight a single digimon. That being said, some of my favorite side-quests were the ones where you didn't even fight a Digimon. In these, you learn more about the expanded cast of characters, their dreams and desires. These ones added a very human touch to the Digimon, blurring the line between human and Digimon, as is often a theme in these stories.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-side-quests.jpg?itok=z6yy8V1m 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-side-quests.jpg?itok=ARl5rGHg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Follow the waypoint, interact with the item, follow the next waypoint...</figcaption></figure><p>In these ways, the gameplay of Side-quests didn't add to the experience, but the stories were normally worth the time. Whether you do or don't care for them, though, one of the Side-Quest rewards is a currency that will allow you to Digivolve into higher levels, so you'll need to be completing them if you want to finish the game.</p>

<p>Outside of explicit Side-Quests, there are a variety of other activities that you can take part in, including hard dungeons with unique objectives known as Outer Dungeons, and an addictive but VERY unbalanced/random card game. The Outer Dungeons are fun for a bit more of a challenge as you're making your way through the game, but the card game is really only worth it if you have nothing else to do.</p>

<h2>Combat Is Familiar For <em>SMT </em>Fans</h2>

<p>Outside of exploration, the core gameplay of <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger </em>is in its turn-based battles. Battles are up to 3x3, with an extra three Digimon as a backup in your party. Much like <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9bf71acc-b777-43e6-82ec-ce923f25f256" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/shin-megami-tensei-v-review" rel="nofollow"><em>SMT,&nbsp;</em></a>speed is a factor, allowing you to have faster Digimon attack more often, and you'll pretty much always be upgrading or swapping around your party to find a combination that's most effective for any area you're travelling through.</p>

<p>Digimon has a combat triangle of the basic Data, Vaccine, and Virus types, but on top of that, there are a variety of types that are outside of that triangle, like No-Data or Unknown. Additionally, there are also elemental typings like Fire, Electricity, and… Steel.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-boss-fight.jpg?itok=4ROgp_OA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-boss-fight.jpg?itok=5-ovVuO0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>UltimateBrachiomon has unique mechanics that will really push your team building</figcaption></figure><p>Damage calculation takes into account the type of your Digimon, as well as the type of the attack, and sometimes even the trait of an enemy Digimon can see you swinging from dealing no damage at all, to dealing five times the amount of possible damage. It can be very satisfying to have everything line up correctly, but having so many variables also means you can take a Digimon who normally wouldn't be effective against an opponent and give them an ability or attack that will allow them to deal bonus damage. Here you'll end up doing 1.5x damage, or even weird variables like 2.3x damage.</p>

<p>I really appreciated these gameplay options, especially as I was getting to the end of the game and was honing in on my 'optimal' team. I could make sure that they were well-rounded as a team, but also within themselves. No matter who your favorite Digimon is, there's a way to have them be viable and take them on your adventure.</p>

<p>You can alter a Digimon's strengths and abilities even further by equipping them with a wide variety of different attacks and by equipping them with attachments that can boost their stats or allow them to resist certain damage types and status conditions.</p>

<p>Boss fights add even more complication as these massive Digimon don't just have more HP and deal more damage, but they'll also have different mechanical gimmicks or will pause at certain times to charge up and launch massive attacks. While I was able to defeat pretty much all of the bosses on my first try, I was normally pushing myself to the finish line with my 'all-rounder' team.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-strong-attack.jpg?itok=aCwRjSdr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-strong-attack.jpg?itok=0DmoZNUv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Defend at the right time otherwise suffer massive damage</figcaption></figure><p>These experiences did a good job of pushing me to think on my feet, trying to figure out the best way to remain most defensive while also maximizing my damage multipliers. It also reinforced the idea that you could take your favorites with you and get through most battles. For those bosses that were too difficult with my all-rounder team, I was always able to spend 5-10 minutes looking through my roster, setting them up with some good attacks, and coming back with an incredibly powerful and specific team.</p>

<h2>Raising Digimon Is A Full Time Job</h2>

<p>Another meaty aspect of gameplay for <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> is in its monster evolution mechanics. Digimon have between six and seven different stages of growth from Baby to Mega+, and unlike other popular monster raising video games, Digimon have all kinds of crazy branched evolution. Your cat head might become a bipedal fox, who, after spending some time as a bird with a bush for a tail, becomes a sentient blob with an attachment to jewelry.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-digivolution.jpg?itok=f1Ax9aC5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-digivolution.jpg?itok=_OTg_M5s 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>De-digivolving can lead you to just as many strange places as Digivolution, and as your Digimon continues to grow and change, its skill ceiling also rises, promoting the idea of you not just digivolving a Digimon into its most powerful form, but to let it run free across the digivolution tree.</p>

<p>To successfully Digivolve a Digimon, it needs to meet certain stat requirements; Greymon might become MetalGreymon with 592 HP and 520 ATK, but if you want a SkullGreymon, you need 1250 ATK and 1060 DEF.</p>

<p>I love the way that digivolution works in this game, there's certain Digimon that will have an easier 'natural' path of evolution but for the most powerful Digimon, or those that require special conditions like Armor or DNA/Jogress Digivolution you'll have to be paying more attention, creating a more powerful Digimon, and even interacting with them in certain ways.</p>

<p>A new mechanic to <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> is Personalities. Each Digimon can have one of sixteen possible personality types. These personalities affect which certain stats might grow faster, but they can also imbue a Digimon with a special ability. One of my favorites is Cheer, which increases ATK and INT at the start of a battle based on the bond of the battle members.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-agent-skills.jpg?itok=cqWVEROB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-agent-skills.jpg?itok=VnqzwkCS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Buy Agent Skills to increase the Digimon you can digivolve into, as well as increase their stats</figcaption></figure><p>Personality was a mechanic that I mostly ignored during my playthrough. The benefits that it could imbue would definitely lend to certain Digimon digivolving in certain ways faster… but I also found that just leveling them up or powering them up with other Digimon was also a fast way to get the stats that I needed.</p>

<p>You'll be happy to know that, aside from needing certain personalities for Jogress evolution, it won't come into play much, but for those who are excited to dive into the Mega+ difficulty mode, having a Digimon with a specific personality will be a key factor to surviving.</p>

<p>It's great to see so many new and fan favorite Digimon are part of the roster of <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em>, but it's also a bit weird to see some of the exclusions. The biggest space I can see is the main digimon from Frontiers, with Spirits for Fire and Light present and Ranamon available, but none of the other Spirits are part of the game.</p>

<p>That being said, there were some fascinating entries with returning fan favorites like the Royal Knights, and Seven Deadly Sins, alongside some newer Digimon like MagnaKidmon, Beelstarmon, and the Olympux XII.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-digimon-party.jpg?itok=RPuAJEzb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-digimon-party.jpg?itok=24nh_RMB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Plenty of familiar faces, as well as new ones</figcaption></figure><p>As a side, you can really tell with the work being done on establishing a greater lore to connect and differentiate the Digimon games. While the past two <em>Digimon Story</em> titles pulled inspiration from the stories of the standard Digital World, this game takes place in the Iliad and references the original server as well as Shambala. Alongside the strong performance of this game, it also makes me very excited for the future of the series.</p>

<h2>Quality Of Life Updates</h2>

<p>As a longtime fan of JRPGs, I am always down for some turn-based combat and occasional grinding. There are a lot of specific things that<em> Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> does to make sure the experience is always a good one, and that it doesn't feel like you're having your time wasted.</p>

<p>In combat, you can see the effectiveness of moves if you've used their types previously, or if you've had that Digimon before. This is helpful to make battles efficient, while also rewarding the work you've done filling out your Digimon field guide. Battles can also be sped up to 5x; this also cuts out certain animations, meaning that even when you're 50+ hours into the game, the combat never feels like a chore.</p>

<p>In the overworld, there are no random encounters, and you can pre-emptively strike your opponents. If you're strong enough, you won't even enter combat; you'll just be rewarded with experience, money, and items as if you fought that battle.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-digimon-bank.jpg?itok=yvCm02iA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-digimon-bank.jpg?itok=yP2F5vv4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Access your Digimon Bank from ANYWHERE</figcaption></figure><p>Some direct improvements from previous <em>Digimon Story</em> games are that you can access your bank of Digimon from anywhere, and you can also Digivolve from anywhere. This cuts out a lot of time that might have been spent running to and from the Digi-Farm. Additionally, there are a number of different ways to fast-travel around the world. No more getting too deep into a dungeon and having to slowly walk out, fighting random encounters along the way.</p>

<p>The Digi-Farm is one area that has fallen to the wayside with all of these enhancements. What was previously a place to let your Digimon gain experience when not travelling with you, and to train up specific stats, it still does those things… but when Digimon in your Bank earn EXP regardless, and it's so much nicer to just have them with you, I spent little to no time using the Digi-Farm.</p>

<p>This feature, much like the personality system, is one that I'm sure will be integral to the hardest difficulty modes, but for the standard game, you'll not likely need it.</p>

<h2><em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>It's been a long time since the release of the last <em>Digimon Story</em> game, and with a grand story, the establishment of a new Digital World, a complex and addictive combat system, and hundreds of Digimon to explore, <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> is an excellent new entry to the franchise.</p>

<p>The story grabbed me from the get-go wth an explosive launch and had me eager to learn more throughout the entire story, even if some sections dragged on a bit. Side-Missions were the weakest aspect, and while they were a snooze gameplay-wise, they certainly added more to the world and its inhabitants.</p>

<p>The core monster raising and digivolution was straightforward enough to learn and get good at, but there's also plenty for min/maxers to really dive into between the personality types, abilities, and training at the Digi-Farm.</p>

<p>This isn't just a good title for those familiar with Digimon and <em>Digimon Story</em> titles to purchase and play, but it's also a great entry point for fans of RPGs like Shin Megami Tensei who want to experience a version of that game with better monster evolution mechanics.</p>
