            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warcraft-2-remaster-leaked-rumor<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A&nbsp;<em>Warcraft 2&nbsp;</em>remaster may have just been leaked ahead of a major celebration for the franchise's 30th anniversary, which is due to take place next week.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1gkkzj1/warcraft_2_remastered_internal_alpha_leaked_via/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Redditor Neggy5</a>, a <a href="https://blizztrack.com/view/w2rd?type=versions" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new listing on tracking site BlizzTrack</a>, which monitors changes in the backend of the company's Battle.net service, points to the existence of an internal alpha test for something called&nbsp;<em>Warcraft 2: Remastered</em>.</p>

<p>All things considered, it's pretty difficult to imagine that this is anything other than a reworked modern version of the seminal 1995 RTS, which was originally titled&nbsp;<em>Warcraft 2: Tides of Darkness</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warcraft-2-remaster-leak-original-shot.jpg?itok=PEyMoc8Q 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warcraft-2-remaster-leak-original-shot.jpg?itok=Eas5tPeJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A remaster of classic 1995 RTS&nbsp;<em>Warcraft 2&nbsp;</em>could be on the way.</figcaption></figure><p>The listing gives practically nothing away, as you might imagine, but it does potentially confirm the existence of a remaster that may well be announced during next week's celebration.</p>

<p>According to the Redditor who discovered the listing, an upcoming update for the controversial&nbsp;<em>Warcraft 3: Reforged&nbsp;</em>was also discovered on the BlizzTrack website, so it seems that Blizzard's attempts to redeem that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warcraft-3-reforged-developer-update-does-little-to-satisfy-irate-fans">ill-received rework</a> also continue, although the nature of said update hasn't been revealed.</p>

<p>It's also worth noting that none of this has officially been confirmed; this could well just be an experimental attempt on Blizzard's part to go through options rather than a confirmation that something concrete is in the works.</p>

<p>Still, the timing of this leak seems pretty serendipitous with the&nbsp;<em>Warcraft&nbsp;</em>anniversary stream due to air next week, so I wouldn't be surprised if a&nbsp;<em>Warcraft 2&nbsp;</em>announcement was officially made at that point.</p>

<p>It's also arriving after developers on said MMO <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/world-of-warcraft-blizzard-union">formed Blizzard's first wall-to-wall union</a> back in July, which essentially means said union represents the entire studio rather than a single unit within the company.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sega-new-virtua-fighter-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega has officially announced that a new&nbsp;<em>Virtua Fighter&nbsp;</em>game is in the works as part of the company's drive to revive some of its classic franchises.</p>

<p>Speaking <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/why-sega-is-reviving-classics-like-shinobi-and-jet-set-radio-across-games-film-and-tv/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">to VGC</a>, Sega transmedia head Justin Scarpone revealed that alongside revivals of franchises like&nbsp;<em>Jet Set Radio</em>,&nbsp;<em>Golden Axe</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Shinobi</em>,&nbsp;which were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/game-awards-2023-recap-check-out-all-news-trailers-and-reveals">announced during last year's Game Awards</a>, a new&nbsp;<em>Virtua Fighter&nbsp;</em>game is also in development, although Scarpone stopped short of revealing further details.</p>

<p>Scarpone also says that "in certain instances", Sega has transmedia projects in development alongside its games, pointing to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shinobi-movie-announced">recently-revealed&nbsp;<em>Shinobi&nbsp;</em>movie</a> as an example, although it's not clear whether&nbsp;<em>Virtua Fighter&nbsp;</em>is also part of that initiative.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/virtua-fighter-revival-fight.jpg?itok=C3ym3pyD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/virtua-fighter-revival-fight.jpg?itok=OLNB1IcM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Virtua Fighter&nbsp;</em>is getting a revival.</figcaption></figure><p>Sega's&nbsp;<em>Virtua Fighter&nbsp;</em>revival is part of a company-wide initiative on Sega's part to emphasize its classic franchises, with several games currently in the works based on old-school Sega IPs.</p>

<p>These projects include a reboot of&nbsp;<em>Crazy Taxi</em>, which Sega says <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crazy-taxi-reboot-open-world-mmo">will be an open-world MMO</a> in contrast to the original game's classic arcade approach to gameplay, as well as reworks of <i>Golden Axe</i>,&nbsp;<em>Shinobi</em>, <i>Jet Set Radio</i>, and&nbsp;<em>Streets of Rage&nbsp;</em>(in the latter case, a reboot distinct from <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/streets-of-rage-4">2020's&nbsp;<em>Streets of Rage 4</em></a>).</p>

<p>We don't have any kind of inclination regarding what exactly Sega is planning to do with these franchises (beyond the&nbsp;<em>Crazy Taxi&nbsp;</em>reboot, of course), but we'll likely learn more in the coming months.</p>

The game managed to sell a million copies within its first few hours on sale.</p>

<p>The gaming giant has also enjoyed recent success thanks to the release of&nbsp;3D platformer&nbsp;<em>Sonic x Shadow Generations</em>, which, much like the aforementioned JRPG, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-x-shadow-generations-sales-million">sold very strongly indeed on its launch day</a>.</p>
