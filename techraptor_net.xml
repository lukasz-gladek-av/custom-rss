            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hasbro-layoffs-june-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Tabletop and gaming giant Hasbro has laid off around 3% of its employees, which amounts to about 150 jobs lost from the company.</p>

<p>That's according to a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/retail/hasbro-trims-3-of-workforce-in-cost-cutting-push-2ac88b24" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a> by the Wall Street Journal, which cites a Hasbro spokesperson as saying the layoffs are due to the firm "aligning [its] structure with [its] long-term goals". The Journal says employees "across departments and regions around the world" were affected by the layoffs.</p>

<p>As the WSJ points out, this is part of a wider restructuring effort at Hasbro, which will see the company attempting to cut around $1 billion from its expenditure over the next couple of years. This initiative also saw over a thousand employees lose their jobs at Hasbro <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hasbro-layoffs-targets-20-of-workforce-resulting-in-1100-jobs-lost" rel="nofollow">back in December 2023</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, Hasbro has some big plans for the IPs around which its business is built; throughout 2025, for instance,&nbsp;<em>Monopoly&nbsp;</em>will <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hasbro-has-big-plans-for-monopoly-in-2025-including-new-box-and-official-expansions" rel="nofollow">get itself a brand new box</a> and some major new expansions, so the popularity of what is probably the world's most divisive mainstream board game will continue.</p>

<p>Not only that, but Hasbro is looking to expand into new areas with some of its properties as well. Back in February, it was revealed that a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-movie-is-coming-courtesy-of-hasbro-and-legendary-pictures" rel="nofollow">movie based on&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-movie-is-coming-courtesy-of-hasbro-and-legendary-pictures" rel="nofollow">Magic: The Gathering</a>&nbsp;</em>is on the way, and it'll serve as a collaboration between Hasbro and movie house Legendary Pictures.</p>

These cuts are part of a wider industry trend that has seen many companies let employees go, including industry giants like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-3-percent-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-shuts-down-two-studios-including-concord-creator" rel="nofollow">Sony</a>, as well as smaller studios like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bossa-studios-layoffs-restructuring" rel="nofollow">Bossa</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playtonic-layoffs-yooka-laylee" rel="nofollow">Playtonic</a>.</p>
