            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Arc Raiders </em>sales have soared past another huge milestone, according to developer and publisher Embark Studios, and there's a lovely free gift waiting for you to claim by way of a thank you.</p><p>As <a href="https://x.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/2010985172632797620" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">revealed</a> on social media earlier today, <em>Arc Raiders </em>has now sold 12 million copies, which means that in the time between <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/arc-raiders-sales-4m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="08dd5792-c4a8-4824-90f6-27b50a7dc7fa" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">mid-November</a> and now, the game has racked up a whopping eight million more sales for itself. Not bad at all.</p><p>The free gift in question is available until 11:59pm CET today (that's around 5:59pm Eastern), and it was originally prepared for <em>Arc Raiders </em>hitting 10 million sales, but as Embark says, players "blew straight past [that milestone] over the winter break".</p><figure role="group">

<p>News of <em>Arc Raiders</em>' new sales milestone accompanies a rather small patch that was released earlier today; it's not a big one, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1808500/view/527616545148373537" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">check out the patch notes here</a> if you want to know what's changed.</p><p>If you're not familiar with <em>Arc Raiders</em>, it's an extraction shooter created by Embark Studios, the company responsible for destructo-FPS <em>The Finals</em>.</p><p>Set on a "lethal future Earth", <em>Arc Raiders </em>sees you (and, optionally, your buddies) taking on massive monsters that now stalk the land, as well as other survivors who may not have the best intentions.</p><p><em>Arc Raiders</em>' success probably won't come as a surprise if you checked out Steam's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steam-best-of-2025" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="506dd7fd-a10c-4745-bcb4-ef7cfe0636c8" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">list of best-selling games from 2025</a> earlier this year, although it is also one of several games on that list to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/almost-20-of-top-new-sellers-on-steam-in-2025-used-generative-ai" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="16d0c419-db96-434f-99c7-9e50c881e987" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">openly use generative AI</a>, which is a controversial topic in the industry right now.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road </em>has reached a new sales milestone, developer and publisher Level-5 has announced, and the game will be getting a second major update in the near future as well.</p><p>As revealed in a <a href="https://www.inazuma.jp/victory-road/en/topics/260113_01/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">news post</a> on the game's official website, <em>Victory Road </em>has racked up 800,000 sales since launching last November. The game managed to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-sales-500k" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="60aad754-fdd9-4d60-bb74-1251bf703db7" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">hit 500,000 sales in its first week</a>, so that means it's picked up another 300,000 since then.</p><p>In addition to revealing the new sales milestone, Level-5 has also announced that a second major update is on the way for <em>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</em>, following on from the game's first big update in December. It's bringing "the opening of the Ares Route, among other features".</p><figure role="group">

<p>Level-5 will no doubt be pleased with <em>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</em>'s performance, especially given what a long road it's been to get here (and not one with a guaranteed chance of victory, either).</p><p>Originally known as <em>Inazuma Eleven: Heroes' Great Road</em>, the game has been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/inazuma-eleven-heroes-great-road-delayed-until-2021" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="291efc63-1f35-4892-bcb7-01502230543a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">delayed</a> numerous times, and a Western release was by no means guaranteed until Level-5 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-will-come-west-new-trailer-details-revealed" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c93004cd-65c8-4edc-afb5-782c92344e4c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">announced one in 2023</a>.</p><p>Just like its predecessors, <em>Victory Road </em>is an RPG that combines tactical soccer battles with overworld exploration. It takes place around 25 years after the original <em>Inazuma Eleven </em>and follows a new protagonist, Dustin Billows (Sasanami Unmei in the Japanese version).</p><p>Billows isn't capable of hitting the field himself, but he can recruit other students to join his team, and so he serves as their commander, building a team of unconventional soccer heroes to take on all comers.</p>
<p><em>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road </em>forms part of what is arguably a big comeback for Level-5, with cozy RPG <em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time </em>also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-girl-who-steals-time-sales-1-5m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4638dd4a-d2d1-40e8-b386-03f485297eeb" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">doing pretty well in the sales stakes</a>.</p><p>You can check out <em>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road </em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2799860/INAZUMA_ELEVEN_Victory_Road/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/inazuma-eleven-victory-road/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/inazuma-eleven-victory-road/9NVX87ZG7WSC" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and both <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/INAZUMA-ELEVEN-Victory-Road-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2950552.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Switch 2</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/INAZUMA-ELEVEN-Victory-Road-2950387.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Switch</a> right now.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
