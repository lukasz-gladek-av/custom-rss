            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/raf-grassetti-naughty-dog<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>God of War Ragnarok&nbsp;</em>art director Raf Grassetti has joined up with&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Uncharted&nbsp;</em>developer Naughty Dog.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/rafagrassetti/status/1866135153497768034" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post on social media platform X</a>&nbsp;earlier today, Grassetti shared a picture of the Naughty Dog logo, together with the simple caption "new chapter" to announce that he'd signed up with the studio.</p>

<p>It's likely that Grassetti will be working on Naughty Dog's next project, which is almost certainly the same game Neil Druckmann <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1gr42v6/neil_druckmann_says_his_current_project_has_been/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">said has been in development since 2020</a> last month, although we don't know any more about the game than that yet, unfortunately.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/raf-grassetti-naughty-dog-sculpture.jpg?itok=zu-Y20et 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/raf-grassetti-naughty-dog-sculpture.jpg?itok=g657UAyy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Raf Grassetti is perhaps best known for his work on the two most recent&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>games.</figcaption></figure><p>As for Grassetti, he's probably best known as the art director on 2022's&nbsp;<em>God of War Ragnarok</em>, having served as an artist on the 2018 predecessor as well. If you loved the art direction of Kratos' latest adventure, you've got Grassetti to thank, at least in part.</p>

<p>Of course, that's not all the work Grassetti has done in the gaming industry. After <a href="https://x.com/rafagrassetti/status/1659618787036110848" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">leaving Sony in May 2023</a>, Grassetti joined up with Netflix to create "a brand-new studio and AAA multiplatform game", although it seems like he may have been one of the casualties when Netflix <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-team-blue-shut-down-report" rel="nofollow">shut down "Team Blue" in October</a>.</p>

<p>Prior to his time with Sony, Grassetti worked as a character artist on projects like BioWare's&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect 3</em>, Ubisoft's&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Origins</em>, and CD Projekt Red's&nbsp;<em>The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings</em>, among many others. Suffice it to say he's an old industry hand.</p>

<p>As for Naughty Dog itself, it's currently working on at least one as-yet unannounced project.</p>

<p>Given that the studio moved towards <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/last-of-us-online-canceled-as-naughty-dog-works-on-more-than-one-ambitious-single" rel="nofollow">focusing exclusively on single-player games</a> back in December last year, it's likely the new game won't be a multiplayer live-service affair, which, given one of Sony's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-shuts-down-two-studios-including-concord-creator" rel="nofollow">more recent high-profile failures</a>, is probably for the best.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/epic-reveals-lego-fortnite-social-experience-brick-life-and-major-new-storm-chasers-update.1055844/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lego-fortnite-brick-festival-storm-chasers<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic has revealed big changes for&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>in the coming days, including a major new social roleplaying experience and an update to the core mode that adds lots of new content.</p>

<p>First up,&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite</em>'s new Brick Life mode is coming on December 12th. Described by Epic as an "all-new social roleplay experience in the&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>universe", the mode will allow you to "make new friends, explore the sights, land your dream job, and move into your new home", according to Epic's description.</p>

<p>Brick Life looks to be an experience that wants to compete with&nbsp;<em>The Sims&nbsp;</em>(and also <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>, perhaps), so of course, you'll also be able to build your dream home and furnish it with all kinds of fun accessories, by the looks of things.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lego-fortnite-brick-life-odyssey-update-phones.jpg?itok=bS3qgpjP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lego-fortnite-brick-life-odyssey-update-phones.jpg?itok=HaYo1H59 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Lego Fortnite</em>'s new Brick Life mode is a "social roleplaying experience" that has shades of&nbsp;<em>The Sims&nbsp;</em>about it.</figcaption></figure><p>In the trailer, we also see&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>characters riding on vehicles, working out at the gym, stealing diamonds from some kind of bank vault, and engaging in plenty of other activities, so it looks like there'll be lots to do in Brick Life.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for this new&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>mode right here.</p>




<p>The second major piece of&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>news released by Epic today is a name change and major update for&nbsp;the main&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite</em>&nbsp;mode. It's now called&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite Odyssey</em>, and it'll be part of a new bespoke&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>section within the main&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>game.</p>

<p>Tomorrow,&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite Odyssey&nbsp;</em>will get a brand new update by the name of Storm Chasers, and it's set to bring a new biome, new dungeons to explore, and new enemies to fight, plus "a formidable big bad" in the form of the titular Storm King. Here's the trailer!</p>




<p>In case you're not aware,&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>is a spinoff mode within massively popular battle royale game&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>.</p>

<p>Released in December last year, the mode debuted to a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lego-fortnite-debuts-with-over-23-million-concurrent-players-will-get-updates-in-early" rel="nofollow">staggering number of concurrent players</a>, with that number <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-festival-launches-with-over-600000-concurrent-players-as-lego-fortnite-passes" rel="nofollow">only increasing in the following days</a>.</p>

<p>Since then,&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>has received a number of updates, including new features, tweaks to existing mechanics, and even <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-fortnite-may-2024" rel="nofollow">a crossover with&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em></a>, among many other things.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>for free right now as part of&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>, which is available to play on PC, PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and mobile devices.</p>
