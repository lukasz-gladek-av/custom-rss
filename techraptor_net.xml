            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has revealed a brand new State of Play presentation for later this week, and it'll be packed to the gills with new information about upcoming games from first-party and third-party studios alike.</p><p>As revealed in a new PlayStation Blog <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/09/state-of-play-returns-this-thursday-february-12/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">post</a>, the State of Play show has been set for February 12th at 2pm Pacific (that's 5pm Eastern and about 10pm GMT). It'll last for around 60 minutes.</p><p>Sony is promising information about "eye-catching third-party and indie games headed to PS5", as well as "the latest from teams at PlayStation Studios". Although the show will include studios from around the world, the presentation will be broadcast in English, with Japanese subtitles additionally available.</p><figure role="group">

<p>As tends to be the case with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-february-2026-announced" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2d141075-7ce0-4253-932a-abe8f3fbe418" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">major presentation announcements</a> from big studios (with some <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-developer-direct-january-22nd-2026" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2c8e5f78-4ad9-43f4-bd6b-54b81360f376" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">notable exceptions</a>), Sony is remaining tight-lipped about exactly what you can expect to see during this week's State of Play.</p><p>In terms of games we already know about, I'd expect to see more on Housemarque's <em>Saros</em>, as well as Bungie's <em>Marathon</em>, since both of them are launching within the next few months.</p><p>I wouldn't be surprised if Insomniac Games turned up to showcase <em>Marvel's Wolverine</em>, too; the last we heard from that game was during Sony's last State of Play <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-state-of-play-september-2025" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="cd5b7ba9-4473-41df-8d3c-8a1ff1c52f90" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">back in September</a>, so we're arguably overdue more info.</p><p>Of course, this being a State of Play, you can also expect the unexpected, as it were; we'll almost certainly be getting announcements for projects and games we don't know about yet. Just don't hold your breath for that <em>Bloodborne </em>remaster.</p><figure role="group">
