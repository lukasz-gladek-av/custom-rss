            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Leder Games has announced the cancellation of the <em>Take</em> board game Kickstarter campaign. The publisher behind <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/root-review-woodland-warfare" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Root</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/arcs-review-fun-unbridled-space-chaos" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Arcs</em></a> had its next project fully funded, but due to a notable departure at the studio, the game will not be coming to gaming tables.</p><h2>The <em>Take</em> Board Game Kickstarter Cancellation</h2><p>According to a report by <a href="https://boardgamewire.com/index.php/2025/12/12/root-arcs-publisher-leder-games-scraps-impending-take-kickstarter-after-games-designer-abruptly-leaves-studio/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Board Game Wire</a>, the <em>Take</em> board game was a passion project by Leder Games' accounting manager, Ted Caya. It was a passion project of his that he was working on outside of his day job at the company as Executive Director of Operations.</p><picture>

The Kickstarter campaign launched about four months ago and was fully funded with more than 8,700 followers. However, in the latest update post on the campaign, Leder Games' founder, Patrick Leder, stated the following:</p><blockquote><p>“Take’s designer, Ted, has decided to move on from the studio and onto his next grand adventure. He will be bringing Take with him. Due to this, we are cancelling this crowdfunding campaign. We wish him the very best!</p><p>“As for the future of Take, that is squarely in the designer’s hands. We enjoyed our play tests in the studio, and will certainly celebrate if/when Ted takes that next step toward production.</p><p>“We are grateful for the enthusiasm you’ve all shown for Take. Nearly 8,700 followers is nothing to sneeze at! We look forward to returning to Kickstarter in the future with another amazing project. Stay tuned!”</p></blockquote><p>What this means for the <em>Take</em> board game is unclear. If you backed the original Kickstarter, you will need to contact Leder Games about a refund. But, there is a chance that the board game may return elsewhere, just not as it was sold under Leder Games.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
