            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>PlayStation has revealed the name and release window of its upcoming wireless arcade fight stick: it's called the FlexStrike, and it's launching sometime next year.</p>

<p>The FlexStrike was first revealed under the codename Project Defiant back at <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-state-of-play-june-2025-recap" rel="nofollow">this year's summer State of Play</a>, but it's now shedding its development moniker. What's more, Sony has revealed more about what you can actually expect from the peripheral.</p>

<p>It'll be compatible with both PS5 and PC, and you'll be able to use it with both via a wired connection or wirelessly (using the included PlayStation Link adapter, of course).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/playstation-flexstrike-fight-stick-blue-background.jpg?itok=HXRoyRYy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/playstation-flexstrike-fight-stick-blue-background.jpg?itok=NccehqMO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The FlexStrike is coming sometime next year.</figcaption></figure><p>On the technical side, you can expect "mechanical switch buttons and toolless swappable restrictor gates", which include "square, circle, and octagon restrictor gates" you can slot into the storage compartments alongside the aforementioned PlayStation Link adapter.</p>

<p>You'll be able to hook both the FlexStrike and a Pulse 3D headset, or the Pulse Explore earbuds, up to your PS5 using a single PS Link adapter, and you can even connect two FlexStrikes up with the same adapter if you want to battle alongside (or against) a friend.</p>

<p>If you're not looking to use the FlexStrike to wander through game menus, you can keep your PS5 controller connected while you're using it, and since the FlexStrike features the same button inputs as a DualSense, you can probably use it as a standard controller as well, if you're so inclined.</p>

<p>You can check out a trailer showing off what the FlexStrike can do and what kind of aesthetic it's sporting (hint: it's pretty similar to the PS5's design) right here.</p>




<p>If you're lucky enough to be attending Evo in Vegas next month, you'll be able to get a first look at the FlexStrike. The rest of us will have to wait until 2026, and we'll presumably learn more about pricing and release dates in the coming months.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>God of War&nbsp;</em>TV series showrunner Ronald D. Moore has revealed some more info about what we can expect from the upcoming video game adaptation, but it's probably going to be a while before you can watch it.</p>

<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ronald-d-moore-discusses-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series-the-tone-of-the-show-is-trying-to-emulate-the-tone-of-the-game-sdcc-2025" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">IGN</a>, Moore confirmed that the show will adapt the Norse stories featured in 2018's&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>and 2021's&nbsp;<em>Ragnarok</em>, since Kratos and his son Atreus will form the core duo at the heart of the show.</p>

<p>Moore says the tone of the show will "emulate the tone of the game", depicting an "epic journey" that's also a "heartfelt story of...two men" setting out to "honor the memory of [Kratos'] wife, Atreus' mother". It sounds, then, like the first season will be a pretty direct adaptation of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/god-of-war-2018" rel="nofollow">the 2018 title</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/god-of-war-tv-series-ronald-d.-moore-combat.jpg?itok=aW_FiGfH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/god-of-war-tv-series-ronald-d.-moore-combat.jpg?itok=mYn-ibfl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ronald D. Moore's&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>show sounds like it'll be a pretty direct adaptation of the 2018 game.</figcaption></figure><p>Speaking to <a href="https://collider.com/god-of-war-series-adaptation-prime-video-update-ron-moore/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Collider</a> a few days ago, Moore said that his show will be an "adaptation-slsh-interpretation" of the&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>universe, and that while the showrunners want to keep the story and characters, there's "a lot here [they] can play with".</p>

<p>Moore refused to be drawn on how many seasons the&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>TV show would span, however. He says he's focusing on the task at hand rather than looking too far into the future, so we don't know how long the show will run.</p>

<p>He does, however, confirm that filming hasn't yet started on&nbsp;<em>God of War</em>, and that the process is unlikely to begin until next year at the very earliest. Sounds like it's going to be quite a while before&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>comes to Prime Video, then.</p>

It's hard to say right now.</figcaption></figure><p>It looks as though this&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>series will be all you're getting in terms of&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>for the foreseeable future, at any rate. No third game in the Norse series has been confirmed, and it was reported back in January that Sony <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-live-service-games-canceled" rel="nofollow">had canceled</a> an in-development live-service&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>spinoff.</p>

<p>Ronald D. Moore's&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>show is set to debut on Prime Video at some point in the future. Here's hoping Kratos' companions <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/god-of-war-ragnarok-please-shut-up-mod" rel="nofollow">are a little more muted</a> than they are in 2021's&nbsp;<em>God of War Ragnarok</em>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-gamescom-demo</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hollow-knight-silksong-gamescom-demo-coming-as-release-window-looms.1255011/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Xbox has revealed its plans for this August's Gamescom show, and among them is a playable demo of&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>, although unfortunately, the demo is only for show attendees.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/28/xbox-gamescom-2025/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement post</a> on Xbox Wire, Xbox reveals it will be giving Gamescom ticket holders a chance to check out <i>Silksong</i>&nbsp;on either PC or the new ROG Xbox Ally X handheld, which was revealed during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">this summer's Xbox showcase</a>.</p>

<p><em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>isn't the only game attendees will be able to play, either; they'll also be able to check out upcoming games like&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em>,&nbsp;<em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em>, among others.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hollow-knight-silksong-gamescom-demo-hornet.jpg?itok=F4A3aIM1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hollow-knight-silksong-gamescom-demo-hornet.jpg?itok=YgPj0Snu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>will be playable at this year's Gamescom event.</figcaption></figure><p>Xbox is also promising a new "theater presentation" for its upcoming RPG&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>, which, it turns out, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-outer-worlds-2-70-dollars-xbox" rel="nofollow">won't cost $80 as previously announced</a>, but a far more sensible $70. That's alongside "a couple more surprises at the show".</p>

<p>If you're somehow not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>, it's the long-awaited followup to Team Cherry's acclaimed 2017 Metroidvania&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight</em>. This sequel will focus on Hornet, a character who featured prominently in the original game, as she explores a brand new kingdom.</p>

<p><em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>has become something of a meme in the gaming community; it was announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-is-hollow-knight-sequel-youve-been-waiting-for" rel="nofollow">all the way back in 2019</a>, and since then, Team Cherry has been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-still-tba" rel="nofollow">evasive</a> regarding the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-delayed" rel="nofollow">release date</a>, as well as further details about its story or specifics for its gameplay.</p>

<p>However, during the aforementioned Xbox summer showcase this year, Team Cherry's Matt Griffin confirmed that&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>was due to release sometime before Christmas this year. Hooray!</p>




<p>If&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>doesn't get a release date in the next couple of weeks, I'll be very surprised indeed. Far more pertinent is the question of whether Team Cherry's next game will have been worth the six-year wait. We'll have to wait (a little longer) and see, I suppose.</p>
