            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Warhorse Studios and publisher Deep Silver have announced the final&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II&nbsp;</em>story DLC, and it'll take Henry to a plague-stricken monastery to investigate the deadly disease's origin next month.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Mysteria Ecclesiae&nbsp;</em>will serve as the celebrated medieval RPG's last major expansion, and it's set for release across all platforms on November 11th.</p>

<p>In&nbsp;<em>Mysteria Ecclesiae</em>, you'll serve as the assistant to renowned healer Sigismund Albicus, and together with that venerated figure, you'll be investigating the Sedletz Monastery, where "a web of intrigue and a deadly, mysterious plague" await you, as well as factions with their own "hidden motives".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-final-dlc-monastery.jpg?itok=dXRM_Tco 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-final-dlc-monastery.jpg?itok=HRYkLbut 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II&nbsp;</em>is getting one final story DLC next month.</figcaption></figure><p>As you'd probably expect from&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em>, the Sedletz Monastery will be a "historically accurate" area in which you can expect "diverse areas" to explore, as well as "hidden secrets" to uncover.</p>

<p>Naturally, you'll also be able to take advantage of a brand new outfit for Henry, as well as new weapons, potions, and books to help you "expand [your] knowledge and abilities to new horizons". In short, if you loved the base game, it'll almost certainly be worth checking this DLC out.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em>, it's the sequel to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-sales-8m" rel="nofollow">hugely successful</a> 2018 action RPG&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em>, and like its predecessor, the sequel emphasizes historical realism and accuracy over fantasy elements.</p>

<p>You'll once again take the role of Henry of Skalitz as he sets out on a journey to avenge the murder of his parents, and along the way, you'll discover plenty of medieval court intrigue to get wrapped up in.</p>




<p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II&nbsp;</em>is no slouch in the sales department either; at last count, the game had managed to rack up <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-3m" rel="nofollow">three million sales for itself</a>, and it's almost certainly topped that figure by now as well.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Mysteria Ecclesiae&nbsp;</em>expansion when it launches on November 11th. The game itself is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1771300/Kingdom_Come_Deliverance_II/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/9N4W31HSMVVD" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and you can read our review <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-review-deliciously-executed-revenge" rel="nofollow">right here</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Elden Ring Switch 2 Version Delayed for "Performance Adjustments"]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-switch-2-delayed-2026</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-switch-2-version-delayed-for-performance-adjustments.1332985/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer FromSoftware and publisher Bandai Namco have announced that the upcoming Switch 2 version of celebrated open-world action RPG&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>has been delayed into next year.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1981360180580217143" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message</a> on social media, the two studios say that while development on the game's Switch 2 port "continues wholeheartedly towards release", a delay is necessary in order for the developers to implement "performance adjustments".</p>

<p>No new release date has been given; all we know is that&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition</em>, for 'tis its name, is now due to arrive on Nintendo's new console sometime in 2026.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-switch-2-delayed-margit.jpg?itok=ggS7d90b 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-switch-2-delayed-margit.jpg?itok=7L1R1DRX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>won't be hitting the Switch 2 this year.</figcaption></figure><p>News of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s delay on Switch 2 follows reports that the game's performance on the console was lackluster, to say the least; during a hands-on at Gamescom, IGN <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/elden-ring-on-switch-2-is-a-disaster-in-handheld-mode-gamescom-2025" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">described</a>&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s Switch 2 handheld performance as "a disaster".</p>

<p>The publication said that frame drops were "significant" when turning the camera outside of the game's initial tutorial area, and that the Switch 2 version of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>also sported a "confusing button layout", which is odd considering the console's controller setup is pretty much the same as any other.</p>

<p>IGN didn't say anything about&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s docked performance on Switch 2, but it presumably won't fare much better than the handheld version, so hopefully, this extra time gives FromSoftware and Bandai Namco time to polish up&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>on Nintendo's new machine before release.</p>

<p>When it does eventually launch,&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition&nbsp;</em>will bring the full game experience to Switch 2, including last year's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree" rel="nofollow">excellent</a>&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>DLC and all updates that have been released since the game's initial 2022 launch.</p>




<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition&nbsp;</em>when it launches sometime next year on Switch 2, and the game is also currently available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1245620/ELDEN_RING/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/elden-ring/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/elden-ring/9P3J32CTXLRZ/0010" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a> (albeit with the DLC sold separately).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has announced&nbsp;<em>Mega Rising</em>, the latest expansion for the mobile smash hit&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>, and it's due to bring a game-changing new set of 'mons to the digital card game next week.</p>

<p>Launching on October 29th,&nbsp;<em>Mega Rising&nbsp;</em>makes good on a promise made by The Pokemon Company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mega-evolution-fall" rel="nofollow">back in August</a>&nbsp;by introducing Mega Evolved Pokemon into the mix. As you'd imagine, these are powerful cards, but they come with risks, too.</p>

<p>Mega Evolved Pokemon will have higher stats and attack power than regular creatures, but if you manage to knock them out, you'll win three whole points for yourself. That's right; defeating a Mega Evolved Pokemon wins you the match, regardless of where things currently stand.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mega-rising-cards.jpg?itok=AOziJHCb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mega-rising-cards.jpg?itok=G8yqf7Kh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>'s new&nbsp;<em>Mega Rising&nbsp;</em>expansion has plenty of Mega Evolved cards for you to admire.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, just like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-wisdom-of-sea-and-sky-expansion" rel="nofollow">previous</a>&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-expansion-shining-revelry" rel="nofollow">expansions</a>, you can expect a bevy of new cards to collect and admire in&nbsp;<em>Mega Rising&nbsp;</em>as well, and some of the artwork for these cards is truly jaw-dropping. Here's hoping its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-ho-oh-production-issue-plagiarism" rel="nofollow">provenance is legit this time</a>, eh?</p>

<p>Mega Evolved 'mons include the likes of Blaziken, Gyarados, and Altaria, and you can also expect new art for existing Pokemon like Pidgey, Growlithe, and Jirachi, among others. It's a real smorgasbord of beautiful Pokemon drawings.</p>

<p>Not only that, but you can also look forward to accessories based on Mega Blaziken, which will be available starting from October 31st to give you the opportunity to "make your hottest cards look even more scorching".</p>

<p>You can take a look at the (appropriately epic) announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Mega Rising&nbsp;</em>expansion, which shows off some of the expansion's beautiful artwork and new cards, right here.</p>




<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Mega Rising&nbsp;</em>expansion when it launches on October 29th. The game is available to play for free right now on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.pokemon.pokemontcgp&amp;hl=en_GB" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pok%C3%A9mon-tcg-pocket/id6479970832" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">iOS</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-xbox-profit-margins-30-percent-report</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-reportedly-pushing-xbox-to-hit-sky-high-30-profit-margins.1332976/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Xbox is reportedly being pushed by parent company Microsoft to achieve profit margins far in excess of those towards which the rest of the industry aims, according to a new report.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-23/microsoft-pushes-xbox-studios-to-hit-higher-profit-margins" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a> (which, of course, cites "people familiar with the business"), Microsoft has set goals of 30% for Xbox's "accountability margins", which is apparently the term Microsoft uses instead of "profit margins". Start brushing up on those corpo-jargon dictionaries now.</p>

<p>Bloomberg reports that average industry profit margins sit between 17% and 22%. Xbox's have generally been lower than that over the past few years at between 10% and 20%, so this 30% profit goal is a massive jump even for Xbox, let alone for the rest of the industry.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-outer-worlds-2-xbox-profit-report.jpg?itok=q8T0vi_o 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-outer-worlds-2-xbox-profit-report.jpg?itok=fzU76ZfK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Xbox is reportedly being pushed to hit 30% profit margins by overlo-er, parent company Microsoft.</figcaption></figure><p>S&amp;P Global analyst Neil Barbour told Bloomberg that the 30% target is one "usually reserved for a publisher that is really nailing it". Given the controversy surrounding <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-tiers-reworked-2025" rel="nofollow">recent Game Pass changes</a>, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">project cancellations</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" rel="nofollow">layoffs</a>, I'd say you'd struggle to apply that descriptor to Xbox right now.</p>

<p>Speaking of Game Pass, Bloomberg's sources say that Xbox's requirement for all first-party games to launch on Game Pass on day one "has hurt Xbox game sales".</p>

<p>According to Bloomberg, Xbox offers a developer incentive that is calculated based on "several factors", one of which is the number of hours players spend on Game Pass titles. Naturally, that means these rewards will be given more often to developers of live-service titles or those without finite campaigns.</p>

<p>In previous years, Xbox staff weren't given specific numerical figures as profit goals; this change, according to Bloomberg, came in 2023 and was introduced by CFO Amy Hood, who's been taking "a larger role in the gaming business" alongside her team recently.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-game-pass-xbox-profit-margin-report.jpg?itok=N5fYh_Q6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-game-pass-xbox-profit-margin-report.jpg?itok=RUcgzQTr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Game Pass apparently continues to cause problems for Xbox developers.</figcaption></figure><p>This isn't the first time we've heard of Game Pass reportedly causing problems for developers and Xbox insiders. Back in September, former Xbox VP Shannon Loftis said the service <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-shannon-loftis-comments" rel="nofollow">creates "weird inner tensions" among developers</a>, with Game Pass adoption coming "at the expense of retail revenue".</p>

<p>It's not hard to see how that might make hitting the aforementioned 30% profit margin difficult, and if Bloomberg's report is to be believed, the publisher is still being expected to hit this target even when taking day one Game Pass games into account.</p>

<p>If it's accurate, the 30% profit margin figure might explain some of Xbox's recent moves, including hiking the price of Game Pass, cancelling projects left and right, and shutting down studios.</p>

<p>For its own part, Xbox told Bloomberg that success "doesn't look the same across every project", and that the company sometimes has to make "hard decisions" while "shifting resources towards the projects that are more aligned with [its] direction and priorities".</p>

<h2>Choices Matter in a Colorful World</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rift-anomaly-outer-worlds-2.jpg?itok=wdqu51no 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rift-anomaly-outer-worlds-2.jpg?itok=2PkkWtal 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The main story is relatively straightforward, with some minor plot twists added in. You have six Companions you can recruit, starting right off the bat with two of them. You can go solo, with a single partner, or bring a max of two people with you when you leave your ship, the Incognito.</p>

<p>There are a variety of areas to explore, but many can feel too hard too quickly if you just follow the main quests. Upgrading your weapons and armor, as well as completing companion quests, are requirements for moving forward without struggling. While this is the case for many RPGs, it feels like side quests are more necessary than optional.</p>

<p>Speaking of side quests, they are the real star of&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>. I don't mean the Companion quests, which can often be resolved with little to no combat. Side quests have you hunting for Manticore pupa, taking out scavengers, finding magazine issues, or finding patent schematics. These involve combat, use a variety of skills, can bring you to new places, or offer a trophy for the Incognito.</p>

<p>While most of the main quests use the same skills or traits, these other missions give you more opportunities to explore what makes your Commander unique, hone in on your individual playstyle, and potentially earn some sweet perks.&nbsp;While all the writing is passable, the side quests are where the different, and often wacky, personalities shine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The most interesting aspect of&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>&nbsp;is how your actions, or lack of actions, impact the game. This can be seen quickly, as well as in the long term. Some decisions can cause you to lose companions, be attacked on sight by a whole faction, or destroy a location. These change the general feeling of the game, while the main narrative stays the same. Your interactions with companions and NPCs can take on a completely different tone and direction.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bibliomania-flaw-outer-worlds-2.jpg?itok=Pa5ve57O 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bibliomania-flaw-outer-worlds-2.jpg?itok=ciPdEeh- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Large choices obviously have larger consequences, but small actions also have an effect. As you progress through the game, you'll start racking up Flaws. Crouch often? You may have a Flaw discovered that your knees start to crack, reducing your stealth. If you steal frequently, you may end up as a Kleptomaniac, causing you to steal regardless of your current surroundings when you hover over an item. You don't have to accept a Flaw, but they can open new avenues for you to experience the title.</p>

<h2>More of the Same</h2>

<p>Even though there are a number of Flaws that can influence your playthroughs,&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>&nbsp;story focuses on the utilization of very few traits, skills, or perks. When it comes to impact, many of the perks you can select, and about half of the skills, don't seem to really affect the overall gameplay. All you need is Lockpicking, Brawny, Hack, Science, and Leadership (or Speech) to make it through the storyline quickly and easily. By the time that I reached the endgame, it was apparent that you should focus on three or four Skills and ignore the rest to reach the high-level requirements seen in the final missions.</p>

<p>The main way the majority of Traits and Skills are seen is through different dialogue options. Outside of that, interacting with the world, completing quests, or finding unique items, mainly require the same things over and over again. Even talking to people with specialized dialogue can become repetitive.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/outer-worlds-2-perks-menu-scrabbles-perk-description.jpg?itok=NcufFWYE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/outer-worlds-2-perks-menu-scrabbles-perk-description.jpg?itok=EqIqU-hx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Repetition isn't necessarily bad, especially when dealing with the strict dogma ingrained in the three factions found in <i>The Outer Worlds 2</i>. Getting the extent of brainwashing or cultural control across is one of the themes present. It gets to the point, however, that the game becomes uninteresting. It doesn't necessarily reach the level of boring, but there were quite a few conversations I skipped through because they sounded exactly like the one before it, or my dialogue resulted in the same conclusions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On top of that, there were a couple of bugs that impacted the game. Loot chests not disappearing off the mini map, bodies dematerializing without creating an ash or goo pile, NPCs or enemies spawning partially in the environment, and game crashes made the experience less than streamlined. Most of the bugs don't greatly impact a playthrough. Other bugs could be occurring that make playing the title difficult, including one experienced by a colleague that pretty much blocks them from using guns at any point in time.</p>

<p>Compared to other single-player RPG releases this year,&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>&nbsp;just falls flat. While there's nothing intrinsically wrong with the game, there's nothing that makes it stand out against star performers like <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="07f3b1f2-234f-4782-8556-c21c1fb23302" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-french-revolution" rel="nofollow">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>.</em>&nbsp;There wasn't any amazing writing, the focus on different societal structures and themes felt surface-level, and repetitive interactions made the title uninteresting. There was no hook that kept me wanting to play beyond reaching the end of the main story in the hopes that something amazing would wow me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For fans of&nbsp;<em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="cd8a1852-2307-4184-b0df-b9afab69154e" href="https://techraptor.net/games/outer-worlds" rel="nofollow">The Outer Worlds</a>,&nbsp;</em>the sequel is more of the same. Newcomers to the franchise can find humor laced throughout the game, unique weapons, and a mostly bug-free experience. Those looking for exquisite writing with a fresh take on RPG mechanics will not find great pleasure in&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>.&nbsp;</p>
