            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/forest-reigns-ex-stalker-devs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher VG Entertainment, formerly known as Vostok Games, has announced&nbsp;<em>Forest Reigns</em>, a narrative-driven survival FPS set in the ruins of an alt-future post-pandemic Paris.</p>

<p>In the game's world, Paris has been "transformed by nature's fury" into a lush, verdant, and hostile paradise. You'll be able to see "iconic landmarks" (and I'm sure you can guess which ones) transformed by nature retaking the city as you explore and scavenge resources to survive.</p>

<p>Vostok Games says that in&nbsp;<em>Forest Reigns</em>, as the title suggests, the forest itself will play a major role. It's effectively being treated as "an intelligence" rather than a backdrop; attacking it will cause it to respond with hostility, but approaching it with "caution" could see it aid you as your ally.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/forest-reigns-announced-paris.jpg?itok=L8ielTaQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/forest-reigns-announced-paris.jpg?itok=Lj-I5Hvp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Forest Reigns&nbsp;</em>will let you loose in the ruins of post-apocalyptic Paris.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Forest Reigns&nbsp;</em>will apparently also feature "realistic weapon handling" and plenty of "customizable gear" so that you can build your own distinctive arsenal as you traverse the overgrown streets of Paris.</p>

<p>As befits a game developed by ex-<em>Stalker&nbsp;</em>luminaries, you can also look forward to a "non-linear story" with plenty of missions to complete, many of which will put you in touch with one of the city's four factions. Each one has a "unique vision" for how humanity should proceed after the apocalypse.</p>

<p>Studio head Ruslan Didenko says&nbsp;<em>Forest Reigns&nbsp;</em>represents "the most daring concept" the studio has ever explored, and that his team is returning to its "roots" by creating a single-player FPS with a narrative focus.</p>

<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Forest Reigns</em>, which should give you a good idea of what kind of art style the game is going for, right here.</p>




<p>You might know VG Entertainment better as Vostok Games, the studio behind <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-stalker-devs-fear-wolves-to-enter-early-access-next-week" rel="nofollow">battle royale title&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-stalker-devs-fear-wolves-to-enter-early-access-next-week" rel="nofollow">Fear the Wolves</a>&nbsp;</em>and free-to-play FPS&nbsp;<em>Survivarium</em>, both of which have now shut down.</p>

<p>Given that it's a single-player title, the same fate is unlikely to befall&nbsp;<em>Forest Reigns</em>, so let's hope it gets finished in a timely fashion. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3325070/Forest_Reigns/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wishlist it right now on Steam</a> if you want to keep up with its progress.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/aloft-preview</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/aloft-preview-empty-skies.1081938/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/aloft-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Early Access. Survival. Crafting. It’s a combo that you’re likely familiar with if you’ve spent a reasonable amount of time browsing the Steam store. <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="27306349-cc50-4431-8f1d-c08818c5fe74" href="https://techraptor.net/games/aloft" rel="nofollow"><em>Aloft</em></a> is the next in a long (and seemingly never-ending) line of these games, aiming to carve its own slice of the survival crafting pie.</p>

<p><em>Aloft </em>doesn’t make the strongest first impression, unceremoniously dumping you into a cave after limited character and world creation. Your only real hint at what’s going on is a single sentence during the loading screen, which talks about an “eternal storm” leading you to a broken world.</p>

<p>It doesn’t take long before you go through the motions of any survival game, picking up stray wood and stone to craft a hammer that will serve you for hours to come. From there, you learn how to build platforms, more items, and tools, then escape your rocky confinement into the outside world.</p>



<p>This outside world is where <em>Aloft</em>’s main selling point comes into play. Rather than one large open map to explore, this is a world made up of many smaller islands. After crafting a glider and flying out to neighboring islands, you soon learn how to create various sailing parts like a helm and sails.</p>

<p>Rather than crafting some sort of airship, you instead use these parts to commandeer one of the aforementioned islands. Once claimed, an island acts not only as a base of operations but also as the main way to traverse across the vast sky.</p>

<p>Traversing is something you’ll be doing a lot of. While worlds are randomly generated, they each follow a set pattern: each world is split into three rings, with each ring split into sections on the map. Sections are populated with clusters of islands, with some holding key points of interest.</p>

<p>Exploring islands is <em>Aloft</em>’s main gameplay loop, as you scour them for resources and crafting recipes. Cutting down trees, opening treasure chests, it’s all that you’d expect from a survival crafting game.</p>

<p>Where things differ is the island ecosystem mechanic. Some islands you come across will be in a state of decay, missing certain vital parts to keep the ecosystem alive. This can range from not enough animals to a lack of fungi or flora.</p>



<p>Most resources on the island stay locked until you satisfy all conditions, which are easy enough to check via a craftable field guide. At first, I thought this could be an interesting way to have the player think about their impact on the environment, carefully picking and choosing resources instead of ransacking everything.</p>

<p>Instead, it’s a shallow system that rarely impacts your playstyle. Most of the time you can just leave islands that require extra work, opting to find one that has a complete ecosystem instead. Even if you do choose to fix things, it’s generally little more than planting a row of flora or trees.</p>

<p>Aloft is full of these shallow mechanics and systems, most of which barely increase in complexity by the time you reach the end of Early Access content.</p>

<p>Combat is simple — all tools double up as weapons — and is clearly not a big focus. In fact, there are only three enemy types, alongside some larger growths that impede progress on some islands. The only real times I found myself in danger was thanks to lag spikes, something relatively common on any of the bigger islands.</p>



<p>This has the knock-on effect of making cooking mostly inconsequential right now. You can forage or grow a number of crops, with <em>Aloft </em>currently allowing you to cook a wide variety of dishes. But most serve very little purpose right now, especially since dying has no consequences.</p>

<p>I found myself crafting little more than basic clean water, since that allowed me to swing faster — a useful buff for both combat and gathering. This also serves the double purpose of staving off the desert heat in<em> Aloft</em>’s current final biome, though even that has very little going on right now.</p>

<p>As of the Early Access launch, <em>Aloft </em>only contains three biomes — two are almost identical, with the last being desert-themed. On top of this, there's a noticeably limited pool of islands that be spawned into a world. You’ll run into the same islands many times, with most having no defining features or reasons to visit.</p>

<p>To stop you from just making a beeline for the next map marker, the world throws a couple of roadblocks at you. Between the outer and middle rings on each side, you’ll have to make it through a field of floating rocks. The south and north sides of the map require progressively better sails, with the crafting recipes being found on random islands.</p>



<p>Because of this, you end up reaching a new cluster of islands, giving them a quick look for said recipes, then moving on to the next. With how plentiful most resources are, there’s not much point in lingering unless you really need to.</p>

<p>In between islands, you’ll use your trusty island-turned-ship, fitting it with new sails to go faster or one of many crafting stations. Crafting is all there really is to do when traveling to a new island, as there are no random events or items to look out for. You'll likely find yourself tabbing out often since you'll otherwise be waiting for minutes with nothing to do.</p>

<p>And honestly, that’s mainly my problem with <em>Aloft</em> right now. After a few hours, the gameplay loop ends up as a bland mix of quickly checking repetitive islands, and then spending my time away from the game while your ship makes its way forward.</p>

<p>Releasing too soon is a pitfall I’ve seen Early Access games like <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c8e4ab6f-2b6f-4d5c-93ad-467e250af935" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/nightingale-preview" rel="nofollow">Nightingale</a> fall into, and I wonder if<em> Aloft </em>has done the same thing. Realistically there are only a few hours of actual meaningful content here, stretched out across 15-20 hours or so of repetitive exploration before you exhaust everything.</p>

<p>More can absolutely be added during Early Access, with the Steam store page promising more biomes and “challenges to overcome”. But as of right now, a unique gimmick doesn’t set <em>Aloft </em>apart from other, more engaging titles.</p>

<hr><p><em><strong>Aloft</strong> was previewed over 25 hours of gameplay on PC via Steam with a key provided by the publisher. All screenshots were taken during the preview process.</em></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/planet-coaster-2-roadmap-spring</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/planet-coaster-2-roadmap-for-spring-includes-new-rides-and-more.1081935/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/planet-coaster-2-roadmap-spring<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Frontier has released a brand new&nbsp;<em>Planet Coaster 2&nbsp;</em>roadmap for spring, and it's promising new rides, gameplay improvements, and more for the theme park management sim.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2688950/view/547849766230295443" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post on Steam</a>, Frontier reveals the full roadmap, which covers the period between February and May. It begins with Update 2, which will arrive in February, bringing with it custom billboards and speakers, new rides, and several adjustments to the core gameplay.</p>

<p>Following that, you can expect Update 3 in March. That one will bring more guest and raft movement on special pieces, as well as more stock coasters, a returning ride from the original&nbsp;<em>Planet Coaster</em>, and more gameplay improvements.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/planet-coaster-2-roadmap-spring-full.jpg?itok=Q3F94g0e 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/planet-coaster-2-roadmap-spring-full.jpg?itok=679Sjxvb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Planet Coaster 2&nbsp;</em>is getting lots of new stuff in spring.</figcaption></figure><p>More updates are on their way in April and May, but Frontier is remaining cagey about exactly what those updates will contain. Suffice it to say they'll probably be on the same level as the preceding two, so expect new rides, gameplay improvements, and other stuff.</p>

<p>Whether or not this roadmap will be enough to placate&nbsp;<em>Planet Coaster 2</em>'s more vocal critics remains to be seen, but I think it's unlikely. There's nothing particularly transformative here.</p>

<p>At time of writing,&nbsp;<em>Planet Coaster 2&nbsp;</em>was sitting at a rather disappointing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2688950/Planet_Coaster_2/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Mixed rating</a> on Steam, with over 6,600 reviewers weighing in on the theme park management sim.</p>

<p>Complaints include Frontier's approach to the release of DLC, as well as technical issues, unintuitive gameplay, and a lack of features when compared to the first&nbsp;<em>Planet Coaster</em>. I think it's probably going to take more than a few extra bits and bobs to convince some of these players the sequel was worth it.</p>




<p><em>Planet Coaster 2&nbsp;</em>was released for PC and current-gen consoles <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/planet-coaster-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">back in November</a>. It's the sequel to the original&nbsp;<em>Planet Coaster</em>, and it boasts a new focus on waterpark features, as well as gameplay improvements and more.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Planet Coaster 2&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2688950/Planet_Coaster_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10009610" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/planet-coaster-2/9PK5WS0HXQKQ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Until Dawn Movie Actually Looks Kind of Interesting]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/until-dawn-movie-first-look</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-until-dawn-movie-actually-looks-kind-of-interesting.1081857/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/until-dawn-movie-first-look<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has released a first-look trailer for the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>movie, which is set to land in theaters in April, and it actually looks like the folks behind the movie have some interesting ideas for the project.</p>

<p>The trailer is more of a teaser than a deep dive, but it does feature talking heads like writer Gary Dauberman, director David F. Sandberg, and actor Peter Stormare. If you've played&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn</em>, you'll know Stormare appears in the game as the sinister Dr. Hill, a role he's set to reprise in the movie.</p>

<p>Encouragingly, Dauberman says he's a "huge fan" of&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn</em>, and that his goal for the movie was to "continue the story" rather than simply "giving the audience the same experience" as they had playing the game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/until-dawn-movie-first-look-header.jpg?itok=ICXLQOP2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/until-dawn-movie-first-look-header.jpg?itok=s5HtQJb9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>movie won't just retell the story of the game.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Sandberg, the movie will sport "the same tone and the same vibe" as the game, but it "expands upon the universe", so it won't just be a straight retelling of&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn</em>'s story.</p>

<p>Sandberg goes on to praise&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn</em>'s system in which players make choices and see different deaths as a result, revealing that he's incorporated a form of this mechanic into the movie.</p>

<p>When characters die in the movie, Sandberg says "things start over and they get to try again", and that every time characters die, they're essentially revived "in a new horror genre".</p>

<p>Honestly, this approach is a lot more creative than I was expecting; I was fully prepared for&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>to be a generic slasher that limped out into theaters and was swiftly forgotten, but mercifully, it seems that's not the approach the team is taking.</p>




<p>The&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>movie is set to arrive in theaters on April 25th, with a full trailer coming "soon", according to Sony. In the meantime, if you want your&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>fix, you can play the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/until-dawn-remake-release-date" rel="nofollow">recently-released remake</a>, although you'd certainly be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/until-dawn-remake-ps5-player-count-concord" rel="nofollow">one of very few who did</a>.</p>
