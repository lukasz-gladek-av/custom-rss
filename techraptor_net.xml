            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Moon Beast Productions, a studio founded by a group of veterans from the <em>Diablo </em>series, has announced its inaugural project <em>Darkhaven</em>, a "next-generation action RPG" that promises to offer a dynamic and reactive world.</p><p>As you'd probably expect from folks who've worked on <em>Diablo</em>, <em>Darkhaven </em>is quite similar to Blizzard's ARPG series. Moon Beast says the game "returns to the genre's roots while pushing it forward", which is a pretty ambitious goal.</p><p>According to Moon Beast, <em>Darkhaven </em>will accommodate "solo play, co-operative adventures, and high-stakes PvP-enabled realms", and will be designed around all three of them. It's safe to say this one is reaching for the moon, as it were.</p><figure role="group">

<p>The world of <em>Darkhaven </em>will apparently be "procedurally generated, fully dynamic, and persistent", meaning that you'll be able to deform terrain and build upon it if you want to.</p><p>Moon Beast is promising seasons that change, weather that "alters combat and traversal", and world-altering events that leave "permanent scars" upon the world. We will, of course, have to wait and see just how substantial those promises are.</p><p>In combat terms, <em>Darkhaven </em>is perhaps promising a more holistic experience than <em>Diablo </em>or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/path-of-exile-2-hands-off-preview-ranger" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ae9db8ce-ce51-4048-811d-7be0b0523331" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">other descendants like <em>Path of Exile</em></a>. Since you can "jump, climb, swim, dash, and traverse the world freely", combat takes on an extra dimension "rarely seen in the genre", Moon Beast says.</p><p>Perhaps most intriguingly, Moon Beast says <em>Darkhaven </em>will reject what it calls the "incrementalism common in many modern titles" in favor of a loot system that's "bold [and] expressive", with each item being "capable of redefining builds rather than merely optimizing them".</p>
<p>At the very least, <em>Darkhaven </em>has a solid pedigree behind it. Moon Beast's staffers include the likes of <em>Diablo II </em>programmer Peter Hu and lead artist Philip Shenk, as well as Erich Schaefer, a designer on both <em>Diablo II </em>and its predecessor.</p><p>Right now, <em>Darkhaven </em>doesn't have a release date, but the devs are planning to <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/moonbeastproductions/darkhaven-an-action-rpg-with-dynamic-worlds" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">launch a Kickstarter campaign</a> soon to help them bring the project into Early Access. While you wait, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3571870/Darkhaven/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">wishlist the game on Steam</a> if you want to keep up with its progress.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
