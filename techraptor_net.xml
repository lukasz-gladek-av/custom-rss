            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Steve Jackson Games has announced a revival of their Saturday morning cartoon TTRPG. The aptly named <em>Toon Second Edition</em> brings back an updated version of the 1984 original with some welcome modern touches, courtesy of an upcoming crowdfunding campaign.</p><h2>The <em>Toon Second Edition</em> Announcement</h2><p>According to its <a href="https://www.backerkit.com/call_to_action/a5976d11-0069-4119-acf2-4d16a54cf8db/landing" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Backerkit page</a>, <em>Toon Second Edition</em> is all about bringing the exaggerated, cartooonish, antics of classic <em>Looney Tunes</em> to a tabletop scenario. It's a game that runs on cartoon logic. No one dies, no matter how many times they are flattened by falling pianos and anvils; they're just temporarily taken out.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>Naturally, the game is easy to learn and perfect for families looking for some old-school cartoon slapstick fun. The original release was notable for its tongue-in-cheek tone, parodying the rules and systems of more "serious" role-playing games on the market, like classic <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>. The core design of the game even encouraged players to act with wild abandon, with advice like, "Act Before You Think."</p><p>Essentially, anything you can imagine happening during a <em>Looney Tunes</em> short is possible in Toon. The GM, or Animator, changing the environment to engineer cartoonish comeuppance. Characters breaking the fourth wall for the sake of a gag. All of it is here.</p><p><em>Toon Second Edition</em> will include new quality-of-life improvements. This includes simplified character designs, enabling faster play, over a dozen customizable cartoon adventures, and improved Silly Tables. For fans of the original, this new rulebook will feature full-color artwork by the original artist, Kyle Miller.</p><p><em>Toon Second Edition</em> is designed by Greg Costikyan (<em>Pax Britannica</em>), developed by Warren Spector (<em>Bullwinkle and Rocky Roleplaying Game</em>, <em>The Thing in the Darkness</em>), and revised by Steve Jackson (<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/munchkin-big-box-brings-definitive-game-to-backerkit" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Munchkin</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/fighting-fantasy-set-2-kickstarter-is-crowdfunding-critical-success" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Fighting Fantasy</em></a>).</p><p>The Backerkit campaign for <em>Toon Second Edition</em> will go live on December 17, 2025. The campaign will provide PDFs, softcover, and hardcover book options.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
