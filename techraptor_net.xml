            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has revealed who's going to be looking after the <em>Assassin's Creed </em>franchise from now on, and three figures with plenty of past experience with the series will be taking the reins.</p><p>The announcement, which was made <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1rclibk/an_update_on_the_future_of_assassins_creed_meet/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">via Reddit</a> earlier today, names Martin Schelling as <em>Assassin's Creed</em>'s new "Head of Brand". Schelling will "lead the franchise team, as well as the overall strategy", according to Ubisoft. He's previously served as producer on games like <em>Black Flag </em>and <em>Valhalla</em>.</p><p>Joining Schelling at the helm of <em>Assassin's Creed </em>is Jean Guesdon, who was creative director on both <em>Black Flag </em>and <em>Origins</em>. He'll now be serving as "Head of Content", which will see him leading the franchise's "creative direction" and shaping its future "while ensuring it remains true to its DNA".</p><figure role="group">

<p>The final new <em>Assassin's Creed </em>appointment is Francois de Billy, who will serve in the rather oddly-named role of "Head of Production Excellence".</p><p>Apparently, it'll be de Billy's responsibility to "strengthen production practices and execution across the franchise". He was <em>Origins </em>and <em>Valhalla</em>'s Production Director, and he's also worked on "several major <em>Assassin's Creed </em>titles", including <em>Black Flag </em>and <em>Revelations</em>.</p><p>Between them, these three men will form <em>Assassin's Creed</em>'s new franchise leadership team, and Ubisoft says they'll "bring their expertise, knowledge, and passion to guide <em>Assassin's Creed </em>into its next chapter".</p><p>News of this team's formation comes after longtime <em>Assassin's Creed </em>boss Marc-Alexis Côté <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-boss-leaves-ubisoft-report" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bedd26ab-2db9-443d-9a58-5d57561ce134" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">departed Ubisoft back in October</a>, with Côté <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-assassins-creed-boss-suing-ubisoft" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="da42bb57-e4f1-4a65-91eb-9ce61dfcfee5" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">subsequently suing Ubisoft to the tune of more than $1.3 million</a> and claiming "constructive dismissal".</p><figure role="group">

            <title><![CDATA[Nacon Connect 2026 Set for March, Cthulhu to Preside]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nacon-connect-2026-announced</link>
            <guid>1443820</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The next Nacon Connect's time and date have been revealed, and the publisher will be showing off games from its upcoming catalog, including <em>Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss</em>, <em>The Mound: Omen of Cthulhu</em>, and <em>Endurance Motorsport Series: Cthulhu Rising </em>(at least, I hope so).</p><p>As revealed via a new teaser trailer, Nacon Connect 2026 will take place on March 4th at 11am PT (that's 2pm Eastern and 7pm GMT). Nacon says it will include game announcements, new gameplay footage for existing titles, and more.</p><p>Specifically, in a press release, Nacon names the aforementioned three games, as well as upcoming RPG <em>Edge of Memories</em>, as feature titles for the presentation. There's no mention of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/terminator-survivors-delayed-multiplayer-canceled" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="40d94db3-1851-4626-9b66-e2ef8936ec01" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">recently-delayed <em>Terminator: Survivors</em></a>, though, so it could be a while before we hear more about that one.</p><figure role="group">

</figure>
<p>As well as the aforementioned games, we'll also be getting a glimpse of "new projects" which Nacon says will "enrich [its] catalog". That seems to me like a curiously shareholder-focused way of putting it, but in any case, we'll get to see new Nacon games. Hooray!</p><p>It's likely that in addition to everything outlined above, Nacon will be showing new gameplay footage for <em>GreedFall 2: The Dying World</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/greedfall-2-release-date-march" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3f57a6c2-60c6-43d7-9e2d-1e4c4532b06a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">set to leave Early Access in March</a>. Whether it'll drum up enough hype for the RPG for a big sales boost remains to be seen, however.</p><p>This is also the first Nacon Connect since the publisher <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nacon-wrc-games-2027-2032" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1f3b1134-585a-4a3b-9274-678fe5c4558f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">took over the <em>WRC </em>game franchise</a> from EA and Codemasters back in May, and with the first new title in that series apparently due for 2027, now seems like the ideal time to reveal it.</p>
<p>We'll find out exactly what's being revealed at this year's Nacon Connect when the showcase airs on March 4th at 11am PT/2pm ET/7pm GMT. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things Nacon.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
