<p>What's more, if you pre-order <em>Icarus </em>on PS5 or Xbox Series X|S, you'll get access to the Pet Companions Pack DLC, which, as the name suggests, adds a number of adorable animals to pet and look after.</p><p>News of <em>Icarus</em>' console release date comes just a couple of weeks after Rocketwerkz and founder Dean Hall announced that the game had managed to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/icarus-sales-1m-steam-winter-sale" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c279503c-13a7-4443-b2c6-79704af33562" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">rack up almost a million sales for itself</a> during the most recent winter Steam Sale.</p><p>Hall also said that <em>Icarus </em>had managed to shift just shy of 250,000 "DLC units", although since the game has a number of smaller packs available in addition to its major expansion, that could just mean a whole bunch of what are effectively microtransaction purchases.</p><p>Just in case you're unfamiliar, <em>Icarus </em>is a survival game created by Dean Hall, one of the key players behind zombie sandbox <em>DayZ</em>. It's a PvE-focused affair that sees you (and, optionally, your squad) heading down to a planet on which terraforming has gone wrong and trying to survive its dangers.</p>
<p>You can check out <em>Icarus </em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1149460/ICARUS/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, and it's coming to <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10013354/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/icarus-console-edition/9P3H2PVZZPSD" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a> on February 26th.

<figcaption><em>Phasmophobia</em>'s 2026 roadmap has plenty in store for you.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Of course, <em>Phasmophobia </em>also has plenty of events planned throughout 2026, including a brand new one-time event and the return of old favorites like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-cursed-hollow-event" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="043f6095-0d10-420d-8bec-e56dd003d4b3" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Cursed Hollow</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-crimson-eye-update" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d3faae98-97a0-41cc-b045-74499b5ceb42" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Crimson Eye</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-winters-jest-event-2025" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="dff99f7f-c6cc-4e9a-976a-8a699b4b7222" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Winter's Jest</a>.</p><p><em>Phasmophobia </em>director Daniel Knight says he's hoping that the 1.0 release of <em>Phasmophobia</em>, which still doesn't have a date attached to it, will "feel as fresh and exciting as when the game first launched back in 2020". We can but hope.</p><p>If you're not familiar with <em>Phasmophobia</em>, it's a multiplayer-focused ghost-hunting game in which your goal is to enter haunted locations and document the phenomena that can be found within.</p><p>Each ghost type has a different method of identification attached to it, so you'll have to enter the location, discover what you're dealing with it, and grab evidence along the way.</p>
<p>Originally released for PC in 2020, <em>Phasmophobia </em>also launched on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-console-release-price-hike" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b5c7afc6-474a-46d3-a750-da8baf47813b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">in 2024</a>, following numerous delays. The game went on to sell <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-console-sales-3m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="13853f71-92e2-442d-8f9e-7f40fb0df251" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">over three million copies</a> on console alone, so it's safe to say this one has been a success.</p><p>Indeed, the revenue from <em>Phasmophobia </em>has helped Kinetic Games to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-kinetic-publishing" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a9440989-2808-4967-9bbd-65f067fd77ce" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">open up its own publishing division</a>, which will champion indie games that just need a little extra push to get over the finish line.</p><p><em>Phasmophobia </em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/739630/Phasmophobia/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/phasmophobia/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/phasmophobia-game-preview/9N6D60SBZN05" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a>.
