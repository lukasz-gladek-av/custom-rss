            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>publisher Playstack has announced&nbsp;<em>Raccoin</em>, a roguelike that blends strategic deckbuilding with the arcade thrills of coin-pusher machines, and it's getting a playtest very soon.</p>

<p>As revealed by Playstack and developer Doraccoon in a press release,&nbsp;<em>Raccoin&nbsp;</em>is a ""nonstop dopamine rush" in which you must utilize special coins, combos, and synergies to get the results you want from a classic arcade coin-pusher.</p>

<p>If all of this is starting to sound familiar, that's probably because you're one of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-5m" rel="nofollow">millions of people</a> who has played&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Raccoin&nbsp;</em>very much seems to be in the same vein; it looks to be attempting to do for coin-pushers what&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>did for poker.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/raccoin-playstack-gadget.jpg?itok=AgD07SwI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/raccoin-playstack-gadget.jpg?itok=FIgtO5x6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Raccoin&nbsp;</em>wants to do for coin-pushers what&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>did for poker.</figcaption></figure><p>Some of the special coins you can look forward to include one that allows you to grow "a money tree" for your machine, as well as a "Nuclear Coin" that will provide a more propulsive push.</p>

<p>Doraccoon is promising "over 100 unique items", all of which have the potential to "dramatically shift the course of your run". Naturally, since this is a&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>-style arcade roguelike, you'll be stacking multipliers and building crazy combos as well.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to different characters to play as, each of whom brings their own unique personality and themed coins. These include a "math-savvy raccoon manager" and a "quirky biologist". Is the former a manager of raccoons or a raccoon themselves (or both)? You'll have to play to find out!</p>

<p>If you want to get a sense for what <i>Raccoin&nbsp;</i>plays like, you can check out the announcement trailer right here.</p>




<p>Of course, a better way to join the&nbsp;<em>Raccoin&nbsp;</em>hype is to playtest the game yourself, and starting from August 18th, you'll get the chance to do just that. All you need to do is request access over on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3784030/RACCOIN_Coin_Pusher_Roguelike/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official Steam store page</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Krafton has announced that later this year, it will wind down support for&nbsp;<em>PUBG: Battlegrounds&nbsp;</em>on PS4 and Xbox One, meaning that if you want to play the console versions of the game, you'll have to pick up a next-gen machine.</p>

<p>This news comes via an <a href="https://www.pubg.com/en/news/9005" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official post</a> on&nbsp;the&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>website, in which Krafton confirms that support for the last-gen versions of its popular battle royale shooter will come to an end on November 13th.</p>

<p>Krafton describes this decision as "a necessary step towards aligning&nbsp;<em>PUBG Console&nbsp;</em>with current-gen consoles", and it should also help to "provide...players with a more stable gameplay environment on console", as well as ensuring "a smoother, more seamless experience with future updates".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pubg-ps4-xbox-one-support-ending-explosion.jpg?itok=gi3c0IQe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pubg-ps4-xbox-one-support-ending-explosion.jpg?itok=eVJj5-lM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>PUBG</em>'s PS4 and Xbox One versions will soon lose support.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Krafton, once this transition is complete, console players will see "improved visuals and more stable frame rates", and not only that, but ongoing crash issues should be resolved "through memory-related optimizations".</p>

<p>Since&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>is a live-service game, it probably won't shock you to learn that it won't be playable in single-player, either. Once support ends for the PS4 and Xbox One versions, that's it; they won't be playable or downloadable anymore.</p>

<p>If you're on PS5, you'll need to redownload&nbsp;<em>PUBG</em>'s new PS5 version once the transition happens, but if you're on Xbox Series X|S and you already have the game installed, you'll automatically get the new version thanks to Smart Delivery.</p>

<p>Once the transition happens,&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>will support 1080p at 60fps or 1440p at 30fps on Xbox Series S, while Series X and PS5 Pro will enjoy dynamic 4K resolution at 60fps. The base PS5 version will also hit 60fps, but at just 1440p resolution.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pubg-ps4-xbox-one-support-ending-swamp.jpg?itok=F7QS0HIo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pubg-ps4-xbox-one-support-ending-swamp.jpg?itok=5Z46HUbz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The newer console versions of&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>should look and play nicer, at least.</figcaption></figure><p>This news follows the announcement that the PC version of&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-pubg-anti-cheat-system" rel="nofollow">is getting new anti-cheat systems</a>, but that probably won't affect console players, since crossplay between console and PC isn't supported.</p>

<p>In any case, you can download and play&nbsp;<em>PUBG: Battlegrounds&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/578080/PUBG_BATTLEGROUNDS/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP5082-CUSA14081_00-PTSBUN0000000000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/pubg-battlegrounds/c0mn5dn8kr3f" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and the PS4 and Xbox One versions of the game will become unavailable on November 13th.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Tales of Xillia Remaster Apparently Accidentally Confirmed]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-of-xillia-remaster-rumor</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tales-of-xillia-remaster-apparently-accidentally-confirmed.1270134/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It looks as though Bandai Namco may have just inadvertently confirmed a&nbsp;<em>Tales of Xillia&nbsp;</em>remaster, if a thumbnail for an upcoming YouTube premiere is anything to go by.</p>

<p>As spotted by X user <a href="https://x.com/lowedeltaa/status/1955925606274658555" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Lowedelta</a> (via ResetEra user <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/bandai-namco-seemingly-accidentally-confirms-tales-of-xillia-remaster-announcement-expected-august-18th.1269954/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Shona</a>), the YouTube thumbnail for an impending news video about the&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>series shows a screenshot from&nbsp;<em>Tales of Xillia</em>, depicting several of the game's characters having a conversation in one of its skits.</p>

<p>This, as Shona points out, may well be an error on Bandai Namco's part; rather than choosing a custom thumbnail for the livestream, the studio may instead have opted to allow YouTube to choose one, and the one it picked is from partway through the video.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-xillia-remaster-leaked-rumor-character.jpg?itok=QUQEoReI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tales-of-xillia-remaster-leaked-rumor-character.jpg?itok=ddS9sQwn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Tales of Xillia&nbsp;</em>appears to be getting the remaster treatment.</figcaption></figure><p>It's not clear whether the potential remaster will include only the first game or&nbsp;<em>Tales of Xillia 2&nbsp;</em>as well, and we also don't know whether this will be the only project announced during the premiere or whether a brand new&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>game will be revealed too.</p>

<p>Either way, the video premieres on August 18th, so we won't have to wait too long to find out. It's a premiere, too, rather than a livestream, so you shouldn't have to wade through too much pre-announcement banter.</p>

<p>If a&nbsp;<em>Tales of Xillia&nbsp;</em>remaster is indeed on the cards, it would be consistent with Bandai Namco's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-series-remasters-regular" rel="nofollow">assertion back in December</a>&nbsp;that&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>series remasters would be coming "fairly consistently". Producer Yusuke Tomizawa said at the time that the studio intends to continue remastering games from the series "as much as possible".</p>

<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Tales of Xillia&nbsp;</em>itself, it's an ideal candidate for the remaster treatment; it was originally released on PS3 back in 2013, and it's never been released on any subsequent system, so it's currently impossible to play the game unless you already own it.</p>




<p>We'll have to wait and see what Bandai Namco has in store for the&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>series when its next news video premieres on Monday. Stay tuned.</p>
