            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sons-of-forest-update-rafts-more<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Endnight Games has released a brand new&nbsp;<em>Sons of the Forest&nbsp;</em>update, and this one comes complete with new buildable structures, support for a major Steam feature, and even a fun new secret to find.</p>

<p>Naturally, this update isn't quite as big as the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sons-of-forest-10-patch-notes" rel="nofollow">huge 1.0 release in February last year</a>, but it does bring three new buildable raft structures, as well as a new mooring post for you to hitch your seafaring vehicles to.</p>

<p>You'll also find new buildable holders for the KnightV and hang glider vehicles, as well as a "procedural defensive wall placement system" to help you draw a more natural formation for your defensive fences.</p>

<p>What's more, there's also a new "secret player findable outfit" that you can discover somewhere in the game world. Endnight is remaining cagey regarding exactly how or where you find this item, so it's up to you to scour&nbsp;<em>Sons of the Forest</em>'s world to claim it.</p>

<p>Naturally, you can also look forward to tons and tons of new gameplay improvements and bug fixes. Make sure to check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1326470/view/526458302147592280" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">full patch notes</a> for this update if you want to see everything that's new.</p>




<p><em>Sons of the Forest&nbsp;</em>is the followup to the supremely spooky survival game&nbsp;<em>The Forest</em>, which was released back in 2018 for PC and PlayStation 4. The sequel is only available for PC, though.</p>

<p>This time, you'll be exploring a mysterious island to try and uncover the fate of a missing CEO, although you'll quickly be drawn into the same type of shenanigans the first game offered. I won't spoil, but this certainly isn't a cozy game, let's put it that way.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Sons of the Forest&nbsp;</em>right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1326470/Sons_Of_The_Forest/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-20m-shipments-report</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-reportedly-preparing-to-ship-20m-switch-2-units-in-first-year.1084248/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-20m-shipments-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo is reportedly preparing a massive amount of Switch 2 shipments for the console's first year on sale, with the figure apparently dwarfing that of the original Switch.</p>

<p>According to a Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-16/nintendo-to-unveil-next-generation-switch-2-in-april" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a> (which, in turn, cites analyst Robin Zhu of Sanford C. Bernstein), Nintendo's supply chain network for the Switch 2 will allow it to sell "more than 20 million units in its first year".</p>

<p>As Bloomberg points out, that figure would be five million higher than the original Switch, which managed to sell 15 million units during its first year on sale. It's clear that Nintendo is banking on its new console doing well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-pipeline-20m-mario-kart.jpg?itok=DzIoVW6a 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-pipeline-20m-mario-kart.jpg?itok=msB6_bFT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nintendo is preparing its new console for around 20 million shipments in its first year, apparently.</figcaption></figure><p>It's also possible the company wants to avoid a repeat of the great chip shortage of the early 2020s, which made consoles like the PS5 and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-shortage-got-you-down-build-your-own-instead" rel="nofollow">original Switch</a> very hard to obtain. It might sound obvious, but Nintendo really doesn't want you not to be able to find this console in stores.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, Nintendo <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">finally announced</a> the Switch 2 earlier today after months of speculation regarding when the console would finally be revealed.</p>

<p>It's fair to say that the announcement itself was pretty terse; it showed off the console's form factor, as well as what appears to be a new game in the&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart&nbsp;</em>series, but it didn't give away anything about the machine's specs or launch day lineup.</p>

<p>We do, however, already know that the Switch 2 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-successor-will-be-backwards-compatible" rel="nofollow">will be able to play</a> original Switch games, although Nintendo has said that the successor may not support every original Switch game at launch.</p>




<p>Nintendo has promised that it will reveal more about the Switch 2 during a Direct presentation in April. It's likely we'll learn more about the console's hardware specs then, and we'll probably get a release date too. Stay tuned.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Exoborne Playtest Will Let You Try Yet Another Extraction Shooter Next Month]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/exoborne-playtest-february</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exoborne-playtest-will-let-you-try-yet-another-extraction-shooter-next-month.1084188/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/exoborne-playtest-february<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Sharkmob has announced an&nbsp;<em>Exoborne&nbsp;</em>playtest for February, so if you were looking for yet another extraction shooter to add to your list for some reason, then you're in luck.</p>

<p>The playtest will take place between February 12th and 17th, and unlike the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/second-monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta" rel="nofollow">upcoming&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>open beta</a> (and, indeed, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta" rel="nofollow">one prior to that</a>), you'll have to request access in order to be approved for the test.</p>

<p>Sharkmob doesn't specifically say which aspects of the game you'll be granted access to if you manage to get approved for the beta, so it sounds like you'll be able to test a slice of the game, which is exciting if you're an extraction shooter fan, I suppose.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/exoborne-playtest-february-storm.jpg?itok=OPeg2gwx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/exoborne-playtest-february-storm.jpg?itok=0wPd3OKI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>An&nbsp;<em>Exoborne&nbsp;</em>playtest is coming in February.</figcaption></figure><p>Playing the&nbsp;<em>Exoborne&nbsp;</em>playtest for 60 minutes will earn you two extra keys, allowing you to recruit a couple of friends and "complete your squad", as Sharkmob says.</p>

<p>As for what the game actually is, Sharkmob describes&nbsp;<em>Exoborne&nbsp;</em>as an "open-world tactical extraction shooter set in a world torn apart by extreme forces of nature". An apocalyptic cataclysm (is there any other kind?) has ravaged the world, making resources scarce and hostile humans numerous.</p>

<p>You'll be let loose in the "vast open land" of Colton County, and it'll be up to you to scavenge for loot, deal with warring factions and enemy players, and try to survive when nature's fury comes a-calling once more.</p>

<p>If you want to know what&nbsp;<em>Exoborne&nbsp;</em>looks like on a moment-to-moment level, you can check out the playtest announcement trailer right here.</p>




<p>Between this, shooters like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/escape-from-tarkov-patch-0-16-0-0" rel="nofollow">Escape from Tarkov</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gray-zone-warfare-tarkov-players" rel="nofollow"><em>Gray Zone Warfare</em></a>, and experiments in other genres like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dungeonborne-playtest-early-access" rel="nofollow">Dungeonborne</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wolcen-devs-project-pantheon-live-service" rel="nofollow"><em>Project Pantheon</em></a>, the extraction genre sure is gaining popularity.</p>

<p>Whether&nbsp;<em>Exoborne&nbsp;</em>can stand out in a landscape like that remains to be seen, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2705130/Exoborne/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wishlist it on Steam</a> if you want to find out. That's also where you can request access to February's playtest.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-release-date-set-for-may.1084185/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Marvelous has announced the release date for upcoming farming RPG adventure&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em>, which will allow you to explore a "Japanese-inspired" land filled with unique twists on classic&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory&nbsp;</em>gameplay.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma&nbsp;</em>will launch on PC and Nintendo Switch on May 30th. There's no word on whether it'll also be released for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">newly-announced Switch 2</a>, but since that console is backwards compatible, I suppose the answer is technically "yes".</p>

<p>As the name suggests,&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma&nbsp;</em>will take place in the land of Azuma, which are "a shadow of their prosperous past" following the events of a mysterious calamity known as the Celestial Collapse.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-release-date-farming.jpg?itok=BEGzDpb- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-release-date-farming.jpg?itok=bYhHC9rC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma&nbsp;</em>brings more cozy RPG farming goodness in May.</figcaption></figure><p>The gods of nature have abandoned the land, but one hero makes a pact with a dragon in order to use its power to save the world from its encroaching blight. That, in case you hadn't twigged, is you.</p>

<p>You'll be able to choose from one of two protagonists, whose destinies are "closely tied together", according to Marvelous.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Guardians of Azuma&nbsp;</em>will also offer "reimagined and expanded&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory&nbsp;</em>gameplay", meaning you'll be able not only to farm, but also to fight using new weapons like bows and talismans, as well as befriending local villagers and exploring the land of Azuma to your heart's content.</p>

<p>You can check out the latest trailer for&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em>, which shows the kind of direction the game is going in, right here.</p>




<p>You won't just be farming in&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em>, either; you'll be rebuilding entire villages, constructing and placing buildings as you see fit. It's a wonder you can find the time for romance in between being an adventurer and a city planner.</p>

<p><em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2864560/Rune_Factory_Guardians_of_Azuma/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and Nintendo Switch on May 30th. Stay tuned for more.</p>
