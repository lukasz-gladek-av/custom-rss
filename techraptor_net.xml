            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/evil-dead-game-delisted-playstation-epic<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Eagle-eyed fans have noticed that&nbsp;<em>Evil Dead: The Game&nbsp;</em>appears to have been delisted from two major storefronts, prompting worries that the game may be about to be shut down.</p>

<p>Over on the game's official subreddit, user ThePatMan117 (who has quite the flair, by the way) <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EvilDeadTheGame/comments/1ka4d44/update_evil_dead_the_games_epic_games_store/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">spotted</a> that&nbsp;<em>Evil Dead: The Game&nbsp;</em>has disappeared from both the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/evil-dead-the-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Epic Games Store</a> and the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/evil-dead-the-game/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation Store</a>. The listing for the game is now a dead link in both cases.</p>

<p>Strangely enough,&nbsp;the game is still available on both the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/evil-dead-the-game/9pd4jfnzcz90/0010" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1493750/Evil_Dead_The_Game/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>, so it is, of course, entirely possible that the PlayStation and Epic delistings are just a mistake and that normal service will resume soon.</p>

<p>At time of writing, there's been no official word from developer Saber Interactive, and the&nbsp;<em>Evil Dead: The Game&nbsp;</em>X account hasn't posted anything for a number of months. We've reached out to Saber to ask whether the game's delisting is a mistake or intentional.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Evil Dead: The Game</em>, it's an <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/evil-dead-game" rel="nofollow">asymmetrical multiplayer horror game</a> along the lines of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dead-by-daylight" rel="nofollow">Dead by Daylight</a>&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Friday the 13th</em><em>: The Game</em>, although as the name suggests, it's based around the&nbsp;<em>Evil Dead&nbsp;</em>franchise.</p>

<p>You can choose to play either as the forces of good, led by Ash Williams, or the Kandarian Demon and its Deadite followers, and as you'd expect, the action can get pretty gory and violent at its most outre.</p>




<p>A quick glance at&nbsp;<em>Evil Dead: The Game</em>'s <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1493750/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam numbers</a> might suggest a reason for its potential delisting; the game currently has just 31 players online, with a 39-player peak over the last 24 hours. Of course, it's available on consoles and other storefronts too, but that's not an encouraging figure.</p>

<p>It does, however, prove that servers for&nbsp;<em>Evil Dead: The Game&nbsp;</em>haven't been shut down yet, although that may change in the near future. We'll bring you more on this as soon as we get it.</p>
