            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remedy has officially unveiled&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>'s Breakpoint update, and it comes complete with a ton of seismic changes to the first-person shooter, although whether they can turn its fortunes around remains to be seen.</p>

<p>Back in July, Remedy <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fbc-firebreak-whats-next" rel="nofollow">promised</a> that it would release&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>'s first big update in September, and the studio has made good on that promise; Breakpoint launches on September 29th (that's this coming Monday at time of writing).</p>

<p>According to Remedy, Breakpoint is "packed with systemic overhauls, new content, and quality-of-life improvements" with a view towards making&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>"more fun, varied, and rewarding to play".</p>

<p>The Crisis Board will show you situations emerging around the Oldest House, and you'll be expected to respond to them; after all, Remedy says, you should be "reacting to dynamic, unpredictable dangers" rather than "being asked to create danger for yourself".</p>

<p>You can also expect a brand new tutorial mission by the name of Orientation, which will be "accompanied by onboarding improvements across the game", so if you felt a bit lost when you jumped into&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>, this should hopefully improve that experience.</p>

<p>There are a ton of other huge changes coming to&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>as part of this update as well, so if you want to know everything that's changing, be sure to check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540/view/530984095140809426" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">full announcement right here</a>.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>, it's a multiplayer-oriented first-person shooter set in&nbsp;<em>Control</em>'s Oldest House. You play a member of the titular Firebreak team, and it's your job to contain a range of bizarre supernatural threats within the Federal Bureau of Control.</p>

<p>The game launched back in June to a mixed reception, and player numbers have dwindled significantly since launch according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2272540/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> (although&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>is also available on both PS Plus and Game Pass, for which I don't have player data).</p>

<p>Remedy itself <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-fbc-firebreak-launch-sales-financials" rel="nofollow">admitted back in August</a> that launch sales of&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>had been disappointing, but the studio described the game as having a "solid" foundation and expressed optimism that it could turn the shooter's fortunes around. Breakpoint is, presumably, the first step in that effort.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2272540/FBC_Firebreak/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/fbc-firebreak/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/fbc-firebreak/9PDCN8Z4HKRN" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and it's available as part of certain tiers of PS Plus and Game Pass as well.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Xbox has officially announced&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 6</em>, the next installment in the&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon&nbsp;</em>series of simcade racers, and as well as PC and Xbox, the game will also be coming to PS5.</p>

<p><em>Forza Horizon 6&nbsp;</em>was unveiled during Xbox's spot at the Tokyo Game Show, so it feels particularly appropriate that the game will take players to Japan as its setting. The trailer shows off a number of Japanese accouterments, including a maneki-neko and a katakana license plate.</p>

<p>We didn't learn too much more about the game during the initial announcement, but we do know that after launching on PC and Xbox Series X|S in 2026,&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 6&nbsp;</em>will be coming to PlayStation 5. Whether it'll be available on Sony's console next year, however, remains to be seen.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/forza-horizon-6-announcement-forza-horizon-5.jpg?itok=NmC_VKte 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/forza-horizon-6-announcement-forza-horizon-5.jpg?itok=fZ7s6dvn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>After&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 5&nbsp;</em>took us to Mexico,&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 6&nbsp;</em>will take place in Japan.</figcaption></figure><p>The next&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon&nbsp;</em>game is just the latest in a string of Xbox titles to make their way to PlayStation; it follows the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gears-of-war-reloaded-announced" rel="nofollow"><em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-ps5-release-date-enhancements" rel="nofollow"><em>Senua's Saga: Hellblade II</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sea-of-thieves-grounded-and-pentiment-officially-announced-for-playstation-platforms" rel="nofollow"><em>Sea of Thieves</em></a>, among others.</p>

<p>It's not just Xbox crossing the divide, though; Sony is also reciprocating (to a degree, at least), since popular live-service shooter&nbsp;<em>Helldivers II&nbsp;</em>was released for Xbox Series X|S <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-xbox-series-xs-august" rel="nofollow">on the same day</a> as&nbsp;<em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em>'s launch.</p>

<h2>What else did Xbox reveal at Tokyo Game Show?</h2>

<p>It's not just&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 6&nbsp;</em>that Xbox showed off during its Tokyo Game Show spot. We also got to see what else the studio is up to, including new trailers for&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>,&nbsp;<em>007: First Light</em>, and a first reveal for&nbsp;<em>Gungrave Gore Blood Heat</em>, a remake of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/gungrave-gore" rel="nofollow">the 2022 shooter</a>.</p>

<p>IO Interactive also revealed a brand new mission for&nbsp;<em>Hitman: World of Assassination&nbsp;</em>during the show, and it'll star none other than legendary Chinese martial artist and actor Bruce Lee, whom you must protect as he infiltrates a high-stakes martial arts tournament.</p>




<p>If you want a full rundown of everything Xbox announced during the show, you can <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/09/25/xbox-tokyo-game-show-broadcast-recap-everything-announced/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">check it out right here</a>.</p>
