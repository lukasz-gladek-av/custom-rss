            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/as-we-descend-early-access-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Box Dragon and publisher Coffee Stain have announced the release date for apocalyptic roguelike deckbuilder&nbsp;<em>As We Descend</em>, which is launching into Early Access next month.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>As We Descend&nbsp;</em>will land on PC via Steam Early Access on March 27th, and since we're at the start of the latest Steam Next Fest event right now, you can try the game out for free on that same platform if you like.</p>

<p>In&nbsp;<em>As We Descend</em>, you'll be thrust "into an apocalyptic future to shape the fate of a submerging civilization at the end of the world". It'll be your job to oversee "a city on the edge of extinction" while also sending expeditions beyond the city's walls to see what lies in wait for you.</p>

<p>Beyond the city management aspect of&nbsp;<em>As We Descend</em>, it'll also offer "challenging card-based combat" for which you can recruit "a variety of squads with unique card sets and abilities", allowing for a number of different combinations and strategies.</p>

<p>Combat revolves around two different zones: the Guard Zone and the Support Zone. Switching your forces between both zones will allow you to dodge monster attacks and set up your defenses.</p>




<p>As you'd probably expect from a roguelike, death won't be the end in&nbsp;<em>As We Descend</em>, either. As the Steam page notes, failure will arm you with "new secrets", allowing you to "begin the next journey with new knowledge and tools".</p>

<p><em>As We Descend&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1769830/As_We_Descend/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on March 27th. The demo is live right now, and you can check it out until March 3rd, so make sure to give it a look if you're a fan of card battlers like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/slay-spire" rel="nofollow">Slay the Spire</a>&nbsp;</em>or city-builders like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/frostpunk" rel="nofollow"><em>Frostpunk</em></a>.</p>
