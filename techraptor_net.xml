The card game featuring iconic characters from across 100 years of Disney canon has had a strong two years of support. This preview is proof that support will continue with details on upcoming sets alongside quality-of-life changes for the competitive scene.</p>

<h2>The 2025 <em>Disney Lorcana</em> Preview</h2>

<p>In an official press release, Ravensburger made several announcements as part of a <em>Disney Lorcana</em> preview. It opens by recounting the success of the game, releasing seven sets with more than 1500 unique cards for the game since its launch in 2023.</p>

It continues the story introduced in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-disney-lorcana-archazias-island-details-revealed-by-ravensburger" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Archazia's Island </em></a>set. Jafar has gotten the Hexwell Crown and has used it to shape the island to his evil will. The island is now packed with dangerous traps and tricky illusions, but a resistance group, including Jasmine and Rapunzel, is trying to steal the crown back.</p>

<p>Part of this set's release includes <em>Illumineers' Quest: Palace Heist</em>. This is a co-op experience where up to four players can hold their own against Jafar's minions. The set will pre-release May 30th with a national release June 6th.</p>

<p>The <em>Disney Lorcana</em> preview also contained new details on the next set, <em>Fabled</em>. First, the set will be the first to include two new rarities to <em>Disney Lorcana</em>: Iconic and Epic. Iconic Cards are extremely rare; only two total are in the set. Iconic cards appear more often than Enchanted rarity cards and feature unique foil treatments.</p>

<p>The launch of Fabled will mark the first time cards will be rotated out of competitive play for Disney Lorcana. The first four sets will be rotated out of the Core Constructed format. But, for those that still want to experiment, a new format, Infinity Constructed, is available. This is a natural result of the game's growing competitive scene and expanding suite of cards.</p>

<p>The <em>Fabled</em> set will release September 5, 2025.</p>
