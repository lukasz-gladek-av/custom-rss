            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/undaunted-stalingrad-review-campaign-begins<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Undanuted</em> by Osprey Games, is a series heralded as perfectly blending a deck-building game with wargaming elements. The series of games first started in 2020 with <em>Undaunted Normandy</em>, and rather than start with a review of the original game, we're working backwards from the latest game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/undaunted-2200-callisto-old-mechanics-new-tricks" rel="nofollow"><em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto</em></a>. This time we're looking at <em>Undaunted Stalingrad</em>, which introduced a campaign setting to&nbsp;<em>Undaunted</em> in one of the most challenging military campaigns of the modern era.</p>

<p>Although we've only just started covering&nbsp;<em>Undaunted</em> on the site, we have previously covered several of Osprey Games' titles, including the brand new <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bolt-action-3rd-edition-review-snapping-into-action" rel="nofollow">Bolt Action 3rd Edition</a></em>, copublished with Warlord games, and also some of their awesome supplements for their miniatures agnostic system,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/frostgrave-wildwoods-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Frostgrave</em></a>.</p>

<p>In games of <em>Undaunted</em>, as was the case in&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/undaunted-2200-callisto-old-mechanics-new-tricks" rel="nofollow"><em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto</em></a>, players draw 4 cards from their deck each turn and then use those cards to play actions from the tokens they have on the board, such as moving and attacking. Certain cards also allow you to draw more cards from your supply, or move cards from your deck to your supply, allowing you to tailor your deck as you play. New tokens can also be added to the game board as you draw new units into your deck. Some tokens have multiple cards that can activate them, with the cards having the same unit or squad name, but representing a different individual in that unit or vehicle.</p>

<p>This card system, as well as working for actions, also controls a unique damage system. As a unit takes hits, you must discard a matching card from your hand. If you don't have a matching card in your hand, you discard one from your discard pile, and if there isn't one there too, you discard it from your deck. If you can't find the card at all, the unit is eliminated. This can put real pressure on going first in the turn and focuses you on picking your targets. If a unit you have the card for in your hand is hit, then you discard the card and you might not be able to activate it this turn. It also adds a nice hidden element as you and your opponent try to work out how many cards units have left, and which is the optimum target to hit.</p>

In <em>Stalingrad</em>, both players start with the similar but not for the artwork decks, but over time, as you take losses and your troops gain experience, you will replace them with inferior replacements, upgrade them, gain new units, or maybe just lose them completely from your deck.</p>

<p>The map too changes over time, expanding, but also reacting to missions and the destruction you bring. Each mission directly links from the previous, and the campaign branches and adapts depending on the last, and with 35 possible scenarios in the book, along with each of the 2 factions having their own scenario book with background narrative and scenario rules, every time you play through will be different (unless you complete exactly the same mission with exactly the same results and the same losses somehow).</p>

<p><em>Undaunted Stalingrad </em>features the 2 historical forces that were part of the campaign during WWII, the Germans and the Soviets. Both factions start with the same decks, but they have different upgrades and additions as the campaign develops. We're keeping this review spoiler-free, but the differences are very on-theme and in keeping with the forces of the time.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/undaunted-stalingrad-6.jpg?itok=ztqI8vIp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/undaunted-stalingrad-6.jpg?itok=OdjUGivU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>As the&nbsp;<em>Undaunted Stalingrad </em>campaign progresses, the Game State will change depending on the winner of each scenario.</figcaption></figure><h2>How Does The Campaign Work In Undaunted Stalingrad?</h2>

<p>At the end of each scenario, along with removing casualties from your deck, and upgrading troops, the game also tracks the game state with a number. Using a table, you take the current game state number, and depending on who the victor is, change the game state to the new number based on that scenario.</p>

<p>The game state also tells you which background section of the scenario book for your force to read, and then which scenario to play next. The scenario then tells you which cards to unlock, your objectives for that game, and any special rules to play.</p>

<p>The developing map and changing deck really does bring home the pressures of war, and makes you consider your decisions in battle. It's easy to throw troops forward when you know everything resets for the next game, but when you're several games into a campaign, and you know that losing a tank could put you on the back foot for the rest of the campaign, your strategy will change.</p>

<p><em>Undaunted Stalingrad</em> is designed for the long haul and that's where it shines. Both players need to be happy going in that there's going to be a few games to get to the end of the campaign, to get the most out of it, rather than the pick-up and play options in the earlier <em>Undaunted</em> products.</p>

<p><i>Undaunted Stalingrad&nbsp;</i>is a fantastic if somber experience. Anyone who's read my reviews before will know that theme is huge for me, as it's easy to put a thematic skin on some mechanics in order to gain audience buy-in, but <em>Undaunted Stalingrad</em> really captures what was a horrendous, grueling campaign for both sides. It takes the solid <em>Undaunted</em> mechanics, and mixes them extremely well with the branching legacy campaign, along with capturing the unique feel of both forces, which was also very pleasing to see.</p>

<h2>Should I Buy Undaunted Stalingrad?</h2>

<p>If you're looking for a quick pick up and play game, as a new player, or a previous <em>Undaunted</em> player, then <em>Stalingrad</em> is at it's best when played as part of the legacy campaign, and you should try out one of the other <em>Undaunted</em> options (<em>2200 Callisto</em>&nbsp;has a linked campaign, but you can play any scenario you wish). If you're not a fan of the WWII theme, then this leans into it very heavily, and when you're deep in the campaign, it's hard to see past it. If you want an incredibly thematic experience, then <em>Stalingrad</em> is that, but if you want a deck-builder wargame hybrid without the WWII theme, then try <em>2200 Callisto</em>.</p>
