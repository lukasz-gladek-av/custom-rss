            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pacific-drive-sales-1m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Ironwood Games and publisher Kepler Interactive have announced that their survival drive-'em-up&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>has managed to hit a brand new sales milestone.</p>

<p>Per a press release, the game has officially passed the one million sales mark. That means it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pacific-drive-sales-update" rel="nofollow">picked up another 400,000 sales</a> for itself since July last year, which definitely isn't too shabby for an indie studio like Ironwood.</p>

<p>As Ironwood itself says in the aforementioned press release, the studio has "less than 20 staff", and&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>is its first game, which I think makes the game passing the million mark even more impressive.</p>

The game has already <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pacific-drive-update-customization" rel="nofollow">received</a> three major updates since release, and the developer is teasing that the "fourth and most substantial update" will launch soon.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Ironwood doesn't provide a specific release window for that update, so we could be waiting quite a while for it. Still, given that this isn't a live service game, it's nice to see the studio supporting it with any kind of post-launch plan.</p>

<p><em>Pacific Drive</em>'s success means it's also caught the eye of Hollywood filmmaker James Wan, best known for the likes of&nbsp;<em>Insidious&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Saw</em>. His <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pacific-drive-tv-series-rights-james-wan" rel="nofollow">production company acquired the rights</a> to a&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>TV show back in December.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive</em>, it's an indie survival game in which you must drive your car across the Olympic Exclusion Zone, foraging for resources and dodging anomalies as you go. If you can imagine&nbsp;<em>Stalker&nbsp;</em>meets&nbsp;<em>Driver</em>, you're not far off.</p>




<p>The game is as much about repairing your car and making sure it runs alright as it is dodging the horrors of the Zone, so if you're in the market for a game that mixes vehicle maintenance with desperate struggles for your life, this is the one for you.</p>

<p><em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1458140/Pacific_Drive/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/pacific-drive/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[Microsoft Announces AI Gameplay Generation Model Muse]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-muse-ai-gameplay-generation</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-announces-ai-gameplay-generation-model-muse.1113531/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-muse-ai-gameplay-generation<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft has announced Muse, a generative AI model that can "generate game visuals, controller actions, or both". The company is calling it the first example of a WHAM, or World and Human Action Model.</p>

<p>In a post on the official Microsoft website, the company reveals that Muse was developed in conjunction with <i>Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice&nbsp;</i>studio Ninja Theory. The model was trained on Ninja Theory's battle arena game&nbsp;<em>Bleeding Edge</em>.</p>

<p>A followup post on the Xbox website says Muse can "create consistent and diverse gameplay rendered by AI", which Microsoft calls "a major step toward generative AI models that can empower game creators". I'm not so sure about that one myself.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bleeding-edge-microsoft-muse-ai.jpg?itok=5FC-wPky 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bleeding-edge-microsoft-muse-ai.jpg?itok=EuWjQAMN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Microsoft trained its new AI on the Ninja Theory game&nbsp;<em>Bleeding Edge</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>In both posts, Microsoft gives some examples of the kind of gameplay Muse is currently able to generate. Honestly, I might just not be infected by the tech brain worms, but to me it looks pretty low-quality.</p>

<p>It's not just me, either; The Verge <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/615048/microsoft-xbox-generative-ai-model-gaming-muse" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">confirms</a> that Muse is currently only capable of generating gameplay at a paltry 300 x 180 resolution, and not only that, but it's also limited to 10 frames per second. Find me a PC gamer that would be happy with those numbers.</p>

<p>I know, I know. The tech is still in its early stages, and I'm sure that Microsoft will be able to iterate on it in order to create a model that can convincingly generate higher-resolution gameplay at a better frame rate.</p>

<p>Honestly, though, I'm still left wondering what the point of it all is. According to Microsoft, it's all about "effectively support[ing] human creatives" and that potential applications include "the opportunity to make older games accessible to future generations of players across new devices and in new ways".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/inzoi-generative-ai-krafton.jpg?itok=NnujBJSC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/inzoi-generative-ai-krafton.jpg?itok=YO5dc2Vt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Generative AI is popping up in games like Krafton's&nbsp;<em>inZoi</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>From a cynical perspective, though, I can only really see companies looking for ways to cut out human developers and replace them with AI processes once the tech becomes even remotely viable for doing so.</p>

<p>That's not to mention the <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2025/explained-generative-ai-environmental-impact-0117" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">colossal environmental impact of AI</a>, which doesn't appear to be mentioned in either of the aforementioned Microsoft posts, nor (ironically) in the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08600-3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nature article</a> in which the Muse research paper is contained.</p>

<p>Still, if you'd like to read about Microsoft's new Muse model and get some of the nerdy details about how it works, you can <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/introducing-muse-our-first-generative-ai-model-designed-for-gameplay-ideation/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">do so here</a>. There's also a less technical and more gamer-focused explanation <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/02/19/muse-ai-xbox-empowering-creators-and-players/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">over on the Xbox website</a>&nbsp;if you prefer.</p>
