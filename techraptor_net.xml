      <div><p><em>Unpacking&nbsp;</em>developer Wren Brier has claimed that Nintendo isn't responding to her requests to take down blatant copies of the game that are still squatting on the Switch eShop.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:en7lk6dayjekqei65vpfornn/post/3ldfndqrhzk2o" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">thread on social media platform Bluesky</a>, Brier points out that this issue was first raised <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wrenegade.bsky.social/post/3lbzzabxois2e" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">around two weeks ago</a>, when a user by the name of Daniel Vuckovic described eShop listings like&nbsp;"<em>Unpacking: Deluxe Edition</em>" as "straight up copyright infringement".</p>

<p>Earlier today, though, in the new thread, Brier says that "it's been over two weeks" and that the listings, which also include the likes of "<em>Unpacking: Chill Music Pack</em>" and "<em>Unpacking: Haunting Locations</em>", still haven't been removed.</p>

<p>Disappointingly, this isn't the first time Brier and her team have run into spurious grifters trying to profit off their work. Back in 2022, a <a href="https://x.com/UnpackingALife/status/1485791817757245441" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">similar issue arose</a> when a mobile&nbsp;<em>Unpacking&nbsp;</em>ripoff topped the charts on the iOS App Store (shortly before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unpacking-rip-off-pulled-from-app-stores-but-only-after-topping-charts" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">being removed</a>, that is).</p>

<p>It's especially disheartening when considering that Nintendo is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/1hdh1jb/comment/m1weaho/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">apparently more than happy</a> to enforce the kind of strict content regulations that lead to the&nbsp;<em>Neptunia&nbsp;</em>games' Western release being canceled on Switch, but not to deal with seemingly obvious cases of infringement like this.</p>




<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Unpacking&nbsp;</em>itself, if you haven't played it, it's a puzzle game that revolves around putting objects in their proper place across a series of rooms. As you play, you'll also uncover a narrative told through the kinds of objects you're, well, unpacking.</p>

<p>The game proved popular with players, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unpacking-sales-move-across-million-mark" rel="nofollow">crossing the million-sale mark</a>&nbsp;in November 2022 and bagging itself a mobile release the following year.
