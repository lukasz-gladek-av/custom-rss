<p>In a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15301" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a>, Scott says that he thinks the decision to step back from managing Nexus Mods is "in both [his] and the community's best interests". He says that the "strain" of responsibility for the "behemoth" he's created has "taken its toll".</p>

<p>According to Scott, running Nexus Mods for 24 years and having to be "on call" has caused "anxiety and stress-related health issues" for him, and that since he's been "burning out", it's best for him to "step aside and bring in new leadership".</p>

He doesn't specify who exactly owns the site now, instead referring to "structural updates to the company ownership that we aren't shouting about".</p>

<p>Despite this, Scott says the changes are "about long-term stability, not changing the values or direction of the platform"; according to Scott, Nexus Mods will remain "community-first and mod-author-focused".</p>

<p>He says that from a user perspective, "not a lot" will be changing, and that behind the scenes, he was already beginning to reduce his involvement in the Nexus Mods platform. As such, the site will likely continue to run as it has done for the last few months.</p>

<p>As for Scott himself, he says he won't be "disappearing" from Nexus Mods altogether. He'll remain active on the site's Discord channel, and he'll also be "working with the team to help guide the overall direction" of Nexus Mods.</p>

Over time, it became a modding platform for that game, eventually expanding to encapsulate other games as well.</p>

<p>It hasn't been without controversy; Scott and Nexus Mods have found themselves in hot water numerous times over their decision to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nexus-bans-all-us-political-mods-going-forward" rel="nofollow">ban certain mods</a>, or, indeed, to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/nexus-mods-decides-to-allow-an-oblivion-remastered-mod-that-changes-body-type-options-to-male-female-declares-its-not-a-battleground-for-broader-cultural-or-political-debates/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">allow</a> certain mods. That's doubtless the kind of back-and-forth Scott wants to escape.</p>

<p>In any case, it's not clear how Nexus Mods will change in future, but one thing's for sure: it won't be changing under Scott's leadership. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/two-killer-soulslikes-we-saw-at-summer-game-fest-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Very few Soulslikes land for me, outside of ones developed by FromSoftware themselves. Still, there's always potential for a hit, as was the case with last year's <em>Black Myth: Wukong. </em>For 2025 and beyond, I'm actually optimistic about the future of the genre, especially after seeing a few potential bangers at&nbsp;Summer Game Fest 2025.</p>

<p>I'm talking about&nbsp;<em>Code Vein II&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers.&nbsp;</em>In the case of&nbsp;the latter, I had a chance to play through the opening hour, though it didn't feel nearly enough to fully grasp what it had to offer.&nbsp;For&nbsp;<em>Code Vein II</em>, we were given a presentation that left me optimistic about this exciting sequel.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Code Vein II</em> - Bigger, and With a Motorcycle!</h2>

<p>Darn, this is one I really wanted to get my hands on. Unfortunately, I only have words and hands-<em>off </em>gameplay to go off of here, but let me tell you why I'm so excited for&nbsp;<em>Code Vein II.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>The first&nbsp;<em>Code Vein</em>&nbsp;was probably the first Soulslike -- again, outside of FromSoftware's own games -- to click with me. The slick anime aesthetic and faster pace of combat resonated with me, and when I was speculating what game this might be based on my SGF appointment's vague description, I hoped it was&nbsp;<em>Code Vein II.</em></p>

<p>And here we are, a sequel! Well, kind of. It's a sequel in name, but Bandai Namco also describes it as a reimagining. Expect some familiar elements, but&nbsp;<em>Code Vein II&nbsp;</em>is very much its own game. The lore behind this sequel is actually quite exciting, too.</p>



<p>Essentially, we'll be traveling between past and present timelines with the help of our player's companion, Lou MagMell. Hopping between timelines, 100 years to the past and then back to the present, is a daunting narrative challenge but one I am excited to see the developer tackle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Players can befriend various legendary Revenants -- essentially, the vampire-like beings from&nbsp;<em>Code Vein --&nbsp;</em>in both past and present. You are, of course, the hero of your own story. <em>Code Vein</em> was known&nbsp;for its robust character creator, so you'll be happy to know it's expanded to be better than ever.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We only got a taste of actual combat in&nbsp;<em>Code Vein II</em>. Footage is fast-paced and more akin to a traditional hack-and-slash action game than a Souls-like, at least at first glance. I doubt it will deviate much from its Soulsy roots, but there's potential for&nbsp;<em>Code Vein II</em>&nbsp;to grow more into its own thing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One returning mechanic are blood codes, which essentially dictate the class of the player and the weight of its stats. As this is a sequel, no doubt we'll see new Blood Codes in this one. We have some new mechanics called Jails and Formae, both of which essentially boil down to providing more abilities and techniques to utilize during combat.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There's also a motorcycle. This seems to be a focal point in&nbsp;<em>Code Vein II</em>, because the Bandai Namco booth at SGF had a prop motorcycle that was&nbsp;<em>very</em>&nbsp;cool. This is used to traverse the world, which will be much bigger this time around. I'm not going to say it's on&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s scale, but having to use a mount in a Soulslike game has me thinking big.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em> - Wuxia Souls</h2>

<p>I also had an hour to play&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>, but darn it all, I wish I had more. One, because it's a mechanically rich Soulslike game, but also because it was quite enjoyable!&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>&nbsp;is, no doubt, one of the least clunky games I've played in the genre, which is a pitfall far too many fall into.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This demo takes place right at the start of&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers.&nbsp;</em>There's some emphasis on story here, and essentially, you're afflicted with an ailment called Feathering. It looks exactly as it sounds, but Wuchang, the eponymous protagonist of this game, uses it to her advantage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wuchang is extremely capable with all form of weapons, and there were various styles I could try out in this demo. I landed on using the base longsword, as it felt like it catered to my playstyle of slightly heavier, longer weapons wielded with two hands. There are faster and slower styles players can use, of course.</p>

<p>The core mechanic to&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>&nbsp;revolves around Skyborn Might. As I understand it, perfectly dodging attacks and other actions grant you more power, so combat puts an emphasis on player skill. If you like to cheese your bosses, it's probably possible, but I feel like it's not quite that simple in this one.</p>



<p>Our character, Wuchang, has plenty of abilities at her disposal. Charging up your heavy attack and hitting the back of certain enemies stuns them and allows you to pull off a powerful attack. We can also cast spells, so if an enemy is pressuring you, take a step back, cast a spell, and do some decent damage on them.</p>

<p>There are plenty of other mechanics that are at play here, but I was still in the midst of getting these explained to me by the time my demo ended. Still, I made it to the first boss of the demo and defeating them in a thrilling battle. Combat left me very satisfied, so I'm eager to see how far&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>&nbsp;can go.&nbsp;</p>
