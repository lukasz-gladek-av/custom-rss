            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/triple-i-initiative-indie-showcase-2025-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Evil Empire has announced the date and time for this year's Triple-i Initiative presentation, which will showcase around 45 minutes of information about new and yet-to-be-revealed indie games.</p>

<p>The first Triple-i Initiative <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/indie-creators-come-together-for-triple-i-initiative-showcase-this-april" rel="nofollow">took place last year</a>, and it's during that show that we got the first reveals for games like&nbsp;<em>Slay the Spire 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Rogue Prince of Persia</em>, as well as updates on games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/vampire-survivors" rel="nofollow">Vampire Survivors</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/v-rising" rel="nofollow"><em>V Rising</em></a>.</p>

<p>Stunlock's vampire survival game makes a return this year to show off its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/v-rising-sales-top-5-million" rel="nofollow">upcoming 1.1 update</a>, and it'll be joined by fellow indie stalwarts like open-world survival-crafter&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/enshrouded" rel="nofollow">Enshrouded</a>&nbsp;</em>and dwarven shooter&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/deep-rock-galactic" rel="nofollow"><em>Deep Rock Galactic</em></a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/enshrouded-triple-i-initiative-2025.jpg?itok=ZjOdf86- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/enshrouded-triple-i-initiative-2025.jpg?itok=O9QmJoox 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Enshrouded&nbsp;</em>joins the list of indie games being showcased at this year's Triple-i Initiative.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Evil Empire, this year's Triple-i Initiative will feature over 30 announcements, and as well as the aforementioned games, you can also look forward to new info about the likes of&nbsp;<em>X4: Foundations</em>, plus new info from publishers like&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>'s Playstack and&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords</em>' Hooded Horse.</p>

<p>The full list of studios also includes&nbsp;<em>The Alters&nbsp;</em>developer 11 bit,&nbsp;<em>Sifu&nbsp;</em>studio Sloclap, and&nbsp;<em>Moonlighter&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Cataclismo&nbsp;</em>outfit Digital Sun, who may well be showcasing more of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/moonlighter-2-announced-2025" rel="nofollow">recently-revealed&nbsp;<em>Moonlighter&nbsp;</em>sequel</a>.</p>

<p>As well as new game reveals, Evil Empire also says that this year's Triple-i Initiative will mark the beginning of a week-long sale across Steam and other platforms, with various games from both this year's show and last year's getting discounts.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that this is an indie show, I wouldn't get your hopes up for news on, well,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong" rel="nofollow"><em>that&nbsp;</em>hotly-anticipated indie game</a>. Team Cherry's name isn't on the list of studios to be featured during the show, so adjust your expectations accordingly. Nobody likes&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>spam in the chat, after all.</p>




<p>You can check out this year's Triple-i Initiative on April 10th at 9am Pacific (that's around 12pm Eastern and about 5pm GMT). Stay tuned for more.</p>
