            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-vegas-mod-fallout-nuevo-mexico-canceled<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The lead developer on ambitious-looking <i>Fallout: New Vegas&nbsp;</i>mod<i>&nbsp;</i><em>Fallout: Nuevo Mexico&nbsp;</em>has canceled the project in order to prioritize his "mental health" and to "face reality".</p>

<p>In a message shared on the mod's Discord server (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/fallout-nuevo-mexico-mod-cancelled-prioritize-mental-health/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">TheGamer</a>), developer Zapshock says that while&nbsp;<em>Nuevo Mexico&nbsp;</em>has been his "passion" and "obsession" for years, the project's workload and costs are "too great".</p>

<p>As such, continuing with&nbsp;<em>Nuevo Mexico</em>'s development "simply isn't sustainable for [Zapshock] and everyone involved, including voice actors", and so the decision was made to cancel the project. Zapshock says the decision was "painful", but "necessary".</p>

<p>The mod was to be set five years after the events of the original&nbsp;<em>Fallout</em>, putting it several decades before the events of&nbsp;<em>Fallout 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>New Vegas</em>, both of which take place as humanity is beginning to rebuild something resembling a coherent society.</p>

<p>Per a Game Rant <a href="https://gamerant.com/fallout-new-vegas-mods-good-nuevo-mexico-scripting/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">interview</a> from February last year, the modders were planning to include&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age</em>-style origins for characters in&nbsp;<em>Nuevo Mexico</em>, including one for a ghoul character, which would have fundamentally changed the mod's gameplay experience.</p>

<p>Honestly, it sounds to me like it's no wonder the mod was canceled; Zapshock and his team clearly had an insane level of ambition for&nbsp;<em>Nuevo Mexico</em>, and with just four people working on the project, they were bound to burn out sooner or later.</p>




<p><em>Nuevo Mexico&nbsp;</em>isn't the only&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>mod to have been canceled in recent months; back in October, the developers of&nbsp;<em>Fallout: Vault 13</em>, a mod that attempted to remake the entirety of the original&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>in the fourth game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-vault-13-mod-development-suspended" rel="nofollow">shut down their mod</a> due to "a combination of factors".</p>

<p>If you are looking for a DLC-sized&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>mod experience, however, all is not lost. There's still&nbsp;<em>Fallout: London</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-london-out-now" rel="nofollow">launched in July last year</a>&nbsp;and which had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-london-mod-million-downloads" rel="nofollow">attracted a million downloads</a> by October. It's a&nbsp;<em>Fallout 4&nbsp;</em>mod, though, so you'll need the base game to play.</p>
