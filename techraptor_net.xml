            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Xbox Series S continues to provide a challenge for developers, but in the eyes of&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>technical director Christian Buhl, that challenge was apparently no bad thing.</p>

<p>In an interview with <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-devs-struggled-xbox-series-s-60-fps-switch-2-2000625487" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Kotaku</a>, Buhl says that the console, which is a less powerful version of the flagship Xbox Series X (and which also doesn't have a physical media drive), was a significant hurdle for the&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>development team thanks to its memory.</p>

<p>According to Buhl, the Series S had "less memory than even [the team's] mid-spec PC", and over the course of development, the team noticed that the game's levels were "crashing on Xbox Series S", but seemingly not on other platforms.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-6-xbox-series-s-running.jpg?itok=Lvwby5mg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-6-xbox-series-s-running.jpg?itok=W0vFeKCU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6</em>'s Xbox Series S port worked wonders for other platforms too, apparently.</figcaption></figure><p>In trying to fix&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>'s problems on Xbox Series S, Buhl and his team apparently made the "whole game better and more stable", although if you're a Series S owner, you will be getting "specific optimizations" on your platform.</p>

<p>The thrust of all this is that if you're playing&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>on Xbox Series S, you can expect a "super solid" 60 frames per second, just like other platforms. It's likely that wasn't a compromise the team was willing to make given the game's multiplayer focus.</p>

<p>Kotaku's Zack Zwiezen also asks Buhl about a&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>Switch 2 port, but an EA rep quickly puts paid to the question, refusing to talk about "anything beyond...the consoles that&nbsp;<em>Battlefield</em>'s coming to". Well, it was worth a try, Zack.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>, it's...well, it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/leaks-reveal-battlefield-6-is-called-battlefield-2042" rel="nofollow">not the sixth</a>&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>game, but it's the latest mainline entry in the first-person shooter series. Due to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-6-revealed-release-date-october-maybe" rel="nofollow">launch next month</a>, the game will feature a single-player campaign alongside its multiplayer component.</p>




<p><em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>will be released on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2807960/Battlefield_6/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/battlefield-6/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/battlefield-6-standard-edition/9PJXV87JTSVQ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on October 10th.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/uk-gaming-trade-body-head-praises-scottish-industry-seemingly-cites-mindseye.1298172/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Would you say that Build a Rocket Boy and IO Interactive's&nbsp;<em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>is indicative of the quality of the Scottish gaming industry as a whole? If you would, then you'd seemingly be in agreement with none other than UKIE trade body head Nick Poole.</p>

<p>Speaking <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/npoole_edinburgh-dice-supercharge-activity-7373061435859410945-xtn9/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on LinkedIn</a>&nbsp;(as spotted by ResetEra user <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/chief-exec-of-uk-videogames-industry-body-boasts-about-strength-of-scottish-games-industry-using-build-a-rocket-boy-mindseye.1297998/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">RedbullCola</a>) ahead of a visit to Scottish capital Edinburgh, Poole said the next couple of years will be "really exciting for Scotland's video game and interactive entertainment industry".</p>

<p>He goes on to say that Scotland has a "really dynamic grassroots ecosystem", as well as "some major emerging players and leading work-for-hire studios and service providers". This all seems fairly innocent so far, but at the bottom of the post, Poole includes a (very low-res) shot of concept art for&nbsp;<em>MindsEye</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mindseye-scottish-gaming-industry-ukie-shooting.jpg?itok=cpiLm9u3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mindseye-scottish-gaming-industry-ukie-shooting.jpg?itok=MItMRGal 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>apparently represents the Scottish gaming industry well enough for UKIE head Nick Poole.</figcaption></figure><p>While Poole doesn't specifically say that&nbsp;<em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>is an exemplar of the Scottish industry, the inclusion of the picture does seem to suggest that he thinks it's a good example of what the country can produce in terms of gaming.</p>

<p>One rather suspects that this either means Poole has terrible gaming taste or that he hasn't actually played&nbsp;<em>MindsEye</em>, and if the latter is true, he also doesn't appear to have paid attention to any of the discussion surrounding the game.</p>

<p>In case you need a reminder,&nbsp;<em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>launched earlier this year to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mindseye-launch-messy" rel="nofollow">a disastrous reception</a>, which appears to have led to developer Build a Rocket Boy <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mindseye-build-a-rocket-boy-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">laying off more than 100 employees</a> in the game's wake.</p>

<p>The launch went so badly that it even seems to have prompted publisher IO Interactive to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/io-interactive-mindseye-third-party-publishing" rel="nofollow">rethink its relationship to third-party publishing</a>, which is a pretty impressive feat, although probably not in the way Build a Rocket Boy would like.</p>




<p>What's particularly galling about Poole's comments is that Rockstar North, the developer behind&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto V</em>, is based in Edinburgh, and it would have been incredibly easy to point to that game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/circana-reveals-best-selling-playstation-games-of-all-time" rel="nofollow">insane level of success</a> as an example of the power of the Scottish gaming industry.</p>

<p>One rather hopes that someone points out to Poole, who heads up one of the <a href="https://ukie.org.uk/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">UK's most important and influential gaming bodies</a>, that&nbsp;<em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>isn't the best example to lead with when praising Scotland, but only time will tell.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Deltarune Chapter 5 Not Coming in 2026's First Half, Chapter 6 Officially Confirmed]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/deltarune-chapter-5-2026-chapter-6</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/deltarune-chapter-5-not-coming-in-2026s-first-half-chapter-6-officially-confirmed.1298079/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Deltarune&nbsp;</em>creator Toby Fox has revealed that the game's fifth chapter isn't going to be ready until at least the second half of next year, but there's some good news as well: a sixth chapter has officially been confirmed.</p>

<p>As part of the game's <a href="https://toby.fangamer.com/newsletters/autumn25/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">fall newsletter</a>, Fox says that he "[doesn't] think that the game will be released in the first half of 2026", presumably referring to&nbsp;<em>Deltarune</em>'s fifth chapter rather than to the game as a whole.</p>

<p>He says that as of September 8th this year, Chapter 5's early areas are complete but in need of polish for some optional areas, while the last 40% of the chapter is in a "rough first pass" state, with the final 10% currently being prototyped.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/deltarune-chapter-5-2026-sans.jpg?itok=s5szU5gM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/deltarune-chapter-5-2026-sans.jpg?itok=r3oxRAbs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Deltarune&nbsp;</em>Chapter 5 won't be along until the second half of next year at the earliest.</figcaption></figure><p>The newsletter also contains the first official confirmation of&nbsp;<em>Deltarune&nbsp;</em>Chapter 6; Fox says that "one programmer is already working on the regular enemy bullet patterns of Chapter 6", with regular enemies in Chapter 5 being "mostly done".</p>

<p>It was already fairly obvious that&nbsp;<em>Deltarune&nbsp;</em>would have at least two more chapters following Chapter 5. The game's chapter selection screen shows space for seven chapters, but this is the first time Fox has overtly referred to a sixth chapter for&nbsp;<em>Deltarune</em>.</p>

<p>Of course, he doesn't provide any kind of timeline for Chapter 6's release; since Chapter 5 doesn't have a release date yet, it would perhaps be strange if Fox knew when its followup would arrive.</p>

<p>In the case of Chapter 5, Fox says he and his team will release it "when it's done", and that he'll continue to update expectant fans on the progress of the chapter as it's made. Hopefully, it won't be too long until the next update.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/deltarune-chapter-5-2026-battle.jpg?itok=HD6mVzkg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/deltarune-chapter-5-2026-battle.jpg?itok=V19o4CWl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A sixth chapter of&nbsp;<em>Deltarune&nbsp;</em>is officially in development.</figcaption></figure><p>Fox has traditionally been pretty transparent about&nbsp;<em>Deltarune</em>'s development. Back in October last year, he promised that the game's third and fourth chapters <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/deltarune-chapters-three-and-four-2025" rel="nofollow">would definitely release this year</a>, which was subsequently confirmed during a Switch 2-focused Nintendo Direct show.</p>

<p>He's also pledged in the past that&nbsp;<em>Deltarune</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/deltarune-update-promises-smoother-development" rel="nofollow">development would be "smoother"</a> following relatively lengthy waits for the game's first few chapters, so hopefully, Chapters 5 and 6 will arrive in a timely fashion.</p>

<p>In the meantime, you can grab&nbsp;<em>Deltarune</em>'s first four chapters on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1671210/DELTARUNE/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/deltarune/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/deltarune-switch-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">both</a> Nintendo Switch <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/deltarune-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">consoles</a>.
