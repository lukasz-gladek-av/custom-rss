            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/io-interactive-007-first-light<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>IO Interactive has finally revealed its upcoming&nbsp;<em>James Bond&nbsp;</em>game, which will officially be titled&nbsp;<em>007 First Light</em>,&nbsp;and more information is coming later this week.</p>

<p>The game's name and artwork were revealed in a <a href="https://x.com/007GameIOI/status/1929553749963350144" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post on X</a> earlier today, and although there's not much to go on, it's nice to know that IO is still working on the game, given how long it's been since the initial announcement.</p>

<p><em>First Light&nbsp;</em>will be an origin story for Bond, detailing how he earned his 007 designation. In case you need a reminder, in the world of Bond, the 007 classification grants whichever agent carries it a license to kill in the field.</p>

<p>We don't yet know where&nbsp;<em>First Light&nbsp;</em>will be set, nor do we know much about the gameplay, although given that it's IO Interactive on development duties, we can assume it'll at least be a little similar to the&nbsp;<em>Hitman&nbsp;</em>games.</p>

<p>It's been quite some time since&nbsp;<em>007 First Light&nbsp;</em>was first teased. We first got wind of IO's intent to make a&nbsp;<em>James Bond&nbsp;</em>game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/developers-of-hitman-franchise-are-making-james-bond-game" rel="nofollow">all the way back in late 2020</a>, and with not much info coming between then and now, you'd have been forgiven for thinking the game had been quietly canned.</p>

<p>That is, until July 2023, when IO <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/io-interactive-new-studio" rel="nofollow">opened up a new studio in the UK</a>. At that point, it was also confirmed that&nbsp;<em>Project 007</em>, as it was then known, was still in development, along with something known as&nbsp;<em>Project Fantasy</em>&nbsp;(which still hasn't officially been revealed).</p>

In October last year, it was revealed that the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/io-interactive-publishing-ex-rockstar-thriller" rel="nofollow">would be publishing&nbsp;<em>MindsEye</em></a>, the upcoming action-adventure game from ex-Rockstar head Leslie Benzies.</p>

<p>More info on&nbsp;<em>007 First Light&nbsp;</em>is coming later this week, so stay tuned for that as soon as we get it.</p>
