            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pathfinder-kingmaker-sales-2m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Knights Peak and developer Owlcat Games have announced that their CRPG&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder: Kingmaker&nbsp;</em>has hit a brand new sales milestone over six years after its initial launch.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder: Kingmaker&nbsp;</em>sales have now hit the two million mark. It seems the milestone may have been reached a little too late for the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pathfinder-kingmaker-delays-its-rule-until-september-25th" rel="nofollow">sixth anniversary</a>, which fell in September last year, but it's still an achievement for Owlcat and Knights Peak to be proud of.</p>

<p>At last count, Owlcat's followup&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous&nbsp;</em>had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pathfinder-wrath-of-righteous-sales-reach-1-million" rel="nofollow">reached a million sales</a>, and earlier this week, the studio revealed that its grimdark futuristic CRPG&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Rogue Trader&nbsp;</em>had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-rogue-trader-1m-sales" rel="nofollow">hit the same number</a>. That puts&nbsp;<em>Kingmaker&nbsp;</em>out in front as the studio's best-selling game to date.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder: Kingmaker</em>, it's a CRPG that serves as both Owlcat Games' first title and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-crpg-pathfinder-kingmaker-announced-chris-avellone-to-contribute" rel="nofollow">first video game</a> to be set in the&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder&nbsp;</em>world. The game sees you building and managing your very own kingdom, navigating courtly intrigue and seeing off threats to your rule as you do so.</p>

<p>As you'd probably expect from a modern CRPG, the game lets you create your own hero and meet a range of diverse companions, as well as iconic figures from the&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder&nbsp;</em>mythology. It also allows you to choose between real-time and turn-based combat depending on your personal preference, which is always nice.</p>




<p><em>Pathfinder: Kingmaker&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/640820/Pathfinder_Kingmaker__Enhanced_Plus_Edition/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP2047-CUSA14853_00-KINGMAKER00000US" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 4</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/pathfinder-kingmaker-definitive-edition/BPHQQN22GB7L" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox One</a>, and you can also play it on current-gen consoles thanks to the magic of backwards compatibility. Stay tuned for more on all other things Owlcat.</p>
