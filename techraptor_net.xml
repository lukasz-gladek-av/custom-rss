            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Games Workshop has dropped a preview for another <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-age-of-sigmar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em></a> army. The upcoming <em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em> Flesh-Eater Courts battletome contains new mechanics and updated rules for the delusional undead army, and GW has provided a sneak peek.</p>



<p>In an official <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/nudwrxbe/knightly-bannermen-join-a-riotous-bacchanal-in-the-flesh-eater-courts-armies-and-regiments-of-renown/" rel="nofollow">Warhammer-Community</a> post, Games Workshop provided a glimpse at the changes in the new <em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em> Flesh-Eater Courts battletome. This is the second undead army to get a spotlight in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-fourth-edition-signals-new-age" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">newest edition</a> of the fantasy miniatures war game recently. The other army was the ghostly <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/games-workshop-previews-changes-in-new-warhammer-age-of-sigmar-nighthaunt-battletome" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nighthaunt</a> army.</p>

That delusion can even be altered on the battlefield, adjusting the horde's behavior.</p>

<p>One of those changes are in the form of the Knights of New Summercourt delegation. It centers around Ushoran, Mortarch of Delusion. This delegation fights alongside Knights, Varghulf Courtiers, and Serfs. With "In Their Sire's Shadow," they can do a free Charge once per battle alongside Ushoran when certain conditions are met.</p>

<p>But Ushoran's behavior can change on a whim, which the <em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em> Flesh-Eater Courts battletome embodies. Once per turn, Ushoran can use "A Duel, Good Sir!" to challenge an enemy general. If the general accepts, both they and Ushoran can only target each other until either one of them are defeated.</p>

<p>Since the Flesh-Eater Courts are undead, dying can be more of a setback than a danger. "Red Errantry Hosts" lets you set up a replacement unit of Knights that have been defeated, albeit with half the models (rounded up).</p>

<p>Additionally, all units can utilize certain passives. "Equinox Parade" gives units a Run bonus on round one. "Ritual Dance" gives a movement bonus in round 3. And "Eat Your Fill" lets units heal after combat on round four.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em> Flesh-Eater Courts battletome will be available for pre-order this upcoming Saturday.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Docked Is a Realistic Dock Management Sim from Saber Interactive]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/docked-announced-saber-interactive</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/docked-is-a-realistic-dock-management-sim-from-saber-interactive.1270251/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Saber Interactive has announced&nbsp;<em>Docked</em>, a realistic management sim that tasks you with managing a busy port after a devastating hurricane has swept through it.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Docked&nbsp;</em>will have you operating heavy machinery, overseeing supply and logistics chains, and managing the overall operations of the port. It's very much one for the <i>Construction Simulator&nbsp;</i>crowd, although it's got the disaster twist of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/snowrunner" rel="nofollow">SnowRunner</a>&nbsp;</em>as well.</p>

<p>Unlike Astragon's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/seafarer-the-ship-sim-astragon" rel="nofollow">recently-announced&nbsp;<em>Seafarer: The Ship Sim</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Docked&nbsp;</em>will see you managing the operations of the port itself, so you won't actually be sailing any ships in this one; rather, you'll be responsible for what happens to them when they come into port.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/docked-announced-ship.jpg?itok=SwaYy9F_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/docked-announced-ship.jpg?itok=OYMiZSdL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You won't be sailing this thing, but you will get to decide what happens to it in your port.</figcaption></figure><p>While you may not be sailing the ships that come into Port Wake, you will be operating lots of heavy machinery, including "colossal ship-to-shore cranes" and "sturdy, heavy-duty tractors", among other things.</p>

<p>As you'd probably expect from a Saber Interactive game, the simulation element will be important in&nbsp;<em>Docked</em>; you'll need to "tighten ropes, position materials, optimize weight distribution, [and] navigate delicate cargo with little margin for error".</p>

<p>As you revitalize your port, you'll need to upgrade and expand it "one crane at a time". Each job you take on will earn you cash, and you can reinvest that cash into Port Wake, buying new vehicles and upgrading your fuel and power supplies as you go.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Docked</em>, which gives you a pretty good sense of what you can expect from the game, right here.</p>




<p><em>Docked&nbsp;</em>doesn't have a release date yet, but when it does arrive, it'll be coming to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. If you want to keep up with the game, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2487300/Docked/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wishlist it on Steam right here</a>. Stay tuned for more.</p>
