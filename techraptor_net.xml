            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has revealed that&nbsp;<em>Dark Ties</em>, the fully-fledged spinoff launching alongside&nbsp;<em>Yakuza Kiwami 3&nbsp;</em>in February, was originally intended as a movie before being expanded into a playable game.</p>

<p><i>Dark Ties&nbsp;</i>was announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties-announced" rel="nofollow">alongside <i>Yakuza Kiwami 3&nbsp;</i>last week</a>; while <em>Kiwami 3&nbsp;</em>was&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/yakuza-kiwami-3-apparently-leaked" rel="nofollow">leaked via an accidental listing</a> on the developer's official website prior to the reveal, <em>Dark Ties&nbsp;</em>was a surprise. It's a spinoff that revolves around Yoshitaka Mine, a prominent character in the original&nbsp;<em>Yakuza 3</em>.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202509/53863" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Famitsu</a> interview (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/yakuza-dark-ties-was-originally-supposed-to-be-just-a-viewable-movie-but-rgg-studio-couldnt-miss-out-on-its-last-opportunity-to-make-mine-playable/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Automaton</a>), game director Ryosuke Horii says that&nbsp;<em>Dark Ties&nbsp;</em>was supposed to be "something that could be viewed like a video", but that the "best way" to tell the expansion's story would be to allow players to play as Mine themselves.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties-mine-cigarette.jpg?itok=YqWu-Q8y 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties-mine-cigarette.jpg?itok=Lhs4ox6R 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dark Ties&nbsp;</em>has been significantly expanded compared to its humble origins.</figcaption></figure><p>Additionally, Yoshitaka Mine is, according to series producer Hiroyuki Sakamoto, one of the franchise's most popular characters. Supposedly, he consistently places in the top five when polls are conducted to discover fans' favorites.</p>

<p>Given that&nbsp;<em>Yakuza 3&nbsp;</em>(and, now,&nbsp;<em>Yakuza Kiwami 3</em>) is Mine's only appearance, the team thought it was the right thing to do to make him playable rather than relegating him to a simple movie project.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Dark Ties</em>, it's a spinoff of&nbsp;<em>Yakuza Kiwami 3&nbsp;</em>in which you'll play as Mine, discovering new side stories and a new "boxing-based combat" system that stand in contrast to Kazuma Kiryu's established fighting style.</p>

<p>Rather than being paid DLC,&nbsp;<em>Dark Ties&nbsp;</em>will launch alongside&nbsp;<em>Yakuza Kiwami 3</em>, and it'll be included with the main game at no additional cost.</p>




<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Yakuza Kiwami 3&nbsp;</em>itself, it's a remake of&nbsp;<em>Yakuza 3</em>, which takes us back to a younger Kiryu as he juggles his responsibilities to his orphanage and to the yakuza clan he's left behind.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Yakuza Kiwami 3&nbsp;</em>when it launches on February 12th for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3937550/Yakuza_Kiwami_3__Dark_Ties/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10015219" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties/9n2370ncnw1m" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties-switch-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cygames-co-founder-yuito-kimura-steps-down-due-to-health-issues.1312285/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yuito Kimura, one of the two co-founders of&nbsp;<em>Granblue&nbsp;</em>developer Cygames, has stepped down from his role as executive director at the company, citing ongoing health concerns.</p>

<p>Kimura's departure was announced today via the official Cygames <a href="https://www.cygames.co.jp/en/news/id-24576" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, with the company confirming that his responsibilities "have been allocated among the current board members", so it sounds like they won't be searching for a specific replacement for Kimura.</p>

<p>Cygames' announcement doesn't give a reason for Kimura's departure, but over on <a href="https://x.com/KimuraYuito/status/1972912672619516331" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">social media</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/cygames-executive-director-yuito-kimura-steps-down" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gematsu</a>), the man himself says that he has ongoing health issues that have made his duties at Cygames difficult to carry out. These health issues are, however, not life-threatening, according to Kimura.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cygames-yuito-kimura-stepping-down-granblue-fantasy-relink.jpg?itok=6WUn7pwz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cygames-yuito-kimura-stepping-down-granblue-fantasy-relink.jpg?itok=uC9fKIbX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Cygames is best known for games in the&nbsp;<em>Granblue&nbsp;</em>series, like 2024's&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy: Relink</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Kimura says that he's hoping to return to video game production at some point in the future, assuming that he makes a recovery from his health issues, so this may well not be the last we've heard of him. Let's hope not!</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with Cygames, it's the studio responsible for most of the games in the&nbsp;<em>Granblue&nbsp;</em>series, including the 2024 action RPG&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/granblue-fantasy-relink" rel="nofollow">Granblue Fantasy: Relink</a>&nbsp;</em>and fighting game&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy Versus&nbsp;</em>(although development on that game was handled by Arc System Works).</p>

<p>Cygames was founded by Kimura and president Koichi Watanabe back in 2011, going on to develop a number of mobile games for the Japanese market, including&nbsp;<em>Rage of Bahamut</em>,&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest Monsters: Super Light</em>, and, of course,&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy</em>.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, given how big the&nbsp;<em>Granblue&nbsp;</em>series has become overseas, it's still not possible to play the original&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy&nbsp;</em>in English. Other Cygames titles, like <i><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragalia-lost-shutdown-coming-this-november" rel="nofollow">Dragalia Lost</a>&nbsp;</i>and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/umamusume-pretty-derby-western-release-date" rel="nofollow">positively meme-worthy&nbsp;<em>Umamusume: Pretty Derby</em></a>, have received Western releases.</p>

Stay tuned for more on this.</p>
