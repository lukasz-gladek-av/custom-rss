<p><em>Mario Kart World </em>is, according to pierre485's figures, also the fastest-selling Nintendo Switch 2 game, as well as the best-selling game of 2025 altogether. Remember, this data applies specifically to Japan and not to the rest of the world.</p><p>Back in November, Nintendo revealed that <em>Mario Kart World </em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-dk-bananza-switch-2-sales" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4e02a144-2a45-4743-8394-5954013f8f00" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">nearing the 10 million sales mark</a>, with fellow Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive <em>Donkey Kong Bananza </em>sitting at a very respectable 3.5 million at that time. It's not clear whether this new data has helped the game cross that line; we'll likely find out when Nintendo next announces its financials.</p><p>Indeed, it's been a strong year for the Switch 2 on the whole. Back in August, it was revealed that the console had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-financials-q1-2026" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="0df1a582-9b9c-40ce-97e3-524ba446cf4f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">managed to pass 6 million sales</a>, taking under two months to do so, and that Nintendo's revenue soared as a result (as you'd expect with the release of a successful new piece of hardware).</p><p>The console's lineup will be bolstered in the coming year by the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-switch-2-version-on-way-next-year" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="159fca3c-8df3-41ad-98da-95af3a28123c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Phasmophobia</em></a> and smash hit adventure <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dispatch-switch-2-switch-eshop-listing" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1bcf2169-2693-40a4-ab6c-88b2398c75da" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Dispatch</em></a>, as well as Nintendo's own <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-pokopia-release-date-leak" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3eeb790b-1baf-43d8-afe2-99182049c947" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Pokemon Pokopia</em></a>, which, if my own (very amateur) predictions are correct, will make roughly all of the money that exists in the world right now. <em>Mario Kart </em>being <em>Mario Kart</em>, I'd expect <em>World </em>sales to trundle along nicely as well.</p>
<p>You can check out <em>Mario Kart World </em>right now exclusively on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/mario-kart-world-switch-2/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Kinetic Games has provided a sneak peek at what 2026 will hold for ghost-hunting horror game <em>Phasmophobia</em>, and the studio is promising that the game's long-awaited 1.0 release is coming next year, plus lots more.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.kineticgames.co.uk/blog/phasmophobia-development-preview-21" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">development preview</a> posted on the official Kinetic website (on Christmas Day, of all days!), the studio confirms that <em>Phasmophobia </em>1.0 is scheduled for next year, although the developer stops short of providing a more specific release window.</p><p>Additionally, "what was previously known as Horror 2.0" will also be arriving alongside the full release, bringing with it "a host of new scares and surprises" that should give "even the most seasoned Ghost Hunter" a run for their money.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Next year holds a more realistic-looking character creation facility for <em>Phasmophobia</em>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In addition to the 1.0 release, <em>Phasmophobia </em>is also getting a brand new character creator next year, which will allow you to "customize your Ghost Hunter in-game with free cosmetics and different looks". You can also look forward to an animation overhaul that's aimed at creating a more immersive gameplay experience through increased realism of movement.</p><p>A rework for <em>Phasmophobia</em>'s Tanglewood Drive map is also on the way, and while Kinetic acknowledges that the announcement of the map's rework was met with "a bit of trepidation", the studio says it hopes its work on the Bleasdale and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-nells-diner-grafton-farmhouse-rework" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="16b7262e-f986-499e-8c3c-16ca2352333c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Grafton Farmhouse map reworks</a> will reassure players that the aim is to "level up the location".</p><p>All of this is, of course, alongside the Nintendo Switch 2 port of the game that Kinetic <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-switch-2-version-on-way-next-year" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="159fca3c-8df3-41ad-98da-95af3a28123c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">announced back in December</a>, as well as the <em>Phasmophobia </em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-movie-blumhouse" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="456ae148-4707-46f3-8535-d25532383d9e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">movie that's currently in development</a> at horror production studio Blumhouse. Suffice it to say that it's a good time to be a <em>Phasmophobia </em>fan (or perhaps that should be "phan").</p><p>If you aren't familiar with <em>Phasmophobia</em>, it's a multiplayer ghost-hunting horror game in which the goal is to find and document various paranormal phenomena haunting a range of different maps. You'll use tools and observation to figure out what's haunting where, then report back to your teammates.</p>
<p><em>Phasmophobia </em>is available now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/739630/Phasmophobia/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/phasmophobia/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/phasmophobia-game-preview/9N6D60SBZN05" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and a version of the game is heading to Switch 2 as well (presumably at around the same time as the 1.0 launch).
