            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shiren-wanderer-mystery-dungeon-of-serpentcoil-island-pc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Spike Chunsoft has announced that roguelike RPG&nbsp;<em>Shiren the Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island</em>, which proved pretty popular on Switch, is officially heading to PC via Steam.</p>

<p>In a press release, the company reveals that&nbsp;<em>The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island&nbsp;</em>is the fastest-selling game in the&nbsp;<em>Shiren the Wanderer&nbsp;</em>series, having surpassed 200,000 copies shipped in Japan "quickly" following its launch in January.</p>

<p>That sales performance is probably why Spike Chunsoft has decided to release this one on Steam as well, although we don't know when the game is arriving on the platform, unfortunately; the Steam page simply reads "coming soon" under the release date heading.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shiren-the-wanderer-the-mystery-dungeon-of-serpentcoil-island-steam-combat.jpg?itok=8g0-XUCD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shiren-the-wanderer-the-mystery-dungeon-of-serpentcoil-island-steam-combat.jpg?itok=FMrBh5EE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Shiren the Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island&nbsp;</em>is officially coming to Steam.</figcaption></figure><p>As the press release points out,&nbsp;<em>The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island&nbsp;</em>is the first&nbsp;<em>Shiren the Wanderer&nbsp;</em>game to make its way to the West since 2016's <i>The Tower of Fortune and the Dice of Fate</i>, which also came to Switch in 2020.</p>

<p>In fact, that game itself was originally released in 2010 for the DS before getting a PlayStation Vita port in 2015, which was subsequently released in the West the following year.</p>

<p>In the years between 2010 and this year, only one&nbsp;<em>Shiren the Wanderer&nbsp;</em>game was released: 2013's&nbsp;<em>Princess Suzune and the Tower of Slumber</em>, which was...a pachinko game. Hardly counts as a&nbsp;<em>Shiren the Wanderer&nbsp;</em>release, if you ask me.</p>

<p>That means that technically,&nbsp;<em>Shiren the Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island&nbsp;</em>is the first full game in the series for a staggering 14 years.</p>




<p><em>The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island&nbsp;</em>introduces some new elements to&nbsp;<em>Shiren the Wanderer</em>, including 3D visuals, creating "a fresh and exciting adventure", as Spike Chunsoft puts it.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with the basic structure of the game, it's a roguelike RPG in which you must explore a series of dungeons filled with monsters, traps, and items to collect. Dying during exploration will mean losing everything you've collected, so this is very much not one for the faint of heart.</p>

<p><em>Shiren the Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island&nbsp;</em>is available <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/shiren-the-wanderer-the-mystery-dungeon-of-serpentcoil-island-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right now on Switch</a> and is launching for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2178480/Shiren_the_Wanderer_The_Mystery_Dungeon_of_Serpentcoil_Island/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> sometime in the future. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-review-bomb</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-review-bombed-on-steam-due-to-server-issues.1040679/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-review-bomb<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024&nbsp;</em>is being review bombed on Steam after seemingly launching with extensive server issues, with users pointing to server loops, excessive loading times, and login queues as major issues, as well as problems with the game's cloud asset infrastructure.</p>

<p>Just yesterday, Microsoft and developer Asobo Studio released the latest iteration of the&nbsp;<em>Microsoft Flight Simulator&nbsp;</em>franchise, but it's already run into major issues, accruing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2537590/Microsoft_Flight_Simulator_2024/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an Overwhelmingly Negative rating on Steam</a> across 2,955 reviews (at time of writing).</p>

<p>One of the biggest issues users seem to be pointing out has to do with how&nbsp;<em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024&nbsp;</em>loads its assets. Much of the game's asset loading, including for aircraft, liveries, and more, is tied to cloud streaming, and since servers are struggling, that seems to be leading to problems.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-review-bomb-klm-flight.jpg?itok=m2O1_FPO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-review-bomb-klm-flight.jpg?itok=xUBK3pyC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024&nbsp;</em>players are not happy with how the game has been released.</figcaption></figure><p>One player says they were <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199244305024/recommended/2537590/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">stuck on a loading screen "for 65 minutes"</a>, with the screen freezing up at 97% and seemingly refusing to load any further than that.</p>

<p>Another <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198192847703/recommended/2537590/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">points out some of the aforementioned issues</a>&nbsp;and says&nbsp;<em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024&nbsp;</em>"feels like an alpha build", concluding that it "looks pretty and has potential but needs a lot of work". That's particularly damning for a game with a hefty asking price of $69.99.</p>

<p>The game's developers have said they are aware of the issue, dedicating a developer livestream to the problem earlier today.&nbsp;<em>Microsoft Flight Simulator&nbsp;</em>head Jorg Neumann said the team had "completely underestimated how high" pre-release excitement had been for the game.</p>

<p>Asobo Studio CEO Sebastian Wloch offers a technical explanation for the issues; players are asking&nbsp;<em>Flight Simulator 2024</em>'s servers for data, which is then cached in a database, but said cache is "currently getting saturated".</p>




<p>Wloch says the team stress-tested&nbsp;<em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</em>'s servers during the game's tech alpha, with the team performing load tests "simulating 200,000 users", but he concedes that the game has been "completely overwhelmed".</p>

<p>Community manager Jayne, also known as Jummivana, pledges to keep players updated via social media, and Neumann concludes the stream by apologizing to affected players, acknowledging that many are "frustrated" with the game's issues.</p>

<p>He says that although he knows the development team "had some problems today", the devs are "on it" and attempting to fix&nbsp;<em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</em>'s issues. Unfortunately, though, for now, if you're stuck, it looks like there's no fix yet.</p>

<p>If you want to try your luck, you can grab&nbsp;<em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024&nbsp;</em>right now on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2537590/Microsoft_Flight_Simulator_2024/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a> or the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Microsoft Store</a>, as well as Xbox Series X|S. The game is also part of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/all-confirmed-xbox-game-pass-november-2024-games" rel="nofollow">November's Xbox Game Pass lineup</a>&nbsp;for PC Game Pass or Ultimate members.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-portal-cloud-streaming-update</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-portal-cloud-streaming-added-in-latest-beta-update.1040625/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-portal-cloud-streaming-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has released a PlayStation Portal update that introduces cloud streaming to the device, allowing you to stream over 100 PS5 games to your Portal, but there's a catch, as you might expect.</p>

<p>As outlined in a new PlayStation Blog <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/19/the-playstation-portal-remote-player-experience-to-evolve-with-new-system-update/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, cloud streaming will only be available for PlayStation Plus Premium members. That's right; you won't even be able to take advantage of this feature if you're signed up to PlayStation Plus Extra.</p>

<p>If you do happen to be a Premium member, however, you'll gain access to cloud streaming for "over 120 PS5 games from the PS Plus Game Catalog", including the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dave-diver" rel="nofollow"><em>Dave the Diver</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/monster-hunter-rise" rel="nofollow"><em>Monster Hunter Rise</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/ratchet-clank-rift-apart" rel="nofollow"><em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</em></a>, among many others.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-playstation-portal-cloud-streaming.jpg?itok=FTRXyhP9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-playstation-portal-cloud-streaming.jpg?itok=oooDm3IT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The PlayStation Portal can now stream certain PS5 games via the cloud, but you'll need a PS Plus membership.</figcaption></figure><p>Games will stream at up to 1080p resolution and 60fps on the PlayStation Portal, and you'll also be able to access DualSense features like haptic feedback and adaptive triggers, as well as the touchpad, which will be emulated via the Portal's touchscreen.</p>

<p>Naturally, cloud storage will also be accessible on the Portal, so you'll be able to access any save files you've got on the cloud for the PS5 games the Portal supports.</p>

<p>In order to access this update, you'll need a PS Plus Premium membership, as well as access to the internet and "minimum 5Mbps of upload and download speeds". That number increases to 7Mbps for 720p and 13Mbps for 1080p.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the Portal won't support streaming PS4 or PS3 games, and it also won't support features like party voice chat, 3D audio, or Game Trials.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/spider-man-miles-morales-playstation-portal-cloud-streaming.jpg?itok=z7LQ69iJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/spider-man-miles-morales-playstation-portal-cloud-streaming.jpg?itok=7khsLMgq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Spider-Man: Miles Morales&nbsp;</em>and many other PS5 games can now be streamed via your PlayStation Portal.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with the PlayStation Portal, it's a rather curious handheld device that is designed to be used with a PS5 console.</p>

<p>Unlike traditional handhelds, the Portal <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonys-playstation-portal-gets-release-date-while-fans-keep-asking-for-real-portable" rel="nofollow">doesn't support games of its own</a>; rather, it streams games from a linked PS5, allowing you to enjoy PS5 games without needing to hook the console up to your TV (although you will need to do that to complete the initial setup).</p>

<p>As such, it's not a true successor to the likes of the PSP or the ill-fated PS Vita, although this latest update arguably puts the Portal one step closer to being the device it always should have been. The new update started rolling out yesterday, so if it hasn't been released where you live yet, it should arrive soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-will-definitely-find-its-fanbase-in-survival-gamers<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It has been a long time coming for <em>STALKER</em>, as a franchise we haven't had a new title since 2009, but with the release of <em>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl</em> players get to return to The Zone and attempt to survive against a variety of factions, strange creatures, and even odder anomalies.</p>

<p>In <em>STALKER 2</em> you take on the role of Skif, a stalker who has headed into the zone to gather more information on a strange Artifact that appeared in his kitchen. Once inside a key piece of equipment is stolen from you and you're left for dead. From there, you begin your quest to track down just who ambushed you and how you can recover your scanner.</p>

<h2><em>STALKER 2</em> reminds me of <em>New Vegas</em>, for better or worse</h2>

<p>The setup reminded me heavily of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d6685d7d-626b-40a4-8641-face640c606d" href="https://techraptor.net/games/fallout-new-vegas" rel="nofollow"><em>Fallout: New Vegas</em></a>, with just a brief introduction to the post-apocalyptic world before you're out on your ass with a major MacGuffin to hunt after. While you can tell there's a drive for Skif to recover what he's lost, as a player with very little connection to this world that kind of motivation is a bit difficult to relate to though.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stalker-2-early-story.jpg?itok=M5NlH9pp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stalker-2-early-story.jpg?itok=7Se-zmmO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Early on following the scent of your attackers, you'll run into others who brave The Zone, each able to drip-feed you a bit of information to get you to your next location. The overall quest structure of the game did feel a bit like a goose chase.</p>

<p>Each new lead you obtain would get you to someone who knows just a little bit more information, but you need to help them clear out a settlement or recover an important item before they share it with you. In that way, you'll find yourself bouncing around the world doing odd jobs working towards your goal.</p>

<p>The shallow nature of the primary story definitely made the start of the game slow and difficult to get into. Many quests feel like checking boxes rather than something I would really be pushing myself to explore or complete on my own. There's a lot more to <em>STALKER 2</em> than the story though.</p>

<p>If you do make it past the initial 8-10 hours then the story does bring in more ideas and concepts from the original games. You'll see what has happened to the Monolithians, among other factions, and even take steps to align yourself with them.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stalker-2-boss-fight.jpg?itok=pxCk61jI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stalker-2-boss-fight.jpg?itok=KFKr-vZP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Enjoyment from exploration, not plot</h2>

<p>Each new area is filled with different side-quests and activities. There are a variety of settlements that you can travel to that can be looted or are populated with others who need some help. You can even stumble into turf wars that you can watch from a distance or hop into the fray yourself.</p>

<p>These side-quests aren't just a chance to explore the world as they're also one of the best ways to obtain very necessary equipment whether it be currency for purchasing new items or repairing your gear, or more powerful weapons and armor.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stalker-2-friendly-fire.jpg?itok=r0IbuKh- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stalker-2-friendly-fire.jpg?itok=EaMgaIE7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Survival mechanics will make or break your experience</h2>

<p>The Survival mechanics of <em>STALKER 2</em> is really what will decide if this is the game for you. Jumping into the game you'll immediately notice features that other games offer, like detecting the rough direction of where you're being shot from or a map-based fast travel aren't present.</p>

<p>These survival features continue to add as you play further. You'll be avoiding radiated areas for fear of getting sick, be reminded to eat food continuously, and see some extremely debilitating effects if you start to push your carrying capacity.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stalker-2-comparing-gear.jpg?itok=to6XBTHh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stalker-2-comparing-gear.jpg?itok=ZKXsaGB5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The combination of carrying capacity limits alongside the lack of fast travel unfortunately is a slog. Going out with equipment, bullets, health and food items, and only three guns I'd regularly find myself at 45-50kg of the 80kg carrying capacity. Carrying much more and suddenly my speed is down to a crawl and my stamina drains faster and recharges slower.</p>

<p>From an on-paper perspective, I can see how this promotes the idea of going 'light' or making returning to a base with a variety of valuable items a more stressful situation. Unfortunately outside of settlements, there's very little else to run into in the overworld. What this results in is a lot of dead time just slowly walking across the map.</p>

<h2><em>STALKER 2</em> will find it's audience</h2>

<p>Chances are if you played the original <em>STALKER</em> you've got some idea of what you're in for but if not imagine a mix between a Fallout and Metro game, with a large open world and more intense survival mechanics. If that is something that you're attracted to then now is your time to hop on. If that doesn't take your fancy then you'll likely not reach a point where the story picks up.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-mobile-revealed</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-xiv-mobile-officially-revealed-launching-in-china-first.1040565/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-mobile-revealed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix and Tencent subsidiary LightSpeed Studios have announced&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em><em>Mobile</em>, a mobile adaptation of the critically-acclaimed MMORPG that's set to launch in China before being released around the world.</p>

<p>Per an <a href="https://ffxivmobile.com/web202409/index.html#/news/detail?lang=en&amp;id=8ed7df04-8e80-47dc-a6be-3339dc3faaf8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official announcement</a>, the game will capture "the immersive experience of the original title in a fresh, mobile-friendly format", so it won't be a direct port; rather, it will be a slightly reimagined version that presumably takes the mobile environment into account.</p>

<p>No release date has been given, but&nbsp;<em>FFXIV Mobile&nbsp;</em>will launch in China first, followed by "a global release soon after". That makes a certain degree of sense given that the developer is a subsidiary of a major Chinese company.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-xiv-mobile-titan-fight.jpeg?itok=n1mdPgTK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-xiv-mobile-titan-fight.jpeg?itok=8-Z43Qtq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Final Fantasy XIV Mobile&nbsp;</em>will serve as an adaptation of the popular MMORPG for mobile devices.</figcaption></figure><p>It seems the studio handling development on&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV Mobile&nbsp;</em>won't be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideaki-itsuno-lightspeed-studios" rel="nofollow">Hideaki Itsuno's LightSpeed Studio Japan</a>, but the core LightSpeed team, which makes sense given Itsuno's desire to focus on action games.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://ffxivmobile.com/web202409/index.html#/news/detail?lang=en&amp;id=6902e2b0-8ec9-4c15-ab88-a81935362931" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an introduction</a> to&nbsp;<em>FFXIV Mobile</em>, Square Enix and LightSpeed promise "controls optimized for mobile devices", a "variety of playable races", and nine jobs for the game's launch, with more presumably to be added over time.</p>

<p><em>FFXIV&nbsp;</em>producer Naoki Yoshida says the mobile version of the game will feature both combat and non-combat jobs, describing&nbsp;<em>FFXIV Mobile&nbsp;</em>as "a sister" to the main game that will aim to "recreate the grandeur of the original's story and combat mechanics" in mobile form.</p>




<p>Side activities like fishing, chocobo racing, and Triple Triad will also be available in&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV Mobile</em>, as will the game's "signature social experience" and "unique, welcoming social atmosphere".</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we don't yet know when&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV Mobile&nbsp;</em>will be available, but the game will be undergoing "multiple play tests in China" first, and a global launch will follow "soon after".</p>

<p><em>FFXIV&nbsp;</em>isn't the only game to be getting the mobile RPG treatment from Tencent soon. Recently, Capcom and the Chinese gaming giant <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-outlanders-mobile-rpg" rel="nofollow">announced&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Outlanders</em></a>, an open-world survival RPG developed by Tencent and published by Capcom.</p>

<p>It's not just Tencent, either. Bungie and NetEase, another massive Chinese gaming company, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/destiny-mobile-spinoff-destiny-rising" rel="nofollow">recently announced&nbsp;<em>Destiny: Rising</em></a>, a mobile spinoff of popular FPS-MMORPG&nbsp;<em>Destiny</em>.
