            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Over recent weeks, we've seen new releases for a whole host of <em>Warhammer 40K</em>&nbsp;Space Marine chapters, including the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-40k-white-scars-combat-patrol-review-ride-wind" rel="nofollow">White Scars</a> with their new Combat Patrol and First Company Captain miniature, and my personal chapter, the Raven Guard, who got the same treatment. But now, it's time for the <em>40K</em> poster boys to upgrade, and we see a whole host of new miniatures for the Ultramarines, and a brand new Terminator boxed set.</p>

<p>We've been covering <i>Warhammer 40K</i> for a while on the site, and you can check out our full <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/warhammer-40k-guide" rel="nofollow">Warhammer 40K Guide</a>, or our preview for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/warhammer-40k-leviathan-first-look" rel="nofollow">Leviathan box</a> that launched the latest edition of the rules.</p>




<h2>All The Terminators, All The Time</h2>

<p>Before we get into the Ultramarines releases, hitting shelves at the same time is the new Crux Terminatus Battleforce. This boxed set is made up entirely of Space Marine Terminators. These Space Marines wear Tactical Dreadnought Armor and are even more durable than normal Space Marines. Most chapters (those that conform to the Codex Astartes, more on that later) only let their 1st company wear Terminator armor, and that company is made up entirely of veterans who've proved their worth in combat.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;Crux Terminatus Battleforce contains 18 Space Marine Terminator miniatures, and 11 are brand new to this boxed set and will be available separately at a later date.</p>

<ul><li>1x Captain in Terminator Armour&nbsp;</li>
	<li>1x Chaplain in Terminator Armour</li>
	<li>1x Ancient in Terminator Armour (brand new in this set)</li>
	<li>10x Assault Terminators (brand new in this set)</li>
	<li>&nbsp;5x&nbsp;Regular Terminators</li>
</ul><p>The new Assault Terminators can be armed with either thunder hammer and storm shields, which have low attacks, high strength, and high damage, plus an additional wound for the storm shield, or twin lightning claws, which have more attacks, a better to hit roll, but lower strength and damage than the thunder hammer option. Your choice will depend on what targets your force is going up against, but with 10 in the Battleforce, you can build a squad armed with 5 of each, or the whole 10 armed with the same loadout.</p>

<p>These Terminators are also available for any chapter, they just happen to be releasing alongside a swathe of other Ultramarines releases, and although the box art features an Ultramarines color-scheme, the included transfer sheet has decals for the&nbsp;Ultramarines, Salamanders, Imperial Fists, White Scars, and Raven Guard.</p>

<p>The Ultramarines are the largest and considered the most organised of the Space Marine chapters. As a legion of the founding Space Marines, their Primarch wrote the book on Space Marine organisation and methods of war, the Codex Astartes. They strictly adhere to this doctrine, where some other chapters might see it as guidance.</p>

<p>To bring war to the enemies of the Emperor, the Chapter Master of the Ultramarines gets a brand new miniature, along with his personal guard, the Victrix Honour Guard. You might have seen Marneus Calgar and his Honour Guard from that moment in <em>Space Marine 2</em> where he drops from the ramp of a Thunderhawk Gunship to save Titus in a cinematically epic scene.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-new-ultramarine-releases-6.jpg?itok=QU3o60PL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-new-ultramarine-releases-6.jpg?itok=KdK3JCLx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This version of Marneus comes wearing the&nbsp;Armour of Antilochus and carries the Gauntlets of Ultramar, which can be used at range or in close combat. He can also be attached to a terminator unit and deep strike onto the battlefield, and then allow that unit to shoot and charge in a turn in which they advance or fall back to keep the pressure on your opponent. This version also doesn't replace the Gravis armored version that comes with 2 Victrix Honour guard, and both are still valid for use.</p>

<p>We're also getting a new Victrix Honour Guard unit, which Marneus, or any other captain, can lead. These come in units of 3 or 6 and come armed with&nbsp;master-crafted bolt carbines and power axes. They also include options to build a Chapter Champion wielding twin-linked blades of honour and a Chapter Ancient (who carries an absolutely insane banner in true ostentatious Victrix Honour Guard style).</p>

<p>Accompanying the new Victrix release, they have a new Company Champion in&nbsp;Cato Sicarius. This already famous Space Marine hero now leads the Vixtrix Honour Guard, guarding the chapter's highest-ranking officers. Wielding the Talassarian Tempest Blade, which has three attack types (strike, sweep, and coup de grace). Cato deals with threats as they close, rather than waiting to defend his charges, and can join a unit of Victrix Honour Guard with Marnesu Calgar as well.</p>

The shoulder pads come for a variety of different armor types, including Phobos, Tacticus, Gravis, Bladeguard Veterans, Aggressors, and Terminators. The included transfer sheet has 255 Ultramarine decals for a lot of unique variety (as long as it adheres to the Codex).</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-new-ultramarine-releases-7.jpg?itok=HNHrRAo0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-new-ultramarine-releases-7.jpg?itok=TLJdolti 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Crux Terminatus Battleforce and Ultramarine Units Final Thoughts?</h2>

<p>The new miniatures, especially those for the Ultramarines, look fantastic. Cato and the Victrix especially look like you would expect those who have excelled even beyond the 1st Company of veteran marines. It's also great to see the Assault Terminators, who've had rules and no new miniatures for a while. I'll be building mine all with lightnight claws in true Raven Guard style.</p>

<p>The new Marneus, Cato, and Victrix Honour Guard combine for a pretty devastating unit, which then makes it incredibly difficult to shift Marneus from. But attaching Marnus to a deep striking terminator unit, like those in the Crux Terminatus Battleforce, means he can deep strike far up the battlefield, and bring the pain right to the enemy.</p>
