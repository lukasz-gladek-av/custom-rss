            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-prices-raised-hardware-software<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Xbox has announced that it's raising the prices of both of its consoles currently on the market, as well as "some" of its upcoming first-party games, in response to "market conditions".</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/hardware-network/console/may-2025-pricing-updates" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on its website, Xbox says the changes have been made due to the aforementioned conditions, as well as the "rising cost of development". From today, you'll be paying $550 for a digital Xbox Series X and $600 for the version with a disc drive, while the Xbox Series S will set you back $380 and $430 for the 512GB and 1TB models, respectively.</p>

<p>In terms of software prices, Xbox will be raising the price of some of its games to $80 "starting this holiday season", although Xbox doesn't specify which games this will apply to.</p>

Judging by the way Xbox hardware <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-hardware-revenue-continues-to-tumble-but-gaming-revenue-is-up-microsoft-reports" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sales are going</a>, though, there's a pretty good chance you're not.</p>

<p>Microsoft isn't the first company to announce that some of its games will get this kind of price jump. When the Nintendo Switch 2 was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">revealed last month</a>, Nintendo announced that certain first-party games, including launch title&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a>, will cost $80, although not every first-party Nintendo game will set you back that much;&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2" rel="nofollow"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></a>, for instance, will retail for $70.</p>

<p>Given that both Nintendo and Microsoft have taken these steps, and that Sony also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-prices-rising-europe-uk-australia-new-zealand" rel="nofollow">raised the prices of the PS5</a> in certain territories recently, it's probably only a matter of time before some PS5 games retail for $80 as well.</p>

<p>Of course, in the background of all of this are the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cmon-reduces-staff-and-pauses-board-game-development-amid-us-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow">tariffs</a> recently introduced by President Donald Trump. While many countries have received a 90-day reprieve from said tariffs, China, which is a manufacturing hub for much of the gaming world, is a notable exception from said reprieves.</p>

Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/koei-tecmo-profits-exceed-expectations-due-to-new-releases.1178658/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/koei-tecmo-financials-profits<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dynasty Warriors&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Atelier&nbsp;</em>studio Koei Tecmo has released its financial results for the 2024-25 fiscal year, and the studio has reported rising profits, largely informed by new releases.</p>

<p>Per the latest Koei Tecmo financial <a href="https://www.koeitecmo.co.jp/e/ir/docs/ir3_20250501_e.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, the studio's operating profit has risen by around 12% over last year, and it's also about 7% higher than the studio's forecast for the twelve-month period.</p>

<p>Koei Tecmo says the increase in its profit is largely down to "our new title release", although the studio does also say that "download sales of back catalog titles have grown". Cost reductions have also contributed to increased profits, according to the report.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dynasty-warriors-origins-koei-tecmo-financials-2025.jpg?itok=JK4yqpbK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dynasty-warriors-origins-koei-tecmo-financials-2025.jpg?itok=o_tsHFIO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins&nbsp;</em>is one of Koei Tecmo's most successful new releases.</figcaption></figure><p>The releases to which Koei Tecmo is referring are likely&nbsp;<em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dynasty-warriors-origins-sales-1m" rel="nofollow">sold a million copies in its first month</a>, and&nbsp;<em>Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories and the Envisioned Land</em>, which serves as the&nbsp;<em>Atelier&nbsp;</em>franchise's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atelier-yumia-sales-300k-fastest-selling" rel="nofollow">fastest-selling title</a>.</p>

<p>Koei Tecmo hasn't revealed any information about the sales performance of&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 2: Black</em>, but given that the game was released simultaneously on Game Pass, it's unlikely it's done quite as well as the two aforementioned titles. Still, if&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-500k" rel="nofollow"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>can do it</a>, so can&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden</em>, I suppose.</p>

<p>In terms of future games, Koei Tecmo is currently gearing up to release a new game in the&nbsp;<em>Atelier&nbsp;</em>series,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atelier-resleriana-red-alchemist-and-white-guardian" rel="nofollow"><em>Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist and the White Guardian</em></a>, which is set to launch sometime this year, although we don't have a release date for it yet.</p>




<p>The studio is also looking ahead to the launch of&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>, which is a co-development project between Team Ninja and&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta&nbsp;</em>studio PlatinumGames. That's due to arrive sometime this year as well, although again, we don't have a concrete release date.</p>

<p>You can read the highlights of Koei Tecmo's <a href="https://www.koeitecmo.co.jp/e/ir/docs/ir1_20250430_e.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">financial report right here</a> if you want to get nerdy with the numbers. We'll bring you more on this as soon as we get it.</p>
