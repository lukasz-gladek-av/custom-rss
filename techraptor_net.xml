            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I played <em>Guitar Hero 3: Legends of Rock</em> constantly as a kid. I was hopeless using the guitar controller, and even had to use a standard controller. But what I remember most was how it introduced me to so many different songs. It was my first introduction to rock artists like Rage Against the Machine, and an obvious love letter to the whole art form. I got similar vibes from my hour and a half hands-on demo and preview event with <em>People of Note</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>A turn-based RPG all about music, Cadence and her band use the power of music while traversing the aptly-named land of Note. After my time with the game, I'm intrigued by the high notes, but worried by a few miscues.</p><h2>Systems That Sing</h2><p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/measures-pon-1.jpg?itok=gtRNko7w 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/measures-pon-1.jpg?itok=hsCvSO3M 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture>It should be noted first and foremost, as it was at our preview event, that <em>People of Note </em>is a music RPG, not a rhythm RPG. Other games, like the recent <em>UNBEATABLE</em>, have music as a part of the plot and heavily as part of the gameplay. <em>People of Note </em>is all about music, but in the gameplay itself, rhythm is about as present as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-french-revolution" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="07f3b1f2-234f-4782-8556-c21c1fb23302" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a><em> </em>attacks.</p><p>For a game all about creativity, I found the more technical parts of the game to be where it shone brightest. In the game's combat, I was really impressed by the game's turn order system. In a mechanic that <em>Final Fantasy X </em>seemed to solve, I felt there were some really creative things happening in <em>People of Note</em>.</p><p>Turns are measured in stanzas, and each turn is a measure. The number of turns you get is determined by a "time signature," where the top number is the amount of turns for your team and the bottom is for the enemy. Later fights in the demo even had modifications made to select measures. What at first seems to be a cosmetic choice seems to actually be one of its best mechanical ideas.</p><p>Management outside of combat allows a lot of creativity as well. <em>People of Note</em>'s Songstone system is a near one-to-one rip of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/ranking-all-of-magic-gathering-final-fantasy-legendary-creatures-part-2" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="83fd60e7-1407-46f1-ac0b-60b876ec8285" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Final Fantasy 7</em></a>'s Materia. That's not a bad thing at all, as it lets you build characters exactly as you want. Even in my hour and a half playtime, I was able to build characters with clear archetypes, with pop star Cadence as my primary damage dealer and the rocker Fret playing support with stat boosts and healing.</p><p>Speaking of characters, the character design is superb. The way Cadence's popstar look clashes with the rock-themed land the demo takes place in makes me really excited about the characters we've yet to meet. The developer at our preview event mentioned that each area in the game is themed after a different genre, and I'm really hoping we get to see a Classical crew decked out with powdered wigs and everything.</p><h2>A Few Sour Notes</h2><p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/freebird-people-of-note-1.jpg?itok=fRe82oO5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture>Outside of the combat, there were a few places that felt like a miss. The dungeon in the demo felt very ho-hum, and navigating it was a real chore. With a good amount of backtracking required, it was easy to get disoriented in similar looking rooms, and the environmental puzzles were pretty by the numbers. It was nice to look at, but it was mostly repetitive and frustrating.</p><p>My other gripe was with the humor. There are puns <em>everywhere </em>in Note, and they start as fun and make some great environmental gags. In dialogue and songs themselves, though, they don't land quite as well. It's clear there's a sincerity behind the jokes, but it just feels like they're far too frequent. Though perhaps it's a little fitting that a love letter to music has band kid humor.</p><h2>People of Note Preview | Final Thoughts</h2><p><em>People of Note </em>went from a relative unknown for me to a game I'm at least intrigued by. I could see its dungeon design and punny dialogue wearing me down quite a bit during its runtime. However, I think its sincerity and sharp systems are interesting and rife with potential.</p><p><em>Guitar Hero </em>was always a love letter to rock. <em>People of Note </em>is striving to be a love letter not to a genre, but to a medium, complete with full musical numbers and loads of variety. It's a huge undertaking, and a big swing for a small team to take. The one certainty I have after my time with <em>People of Note</em>: it's ambitious as hell, and that's enough for me to see it through.</p><hr><p><em><strong>People of Note</strong> was previewed on PC using a copy provided by the publisher over the course of an hour and a half of gameplay.</em></p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-f7cce43c-7fff-fe01-2497-c7469a27d0e0">One thing that constantly persisted in my playthroughs of&nbsp;<em>Love Eternal</em>, the self-proposed “horror platformer” published by Ysbryd Games and developed by Brika, was a perversion of wanting. What I wanted wasn’t entirely clear, whether it was an answer, a challenge, cohesion, or even attrition, and even now, 3 playthroughs later, what&nbsp;<em>Love Eternal</em>&nbsp;*<strong>is</strong>* doesn’t necessarily aim itself towards any of those. Could it? Should it? Well, let’s delve deeper.</p><p dir="ltr">What is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/love-eternal-preview-stunning-precision-platformer" rel="nofollow"><em>Love Eternal</em></a>? Well, in many ways, it’s in the title, but to whom and to what end? Well, all manner of things, if you will. To companionship, creation, celebration, confusion, continuation, cycles, chores, and condemnations. As a product, it’s a buckling beast of wrath, all of it housed inside the cozy visual package of a freeware platformer from the Flash era.</p><p dir="ltr">It’s very unabashed about its inspirations, namely titles like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/i-wanna-be-guy-remastered-fans-developer-blessing" rel="nofollow"><em>I Wanna Be The Guy</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/celeste" rel="nofollow"><em>Celeste</em></a>, as well as PICO-8 platformers like <em>Pullfrog </em>and… well, <em>Celeste</em>, I suppose, and its slew of mods. Narratively, it seeks to emulate elements of David Lynch’s work, while also somewhat unintentionally running parallel to Joe Dante’s segment in the&nbsp;<em>Twilight Zone</em>&nbsp;movie, which is enticing, but horse before the cart, eh?</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/loveeternal_level.jpg?itok=wrnPtgma 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/loveeternal_level.jpg?itok=ml_jh8W2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p dir="ltr"><em>Love Eternal</em> itself is an expansion of Brika’s previous hardcore platformer simply titled <em>Love </em>– not to be confused with Fred Wood’s 2008 2D platformer <em>Love</em>. While the latter is much more straightforward, Brika’s <em>Love</em>, and <em>Love Eterna</em>l, have a sneaky ace up their sleeve. At the push of a button, whether stationary or in mid-air, your character will invert their gravity and use the ceiling as their new platform.</p><p dir="ltr">How the game approaches this gimmick is largely through the use of increasing the length of stringing together how many times you can invert in one floating period through the use of red crystals, which refresh your one-time use. There are hazards like spikes and lasers, and these, in turn, close the timings tighter until it becomes more masochistic than precision. A meeting of the minds between its two main inspirations.</p><p dir="ltr">On the whole, this is the game. It is a maximum of three hours of this mechanic stretched to an atomically small width, where the margins get tighter, and the line of red crystals becomes longer. Is it fun? It is initially, before repeat playthroughs, which, due to the narrative, are outright encouraged, undermine how reliant the game is solely on one element of <em>Love Eternal</em>'s platforming possibilities. Instead, what we have is a story to sink our teeth into.</p><picture>

  </picture><p dir="ltr">You play as Maya, a young girl seemingly at odds with everything in her life, from her family and what they eat for dinner, to her friends and their failure to show up for events Maya’s scheduled. Her reactionary anger to friends like Lacey for failing to show up at an event with Maya, brings the wrath of a selfish god who, unbeknownst to Maya, invites her into a castle hosted of her memories, as fractured and as alien to Maya, as much as they are to the God itself.</p><p dir="ltr">What follows is a spotty, but nonetheless, consistently fascinating string of scenes detailing a lot of this nefarious God’s activity, and a lip service treatment of Maya’s history. Why she’s chosen is just down to bad luck on her part, and as such, <em>Love Eternal </em>is much more interested in detailing how this God interacts with the world around Maya – their new plaything – and their history of previous playthings. The result as a whole, is a memetic experience that is alluring, but aggravatingly impenetrable.</p><p dir="ltr">It’s branded as “an experimental narrative”, but in reality, it is an abstract story, almost completely detached from gameplay, and contextualized through two decades of internet history. If the screenshots fail to garner a reaction other than “buh?”, then just know that they DO make sense, in one very acute angle of how this game structures its writing. Otherwise, you mostly fall prey to this God's absurdist reactions to a world that has gone from temples to touchpads, the Baby Boomer to end all Baby Boomers.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/loveeternal_shout.jpg?itok=JC2NGDQf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p dir="ltr">It’s almost pointless trying to adequately compose a consistent chain of events that would make this even remotely make sense. The somewhat garbled memories of Maya intersecting with a previous victim of the God, Divesh, and why the two meet so frequently, when, even when it’s shown, Divesh shows nowhere near the same amount of ire towards his contemporaries like Maya does. Instead, what <em>Love Eternal</em> focuses on is Dadaism.</p><p dir="ltr">Watch! As the God assumes Maya is a girl wholly inspired by the use of 2010 rage comics, one Memebase watermark short of a negative vote rating on 9gag. Gasp! As they react to manga as if it is a coloring book! Chuckle! As the ending of&nbsp;<em>The Blair Witch Project</em>&nbsp;is referenced multiple times in the same scene, but with an irreverence of dopiness behind it! And finally, analog horror jumpscares that shut the game down when finished.</p><p dir="ltr">It should be noted that all of this takes place when the platforming is discarded for a genre switch to a point ‘n click, which falls just shy of being the worst kind of visual novel. Save for an ending which, without spoiling, throws an entirely new angle of commentary towards the player, the platforming element becomes a branch of the statement Brika is trying to make… I think.</p><picture>

  </picture><p dir="ltr">Is the mare meant to race? Should the child be coached? What follows these questions are historical context that no longer applies when we, as a collective, have fallen past the need for it. Marriage is no longer a bond of religious intent, but one with protections and privy to the human condition, ultra-modernized. A statement is a JPEG, a playground is a platformer, and you are still you, getting older, and with it, more despondent to a world that doesn’t want you. So you want it, more than food or water. You want it, never need it.</p><p dir="ltr">If that is the intent, it’s an absorbing diatribe, which deserves something a bit more welcoming to synchronicity. Towards the end, Brika seems to lament their creative intent, anger as progression is pushed into the player without the player actively engaging in it, almost furious that there’s a cage around them. Like all animals, they buckle, but to what end? Just living.</p><h2><em>Love Eternal </em>Review | Final Verdict</h2><p dir="ltr">I won’t say that <em>Love Eternal</em> is a great game. Despite its cost-effective batch of content, the reliance on its legitimately bewitching gimmick being one broad stroke of challenge leaves the player desiring more. While the story is a legitimately enthralling aspect, it betrays the supposed experimentation by just sitting alongside the gameplay, and never the two shall meet.</p><hr><p><em><strong>Love Eternal </strong>was reviewed on PC with a copy provided by the publisher over the course of 8 hours of gameplay.

Following their traditions, the rest of her family isolates to mourn the loss, but very quickly learns that they're all where One Eye, a faustian devil, wants them to be as he plans to collect on the souls owed to him.</p><p dir="ltr">As Maven, a master of the dark arts, you're able to read the contracts laid out by One Eye, and by participating in card-based battles, you can alter the contracts to benefit the different family members whose lives have unknowingly been put on the line.</p><picture>

  </picture><p dir="ltr">The way that the story relates to the gameplay is that each member of the cursed family that you assist will start you with a deck, including some cursed cards. Over the course of a number of runs, you'll not only work to defeat One Eye and his lieutenants through playing the game, but upgrade your deck and even seek to remove the cursed cards to get the 'best' ending.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Play Your Cards In A One-Dimensional Deckbuilding Roguelite Game</h2><p dir="ltr">In <em>The Killing Stone</em>, the core gameplay is centered around a card battling system where you spend energy to summon creatures, try to take out your opponents health while preserving your own, and work your way through the different nodes of the contracts that can offer a variety of good or bad effects.</p><p dir="ltr">Beginning with the card game itself, each round you'll gain three energy to spend on your cards. These can be units that will deal damage or have other effects, or spells that can affect you or your opponent. You can only ever have three units on the main battle line, but there are spaces to fill in 'reserve' units, which sit above the main units on the board and take over their place if the main unit falls.</p><picture>

You can always see when combat is activated which units will remain alive, which will take damage, and how much damage you might deal directly to your opponent. This is incredibly helpful when you've got to factor in up to six units a side, spells, reserves, and all kinds of other abilities.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Each Layer Of <em>The Killing Stone</em> Adds Additional Challenge</h2><p dir="ltr">Your deck and build will constantly be changing as you progress through the framework of each Ritual's contract.</p><picture>

  </picture><p dir="ltr">When you start each family member will have Curse cards, these are often negative cards that will force you to do something like sacrifice one of your creatures before you can do anything else or they could just sit in your hand and be useless. You'll have chances to get rid of these curses, but the game also finds a way to put more of them in front of you.</p><p dir="ltr">Forge events are nodes where you can alter sets of cards in your hands. These can include lowering the summoning costs of cards, getting new cards, or even getting rid of Curse cards. These also come in a variety of levels offering better cards, though those are normally behind riskier battles.</p><p dir="ltr">Outside of the cards in your hand there are also Boons and Banes that can be picked up, permanent modifiers that will grow as you spend time with the deck. Some of these are temporary, while others will have the opportunity to become permanent further refining your build.</p><picture>

  </picture><p dir="ltr">To cap it all off certain difficult battles even have additional rules that might just benefit your opponent, or could also force you both to act in certain ways. An early additional rule I ran into was that every turn I received a card that would let me draw two more cards at no cost, but I needed to sacrifice one unit every turn before I could play any other cards.</p><p dir="ltr">The style and speed of gameplay immediately shifted as I was drawing cards and playing with so many more opportunities, but it was also being forced to kill off powerful units just as quickly.</p><h2 dir="ltr">A Roguelite With A Heavy Emphasis On Story</h2><p dir="ltr">Each member of the family has their own deck that you'll be building over the course of their chapter. You'll learn about the family members through optional dialogue with them and the rest of the family, and even talk with the spirit of Mariken herself.</p><p dir="ltr">The game ties into the greater story by the state of each family member's deck coming back in the final act of the game, as a deck you return to, but also one that will decide the character's fate.</p><picture>

  </picture><p dir="ltr">After completing the story of a family member, you'll be able to save the deck and continue on to the next family member, but if you think you could do better or want to craft a deck completely free of any curses then you can replay that chapter and just enjoy the deckbuilding gameplay.</p><p dir="ltr">It's in this way that there's still runs and getting better as you'd expect from a Roguelite, but also a point where you're going to narratively save the character by improving on their deck enough.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><em>The Killing Stone's</em> Dialogue Is Too Rich</h2><p dir="ltr">A key aspect of <em>The Killing Stone</em> is the dedication to the storytelling, and the way the story is told to the player. The game has a Modern English setting, that is something akin to enjoying modern media set in the past, and then there's a Period English that is much closer to classic Shakespearean.</p><p dir="ltr">Listening to Liam O'Brien's One Eye and Emma Gregory's Mariken being performed in the Period English has been so entertaining. Luckily, you can also set the spoken dialogue to one, while the written is set to the other. I most enjoyed it when I could hear the period english performances, while also making sure I missed nothing in the text.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>I know I could have made it by with just reading the Period English, but I likely would have wanted to be there with a highlighter and margin space to ponder and interpret.</p><p dir="ltr">While these two performances are spectacular, and they absolutely hold your attention while being performed, it is a bit disappointing that the other characters that you interact with aren't voiced at all. In scenes where your character, another member of the family, and One Eye are each taking turns to speak it's only even 1/3rd of the conversation that you're hearing instead of just reading.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Early Access Doesn't Skimp On The Content</h2><p dir="ltr"><em>The Killing Stone</em> is releasing in Early Access, but it was only a few weeks ago that today was intended to be the full date of release. A side-effect of this is that in its current state, you get to play, and replay, the main three story arcs for the different family members, have access to all of the optional missions, and the vast majority of the cards.</p><p dir="ltr">The only thing narratively that isn't available at present is the final arc, The Reckoning, that is going to be added later. While it's a shame a 1.0 release wasn't able to happen, this does give players plenty of chances to replay the story arcs and craft decks free of curses.</p><picture>

  </picture><p dir="ltr">Unlike a lot of Early Access titles that seem to launch in a 50% state and work their way up to 100%, my experience with <em>The Killing Stone</em> has felt more like 85% of the game, leaving me to anticipate the final 15%.</p><h2 dir="ltr">I'm Ready For More <em>Killing Stone</em></h2><p dir="ltr"><em>The Killing Stone</em> is a really enjoyable and complex deckbuilding roguelite. I wasn't too sure how I would feel about the emphasis that narrative has on the story, but it's woven in so nicely with the gameplay that you want to progress not just because the game gets more enjoyably complex, but also because you want to hear more of the stunning performances in the game.</p><p dir="ltr">While I've finished a number of rituals and crafted some fine decks, I can definitely see this as a quick roguelite to continue to return to and build towards that Reckoning so that I'm ready for its release.</p><hr><p><em><strong>The Killing Stone </strong>was previewed on PC via Steam with a code provided by the publisher over the course of 12 hours - All images were taken by the previewer.</em></p></div><div><p><span><div>
