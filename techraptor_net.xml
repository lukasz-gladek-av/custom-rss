            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/astro-bot-holiday-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Team Asobi has announced a holiday update for celebrated 3D platformer&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em>, and it's set to add a brand new level to the game tomorrow.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/12/11/astro-bot-winter-wonder-update-out-tomorrow/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation Blog post</a>, Team Asobi studio director Nicolas Doucet says that the "little robotic elves of Team Asobi have been very busy" preparing the new update, which arrives tomorrow at 6pm Pacific (that's 9pm Eastern and around 11pm GMT).</p>

<p>The first major addition coming as part of the update is a level by the name of Winter Wonder, which Doucet describes as a "fun-filled level with shiny presents [and] a good dose of jingle bells". Sounds pretty appropriate for the holiday season!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/team-asobi-astro-bot-holiday-update-new-level.jpg?itok=XeKgwsmJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/team-asobi-astro-bot-holiday-update-new-level.jpg?itok=-wrL7LhX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>is getting a holiday update that brings a brand new level and more.</figcaption></figure><p>Team Asobi promises that the new level won't offer a "hair-pulling challenge", since it was designed "with every user in mind", which, again, feels appropriate enough for a holiday-themed level.</p>

<p>As well as the level itself, you can also look forward to some special new bots to find, although Team Asobi says it wants both the bots and the level itself to "remain a little surprise", so it's not giving away many details regarding either element of the update.</p>

<p>If you want to access Winter Wonder, you'll need to have completed&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em>, although as our very own <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/astro-bot-review-90s-platformer-done-right" rel="nofollow">Andrew Stretch's glowing review</a> will attest, doing so isn't a particularly arduous task. If you haven't already played&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em>, then this new level might be the perfect excuse to convince you to do so.</p>




<p>Winter Wonder is just the latest piece of post-launch content for&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em>. Since it arrived in September, the 3D platformer has been updated with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/astro-bot-dlc-post-launch" rel="nofollow">new challenge stages</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-astro-bot-speedrun-stage-tomorrow" rel="nofollow">new bots</a>, although we're not sure if those updates will continue into 2025.</p>

<p>Given that&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>managed to rack up <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/astro-bot-sales-sony-financials" rel="nofollow">1.5 million sales in a nine-week period</a>, however, it'd arguably be in Sony's best interest to continue supporting the game. Will that success lead to a sequel? Only time will tell.</p>

<p><em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>is available right now <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/astro-bot/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">exclusively for PlayStation 5</a>. The holiday update, which adds the Winter Wonder level and new special bots, will be made available for all players tomorrow.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Aardman Pokemon Collaboration Revealed for 2027]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/aardman-pokemon-collaboration</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/aardman-pokemon-collaboration-revealed-for-2027.1058004/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/aardman-pokemon-collaboration<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Stop-motion animation studio Aardman, best known for the&nbsp;<em>Wallace and Gromit&nbsp;</em>series and movies like <em>The&nbsp;</em><em>Pirates! In an Adventure with Scientists!</em>, has announced a collaboration with&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>&nbsp;that's set to debut in a couple of years.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.aardman.com/latest-news/2024/december/pokemon-aardman-team-up-for-exciting-collaboration-coming-2027/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an announcement on its website</a>, Aardman says its collaboration with The Pokemon Company will consist of "a special project" that'll arrive in 2027, and that the project will involve Aardman "bringing its unique style of storytelling to the <em>Pokemon</em> universe in brand-new adventures".</p>

<p>Aardman managing director Sean Clarke says that the collab will bring together&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>and Aardman's "love of craft, character and comedic storytelling", so it sounds like Aardman will be given at least a degree of creative control over the project, although The Pokemon Company isn't likely to let the studio do whatever it wants.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wallace-and-gromit-aardman-pokemon.jpg?itok=n1NjTG5f 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wallace-and-gromit-aardman-pokemon.jpg?itok=KFSuT0G- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Aardman is perhaps best known for the&nbsp;<em>Wallace and Gromit&nbsp;</em>series.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>marketing and media VP Taito Okiura, meanwhile, says that the teamup between Aardman and&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>is "a dream partnership", describing Aardman as "masters of their craft" and teasing that "global <em>Pokemon</em> fans are in for a treat".</p>

<p>This won't be&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>'s first dalliance with stop-motion animation. Back in February 2023, The Pokemon Company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-dlc-hidden-treasure-of-area-zero-revealed" rel="nofollow">announced&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Concierge</em></a>, a stop-motion series that was then in production for Netflix. It aired in December last year, attracting <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/pokemon_concierge/s01" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">strongly positive reviews</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, we don't yet know whether&nbsp;the Aardman collaboration will be another series or a movie, but the announcement refers to "brand-new adventures", so we'll seemingly be getting more than one of whatever the two companies are cooking up.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-concierge-wooper.jpg?itok=Azy1sRY- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-concierge-wooper.jpg?itok=IihTiqJF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>has dabbled in stop-motion animation before.</figcaption></figure><p>As for what's next for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>, the next game in the series <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-a-announced" rel="nofollow">will be&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em></a>, which is supposedly currently in development for Switch and which is intended to land next year, although we haven't heard much about the game since its announcement back in February.</p>

<p>Otherwise, the next major mainline installments in the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>series will probably be appearing on the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation" rel="nofollow">long-awaited Switch 2</a>, so much like the Aardman collab, we'll probably be waiting a while for more news on that one. Stay tuned for more.</p>
