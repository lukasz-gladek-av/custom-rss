            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/transformers-reactivate-canceled-as-splash-damage-staff-at-risk-of-redundancy<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Splash Damage has announced that upcoming online multiplayer action game&nbsp;<em>Transformers: Reactivate&nbsp;</em>has been canceled, and that a number of roles at the studio may now be "at risk of redundancy".</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/splashdamage/status/1877020458454749485" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message</a> on social media platform X, Splash Damage says that as well as canceling&nbsp;<em>Transformers: Reactivate</em>, the studio will be "scaling down to refocus [its] efforts on other projects", which is why some staff may be laid off.</p>

<p>The studio doesn't specify which staff members or which departments are most at risk, but it does say that "having to say goodbye" to employees "hurts even more" than not being able to release&nbsp;<em>Transformers: Reactivate</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/transformers-reactivate-canceled-shooting.jpg?itok=CfmFSIbA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/transformers-reactivate-canceled-shooting.jpg?itok=vLiSwSQW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Transformers: Reactivate&nbsp;</em>has been, well, deactivated.</figcaption></figure><p>The cancellation of&nbsp;<em>Transformers: Reactivate&nbsp;</em>probably shouldn't come as too much of a surprise. The game was first revealed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everything-announced-at-game-awards-2022" rel="nofollow">during the Game Awards opening ceremony back in 2022</a>, but since then, Splash Damage has been pretty quiet about its development.</p>

<p>Outside of the (admittedly rather evocative) announcement trailer, Splash Damage didn't reveal much about&nbsp;<em>Reactivate</em>, save that it would be an online-focused action game for 1-4 players and that it would come to PC and consoles.</p>

<p>Following the initial reveal, however, Splash Damage did announce that it had purchased <i>Transformers: Reactivate&nbsp;</i>development partner Bulkhead. As far as we know, Bulkhead remains a Splash Damage subsidiary despite the cancellation.</p>

<p>At some point, Splash Damage planned to hold a closed beta for the game, but it looks like that test never materialized either, at least for public-facing signups.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/transformers-reactivate-canceled-hand.jpg?itok=KeBPR9Sq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/transformers-reactivate-canceled-hand.jpg?itok=zOYj60Ie 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Unfortunately, Splash Damage won't get to realize its vision for the multiplayer-focused&nbsp;<em>Transformers: Reactivate</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Between this cancellation and the <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/17512/transformers-galactic-trials" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">underwhelming release</a> of Outright Games'&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/transformers-galactic-trials-announcement" rel="nofollow">action-racing roguelite</a>&nbsp;<em>Transformers: Galactic Trials</em>, it seems that&nbsp;<em>Transformers&nbsp;</em>fans are having a pretty bad couple of years when it comes to video game adaptations of the property.</p>

<p>It doesn't sound like Splash Damage is shutting down entirely as a result of this cancellation, so we'll have to wait and see what the studio does next. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/finspan-takes-the-wingspan-formula-to-new-depths-later-this-month.1077153/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/finspan-wingspan-creators-january<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Wingspan&nbsp;</em>studio Stonemaier Games has announced&nbsp;<em>Finspan</em>, the latest game in the&nbsp;<em>Wingspan&nbsp;</em>family. As you've probably already guessed, the game expands the card-based engine-building gameplay of&nbsp;<em>Wingspan&nbsp;</em>into the world of marine life.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Finspan</em>, which follows on from&nbsp;<em>Wingspan&nbsp;</em>and its <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/embrace-your-inner-dracologist-with-wyrmspan" rel="nofollow">dragon-based successor&nbsp;<em>Wyrmspan</em></a>, has you playing as a marine researcher who must observe aquatic life over three zones: the Sunlight Zone, the Twilight Zone, and the Midnight Zone.</p>

<p>Each of&nbsp;<em>Finspan</em>'s dive sites will help you with a key aspect of your research, from growing your fish collection to discovering new eggs and even hatching eggs to create schools of fish. If you've played&nbsp;<em>Wingspan</em>, you'll probably be familiar with the basic idea here, albeit with a marine twist.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stonemaier-games-finspan-play.jpg?itok=yFRfN_Xc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stonemaier-games-finspan-play.jpg?itok=n-viEVPW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Finspan&nbsp;</em>takes the&nbsp;<em>Wingspan&nbsp;</em>formula to new depths, as it were.</figcaption></figure><p>Players will compete with one another to assemble vast arrays of marine life, with the winner being the player that gains the most points. You can score points through "fish, eggs, young, schools, and achievements", according to Stonemaier.</p>

<p><em>Wingspan&nbsp;</em>designer Elizabeth Hargrave says that while she knew fish were often requested by fans of her game, she "didn't feel like [she] had the bandwidth to do them justice", but that she's "absolutely delighted"&nbsp;<em>Finspan&nbsp;</em>will soon be out there in the world.</p>

<p>Hargrave goes on to say that she hopes&nbsp;<em>Finspan&nbsp;</em>"will inspire people to connect with the marine world and conservation in the same way that&nbsp;<em>Wingspan&nbsp;</em>has made people birders".</p>

<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Finspan</em>, which also shows off the game's beautiful board and fish card artwork, right here.</p>




<p><em>Finspan&nbsp;</em>will support up to five players of ages 10 and up, and a game should take you somewhere between 45 and 60 minutes to complete, which is roughly in keeping with&nbsp;<em>Wingspan</em>'s duration.</p>

<p>Notably, the game will also offer a solo play mode created by Automa Factory, the studio that also worked on solo play modes for Stonemaier titles like&nbsp;<em>Scythe&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Tapestry</em>, as well as&nbsp;<em>Wingspan&nbsp;</em>itself.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Finspan&nbsp;</em>when it launches on January 22nd to <a href="https://stonemaiergames.com/games/finspan/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">buy direct from Stonemaier</a>, followed by a wider retail release in February. To catch up before then, why not check out our reviews of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/wingspan-review-pleasant-from-beak-to-tailfeather" rel="nofollow">Wingspan</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/wyrmspan-review-takes-wingspan-to-new-heights" rel="nofollow"><em>Wyrmspan</em></a>?</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/plaion-koch-media-ceo-stepping-down</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ceo-of-plaion-formerly-koch-media-to-step-down-after-31-years.1077084/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/plaion-koch-media-ceo-stepping-down<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Klemens Kundratitz, the CEO and co-founder of Plaion (formerly known as Koch Media), will step down from his role after 31 years and take an advisory role with parent company Embracer Group.</p>

<p>Per a press release, Kundratitz has decided that it's time to "take a step back and spend more time with his family", and so he's handing over the CEO reins to Phil Rogers, an exec who's "leading the creation of the new Middle-earth &amp; Friends operating unit".</p>

<p>In case you need a reminder, Middle-earth &amp; Friends is one of the three companies <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-splitting-three-companies" rel="nofollow">into which Embracer Group will be splitting</a>&nbsp;during this year, alongside tabletop division Asmodee and indie label Coffee Stain &amp; Friends.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/plaion-koch-media-ceo-klemens-kundratitz-kingdom-come-deliverance.jpg?itok=NU5JGk3e 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/plaion-koch-media-ceo-klemens-kundratitz-kingdom-come-deliverance.jpg?itok=EbZDFiuL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Through its various divisions, Plaion has published a number of games, including&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Kundratitz, who co-founded Plaion as Koch Media alongside Franz Koch back in 1994, says he's "delighted" to be handing over CEO duties to Rogers, and that he believes Rogers will continue Plaion's "excellent momentum".</p>

<p>For his part, Rogers says he's "excited" to start building Middle-earth &amp; Friends as Plaion's new CEO, and that Kundratitz has built an "incredible legacy" over the course of his 31 years with the company.</p>

<p>Though you might not recognize Plaion's name, you'll probably know at least one of the publishing labels under its stewardship, namely Deep Silver, Ravenscourt, and Prime Matter.</p>

<p>Through Deep Silver, Plaion has published games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/payday-3" rel="nofollow"><em>Payday 3</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dead-island-2" rel="nofollow"><em>Dead Island 2</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/metro-exodus" rel="nofollow"><em>Metro Exodus</em></a>, while the Prime Matter label is responsible for the likes of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/kingdom-come-deliverance" rel="nofollow">Kingdom Come: Deliverance</a>&nbsp;</em>(whose developer Warhorse Studios is also a subsidiary of Plaion) and 2023's&nbsp;<em>System Shock&nbsp;</em>remake.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/system-shock-remake-plaion-koch-media-ceo.jpg?itok=1865tiQI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/system-shock-remake-plaion-koch-media-ceo.jpg?itok=gCCB_aF9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>System Shock&nbsp;</em>is just one of the many pies in which Plaion has its fingers.</figcaption></figure><p>As for Kundratitz himself, while he's stepping back from CEO duties with Plaion, he's not leaving Embracer entirely. He'll now serve as a "strategic advisor" for the group, which, given its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-financials-q2-2024" rel="nofollow">recent financial woes</a>, I'm sure will be appreciated.</p>

<p>It's unlikely that Kundratitz's departure will have a material effect on Embracer or its companies from a public-facing perspective, but we'll have to wait and see whether anything changes as a result of this management shift. Stay tuned.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Freedom Wars Remastered Review - Abductor Slayer]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/freedom-wars-remastered-review-abductor-slayer</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/freedom-wars-remastered-review-abductor-slayer.1077036/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/freedom-wars-remastered-review-abductor-slayer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In September of last year, <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em> was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/freedom-wars-remastered-announced" rel="nofollow">announced</a>. The circles I frequent online were quite enthusiastic about this, despite me having never heard of the game. I mean, I didn't even own a <a href="https://techraptor.net/platform/playstation-vita" rel="nofollow">PS Vita</a>, it seemed like a completely obscure title. Still, the excitement from my friends piqued my interest, so I had to see what <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em> was all about.</p>

<p>It seemed like a weird choice to revive a dormant IP exclusive to the PS Vita, but I'm glad I took the chance to review it. Turns out, <em>Freedom Wars </em><em>Remastered</em> is a quirky and competent take on the <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/series/monster-hunter" rel="nofollow">Monster Hunter</a> </em>formula, and that makes for an addicting game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-screenshot-1_1.jpg?itok=BxiFgXLe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-screenshot-1_1.jpg?itok=2Nmk-fdF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I guess I'll take that as a compliment?</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Freedom Wars Remastered,</em> a Decade After the Original</h2>

<p>As <em>Freedom Wars</em> is a remaster of a PS Vita title from 2014, you might expect it to look a bit dated visually. The smaller screen of a Vita means lower resolution, so obviously graphics aren't going to be on par with that of consoles.</p>

<p>Still, developer Dimps Corporation makes a commendable effort to revitalize <em>Freedom Wars</em> with this remaster. With upgraded textures and running a higher resolution, <em>Freedom Wars</em> <em>Remastered</em> looks very good considering its origins.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-gameplay-2.jpg?itok=AD2jGueH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-gameplay-2.jpg?itok=1iW1Ohiw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The squad's here!</figcaption></figure><p>Supposedly, it can run on 4k resolution. I couldn't find any way to tweak graphics on the PS5 version of <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em>, so I'll just have to take the developer's word for it. I presume PC versions will have more options to adjust visuals. At the very least, I can say <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em> runs at 60 FPS, so it's a smooth ride.</p>

<p>Really, the only issue is some animations look a little janky, especially during dialogue. There's a lot of talking in <em>Freedom Wars Remastered, </em>and facial animations are super rudimentary. It's nothing that'll detract from the experience; in fact, it's usually the only <em>visual </em>reminder that this was once a PS Vita game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-gameplay.jpg?itok=nxl8UtQJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-gameplay.jpg?itok=8fGmfn3e 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's satisfying to drag down a big ol' monster!</figcaption></figure><h2>Fighting For the Cause in <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em></h2>

<p>To put it simply, <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em> takes the <em>Monster Hunter</em> formula and gives it a gratifying hook (as if <em>Monster Hunter </em>wasn't already addicting). Not only are you acquiring new materials to upgrade equipment, but you also have a million-year prison sentence. As a sinner, you're tasked with working off that sentence by taking on various operations.</p>

<p>Your player character's prison sentence literally looms over your head, and just about every action you do either contributes to or diminishes said sentence. Stand around in one place too long? The game will give you a few decades to think about your ungodly crime.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-sentence-2.jpg?itok=5K79MwUD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-sentence-2.jpg?itok=5slMXScb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Just a drop in the bucket.</figcaption></figure><p>And so, that's where these operations come in. Completing various missions, ranging from extermination of "Abductors" (<em>Freedom Wars' </em>version of monsters), rescuing citizens, and donating valuable resources to the cause, all help diminish that prison term.</p>

<p>Watching the prison sentence deteriorate over the course of the campaign and into the endgame is a very satisfying feeling, even if it's an arbitrary number. It's a way to catalog your rank among other players and track your progress. Having this little way to measure your efforts encouraged me to do "just one more mission."</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-dragon.jpg?itok=viEelOT3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-dragon.jpg?itok=35ppx2Ns 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>We got Rathalos at home.</figcaption></figure><p>This progress is also tracked via online leaderboards. It's a multiplayer game with other sinners, and each sinner belongs to a Panopticon. Think of a Panopticon as your home base. You choose this at the beginning of the game when you're customizing your character, and each Panopticon represents a prefecture of Japan.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if this will change once the public has hands on it, but the original version of <em>Freedom Wars</em> split Panopticons as cities around the globe. Though, as far as I know, the only choice now is Japan's prefectures, so I went with Hokkaido.</p>

<p>The leaderboard tallies your contribution both within the Panopticon and against other prefectures, so it's again, a very neat little measure to see how everyone's progressing and incentivizes some friendly competition.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-anductor.jpg?itok=PnRJ97GW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-anductor.jpg?itok=3xdoBSgM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sometimes, guns are the best option!</figcaption></figure><h2>On the Hunt in<em> Freedom Wars Remastered</em></h2>

<p>It's in <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em>'s combat that many players will find some sort of familiarity with. I don't like to draw comparisons to other games if I can help it, but it's hard to ignore the fact that<em> Freedom Wars Remastered</em> plays a great deal like <em>Monster Hunter</em>.</p>

<p>The whole routine of fighting giant monsters (Abductors), severing parts, upgrading your equipment from said parts, and going back into the fray is the general gameplay loop here. Though, on its own, <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em> is a competent action game, even if it's a bit light on game mechanics.</p>

<p>There are several different weapon types to choose from, each with its own skillset, as well as firearms. You can equip yourself with two different weapons at once, so that gives room for some versatility. You're also given several AI companions if you're playing solo, as well as your own customizable Accessory -- this is a robot companion that helps you out.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-combat-2.jpg?itok=4jYnJyuJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-combat-2.jpg?itok=1BcP709u 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Once they're on the ground, it's time to lay on the hurt.</figcaption></figure><p>To top it all off, you have a thorn, which makes <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em>'s gameplay quite enjoyable. By shooting a thorn onto a wall or enemy, you can launch yourself to that location and pull off some cool air attacks. It's especially useful against Abductors so you can sever parts that are higher up.</p>

<p>Thorns are super fun to use, launching yourself around gargantuan foes like you're from <em>Attack on Titan</em>. It adds just a bit of extra oomph to the gameplay, though the rest of <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em> could do with either new weapons, a few new attacks, or just something else to help it stand out.</p>

<p>Enemy variety, too, is just a bit repetitive. Most enemies come in the form of Abductors, and they increase in power as you progress through the campaign. The thing is, most of them follow the same template of being bipeds, quadrupeds, and the like, and they don't look or act all that different as time goes on.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-story.jpg?itok=PPPqQDfj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-story.jpg?itok=zdJCpUkl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Aries, one of the story's several key characters.</figcaption></figure><h2>A Story That Never Reaches Its Potential in <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em></h2>

<p>My thoughts on <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em>'s story are conflicted. On one hand, I really like its premise and setting, but on the other, the way the story is told is not all that great. The setting is, you're in this resource war, as presumably the world's resources are sparse in that day and age.</p>

<p>As such, Sinners are required to gather resources. Regular civilians are kidnapped by rival Panopticons' Abductors, and Sinners have to go save them. Meanwhile, there are various factions working within and outside of your Panopticon with different agendas and motives, most of which remain vague throughout the duration.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-story-2.jpg?itok=KXrymuDK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/freedom-wars-remastered-story-2.jpg?itok=Rsv1EFyt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Most of the characters are likable enough.</figcaption></figure><p>In fact, <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em> ends on an absurdly disappointing note. There are some post-game activities, but as I understand it, the story was supposed to continue in a sequel that never was. It leads to some mysteries that are never solved, which is a shame.</p>

<p><em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em> also presents its story in a sloppy way. The start of the game is front-loaded with a ton of dialogue, so it's super slow-going at first and really could do better with its pacing. On top of that, walking around your Panopticon to continue the story is pretty sluggish and doesn't make for exciting gameplay.</p>

<p>There are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1OD00IBWxM" rel="nofollow">a few enhancements</a> that returning players will enjoy. Apparently, upgrading weapons has become a more seamless experience. They've added subtle improvements to combat overall, and even a new difficulty mode. These are additions that I initially took for granted, but when I learned about how <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em> changed for the better, I was very appreciative of these tweaks.</p>

<p>Despite some problems with <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em>'s story and the lack of depth in its gameplay, I still had a lot of fun with this title. Seeing your sentence diminish as time goes on is a gratifying feeling. Moreover, once it launches for players worldwide, I imagine the conflict amongst other Panopticons will lead to some exciting rivalries.</p>

<p>Who knows, <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em> might even lead to the long-awaited sequel. I'd absolutely love to see <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em>'s formula expanded upon. More depth in its gameplay and a more developed story in a sequel would make it a strong rival to <em>Monster Hunter</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ravenswatch-nightmares-unleashed-update-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Passtech Games and publisher Nacon have announced the release date for the upcoming <i>Ravenswatch&nbsp;</i>Nightmares Unleashed update, and it's landing in just a couple of weeks.</p>

<p>The update will represent the first major free content drop since the game's launch back in September, and it's officially coming to all platforms simultaneously on January 23rd, so you'll have to split your time <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dwarf-fortress-adventure-mode-release-date" rel="nofollow">between this and&nbsp;<em>Dwarf Fortress</em></a>.</p>

<p>New features you can look forward to in the Nightmares Unleashed update include improvements to the Key system, new minibosses to take down, and alternate Master Nightmare encounter patterns to keep you on your toes.</p>

<p>New activities can also be found throughout&nbsp;<em>Ravenswatch</em>, including Blood Rituals, which allow you to get your hands on Keys by battling a new enemy and halting the ritual. Other new events include Locked Chests, for which you'll need Keys, and the Sacrificial Idol, which lets you give up health for damage.</p>

<p>New NPCs have also been added in the form of the Refugees, a small group of unfortunate souls who will ask for your help if they encounter you. Passtech says they either represent "a glimmer of hope in your journey, or a bad decision around the corner".</p>
