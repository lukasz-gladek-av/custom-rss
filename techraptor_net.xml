            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>WWE&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Earth Defense Force&nbsp;</em>developer Yuke's has acquired Japanese visual novel-focused studio Aquaplus, best known for games like&nbsp;<em>To Heart</em>,&nbsp;<em>Utawarerumono</em>, and&nbsp;<em>White Album</em>.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/toheart-developer-aquaplus-to-be-acquired-by-wwf-smack-down-and-edf-developer-yukes/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Automaton Media</a>, Yuke's announced the acquisition via its official Japanese website earlier today. The deal, which cost Yuke's around 784 million yen (around $5.3 million), also includes F.I.X. Records, a music label under Aquaplus' stewardship.</p>

<p>Naturally, as is customary in the corporate world, Yuke's is looking to leverage Aquaplus' expertise in the visual novel area in order to reach a new audience, and it'll be putting some of its own development heft behind the studio's ongoing projects.</p>

<p>The aforementioned&nbsp;<em>White Album&nbsp;</em>was unavailable outside of Japan between its original 1998 release and 2023, when it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/legendary-visual-novel-white-album-finally-coming-to-steam-with-official-english" rel="nofollow">released for PC via Steam in the West</a>, complete with an all-new official localization.</p>

<p><em>ToHeart</em>, meanwhile, was remade earlier this year for PC and Switch, and the new version boasts all-new 3D scenes, improved visuals and gameplay, and a new set of voiceovers, although you can also choose to switch to the original cast if you prefer.</p>

<p>As for Yuke's, you probably know the studio's name best from the&nbsp;<em>WWE 2K&nbsp;</em>series, for which it was responsible between its inception in 2000 through to 2018, at which point 2K subsidiary Visual Concepts took over the series (with what can best be described as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wwe-2k20-ps4-refunds-being-issued-to-unhappy-customers" rel="nofollow">mixed results to start with</a>).</p>

<p>You may also know Yuke's from its work on the&nbsp;<em>Earth Defense Force&nbsp;</em>franchise; the developer worked on spinoffs like the&nbsp;<em>World Brothers&nbsp;</em>sub-series and 2019's&nbsp;<em>Iron Rain</em>.</p>

<p>Whether or not the acquisition of Aquaplus by Yuke's results in a change in either studio's operations remains to be seen, but I'd imagine it'll be business as usual. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>According to a new report, a&nbsp;<em>BioShock&nbsp;</em>remake that was in development at publisher 2K has been canceled, and the long-awaited&nbsp;<em>BioShock 4&nbsp;</em>is currently struggling due to problems with its story.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-01/next-bioshock-game-changes-leaders-after-development-turmoil" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>, a remake of the original&nbsp;<em>BioShock&nbsp;</em>was being developed at 2K Games, although which development subsidiary was to handle the project is unclear. That's moot now, though, of course, since the project has been shut down.</p>

<p>Not only that, but <i>BioShock 4</i>, which was announced all the way back in late 2019 (and which has been rumored to take place in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioshock-4-rumored-to-be-set-in-1960s-antarctica" rel="nofollow">Antarctica in the 1960s</a>), has run into its own spot of bother, with senior 2K executives reportedly unhappy with the direction of the game's story.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bioshock-remake-canceled-big-daddy.jpg?itok=gPy7-qSH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bioshock-remake-canceled-big-daddy.jpg?itok=_5EMe5sX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>An in-development&nbsp;<em>BioShock&nbsp;</em>remake has apparently been canceled.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Schreier's report, a recent internal review concerning&nbsp;<em>BioShock 4&nbsp;</em>at 2K resulted in executives expressing dismay with the narrative chosen by developer Cloud Chamber, although it's not clear exactly what they were displeased with.</p>

<p>As a result of that review, however, Kelley Gilmore was ousted from her role at the top of Cloud Chamber, and Hogarth de la Plante, who was previously serving as&nbsp;<em>BioShock 4</em>'s creative director, will now serve in what Schreier calls "a publishing role".</p>

<p>Additionally, Cloud Chamber staffers were reportedly told by 2K that their studio needs to become "more agile and efficient" (that's Bloomberg's wording), which sounds like prime corporate speak for impending staff cuts.</p>

<p>2K told Bloomberg that while the current iteration of&nbsp;<em>BioShock 4&nbsp;</em>is "good", the publisher is "committed to delivering a great [game]", and that it's currently "working closely with [Cloud Chamber] leadership" to achieve this goal.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bioshock-remake-canceled-infinite.jpg?itok=v2_teEk0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bioshock-remake-canceled-infinite.jpg?itok=oTFgO7BY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>BioShock Infinite&nbsp;</em>remains the last mainline entry in the&nbsp;<em>BioShock&nbsp;</em>series for now.</figcaption></figure><p>Since&nbsp;<em>BioShock 4&nbsp;</em>is struggling and the&nbsp;<em>BioShock&nbsp;</em>remake has been canned, it looks like&nbsp;<em>BioShock&nbsp;</em>fans' next great hope is&nbsp;<em>Judas</em>, Ken Levine and Ghost Story Games' upcoming narrative FPS.</p>

<p>Sadly, that game doesn't have a release date yet, so for now, it seems as though you'll have to content yourself with replaying the existing&nbsp;<em>BioShock&nbsp;</em>games. Stay tuned for more.</p>
