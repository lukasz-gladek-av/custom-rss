            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bendy-lone-wolf-roguelike-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Joey Drew Studios has announced a new&nbsp;<em>Bendy&nbsp;</em>game in the form of&nbsp;<em>Bendy: Lone Wolf</em>, but it looks like this one will be taking a slightly different tack with regards to genre.</p>

<p>Where previous&nbsp;<em>Bendy&nbsp;</em>games were (by and large) first-person horror affairs,&nbsp;<em>Bendy: Lone Wolf&nbsp;</em>is a roguelike that pits its titular canine Boris against "endlessly generated corridors" and "ever increasing odds".</p>

<p>Exploring the twisting hallways of the <em>Bendy&nbsp;</em>series' fictional Joey Drew Studios (for which the developer is also named), Boris will need his wits about him as "monsters and obstacles emerge from every direction".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bendy-lone-wolf-announced-boris.jpg?itok=U1Bd5DSa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bendy-lone-wolf-announced-boris.jpg?itok=6YeGBlx2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Bendy: Lone Wolf&nbsp;</em>pits Boris against the ever-shifting corridors of Joey Drew Studios.</figcaption></figure><p>As Boris explores, he'll come up against the "cartoon creeps of the Dark Puddles", and it's up to you to use the weapons and resources you've gathered, as well as "the clever use of dangerous traps", to get rid of them.</p>

<p>Additionally, you'll be chased by a truly terrifying foe known only as the Ink Demon, and it sounds like you won't be able to fight him. Instead, you'll have to "run and hide" when you hear the "beating of his ink heart".</p>

<p>It's a shift away from&nbsp;<em>Bendy</em>'s traditional first-person horror puzzling, but it looks like the game still retains the signature atmosphere of the&nbsp;<em>Bendy&nbsp;</em>series. You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Bendy: Lone Wolf&nbsp;</em>right here.</p>




<p>Action roguelikes (or roguelites) based on popular franchises are becoming increasingly prevalent. In the last couple of years alone, we've seen the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/rogue-prince-of-persia-is-another-stellar-aa-addition-to-prince-of-persia-franchise" rel="nofollow"><em>The Rogue Prince of Persia</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Callisto Protocol&nbsp;</em>spinoff&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/redacted-callisto-protocol-spinoff-release-date" rel="nofollow"><em>Redacted</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-in-random-eternal-die-roguelike-announced" rel="nofollow"><em>Lost in Random: The Eternal Die</em></a>&nbsp;carrying that particular torch.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Bendy: Lone Wolf&nbsp;</em>will be released sometime next year for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3232610/Bendy_Lone_Wolf/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch, and it'll also be available on mobile devices. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things&nbsp;<em>Bendy</em>-related.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/agatha-christie-death-on-the-nile-brings-a-classic-detective-mystery-next-year.1062579/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/agatha-christie-death-on-nile-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microids has announced&nbsp;<em>Agatha Christie: Death on the Nile</em>, a brand new adaptation of one of the mystery writer's most celebrated books, and the adventure game is due to hit PC and current-gen consoles next year.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.microids.com/microids-unveils-the-video-game-adaptation-of-the-iconic-novel-agatha-christie-death-on-the-nile/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an announcement post</a>, Microids says its&nbsp;<em>Death on the Nile&nbsp;</em>adaptation will explore "all-new plots, advanced gameplay mechanics and a unique setting" in the form of 1970s Egypt, so even if you've read the book, it sounds like you'll still have plenty to discover.</p>

<p>This time around, you won't just be playing as the legendary Hercule Poirot, but also as new detective Jane Royce, who must pursue her own investigation adjacent to Poirot's. The two investigations will then "collide" in Abu Simbel, an important location in the original novel.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/agatha-christie-death-on-the-nile-jane-royce.jpg?itok=Xo8KrHNY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/agatha-christie-death-on-the-nile-jane-royce.jpg?itok=Yc5zzHQJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Agatha Christie: Death on the Nile&nbsp;</em>introduces us to Jane Royce, a new detective character.</figcaption></figure><p>As you'll know if you've read Christie's original book, Jane Royce is an entirely new creation for this game, so it'll be interesting to see where her investigation takes her and how it dovetails with the mystery from the novel.</p>

<p>As well as a new character and new plot threads, Microids' adaptation of&nbsp;<em>Death on the Nile&nbsp;</em>will also offer a raised level of difficulty, "more complex puzzles", and "more freedom in the progression of the investigation", according to Microids head David Chomard.</p>

<p>He also promises a closer dovetailing of Poirot's and Royce's stories when compared to those of Poirot and Joanna Locke in&nbsp;<em>Murder on the Orient Express</em>, which was Microids Studio Lyon's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/murder-on-orient-express-release-date" rel="nofollow">previous stab at a Poirot game</a>.</p>

<p>You'll use the detectives' mindmap - which looks not unlike the mind palace from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sherlock-holmes-awakened-gets-release-date-goes-gold" rel="nofollow">Frogwares'</a>&nbsp;<em>Sherlock Holmes&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/how-frogwares-created-sherlock-holmes-chapter-one-without-crunch" rel="nofollow">games</a> - to piece the cases together, and you'll then confront suspects to expose their lies. It all sounds like classic detective adventure stuff.</p>




<p>We don't have a release date for <i>Agatha Christie: Death on the Nile&nbsp;</i>yet, but when it arrives, you'll be able to play it for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3150480/Agatha_Christie__Death_on_the_Nile/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch. Stay tuned for more.</p>
