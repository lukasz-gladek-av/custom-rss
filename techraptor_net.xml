            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-handheld-confirmed-but-years-away<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Xbox head Phil Spencer has officially confirmed that an Xbox handheld is in the works, although that announcement does, as you would expect, carry several pretty heavy caveats.</p>

<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-13/microsoft-s-gaming-chief-is-still-looking-for-acquisitions-sees-future-growth" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a>, Spencer said that the "expectation" is that Xbox would create some kind of hardware in the handheld category. Bloomberg says that Xbox is "working on prototypes", but that the final release of any kind of Xbox handheld device is "a few years out".</p>

<p>An Xbox handheld (that is to say one created officially by Xbox, rather than one simply <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/logitech-and-tencent-cloud-gaming-handheld-images-possibly-leaked" rel="nofollow">designed to play</a> Xbox cloud games) has long been rumored, but this is the first official confirmation we've had from anyone on Xbox's side.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/asus-rog-ally-xbox-handheld.jpg?itok=qhbTOxyk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/asus-rog-ally-xbox-handheld.jpg?itok=gnSjnz5M 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There are handheld devices that play Xbox games on the market, but we now know that an official Xbox handheld is in the works.</figcaption></figure><p>Rather than focusing on the handheld, Xbox engineers will instead work to improve the Xbox app on existing devices. Spencer told Bloomberg there was room for improvement with regards to the Xbox app, and that any potential handheld needs to be "informed by learning and what's happening now".</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the interview, Spencer reveals a couple of other interesting tidbits regarding Xbox's strategy. He reiterates that there are no "red lines" dictating which games could or couldn't come to non-Xbox platforms, but says that it's too early to talk about whether&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>could go multiplatform.</p>

<p>Spencer also confirms that Microsoft and Xbox are still looking at more acquisitions, which puts recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-ceo-payrise-layoffs" rel="nofollow">sweeping layoffs</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown" rel="nofollow">studio closures</a> at Microsoft into somewhat stark relief if you ask me.</p>

<p>Then again, Xbox arguably has a history of saying seemingly contradictory things after making big decisions. Remember when Matt Booty said Xbox <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-smaller-games-comment-hi-fi-rush" rel="nofollow">needed "smaller games"</a> right after closing two studios that would have been ideally situated to make them? Me too.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/redfall-xbox-arkane-closure.jpg?itok=p9SgA1Jz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/redfall-xbox-arkane-closure.jpg?itok=34aX7k45 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Even after closing two studios earlier this year, Microsoft still says it's considering more acquisitions.</figcaption></figure><p>Spencer also confirms in the Bloomberg interview that the planned Xbox mobile store, which was originally announced in May with a July release window, has been delayed.</p>

<p>He says that an approach in which Microsoft simply hopes that "if we build it, they will come" won't work, and so the challenge is trying to figure out how to get consumers to find the Xbox store amongst stiff competition.</p>

<p>It should be noted that this is distinct from Xbox allowing you to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-android-app-games" rel="nofollow">buy and play games via its own app</a>, a feature that Xbox president Sarah Bond announced would be implemented following <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-google-victory-play-store" rel="nofollow">a ruling in an Epic-Google lawsuit</a> that also proved favorable to Microsoft.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-outlanders-mobile-rpg</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-outlanders-is-an-open-world-mobile-rpg-from-tencent-and-capcom.1034622/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-outlanders-mobile-rpg<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom and Tencent subsidiary TiMi Studio Group have announced&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Outlanders</em>, an open-world action RPG set to be released for mobile devices.</p>

<p>The two studios describe&nbsp;<em>Outlanders&nbsp;</em>as an "open-world survival game set in the&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>universe", and you'll be able to do all of the things you'd expect from a&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>game, including discovering ecosystems, crafting gear, and hunting alongside your friends.</p>

<p>We don't have a release date for&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Outlanders&nbsp;</em>yet, but TiMi and Capcom say they will be conducting "several play tests in advance", although those don't have dates yet either, unfortunately. The goal with the game is to create a mobile experience you can enjoy "with friends, anytime and anywhere".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-outlanders-gliding.jpg?itok=CKAskoKS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-outlanders-gliding.jpg?itok=Q6GMqsIK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Monster Hunter Outlanders&nbsp;</em>is an open-world mobile survival RPG from TiMi and Capcom.</figcaption></figure><p>The screenshots TiMi and Capcom have released so far show a game that looks...well, a lot like a traditional&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>game. Expect open-ended areas to explore, monsters to take down, and lots of elaborate, ostentatious armor and weapons to build from monsters' remains.</p>

<p>The two studios are promising "natural environments [and] ecosystems" to discover, so like classic&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter</em>, you'll probably be able to observe monsters as they go about their daily lives before you start your hunt.</p>

<p>If you're interested in&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Outlanders</em>, you can sign up for email announcements via the <a href="https://monsterhunteroutlanders.com/en/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">newly-created official website</a>, which also displays some rather evocative concept art.</p>




<p>The reveal of&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Outlanders&nbsp;</em>comes as Capcom gets ready to release&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, the next mainline entry in the franchise, which is scheduled to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-release-date" rel="nofollow">arrive across PC and consoles in February</a>.</p>

<p>It's shaping up to be a pretty big success already; an open beta was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta" rel="nofollow">held earlier this month</a>, and the beta alone <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-steam-records" rel="nofollow">broke the series' Steam player count record</a> despite not being a full game.</p>

<p>We don't yet have an official release date or window for&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Outlanders</em>, so watch this space for more info as and when we get it.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Gylt and Rime Developer Tequila Works Files for Insolvency]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tequila-works-insolvency</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gylt-and-rime-developer-tequila-works-files-for-insolvency.1034556/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tequila-works-insolvency<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Gylt&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Sexy Brutale&nbsp;</em>developer Tequila Works has filed for insolvency, with newly-appointed general manager&nbsp;Térence Mosca citing "prolonged market conditions" as the reason for the studio's predicament.</p>

<p>According to a GamesIndustry.biz <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/rime-developer-tequila-works-files-for-insolvency" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, Mosca says he's proud of what his team "has accomplished together", but that the aforementioned market conditions gave his studio no choice other than filing for insolvency.</p>

<p>As a reminder, Tequila Works <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tequila-works-rime-sexy-brutale-layoffs" rel="nofollow">canceled an unannounced project</a> and laid off an unspecified number of staff back in October, calling the current moment in the gaming industry an "incredibly difficult time". Evidently, those layoffs and that cancellation weren't enough to save the studio.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tequila-works-insolvency-rime.jpg?itok=9k1Rc0Q0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tequila-works-insolvency-rime.jpg?itok=LjOf2zZz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Tequila Works is responsible for games like&nbsp;<em>Rime</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that insolvency isn't necessarily the same thing as a studio shutdown; essentially, insolvency means an entity isn't able to pay the debts it's incurred, which means Tequila is functionally out of money but not necessarily defunct yet.</p>

<p>As such, the studio could undergo a reorganization under Mosca, although it looks like it might take a pretty mighty reorganization effort in order to save a studio that seems to have been struggling for quite some time.</p>

<p>In the statement provided by GI.biz, Mosca says that the studio is doing everything it can to "provide support and guidance to our teams", an assurance that was also made when the studio laid off staff and canceled its project last month.</p>

<p>The statement notably doesn't say that Tequila has canceled its remaining project or laid off the remainder of its staff, so it's possible we may see Tequila rising from the ashes at some point in the future.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-sexy-brutale-tequila-works-church.jpg?itok=LSlQWP4B 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-sexy-brutale-tequila-works-church.jpg?itok=cuhNEQBm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Previous games by Tequila Works include time-loop puzzler&nbsp;<em>The Sexy Brutale</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Tequila Works was founded in 2009 and released its first game, cinematic zombie platformer&nbsp;<em>Deadlight</em>, in 2012. That game was followed by titles like&nbsp;<em>The Sexy Brutale</em>,&nbsp;<em>Rime</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Gylt</em>, as well as last year's&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>spinoff&nbsp;<em>Song of Nunu</em>.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen what lies in Tequila Works' future, but don't be surprised if we don't hear from the studio for some time. Stay tuned for more.</p>
