            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has announced that&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.8 will be launching in late July, bringing with it a brand new permanent summer resort map, a new playable character, and more.</p>

<p>Following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-57-release-date" rel="nofollow">last month's Version 5.7 update</a>, Version 5.8 will arrive on July 30th. Its main new addition is the Easybreeze Holiday Resort, where you'll meet familiar faces pursuing their own agendas, including none other than everyone's favorite bard Venti.</p>

<p>The new map will also grant you traversal powers that will allow you to "glide across water and hover briefly in midair across the layers of the resort", and you'll gain other powers that will let you solve new puzzles and explore the resort more effectively as well.</p>

<p>Ineffa is a 5-star polearm user based on the Electro element, and she can deal continuous Electro damage by summoning a devastating thunder cloud to hover over the battlefield. Not only that, but if she's your active character, she can summon a shield and a drone that deals extra Electro damage for her.</p>

<p>You'll be able to recruit Ineffa to your team as part of the first half of Version 5.8's wish cycle, along with a rerun of Citlali. In the second half, you'll get the chance to recruit Mualani and Chasca if you missed them the first time around.</p>




<p>As ever, there are also bonus codes to give you some free stuff as part of this version cycle, so here they are!</p>

<ul><li>Ineffa0730Birgitta - 100 Primogems, 10 Mystic Enhancement Ore</li>
	<li>Summer0730Asha - 100 Primogems, 5 Hero's Wit</li>
