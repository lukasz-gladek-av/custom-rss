            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-record-breaking-financials-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>PUBG: Battlegrounds&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Callisto Protocol&nbsp;</em>publisher Krafton has released its financial statement for the 2024 fiscal year, and the company has reported "record-breaking" sales and profits.</p>

<p>Per a press release, Krafton's sales grew by 41.8% in 2024 when compared to the previous year, while its profits grew by a staggering 54%. Both of these figures were, Krafton says, "driven by the continued expansion and sustainability of the&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>IP".</p>

<p>The figures mean that Krafton's average annual sales growth rate for the past five years stands at 20%, which isn't too shabby at all. I'm sure the studio will be happy with these numbers.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/krafton-financials-2024-pubg.jpg?itok=EiCaq-fE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/krafton-financials-2024-pubg.jpg?itok=HTOeUEbU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>IP has driven a year of record-breaking highs for Krafton in financial terms.</figcaption></figure><p>Krafton also reported its numbers for the year's fourth quarter along with the full twelve-month span, and that quarter also brought growth for the company, with sales rising 15.5% and profit rising 31.1% year-on-year.</p>

<p>According to Krafton,&nbsp;<em>PUBG</em>'s transition to a free-to-play model, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pubg-player-count-doubles-on-steam-after-free-to-play-launch" rel="nofollow">took place in late 2021</a>, "has continued to drive growth", along with the IP's various successful collaborations. As a reminder, those collaborations have historically included the likes of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/payday-pubg-crossover-starbreeze-krafton" rel="nofollow">Payday</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pubg-crossover-adds-dead-by-daylight-for-spooky-frights" rel="nofollow"><em>Dead by Daylight</em></a>, among many others.</p>

<p>With regards to its future, Krafton says it wants to make "significant investments in securing a 'Big Franchise IP'", although it's not clear whether that means the company wants to acquire a new property or transform its&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>IP into a "Big Franchise".</p>

<p>The company's slate of games for this year includes the likes of survival sequel&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/subnautica-2-early-access-2025-co-op" rel="nofollow">Subnautica 2</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Sims&nbsp;</em>competitor&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/inzoi-release-date-delayed" rel="nofollow"><em>inZoi</em></a>, as well as the global launch of&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker Mobile&nbsp;</em>and multiplayer life sim&nbsp;<em>Dinkum Together</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/krafton-financials-2024-inzoi.jpg?itok=q6pFkDiy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/krafton-financials-2024-inzoi.jpg?itok=RR-wQmRH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Krafton's upcoming slate includes&nbsp;<em>inZoi</em>, as well as&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>and more.</figcaption></figure><p>It's been an eventful year for Krafton, to say the least. Not only does the company have a packed slate of upcoming games, but it also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-acquires-tango-gameworks-and-hi-fi-rush-ip-with-plans-for-future-expansion" rel="nofollow">acquired Tango Gameworks</a> and the rights to the&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush&nbsp;</em>IP after Microsoft <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown" rel="nofollow">turned its back on the studio</a>.</p>

<p>Krafton is also planning to develop a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-mobile-version-krafton" rel="nofollow">mobile version of global smash hit&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em></a>, although we don't have a release window for that yet. Hopefully, that won't have the rather <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-generative-ai-characters-pubg-inzoi" rel="nofollow">nightmarish-sounding AI-generated player characters</a> the studio is currently going all-in on.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[PlayStation State of Play Confirmed for February 12th]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-confirmed</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-state-of-play-confirmed-for-february-12th.1105908/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-confirmed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has announced that a new PlayStation State of Play show will air tomorrow, featuring updates on "exciting games from studios around the world".</p>

<p>Announcing the showcase on its PlayStation&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/11/state-of-play-returns-tomorrow-february-12/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">blog</a>, Sony says the new State of Play will last for 40-plus minutes and that it'll air at 2pm Pacific (that's 5pm Eastern and around 10pm GMT, so make sure you grab your coffee if you're planning to stay up for it).</p>

<p>The show will be broadcast via Sony's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/PlayStation" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/playstation" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Twitch</a> channels, and you'll be able to watch it in either English or Japanese, depending on your whim.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-mgs.jpg?itok=uD0c1482 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-mgs.jpg?itok=ETbep27N 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Tomorrow's State of Play could bring that&nbsp;<em>MGS Delta&nbsp;</em>release date you've been waiting for.</figcaption></figure><p>So, what are we likely to see during the show? Well, naturally, Sony is remaining tight-lipped about what will be showcased, so we'll have to resort to (educated!) guesswork.</p>

<p>The most likely announcement for tomorrow's State of Play is a release date for&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em>. The release date was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-release-date-leak-playstation" rel="nofollow">leaked last week</a> via a PlayStation Store listing and new trailer before being hastily removed, so it's almost certainly earmarked for the show.</p>

<p>Upcoming PlayStation-exclusive games (for now, at least!) include&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ghost-of-yotei-ghost-of-tsushima-followup-2025" rel="nofollow"><em>Ghost of Yotei</em></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;Hideo Kojima's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-filming-and-recording-completed" rel="nofollow"><em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em></a>, both of which could get new extended gameplay demos or release dates tomorrow.</p>

<p>There's also a non-zero chance that some sort of&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>remaster or remake could finally be revealed tomorrow, if Sony's recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloodborne-psx-demake-dmca-sony" rel="nofollow">twin DMCA takedowns</a> of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloodborne-60fps-patch-dmca" rel="nofollow">fan projects</a> revolving around the game are anything to go by.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-bloodborne-rumor.jpg?itok=mBxsRziX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-bloodborne-rumor.jpg?itok=cvxkO2At 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Could that long-awaited&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>remaster finally be coming?</figcaption></figure><p>Whatever PlayStation has to show for itself, it's following hot on the heels of January's Xbox Developer Direct, during which we got new looks at&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>,&nbsp;<em>South of Midnight</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, as well as the reveal of a new&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden&nbsp;</em>game.</p>

<p>Whether or not Sony shows anything comparable off remains to be seen, but you can tune in tomorrow at 2pm Pacific (5pm Eastern, 10pm GMT).</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Unity Reportedly Lays Off Yet More Staff, Including Entire Behavior Division]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/more-unity-layoffs-report</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/unity-reportedly-lays-off-yet-more-staff-including-entire-behavior-division.1105905/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/more-unity-layoffs-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>New reports have emerged claiming that Unity has laid off a number of employees, with one report suggesting that the company's entire Behavior division has been laid off.</p>

<p>According to Unity Behavior head Shanee Nishry, the whole Behavior team has been "included in [Unity's] latest round of layoffs". Nishry says she's reached out to Unity leadership to ask if "they can open source the project", but that this isn't guaranteed.</p>

<p>Additionally, designer&nbsp;André de Miranda Cardoso <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andre-mc_unfortunately-i-was-affected-by-the-latest-activity-7295024528282288128-4mqz/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">posted on LinkedIn earlier</a> confirming that he's been "affected by the latest Unity layoff[s]". Neither former employee confirmed how many staff members had been laid off across the company.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/unity-layoffs-report-editor.jpg?itok=e85RPOHM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/unity-layoffs-report-editor.jpg?itok=OCWy1rza 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>More layoffs have apparently hit Unity.</figcaption></figure><p>Other Unity employees to confirm the layoffs include senior software developer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7294738324894691329/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Coline Turquin</a> and tech lead <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7294815856256049152/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Florence Rolland-Soulier</a>&nbsp;(both courtesy of <a href="https://80.lv/articles/breaking-unity-suddenly-lays-off-numerous-developers-with-a-5-am-email/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">80.lv</a>), the latter of whom refers to the latest round as a "wave of mass layoffs".</p>

<p>Another employee impacted by the layoffs, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7294910467607535616/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Peter Roe</a>, "call[s] out" the way Unity chose to communicate the layoffs to staff, claiming that the company sent "a 5am email" from a "noreply" email address to inform him that his role would be "eliminated".</p>

<p>It's worth noting that Unity itself has yet to publicly announce or confirm these layoffs. However, given how many Unity employees (or former employees) are coming forward to share their stories, it seems unlikely that the reports are false.</p>

<p>Back in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unity-layoffs-core-business" rel="nofollow">January last year</a>, Unity revealed that it would slash 25% of its workforce in order to "refocus on its core business". It's unclear whether these layoffs are part of that wave or whether they represent a further commitment to cutting staff.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/subnautica-unity.jpg?itok=UthiZiRj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/subnautica-unity.jpg?itok=5HN1eJIi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Subnautica&nbsp;</em>is just one of many games made using Unity.</figcaption></figure><p>It's not the first time Unity has committed to laying off employees, either; in 2023, the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unity-weta-digital-layoffs" rel="nofollow">said it would lay off hundreds of staff members</a> as part of a company-wide "reset" effort.</p>

<p>All of this follows the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unity-developers-outraged-after-major-pricing-change" rel="nofollow">introduction</a> of a controversial runtime fee policy change in 2023, which was so poorly received that it appears to have led to CEO <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unity-ceo-john-riccitiello-retiring-after-runtime-fee-controversy" rel="nofollow">John Riccitello retiring</a>. The fee was subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unity-runtime-fee-canceled" rel="nofollow">canceled altogether</a> in September last year.</p>
