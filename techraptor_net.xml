            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/upcoming-magic-presents-spring-flourishes-event-showcases-new-dd-themed-cards<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has announced a new draft event for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a>. The event, Magic Presents: Spring Flourishes, will be available in supporting retail stores in April. Participants can obtain new cards featuring characters and artwork from <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>.</p>



<p>In an official <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/earn-d-and-d-themed-promo-cards-with-magic-presents-spring-flourishes" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>, Wizards of the Coast explained what players can expect from Magic Presents: Spring Flourishes. The event will take place between April 25 to May 25, in keeping with the Spring title.</p>

Either way, you will still draft in pods of eight, then play against your fellow participants.</p>

<p>But the big draw of this event are the promotional <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> cards. Everyone who participates in the event will get a non-foil borderless card of a legendary creature from the world of D&amp;D.</p>

<p>These cards will be quite familiar for those who recall the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves</em> Secret Lair. This is because this draft event is part of the first official Secret Lair test by Wizards of the Coast. Among those creatures is the legendarily large red dragon Themberchaud.</p>

Sometimes, these limited drops feature familiar cards with different names or artwork. But on occasion, a completely unique card is made to better represent the theme of that Secret Lair.</p>

<p>In order to prevent availability issues and mitigate FOMO, Wizards announced their "SLX" program. Under this program, any mechanically unique cards released as part of a Secret Lair will have a counterpart made available. Mechanically the same, but aesthetically different. Furthermore, you can purchase these non-foil cards from your local retail store.</p>

<p>The Magic Presents: Spring Flourish event is the first attempt at this Secret Lair test. So your participation and feedback will ensure whether these kinds of events will continue.</p>
