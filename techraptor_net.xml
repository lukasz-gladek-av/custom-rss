            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-eshop-online-closing-china-2026<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced that it will shut down the eShop and all Switch network services in China in 2026. No reason has been given for the shutdown.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.nintendoswitch.com.cn/topics/57ea6913-1a17-4afa-b325-a1a1a8596e15" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a notice</a> posted on the official Chinese Nintendo website (thanks, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-eshop-closing-2026-in-china" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>), the eShop will cease selling games and software on March 31st, 2026, after which point you won't be able to buy any games from the eShop, nor will you be able to download demos, trials, or free games.</p>

<p>Following that, on May 15th of the same year, you won't be able to download games from the eShop, and you won't be able to redeem codes either. That means you won't be able to buy any DLC, and it also seems to mean you won't be able to download games you already own.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/super-mario-odyssey-eshop-closure-china.jpg?itok=clxwOBnG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/super-mario-odyssey-eshop-closure-china.jpg?itok=0WvP487i 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Nintendo Switch eShop, as well as all of the console's network services, will be coming to an end in 2026 in China.</figcaption></figure><p>On the same day, all Switch-related network services will also be shut down, so you'll no longer be able to play Switch games online with your friends at that point.</p>

<p>You can see a full list of all of the games that will be affected by the network shutdown <a href="https://www.nintendoswitch.com.cn/support/software_affected.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>. It's in Chinese, and we're using machine translation for it, but it seems relatively accurate to me (although I have little to no knowledge of Chinese as a language).</p>

<p>In order to compensate Chinese Switch gamers for this decision, Nintendo will give away up to four Nintendo games for users via their WeChat account. You'll need to have activated your Switch console, and you'll need to have stuck to the Terms of Use as well.</p>

<p>The list has a couple of...unusual entries using machine translation, but games like&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>,&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Yoshi's Crafted World&nbsp;</em>can be redeemed, as well as&nbsp;<em>Kirby Star Allies</em>,&nbsp;<em>New Pokemon Snap</em>, and more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-eshop-closure-china-new-pokemon-snap.jpg?itok=o1tMZUrf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-eshop-closure-china-new-pokemon-snap.jpg?itok=I6sOdYmB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you're a Switch user in China, you could be entitled to a free copy of&nbsp;<em>New Pokemon Snap</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>The giveaway starts on November 27th and runs until March 31st, 2026, and you'll need to use WeChat's game redemption applet in order to take advantage of it.</p>

<p>Do note that you'll have to download whatever games you decide to grab before May 15th, or else your free games will be gone for good. It's also worth noting that as far as we know, this doesn't affect the eShop anywhere else in the world.</p>

<p>News of the eShop's closure in China comes amid fevered speculation about the Switch 2, which Nintendo is due to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation" rel="nofollow">reveal sometime before April</a>. It's not clear what this might mean for the Switch 2 in China.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Echoes of Wisdom Now Has a Place on the Official Zelda Timeline]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/echoes-of-wisdom-zelda-timeline</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/echoes-of-wisdom-now-has-a-place-on-the-official-zelda-timeline.1045530/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/echoes-of-wisdom-zelda-timeline<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has finally allocated a place for&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>on its sprawling and baffling&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>timeline, although one rather wonders if that constitutes wasted effort on the Japanese gaming giant's part.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-finally-places-echoes-of-wisdom-on-its-official-zelda-timeline" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">IGN</a>,&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>is now located just before the original 1986&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda</em>&nbsp;and just after&nbsp;<em>Tri-Force Heroes&nbsp;</em>on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/character/zelda/en/history/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official timeline</a>, which means that it takes place in the branch in which Link was defeated in&nbsp;<em>Ocarina of Time</em>.</p>

<p>In case you need reminding, the&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>timeline is unified until&nbsp;<em>Ocarina of Time</em>, at which point two divergent branches are created: one in which Link is defeated by Ganondorf and one in which he emerges victorious.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-timeline-beds.jpg?itok=zARfnUfm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-timeline-beds.jpg?itok=FfIUiNcH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>now has a place on the official&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>timeline.</figcaption></figure><p>The branch in which Link is triumphant has its own two branches, too: one set in Link's "child era" and one in his "adult era". The former gives rise to&nbsp;<em>Majora's Mask&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Twilight Princess</em>, while the latter leads to&nbsp;<em>The Wind Waker&nbsp;</em>and its DS sequels.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly where&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-wild" rel="nofollow">Breath of the Wild</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-kingdom" rel="nofollow">Tears of the Kingdom</a>&nbsp;</em>fit into the timeline...well, they don't. They're part of their own branch, one that's not connected to any previous&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>games.</p>

<p>I've never quite understood the appeal of creating an overarching&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>timeline. The series doesn't feel like it fits neatly into a chronology, and imposing a rigid timeline on things arguably makes it harder for fans to create fun theories, like the one that posits all&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>games are retellings of the same story.</p>

<p>Still, if you were wondering exactly where&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>fits into the broader <i>Zelda</i>...storyline, then now you know.</p>




<p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>is the latest entry in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>series. It combines the top-down perspective of classic&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>games with the experimental systems-based style of&nbsp;<em>Breath of the Wild</em>.</p>

<p>Unlike previous&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>games, you'll play as Princess Zelda in this one, and you'll use Echoes to conjure everything from objects to monsters in order to help you solve freeform puzzles.</p>

<p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>is available right now <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">exclusively on Nintendo Switch</a>.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/casey-hudson-humanoid-origin-closed-down</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ex-bioware-dev-casey-hudsons-studio-humanoid-origin-closes-down.1045515/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/casey-hudson-humanoid-origin-closed-down<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Humanoid Origin, the studio started by ex-BioWare staffer Casey Hudson, has closed down, citing "an unexpected shortfall of funding" that left the studio "unable to sustain operations".</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/humanoid-origin_earlier-today-we-informed-our-staff-that-activity-7266889657370447874-9uwE/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">LinkedIn post</a>, Humanoid Origin says that the closure happened despite its "efforts to shield the studio from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-june-14th" rel="nofollow">broader challenges in the industry</a>", and that the company is "heartbroken" it won't be able to complete its debut project.</p>

<p>The project in question was set to take place in a "new science-fiction universe", and while Hudson and Humanoid Origin never revealed what kind of game it would be, the studio's <a href="https://humanoidorigin.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official website</a>&nbsp;describes it as a "multi-platform AAA title focused on character-driven narrative". Sounds very familiar indeed.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/casey-hudson-humanoid-origin-closure-mass-effect.jpg?itok=4I2uaIGN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/casey-hudson-humanoid-origin-closure-mass-effect.jpg?itok=sGPLRKBe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Casey Hudson is perhaps best known for his work as a director on the&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect&nbsp;</em>series.</figcaption></figure><p>Humanoid Origin says that it's "committed to supporting [its team] in their transition to new employment", and that during the team's time together, it "achieved incredible progress", fostering "a culture of fun and creativity".</p>

<p>The studio is right when it points to the current time as one of tumult and difficulty for the gaming industry (or certain sections of it, at the very least).</p>

<p>Major studios like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-ceo-payrise-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Sony</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-interactive-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Take-Two</a> have laid off hundreds of staff members in recent times, and some studios, like&nbsp;<em>Saints Row&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-shuts-down-saints-row-developer-volition" rel="nofollow">Volition</a> and&nbsp;<em>Gothic&nbsp;</em>outfit <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/piranha-bytes-shut-down-report" rel="nofollow">Piranha Bytes</a>, have been outright shut down.</p>

<p>Many game projects are being canceled as well; in recent months, we've seen the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-spinoff-project-t-canceled" rel="nofollow"><em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>spinoff Project T</a>, online action RPG&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/blue-protocol-canceled-west-japan-service-ending" rel="nofollow"><em>Blue Protocol</em></a>, and an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/electronic-arts-to-lay-off-5-of-its-workforce-amid-refocus-on-owned-ip-and-sports-games" rel="nofollow">unannounced&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>FPS</a> canceled (at least in the West, in <em>Blue Protocol</em>'s case), among others.</p>

We'll just have to wait and see, I suppose.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rift-of-necrodancer-pc-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rift-of-the-necrodancer-pc-release-date-revealed-alongside-delay.1045482/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rift-of-necrodancer-pc-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Klei and developers Brace Yourself and Tic Toc have announced the&nbsp;<em>Rift of the NecroDancer&nbsp;</em>release date, although it's probably a little later than you might have expected or hoped for.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2073250/view/4489618994289967161" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post on Steam</a>,&nbsp;<em>Rift of the NecroDancer&nbsp;</em>will launch on PC on February 5th, but Brace Yourself says it's "decoupling" the Steam launch from the game's console release, which will now happen "at a later date" that's yet to be determined.</p>

<p>According to Brace Yourself, the delay is down to the team not wanting to cut any of&nbsp;<em>Rift of the NecroDancer</em>'s features to make a 2024 release, and the console delay is so that the team has "a little more time" to polish the game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rift-of-the-necrodancer-release-date-gameplay.jpg?itok=9jLY_Dyq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rift-of-the-necrodancer-release-date-gameplay.jpg?itok=QCN9ve0E 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Rift of the NecroDancer&nbsp;</em>will now be launching in 2025.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as announcing the new release date (and, by extension, the delay), Brace Yourself also reveals what it's been working on in the last year or so, with many of the features mentioned seemingly contributing to the game's delay.</p>

<p>These features include an extra "Impossible" difficulty level, as well as more Rhythm Rift beat maps, additional readability for monsters that land off the beat, and tools to implement custom music.</p>

<p>You'll also be able to enjoy a Remix Mode that "throws a fresh chart your way every playthrough", as well as better tutorials and practice mode gameplay, more animation clarity, and a revamp of the story mode. In short,&nbsp;<em>Rift of the NecroDancer</em>'s devs are using the extra time wisely, it seems.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Rift of the NecroDancer</em>, it's a&nbsp;rhythm spinoff of Brace Yourself's roguelike&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/crypt-of-necrodancer" rel="nofollow"><em>Crypt of the NecroDancer</em></a>. Though the game will feature many of the same characters as&nbsp;<em>Crypt</em>, it has its own gameplay style that's more indebted to games like Harmonix's&nbsp;<em>Frequency&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Amplitude</em>.</p>

<p>The game is set to launch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2073250/Rift_of_the_NecroDancer/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> on February 5th, with a console release to follow sometime after.</p>
