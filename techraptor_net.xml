<p>In a <a href="https://campfirecabal.com/still-alive/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> rather appropriately titled "Still Alive" on the official Campfire Cabal website, the studio says that it "never stopped" working on the newest entry in the series, but that it did go through some hardships as a result of the turmoil currently facing the gaming industry.</p>

<p>Campfire Cabal says that although it was never shut down, it did have to "say goodbye to many of [its] colleagues", leaving a "compact team" behind to work on the new&nbsp;<em>Expeditions&nbsp;</em>game, which began production back in 2022.</p>

<p>According to Campfire Cabal, the next&nbsp;<em>Expeditions&nbsp;</em>game will be set in a "new period of our history" and "a new part of the world for the series", and it will represent "another step up in quality" from&nbsp;<em>Expeditions: Rome</em>.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with Campfire Cabal, the studio was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/campfire-cabal-is-new-development-studio-from-expeditions-rome-developers" rel="nofollow">founded all the way back in 2022</a> to steward the&nbsp;<em>Expeditions&nbsp;</em>series of historical RPGs, following the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/expeditions-rome-developer-logic-artists-closing-down-to-make-nft-games" rel="nofollow">disbandment of original developer Logic Artists</a> to pursue NFT game development alongside new parent Dynasty Studios.</p>

<p>As it stands, there are three games in the&nbsp;<em>Expeditions&nbsp;</em>series: 2013's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/expeditions-conquistador" rel="nofollow"><em>Expeditions: Conquistador</em></a>, which kicked off the franchise, and its two followups&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/expeditions-viking" rel="nofollow">Expeditions: Viking</a>&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/expeditions-rome" rel="nofollow"><i>Expeditions: Rome</i></a>.</p>




<p>If you're wondering where 2024's&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/expeditions-mudrunner-game-announced" rel="nofollow">Expeditions: A MudRunner Game</a>&nbsp;</em>fits into things, well, it doesn't. It's a completely unrelated title, so don't worry about fitting that one into your schedule if you're looking to complete the series.</p>

<p>In any case, it looks like the&nbsp;<em>Expeditions&nbsp;</em>series will continue its explorations, although we don't know where or when. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/clash-of-clans-tv-show-in-the-works-for-some-reason.1193979/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clash-of-clans-tv-show<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Netflix has announced that a&nbsp;<em>Clash of Clans</em> TV&nbsp;show is in the works, so now you have to reckon with that being a thing in the real world as much as I do. Sorry about that.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/netflix/status/1924804801616871741" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Netflix says that the "world" of&nbsp;<em>Clash of Clans&nbsp;</em>is "coming to life as an animated series on Netflix", although the streaming giant doesn't provide any kind of time frame for the series' arrival, nor does it specify what the story will be about.</p>

<p>However, if the mobile game is anything to go by, the series will probably revolve around chiefs trying to defend their village against attacks from other clans. I'd assume there will be a hefty dollop of self-referentiality and pop-culture gags, too, for such is the way these things often go.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/clash-of-clans-netflix-series-characters.jpg?itok=acCTnHEP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/clash-of-clans-netflix-series-characters.jpg?itok=Uq5lMiI4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Clash of Clans&nbsp;</em>is getting a streaming series courtesy of Netflix.</figcaption></figure><p>In the (admittedly rather amusing) trailer announcing the&nbsp;<em>Clash of Clans&nbsp;</em>series on Netflix, Supercell staffers describe how there's at least one comment asking for a&nbsp;<em>Clash of Clans&nbsp;</em>show under every video made about the game by the studio "since 2012".</p>

<p>The video's description merely promises that the&nbsp;<em>Clash of Clans&nbsp;</em>show will star "your favorite moustachioed Barbarian and his high-pitched, hog-riding friends", so I guess if you were worried the show wouldn't be true to the game, you can put those worries to rest.</p>

<p>It sounds like we're going to have to wait quite a while for more information about the&nbsp;<em>Clash of Clans&nbsp;</em>series, so for now, you can content yourself with Supercell's announcement trailer. Even I, swinging brick of a heart and all, can admit it's quite funny.</p>




<p><em>Clash of Clans&nbsp;</em>will follow in the footsteps of other video games to get animated Netflix adaptations, including the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-devil-may-cry-renewed-second-season" rel="nofollow"><em>Devil May Cry</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Castlevania</em>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-edgerunners-is-anime-set-in-cyberpunk-universe" rel="nofollow"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></a>, among others.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what kind of direction Netflix is going in with the show, as well as when we can expect it to launch. Stay tuned for more.</p>
