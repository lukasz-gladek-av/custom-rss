            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A brand new retro SNES gem is now available via Nintendo Switch Online in the form of&nbsp;<em>Mario Paint</em>, and if you happen to own a Switch 2, you're in luck.</p>

<p>As revealed <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1950001200637890859" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on social media</a>,&nbsp;<em>Mario Paint&nbsp;</em>is available now for standard Switch Online members (and those with the Expansion Pack addon, of course), and what's more, it <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1950001356699312467" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">fully supports</a> the Switch 2's Joy-Con 2 mouse control feature.</p>

<p>Nintendo says that if you're playing on the original Switch, you can sub in a standard USB mouse and use that instead of the Joy-Cons if you want. Presumably, you can also do that on the Switch 2, although I can't confirm whether that's the case.</p>

That includes composing music, coloring in existing images, and, naturally, drawing pictures of your own.</p>

<p>Thanks to Switch Online, though, there are a few extra features you can take advantage of now. You can save up to four compositions and drawings thanks to the suspend feature, and, of course, you can now play it in handheld mode as well.</p>

<p>In addition to&nbsp;<em>Mario Paint&nbsp;</em>hitting the Switch Online library, some of its most iconic tracks are also now available as part of the Nintendo Music app, so if you like listening to the Gnat Attack theme while you work out, Nintendo's got you covered.</p>

<p>You can check out the trailer for&nbsp;<em>Mario Paint&nbsp;</em>on Nintendo Switch Online, which feels just a touch more irreverent than Nintendo's usual trailers, right here.</p>




<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Mario Paint&nbsp;</em>right now if you're a Switch Online member. Unlike the service's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/super-mario-strikers-switch-2" rel="nofollow">GameCube lineup</a>, as well as its N64 or Game Boy Advance titles, you won't need the Expansion Pack to enjoy this one.</p>
