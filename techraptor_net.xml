            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Rainbow Billy: The Curse of the Leviathan </em>was, I'd argue, one of those games with potential that fell a little flat, so the fact it's getting a followup in the form of <em>Rainbow Billy: The Book of Fears </em>is an exciting prospect for me.</p><p>Developer Manavoid Entertainment announced the game today, describing it as a "new story-driven investigative adventure" that takes place in a "colorful summer camp where something feels...off".</p><p>It sounds as though Manavoid may have ditched <em>Rainbow Billy</em>'s shape-based combat system; in a press release, the developer says you'll "explore the camp, follow subtle clues, talk with campers, and slowly piece together what's happening", but there's no mention of any fisticuffs.</p><figure role="group">

<p>According to Manavoid, you can expect an investigative experience in which "clever puzzles" will "guide the story forward and reward curiosity", so hopefully, this won't be your typical "press A on the thing to win" adventure game.</p><p>The story revolves around the appearance of "curious creatures known as Fearlings" that were "never supposed to exist". They're a manifestation of the worries of the campers at an otherwise-cheerful summer camp, and it'll be your job to deal with them.</p><p>Manavoid says the Fearlings will be central to your journey, and that each "has a reason for being there", making learning the proper way to deal with them "essential" for achieving success in <em>Rainbow Billy: The Book of Fears</em>.</p><p>Since Manavoid is still all about inclusivity and emotional intelligence, however, <em>The Book of Fears </em>will remain "warm and inviting" throughout its runtime from a tonal perspective, offering a "thoughtful and quietly meaningful experience".</p>
<p><em>Rainbow Billy: The Book of Fears </em>is set to arrive on PC via Steam sometime this year.
