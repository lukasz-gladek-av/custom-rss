            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Not long after the original&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em> trilogy wrapped, fans got the first officially licensed video game with 1982's&nbsp;<em>The Empire Strikes Back&nbsp;</em>on the Atari 2600. Ever since then, the IP has spawned dozens of video games across multiple generations, with more announcements coming every year.</p><p>LucasArts gave us some phenomenal games for decades, and though they rebranded to Lucasfilm Games in 2021, there are many much-anticipated titles on the horizon that fans can look forward to.</p><p>With the rest of 2026 ahead of us, I wanted to take a moment to pause and look at the current state of&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em>, tallying the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em> games that have been teased or announced. Though some of these games have a release window, there are a few projects that we might not see until next decade.&nbsp;</p><p>Check out which ones are around the corner and which <em>Star Wars</em> release dates we'll have to wait a bit longer for.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2><em>Star Wars Galactic Racer&nbsp;</em></h2><p>Announced at&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-game-awards-2025-recap" rel="nofollow">The Game Awards 2025</a>&nbsp;and likely the next&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em> game we'll actually be able to play later this year,&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Galactic Racer</em> from Fuse Games will put you behind the controls of a high-speed racer. The&nbsp;<em>Galactic Racer</em> teaser trailer showcases speeder bikes and other racers rocketing across Jakku, but one thing is noticeably missing: pod racers. Distancing itself from 1999's&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Episode 1: Racer&nbsp;</em>will help make this experience feel like a fresh take on the genre in the&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em> universe.&nbsp;</p><p>Still, I hold out hope that we'll get some level of pod racing introduced before the&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Galactic Racer</em> release date hits later in 2026.&nbsp;</p><picture>

  </picture><h2><em>Star Wars Eclipse&nbsp;</em></h2><p>A creative collaboration between Quantic Dream and Lucasfilm Games sets&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Eclipse</em> in the High Republic era, centuries before the Skywalker Saga. Branding itself as a "new action-adventure, multiple-character branching narrative game,"&nbsp;Eclipse offers the ability to freely explore the&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em> galaxy and play as multiple characters with different arcs, abilities, and morality systems.</p><p><em>Star Wars Eclipse</em> has the potential to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cJpiOPKH14" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">offer a little bit of everything</a>&nbsp;to any&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em> fan, but it's likely not a game that we'll see this year. Even though it was revealed at <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-announcement-from-game-awards-2021" rel="nofollow">The Game Awards in 2021</a>, the trailer footage was still early development, making the&nbsp;<em>Eclipse </em>release date a bit uncertain.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>The Next&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: Jedi</em> Game</h2><p>Though not officially confirmed by Lucasfilm games, Cal Kestis voice and mocap actor Cameron Monaghan announced in a 2023 panel at Ocala Comic Con that work was underway on the third game.&nbsp;</p><p>As reported by&nbsp;<a href="https://thedirect.com/article/star-wars-jedi-3-cameron-monaghan" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Direct</a>, Monaghan said, "We're working on the third [game] and we're in the process of doing it right now… So, that's a big undertaking and there's been some conversations so far. But hopefully, when all things are said and done, we'll be able to go in and make something really cool for you guys again."&nbsp;</p><p>We loved&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/star-wars-jedi-survivor-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</em></a>, scoring it a 9 in our TechRaptor review, and eagerly await the next and likely final installment in the Cal Kestis trilogy. Given the five-year gap between the first two games, the next&nbsp;<em>Jedi&nbsp;</em>game could come sometime in 2028.&nbsp;</p><picture>

  </picture><h2><em>Star Wars: Zero Company</em></h2><p>Star Wars Celebration 2025 in Japan came with a flurry of announcements, including&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-zero-company-respawn-bit-reactor" rel="nofollow"><em>Star Wars: Zero Company</em></a> from Respawn and Bit Reactor. Set during the Clone Wars,&nbsp;<em>Zero Company</em> is a single-layer turn-based tactics game that puts you in control of a squad of heroes from across the galaxy.</p><p>Starring a former Republic officer named Hawks,&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: Zero Company</em> will introduce a whole new cast of characters and allow player choices to shape the outcome of your experience. Expected later in 2026, the&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: Zero Company</em> release date is one of the few that should arrive this year, barring any delays.</p><h2>An Amy Hennig&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em> Project</h2><p>Back in 2022, Skydance New Media announced a collaboration with Lucasfilm Games to develop an original, narrative-driven action-adventure game within the&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em> universe led by Amy Hennig. The studio is currently hard at work on&nbsp;<em>Marvel 1943: The Rise of Hydra</em>, which, as of a couple months ago, got <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-delayed-indefinitely" rel="nofollow">delayed indefinitely to "beyond 2026."</a> Given the scope of these two very large projects, it's not surprising that we likely won't see this <em>Star Wars </em>release date for quite some time, but the wait should be worth it.</p><p>Hennig has earned her own accolades in the industry, with credits that include&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-1-2-remastered-review-cult-of-personality" rel="nofollow"><em>Legacy of Kain</em>&nbsp;</a>when she worked with Crystal Dynamics and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/20-years-jak-and-daxter" rel="nofollow"><em>Jak and Daxter</em></a> while at Naughty Dog. She also created the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/series/uncharted" rel="nofollow"><em>Uncharted</em></a><em> </em>series and has been working in the industry for nearly 40 years, making her a perfect choice for a&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em> narrative adventure.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2><em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake</em></h2><p>One of the most beloved&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em> games of all time is getting a remake, we're just not sure exactly when.&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/star-wars-knight-of-old-republic-remake-kotor-remake" rel="nofollow"><em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake</em></a> was originally announced during a PlayStation Showcase in 2021, and there haven't been many updates in the years since. However, a recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/kotor-ii-restored-content-mod-dlc-switch-killed-disney" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Game File report</a>&nbsp;on a lawsuit discovered references to both&nbsp;<em>KOTOR 1 &amp; 2 </em>remakes, providing hope that the projects aren't dead quite yet.</p><p>Fans can hold out hope that development is still well underway, especially with one of the most recent announcements to come out of The Game Awards 2025, which brings me to….</p><picture>

Developed by Arcanaut Studios–founded by&nbsp;<em>Knights of the Old Republic</em> and the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/mass-effect-legendary-edition" rel="nofollow"><em>Mass Effect</em> Trilogy</a> director Casey Hudson–<em>FOTOR </em>has ambitions of putting players on a single-player RPG adventure worthy of its predecessors.</p><p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-trailer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">an interview with StarWars.com</a>, Hudson said, "<em>Fate of the Old Republic</em>&nbsp;represents an opportunity to explore a contemporary vision of a definitive&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em> experience, using state-of-the-art technology and game design, and an all-new story crafted specifically to deliver on the combination of player agency and immersion in&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em> that was at the heart of&nbsp;<em>KOTOR</em>."</p><p>No&nbsp;<em>Fate of the Old Republic</em> release date is in sight yet, but it's a project fans will want to keep a close eye on as a likely next-gen release.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>Though hard <em>Star Wars</em> release dates are few and far between when it comes to&nbsp;these projects, there's plenty in development from different creative minds. This should offer a bevy of unique experiences when these games become a playable reality.</p><p>In the meantime, the next big&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em> project outside of gaming to be excited for is&nbsp;<em>Maul: Shadow Lord</em>&nbsp;that releases this April. After that, hopefully we can get our hands on at least a couple of these titles before 2026 is out.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
