            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>A Game About Digging a Hole</em>, which is a game about, er, navigating a tricky post-colonial climate, is making its way to consoles next month, developer DoubleBee and publisher rokaplay have announced.</p>

<p>The game, which has been available on PC since February, will be launching on current-gen machines (and Nintendo Switch, although not the Switch 2, apparently) on December 9th.</p>

<p>If you're wondering why <i>A Game About Digging a Hole&nbsp;</i>is getting a console release, it's probably because the indie hit managed to rack up 250,000 sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/a-game-about-digging-a-hole-sales-250k" rel="nofollow">inside its first week</a>, so it stands to reason DoubleBee and rokaplay would want to expand its audience.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/a-game-about-digging-a-hole-console-pit.jpg?itok=-60Hu0ZV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/a-game-about-digging-a-hole-console-pit.jpg?itok=ogsfsPov 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>A Game About Digging a Hole&nbsp;</em>is coming to consoles soon.</figcaption></figure><p>Since then, rokaplay says&nbsp;<em>A Game About Digging a Hole</em>'s audience has expanded to encapsulate more than 1.2 million players, describing it as an "unassuming indie title" that will be stepping "onto the biggest stages in gaming" next month.</p>

<p>If you're wondering what&nbsp;<em>A Game About Digging a Hole&nbsp;</em>is, well, it's a game about digging a hole, funnily enough. You have a spade, and you must dig a hole in your back garden, beneath which you'll find all manner of secrets and other things buried.</p>

<p>Over the course of your time digging your hole, you'll be able to upgrade your equipment and sell the resources you gather. As rokaplay and DoubleBee say, "there's no rush, no pressure, just the pure joy of discovery as you dig deeper and deeper".</p>

<p>That'll be reflected in&nbsp;<em>A Game About Digging a Hole</em>'s price point; the game retails for just $5 on PC, which, as the two studios point out, is "less than a takeaway coffee". Hopefully, the console price point will reflect that as well.</p>
