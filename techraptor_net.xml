            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p dir="ltr">Where tough deckbuilding roguelite action and Shakespearean prose meet, you'll find <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/killing-stone-is-17th-century-occult-adventure-with-deckbuilding-at-its-core" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="0a9de301-2954-4425-82de-6eb858fd831f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>The Killing Stone</em>, Question Games' new title</a>, where you are fighting against the devil to free the family of your newly deceased mentor from a sin-filled contract that she signed them up for.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>The Killing Stone</em> opens with the news of your master, Mariken's, death. Following their traditions, the rest of her family isolates to mourn the loss, but very quickly learns that they're all where One Eye, a faustian devil, wants them to be as he plans to collect on the souls owed to him.</p><p dir="ltr">As Maven, a master of the dark arts, you're able to read the contracts laid out by One Eye, and by participating in card-based battles, you can alter the contracts to benefit the different family members whose lives have unknowingly been put on the line.</p><picture>

  </picture><p dir="ltr">The way that the story relates to the gameplay is that each member of the cursed family that you assist will start you with a deck, including some cursed cards. Over the course of a number of runs, you'll not only work to defeat One Eye and his lieutenants through playing the game, but upgrade your deck and even seek to remove the cursed cards to get the 'best' ending.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Play Your Cards In A One-Dimensional Deckbuilding Roguelite Game</h2><p dir="ltr">In <em>The Killing Stone</em>, the core gameplay is centered around a card battling system where you spend energy to summon creatures, try to take out your opponents health while preserving your own, and work your way through the different nodes of the contracts that can offer a variety of good or bad effects.</p><p dir="ltr">Beginning with the card game itself, each round you'll gain three energy to spend on your cards. These can be units that will deal damage or have other effects, or spells that can affect you or your opponent. You can only ever have three units on the main battle line, but there are spaces to fill in 'reserve' units, which sit above the main units on the board and take over their place if the main unit falls.</p><picture>

  </picture><p dir="ltr">There are a large number of abilities in play that will control how a unit might gain or lose attacking might or health, how they might be powered up depending on where they're played, or even how they might be able to be deployed behind enemy lines.</p><p dir="ltr">There are some excellent quality of life additions that you'll see when contemplating activating your spells or placing your units. You can always see when combat is activated which units will remain alive, which will take damage, and how much damage you might deal directly to your opponent. This is incredibly helpful when you've got to factor in up to six units a side, spells, reserves, and all kinds of other abilities.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Each Layer Of <em>The Killing Stone</em> Adds Additional Challenge</h2><p dir="ltr">Your deck and build will constantly be changing as you progress through the framework of each Ritual's contract.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-killing-stone-preview-contract.jpg?itok=SfQLitjq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p dir="ltr">When you start each family member will have Curse cards, these are often negative cards that will force you to do something like sacrifice one of your creatures before you can do anything else or they could just sit in your hand and be useless. You'll have chances to get rid of these curses, but the game also finds a way to put more of them in front of you.</p><p dir="ltr">Forge events are nodes where you can alter sets of cards in your hands. These can include lowering the summoning costs of cards, getting new cards, or even getting rid of Curse cards. These also come in a variety of levels offering better cards, though those are normally behind riskier battles.</p><p dir="ltr">Outside of the cards in your hand there are also Boons and Banes that can be picked up, permanent modifiers that will grow as you spend time with the deck. Some of these are temporary, while others will have the opportunity to become permanent further refining your build.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-killing-stone-preview-forge.jpg?itok=D4Cz_IyA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p dir="ltr">To cap it all off certain difficult battles even have additional rules that might just benefit your opponent, or could also force you both to act in certain ways. An early additional rule I ran into was that every turn I received a card that would let me draw two more cards at no cost, but I needed to sacrifice one unit every turn before I could play any other cards.</p><p dir="ltr">The style and speed of gameplay immediately shifted as I was drawing cards and playing with so many more opportunities, but it was also being forced to kill off powerful units just as quickly.</p><h2 dir="ltr">A Roguelite With A Heavy Emphasis On Story</h2><p dir="ltr">Each member of the family has their own deck that you'll be building over the course of their chapter. You'll learn about the family members through optional dialogue with them and the rest of the family, and even talk with the spirit of Mariken herself.</p><p dir="ltr">The game ties into the greater story by the state of each family member's deck coming back in the final act of the game, as a deck you return to, but also one that will decide the character's fate.</p><picture>

  </picture><p dir="ltr">After completing the story of a family member, you'll be able to save the deck and continue on to the next family member, but if you think you could do better or want to craft a deck completely free of any curses then you can replay that chapter and just enjoy the deckbuilding gameplay.</p><p dir="ltr">It's in this way that there's still runs and getting better as you'd expect from a Roguelite, but also a point where you're going to narratively save the character by improving on their deck enough.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><em>The Killing Stone's</em> Dialogue Is Too Rich</h2><p dir="ltr">A key aspect of <em>The Killing Stone</em> is the dedication to the storytelling, and the way the story is told to the player. The game has a Modern English setting, that is something akin to enjoying modern media set in the past, and then there's a Period English that is much closer to classic Shakespearean.</p><p dir="ltr">Listening to Liam O'Brien's One Eye and Emma Gregory's Mariken being performed in the Period English has been so entertaining. Luckily, you can also set the spoken dialogue to one, while the written is set to the other. I most enjoyed it when I could hear the period english performances, while also making sure I missed nothing in the text.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-killing-stone-preview-period-english.jpg?itok=BlMYK5Nq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-killing-stone-preview-period-english.jpg?itok=nwGC3ST2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p>I know I could have made it by with just reading the Period English, but I likely would have wanted to be there with a highlighter and margin space to ponder and interpret.</p><p dir="ltr">While these two performances are spectacular, and they absolutely hold your attention while being performed, it is a bit disappointing that the other characters that you interact with aren't voiced at all. In scenes where your character, another member of the family, and One Eye are each taking turns to speak it's only even 1/3rd of the conversation that you're hearing instead of just reading.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Early Access Doesn't Skimp On The Content</h2><p dir="ltr"><em>The Killing Stone</em> is releasing in Early Access, but it was only a few weeks ago that today was intended to be the full date of release. A side-effect of this is that in its current state, you get to play, and replay, the main three story arcs for the different family members, have access to all of the optional missions, and the vast majority of the cards.</p><p dir="ltr">The only thing narratively that isn't available at present is the final arc, The Reckoning, that is going to be added later. While it's a shame a 1.0 release wasn't able to happen, this does give players plenty of chances to replay the story arcs and craft decks free of curses.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-killing-stone-preview-curse.jpg?itok=fCSKAA87 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p dir="ltr">Unlike a lot of Early Access titles that seem to launch in a 50% state and work their way up to 100%, my experience with <em>The Killing Stone</em> has felt more like 85% of the game, leaving me to anticipate the final 15%.</p><h2 dir="ltr">I'm Ready For More <em>Killing Stone</em></h2><p dir="ltr"><em>The Killing Stone</em> is a really enjoyable and complex deckbuilding roguelite. I wasn't too sure how I would feel about the emphasis that narrative has on the story, but it's woven in so nicely with the gameplay that you want to progress not just because the game gets more enjoyably complex, but also because you want to hear more of the stunning performances in the game.</p><p dir="ltr">While I've finished a number of rituals and crafted some fine decks, I can definitely see this as a quick roguelite to continue to return to and build towards that Reckoning so that I'm ready for its release.</p><hr><p><em><strong>The Killing Stone </strong>was previewed on PC via Steam with a code provided by the publisher over the course of 12 hours - All images were taken by the previewer.</em></p></div><div><p><span><div>

This, the developer says, will enable it to add "a final layer of polish" to the game.</p><p>Sad Cat says it's "super close to the finish line" and that the game is "technically finished", but that feedback from the recently-released demo for <em>Replaced </em>showed the studio that "final tweaks" were needed in order to make the full game "shine".</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Replaced </em>has been delayed once again, unfortunately.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>According to Sad Cat, the delay to <em>Replaced </em>means the game will be "polished, stable, and true to the vision" the developer intends. At the very least, it's bound to give the studio a better chance of achieving that goal.</p><p>It's been a long road for <em>Replaced</em>. The game was originally revealed as part of Xbox's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-announcement-from-xbox-bethesda-e3-2021" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a8f02423-4316-4b53-9fae-e0c65906486c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">summer showcase back in 2021</a>, and between then and now, it was delayed a few times, with Sad Cat <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/replaced-spring-2026-release-window" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e1909a0a-08c9-41e1-bf76-76966ced7965" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">popping back up midway through last year</a> to confirm <em>Replaced</em> was still in development.</p><p>Following that, <em>Replaced </em>got itself a March release date <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/replaced-release-date" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="70952c19-bd65-4e2b-9920-8ad379b673c2" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">in December</a>, but evidently, the devs now feel they can't uphold that release date without seriously compromising on the game's quality.</p><p>Given that it's taken this long for <em>Replaced </em>to arrive, though, another month or so seems like it's not too big an ask. Here's hoping the new April date stays in place and doesn't get pushed back.</p>
<p>As for exactly what <em>Replaced </em>is, Sad Cat describes it as a "narrative-driven 2.5D platformer" that blends "cinematic exploration with fluid, free-flow action". It's set in a dystopian cyberpunk future and revolves around R.E.A.C.H., an "AI trapped in a human body".</p><p><em>Replaced </em>will launch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1663850/REPLACED/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/replaced/9nv3l234vgxd" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a> on April 14th.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Recently, <em>Highguard</em>'s official website went down, prompting speculation that the ill-fated first-person shooter could be about to fire its last bullet.

</figure>
<p><em>Highguard </em>may not be shutting down, but it's not much of a surprise that that's the conclusion many jumped to when its website went offline. To put it simply, the game has been having a rough time since it launched at the end of January.</p><p>Following a rather underwhelming reveal at the conclusion of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-game-awards-2025-recap" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7f71e644-2289-45c0-a1c9-dc56c3797e8a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">December's Game Awards</a>, <em>Highguard </em>was released on January 26th, and though its player count surged on release, feedback was mixed, with many pointing to poor performance and fundamental gameplay issues as major problems.</p><p>After its release, <em>Highguard</em>'s player count plummeted, and last week, developer Wildlight <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/highguard-developer-wildlight-reportedly-lays-off-most-staff" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="662d78d2-0c4f-4bac-903f-7998daba8b76" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">laid off a number of staffers</a>, leaving a core group of developers to continue to work on the game.</p><p><em>Highguard</em>'s launch has prompted many to compare the shooter to Sony's flop <em>Concord</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ed1fd329-b76e-4ff9-aeb1-683a1c840a0c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">shut down just weeks after its release</a> back in 2024.
