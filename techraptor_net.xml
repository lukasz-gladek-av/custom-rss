            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you haven't heard of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/lorns-lure-review-call-of-void" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Lorn's Lure</em></a><em>, </em>you're about to learn something today. One way to describe it is one of 2024's best indie games. Another is to say it's this amazing, somewhat niche, experimental, and ominously beautiful first-person <a href="https://techraptor.net/genre/platformer/games" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">platformer</a> that takes place within a mysterious megastructure. It even has a brand-new DLC with <em>Lorn's Lure: Parkour Map Pack</em>.</p><p>The main game is inspired by my favorite manga author, Tsutomi Nihei, who is a master of his craft. He puts his architecture background to incredible use and illustrates these haunting, gigantic structures filled with unfathomable secrets.&nbsp;</p><p>While <em>Lorn's Lure</em> already took some inspiration from Nihei, I was very intrigued to try out one particular map in this collection, called "Blame." It's the name of Nihei's most famous work, <em>Blame!</em>, so I knew this was going to be something special to me. Besides that, we have four other maps with a central "parkour" theme that are sure to keep your attention for a good few hours.</p><p>With five different maps offering five different experiences, I'm going to go against the grain and rate every level on its own merits with a handful of "mini-reviews" with their own number ratings, then we'll average those numbers up and see what we get for the whole package.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>The<em> Blame!</em> vibes are strong here.&nbsp;</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Blame is the closest we get to an additional <em>Lorn's Lure</em> chapter. It's roughly the same length as a story chapter and focuses on exploration rather than speed. Mechanically, players are given just a few upgrades, so you don't have a double-jump or grapple at your disposal. This one is purely about the vibes, and that's what made me fall in love with <em>Lorn's Lure</em> in the first place.</p><p>Elements from the <em>Blame! </em>manga are perhaps more overt here than any other chapter, with concrete, drab megastructures looming in the distance, leading into areas with unknown technology, pipes (Nihei loves to draw his intricate network of pipes, after all), and castle-like buttresses and towers.</p><figure role="group">

<p>This would make an excellent addition to the story of <em>Lorn's Lure</em> were it not a part of the <em>Lorn's Lure: Parkour Map Pack. </em>While it's not the most difficult or intense chapter, it does what <em>Lorn's Lure</em> does best, instilling a sense of awe at the sheer scale of the world compared to tiny ol' you.</p><p>Final Verdict: 9/10</p><figure role="group">

<h2><em>Lorn's Lure: Parkour Map Pack</em> - Fall</h2><p>Fall is a quick, intense experience in <em>Lorn's Lure: Parkour Map Pack</em>. You're descending a giant pit, all the way to the bottom. <em>Lorn's Lure</em> mechanics dictate that falling too fast will result in your death as soon as you hit the ground, so the name of the game here is to take a measured approach.</p><p>You're equipped with a grapple, so Fall becomes quite an exciting experience when you're able to utilize this tool. The physics for the grapple are fantastic, so you end up feeling like Spider-Man, trying his best not to fall too hard while also rushing to the finish to get a high score.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Make use of that grapple, or you're cooked.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This is one of the shortest maps in the pack, but there's a decent variety of obstacles given that it's a completely vertical map. It can also be a bit challenging, even for someone like me who likes to take things safe, slow, and steady.</p><p>Final Verdict: 7.5/10</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Sheesh, where to even begin when you only have a single checkpoint to start?</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2><em>Lorn's Lure: Parkour Map Pack</em> - ProcGenV1</h2><p>ProcGenV1 is a very experimental map in this collection, but definitely one of the highlights of <em>Parkour Pack</em>'s offerings. As the name implies, it's a procedurally generated experience. There are, in essence, unlimited possibilities in ProcGenV1, as it creates a large environment of megastructures to explore.&nbsp;</p><p>The goal of this map is to find the "extraction hut," which finishes the level. The environment is filled with various other huts high and low, and most have an arrow pointing to the actual extraction hut. Huts have items that players can use at their disposal to aid in their adventure, adding a nice twist on the simplistic platforming of <em>Lorn's Lure</em>.</p><p>Items include a stamina boost, boots to increase your jumping abilities, a one-time use grapple (refillable if you find more), and a checkpoint USB. In the main game of <em>Lorn's Lure</em>, checkpoints are aplenty, but with them being so scarce in ProcGenV1, you're encouraged to be methodical and only take risks when it's absolutely necessary.</p><figure role="group">

  </picture>
<figcaption>The arrow is just vague enough to still be challenging, especially when a level is as big as this.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I'm just amazed by the complexity of environments created in ProcGenV1. They are a little drab in appearance, but as I understand it, Rubeki Games will update this with new features every once in a while. I see a great deal of potential in ProcGenV1 evolving into something amazing; for now, it could use more variation in appearance and perhaps more items.</p><p>There's also a really pesky mechanic where some items are poisoned, and that decreases your stamina by a large amount for several minutes. Because of the way these levels are generated, you usually never have enough stamina to go anywhere when it's so low, so I usually waited it out until the poison debuff was removed.&nbsp;</p><p>Final Verdict: 8.5/10</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>The closest I'll ever get to doing parkour in my life is through <em>Lorn's Lure</em>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2><em>Lorn's Lure: Parkour Map Pack</em> - Rubeki's Pro Traceur</h2><p>Rubeki's Pro Traceur is a beautiful parkour-based map that replaces <em>Lorn's Lure</em>'s megastructures with a small urban environment. Resembling that of a European city, this map touts itself as a "parkour sandbox."&nbsp;</p><p>The main objective of this map is to gather all the crystals. It seems to take inspiration from <em>Super Mario Sunshine</em> in particular, with its Delfino Plaza-esque visuals and vibes. Your objective is to gather all the crystals on this map, of which there are 25.&nbsp;</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>What a nice view!</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Buildings are close together to create narrow alleys to bounce around on. Crystals at the top of the building are quite difficult to reach, especially when you're stripped of your usual climbing tools. I ran into an issue where I was given the option to pick up climbing tools right from the start, but I don't think that was intentional since it largely strips the map of any sort of difficulty.&nbsp;</p><p>Even so, Rubeki's Pro Traceur is fine for what it is. It's short and doesn't try to be anything but a little sandbox to give players the ability to flex their platforming skills. It's far from the slower, exploration-based platforming that I prefer, but it's still worth one play.&nbsp;</p><p>Final Verdict: 7/10</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Gotta go fast, but also, I'm too scared to.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2><em>Lorn's Lure: Parkour Map Pack</em> - Sonic</h2><p>The idea behind Sonic is to create a high-speed obstacle course for players, with devastating consequences for failure. It's a somewhat linear track that hangs high above in a megastructure, so if you fall, you're going right back to the start. The twist here is that you're given super speed, so it's actually very challenging to deal with this newfound mobility.</p><p>You don't have any tools at your disposal other than this speed. Unfortunately, there was one obstacle near the start that, try as I might, I couldn't find how to overcome. I didn't get a real chance to experience this one, so I'll just admit defeat and say this level wasn't for me (especially since I prefer the slower, methodical gameplay as opposed to speed). While I won't give it a final score since I didn't complete it, I know this one isn't for me.</p><p>Final Verdict: N/A</p><figure role="group">

<h2><em>Lorn's Lure: Parkour Map Pack </em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2><p>While Blame and ProcGenV1 are the main appeal here, there's something for fans of speedier gameplay in Sonic, Rubeki's Pro Traceur, and Fall. All-in-all, it's a nice little package to give fans more <em>Lorn's Lure</em> content, but what I'm <em>especially</em> interested in is seeing how ProcGenV1 develops in the future.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em><strong>Lorn's Lure: Parkour Map Pack</strong> was reviewed on PC using a code provided by the developer over the course of 5 hours of gameplay - all screenshots were taken during the process of review.</em></p></div><div><p><span><div>
