            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Ratatan</em>, the rhythm-action game created by several ex-<em>Patapon&nbsp;</em>developers, will launch on PC via Steam Early Access next month, developer Ratata Arts has announced.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Ratatan&nbsp;</em>will arrive on September 19th, having been <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2949320/view/520843384949050989" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">delayed</a> from its originally-intended launch date of July 25th. That delay, Ratata Arts said at the time, was put into effect in order to implement various pieces of player feedback from the game's Steam Next Fest demo.</p>

<p>Now, the developer says&nbsp;<em>Ratatan&nbsp;</em>"has evolved substantially" since that demo was released, and it looks like the&nbsp;<em>Patapon&nbsp;</em>spiritual successor is finally ready to launch (in Early Access, of course).</p>

<p>That campaign was subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/patapon-spiritual-successor-ratatan-fully-funded-on-kickstarter-in-48-minutes" rel="nofollow">fully funded in under an hour</a>, allowing Ratata Arts to fulfil stretch goals like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/patapon-spiritual-successor-ratatan-recruits-more-sony-japan-studio-veterans-with-final" rel="nofollow">hiring more ex-Japan Studio staff</a>, adding <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/patapon-spiritual-successor-ratatan-reveals-super-catchy-music-clears-multiplayer" rel="nofollow">multiplayer modes</a>, and bringing&nbsp;<em>Ratatan&nbsp;</em>to consoles (although it won't launch on other systems at the same time as PC).</p>

<p>The game eventually closed its crowdfunding campaign at a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/patapon-spiritual-successor-ratatan-successfully-ends-kickstarter-campaign-at-15" rel="nofollow">whopping $1.5 million raised</a>, so it's clear there's an appetite for a&nbsp;<em>Patapon&nbsp;</em>spiritual successor. That's likely also why Ratata Arts has taken such care to improve the game since its initial demo.</p>

<p>As for what you can expect from&nbsp;<em>Ratatan</em>, the devs describe it as a "rhythm roguelike action game that combines rhythm games and side-scrolling action", complete with a "toe-tapping soundtrack". You can check out a trailer for&nbsp;<em>Ratatan&nbsp;</em>(albeit one with a now-incorrect release date) right here.</p>




<p><em>Ratatan&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2949320/Ratatan/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on September 19th. There's no word yet about when the game will be coming to consoles, but it might be a case of waiting until the 1.0 release. Stay tuned for more.</p>
