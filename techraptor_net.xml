            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/deadpool-secret-lair-brings-merc-with-mouth-to-magic-gathering<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has made a special April Fools' Day Secret Lair announcement for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a>. A certain red-suited, wisecracking <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-magic-gathering-marvel-crossover-details-revealed-including-new-secret-lair-and" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Marvel</a> character is coming to the popular card game. Not Spider-Man or The Avengers; it's a Deadpool Secret Lair.</p>

<h2>The Deadpool Secret Lair Announcement</h2>

<p>According to its <a href="https://secretlair.wizards.com/us/product/1151231/secret-lair-x-marvel-s-deadpool" rel="nofollow">store page</a> listing, the Deadpool Secret Lair will include five cards featuring the merc with a mouth. The description is written from the perspective of Deadpool, complete with crass self-awareness.</p>

These reprints feature Deadpool-themed artwork by Justine Cruz, Slawomir Maniak, Miguel Mercado, Kevin Sidharta and Tomasz Zarucki. The reprinted cards are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><em>Deadly Rollick</em></li>
	<li><em>Saw in Half</em></li>
	<li><em>Blasphemous Act</em></li>
	<li><em>Vandalblast</em></li>
</ul><p>Presentation-wise, the cards are a solid representation of Deadpool's anarchic sense of humor. <em>Blasphemous Act</em> shows him sitting on the moon, wielding the Infinity Gauntlet. <em>Deadly Rollick</em> portrays him riding on a unicorn with a rainbow in the background. Mechanically, <em>Saw in Half</em> is taken from the Unfinity set, which is, by design, silly and irreverent, which fits the character perfectly.</p>

<p>But the fifth and final card in the Deadpool Secret Lair is a mechanically unique legendary creature: Deadpool, Trading Card. It is, as the name suggests. Deadpool is a Black/Red creature with 5/3. On its own, not a bad card, until you read the text, "when Deadpool enters, you may exchange his text box and another creature's."</p>

<p>This is potent enough on its own. Deadpool can steal an enemy creature's abilities through their rules text. But that's not all that is in Deadpool's text. You also lose life at the start of each turn, which is a devious combination.</p>

<p>Lastly, the Deadpool Secret Lair drop will be coming to certain retail stores. Like all prior Secret Lairs, you can order both foil (MSRP $39.99) and non-foil (MSRP $29.99) bundles online. In addition, all WPN retail stores will have non-foil bundles available on April 25. This is the first time a Secret Lair drop has been available at retail.</p>
