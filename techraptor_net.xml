The tabletop developer is the first to articulate this major commerce issue facing the entire board game industry, one that can be financially devastating.</p>

<h2>The <em>Deep Regrets</em> Risk Update</h2>

<p>In a recent update on its <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tettix/deep-regrets-an-unfortunate-fishing-game/description">Kickstarter page</a>, the developer of <em>Deep Regrets</em>, Judson Cowan, informed backers on game developments. It started with rudimentary updates regarding updates to the pledge manager, issues with declined card payments, and that the manufacturing was officially underway.</p>

Cowan mentions the immediate impact of the recent US election, the victory of former president and convicted criminal Donald Trump. Specifically, the administration would impose trade tariffs on imported products. These tariffs were a highly advertised part of Trump's campaign, though it is a strategy <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/08/politics/tariffs-donald-trump-strategy/index.html">not fully formed</a>.</p>

<p>The impact of these tariffs would devastate the entire board game industry. <em>Deep Regrets</em> is no different. If the tariffs are imposed by the time the game reaches store shelves in February, the price of importing the game to the US could increase by 60%, roughly costing $100,000 more.</p>

<p>The reason for this is that the aim of these trade tariffs is on imported products from China. Roughly 90% of all board game manufacturing happens overseas in China. A potential side effect may mean board game companies will increase their prices to recoup these costs.</p>

However, Cowan remakes that the tariffs may potentially affect his ability to sell board games in the US, or even continue to make and sell board games period.</p>

<p>This will not be the last time such stories will occur in the tabletop industry. Amongst the many geopolitical, sociologically, and economic ramifications of a second Trump presidential terms, one of them maybe higher costs for board game experiences across the board. <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> cards, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer</em></a> miniatures, and potentially TTRPG books.</p>
