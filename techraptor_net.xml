            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Modding site Nexus Mods has announced it's going to be making some changes in the near future thanks to UK and EU laws, and those changes will include age verification for users in those areas, plus more.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15319" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a>, Nexus Mods content team lead SlugGirl says that the updates in question are part of Nexus Mods' "legal obligation to comply" with the UK's <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-safety-act-explainer/online-safety-act-explainer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Online Safety Act</a> and the EU's <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-services-act_en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Digital Services Act</a>, plus new guidance issued by UK regulator Ofcom.</p>

<p>This legislation means Nexus Mods must, in SlugGirl's words, "ensure [it continues] to remove illegal content and add additional restrictions to children's access to certain adult content".</p>

Nexus Mods says "the specifics of this are being carefully considered", as the site "want[s] to get this right" and ensure that adult content is still available for those of appropriate age. Those outside of these regions won't be subject to age verification.</p>

<p>Other upcoming changes include "a clearer, more detailed definition of what counts as illegal content" in Nexus Mods' terms and conditions, as well as new automated detection for child sexual abuse material (CSAM).</p>

<p>Adult content guidelines and categorization will also be overhauled, with new revised tags being introduced for mods that feature adult subjects like pornography, extreme violence, or suicide and self-harm.</p>

<p>Nexus Mods' block and mute systems will be rebuilt "to make them clearer and more effective", and the site's automated spam detection tools will be expanded to other site areas, including comments, which will now be "manually reviewed by staff/moderators", according to SlugGirl.</p>
