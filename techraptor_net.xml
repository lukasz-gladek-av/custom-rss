            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom president Haruhiro Tsujimoto has blamed something he calls the "PS5 barrier" for slowing&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>sales, suggesting that the console and its ancillary purchases are at least partly responsible for the game's underperformance in recent months.</p>

<p>In an interview with <a href="https://xtrend.nikkei.com/atcl/contents/18/01186/00001/?wovn=en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nikkei</a> (as spotted by ResetEra user <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/capcom-president-regarding-building-upon-wilds-initial-sales-we-found-that-the-ps5-barrier-is-unexpectedly-large-ps5-the-main-platform-for-mhw.1285902/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">DriftingSpirit</a>; we're using machine translation for the interview), Tsujimoto says that&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' "main platform" is the PS5, but that the "barrier" for this platform is "unexpectedly large".</p>

<p>He says that the console costs around 80,000 yen in Japan (which works out at around $540), but that when adding "software and monthly subscriptions", that cost can reach about 100,000 yen (roughly $670). This, Tsujimoto says, is "not an amount that can be easily reached, especially for younger generations".</p>

Relatedly, Sony <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-5-price-hike-us" rel="nofollow">increased prices for the PS5</a> in the US back in August, with all three major models of the console affected by the price hike.</p>

<p>Tsujimoto says that "sales will begin in the future", presumably pointing to discounts for&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>on the horizon. He also says the Switch 2's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-financials-q1-2026" rel="nofollow">successful launch</a> at around 50,000 yen proves the "high level of cost-consciousness among ordinary consumers".</p>

<p>It's telling that Tsujimoto doesn't make reference to any of the other factors that might be causing&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>sales to slow down.</p>

<p>Players have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-optimizations-winter" rel="nofollow">complained</a>, for instance, about the game's lackluster PC performance and lack of endgame content, prompting Capcom to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-endgame-august" rel="nofollow">move its plans for the latter forward</a> to an earlier patch in August and to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-optimizations-winter" rel="nofollow">promise more PC optimizations this winter</a>.</p>




<p>It's entirely possible that word-of-mouth regarding these problems has put some players off buying the game, so perhaps when Capcom addresses these issues, sales might pick up. Of course, discounts in major storefront sales won't hurt, either.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Former&nbsp;<em>Everwild&nbsp;</em>producer Louise O'Connor has been recruited by Xbox to serve as its new chief of staff, following the cancellation of that game earlier this year.</p>

<p>Back in early July, Rare's <i>Everwild&nbsp;</i><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">was canceled</a> and various staff members at the studio were let go as part of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" rel="nofollow">wider layoff wave</a> at parent company Microsoft. However, it looks as though O'Connor is one of the Rare staffers who's managed to escape unemployment.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/rare-veteran-lands-new-role-at-xbox-game-studios-after-everwild-cancellation/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">VGC</a>, O'Connor, who previously served as an artist and animator at Rare before overseeing <i>Everwild&nbsp;</i>as an executive producer, will now occupy the position of Xbox's chief of staff, which means she'll be overseeing the gaming division's various teams and employees.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rare-everwild-louise-oconnor-xbox.jpg?itok=BVMkROeo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rare-everwild-louise-oconnor-xbox.jpg?itok=VBb227fk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Everwild&nbsp;</em>producer Louise O'Connor has found a new home at Xbox.</figcaption></figure><p>O'Connor's career with Rare started with 2001's foul-mouthed platformer&nbsp;<em>Conker's Bad Fur Day</em>, and after that game was released, she went on to work on titles like Xbox 360 launch title&nbsp;<em>Kameo: Elements of Power</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;2006 life sim&nbsp;<em>Viva Pinata</em>.</p>

<p>Her last credit with Rare is a special thanks nod on 2020's side-scrolling beat-'em-up&nbsp;<em>Battletoads</em>, with which our reviewer Austin was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/battletoads-review" rel="nofollow">particularly impressed</a>&nbsp;(the game, that is, not the credit).</p>

<p>O'Connor also isn't the only Rare luminary to jump ship to Xbox in the last twelve months. She follows in the footsteps of former Rare boss Craig Duncan, who <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-studios-head-retiring" rel="nofollow">took the place of Xbox's Alan Hartman</a> as the head of Xbox Game Studios back in October last year.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, many Rare staffers weren't as lucky as O'Connor or Duncan, with several employees losing their jobs as part of the aforementioned Microsoft employee cull, including long-time Rare veteran <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sources-banjo-kazooie-sea-of-thieves-director-leaves-rare-after-35-years-following-everwild-cancellation/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gregg Mayles</a> (again, according to VGC).</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what Rare will announce next (if anything; it may end up going the same way as&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow"><em>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</em>studio The Initiative</a>). Stay tuned for more.</p>
