            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Faire Trade</em> is the follow-up title from Sassybot, the makers of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="69d4ab5d-9545-4eb0-85d7-fe27cf8ca257" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/winkeltje-little-shop-is-seriously-fun-business-that-doesnt-break-bank" rel="nofollow"><em>Winkeltje: The Little Shop</em></a>. Another shop manager, the game allows players to grow a farm as well as run a store. Explore all the title offers in our <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="0d3949c9-b320-4885-b2ff-c5b74e30b0c4" href="https://techraptor.net/games/faire-trade" rel="nofollow"><em>Faire Trade</em></a> preview.</p>

<h2>Early Access Jank</h2>

<p>To start, there are two modes you can select at the start of Early Access in <em>Faire Trade</em>: Sandbox and Creative. There’s no story, though the general premise is you need to keep your shop in the black. There is a narrative that will accompany the fully released game, but it’s not included right at the start.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/faire-trade-gameplay.jpg?itok=n7MBfgOg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/faire-trade-gameplay.jpg?itok=_KFhSQmc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>That doesn’t detract too much from the general gameplay loop, however. You have tasks to earn money, expand the shop, decorate rooms in certain ways, and hone your crafting skills. There are multiple things to level up, like your shop, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="0f8f1b21-d841-43e3-8780-626fe2c7df99" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/faire-trade-crafting-guide-how-to-make-items" rel="nofollow">crafting</a>, and farming skills, and shop appeal.</p>

<p>On top of the basic mechanics of making and selling things, you have a home you can build up, as well as a farm to expand. As your shop grows, you can hire <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1d6b5181-3bca-428a-b5cc-ffaa01a33bea" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/faire-trade-employees" rel="nofollow">employees</a> to help you with certain tasks, like restocking shelves or drawing in customers. This frees you up to handle other things in the store, like trading with merchants that drop in or crafting more items.</p>

<p>Six crafting skills are at the heart of your supply. The expected Blacksmithing is there, as well as Farming, but you also have Music, Pottery, and Swindling. Swindling may sound suspect, and it is. You can create fun things like Blessed Water or a Rain Charm. They may not work, but your customers don’t care. It adds a unique twist to the typical crafting skills found in different shop management games.&nbsp;</p>

These <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a5c5853d-da7f-4eb2-aa2c-c38feab20c09" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/faire-trade-room-recipes-guide" rel="nofollow">room recipes</a> need to be discovered, really opening the doors to experimentation in <em>Faire Trade</em>. They can grant additional storage, lessen resources needed for crafting, or increase the price of certain goods.</p>

<h2>So Much Potential</h2>

<p>There are quite a few mechanics that are not working properly in the <em>Faire Trade</em> EA version. Some events and tasks aren't tracked, product levels don't carry over from play session to play session, and decoration pieces may not have properly attributed tags. However, these are things that need small tweaks to fix that will greatly impact the uniqueness of the game and bolster the gameplay cycle.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/faire-trade-events.jpg?itok=J8xMW2j5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/faire-trade-events.jpg?itok=Ajz8pwgf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Different seasonal or weekly events, which impact their related quests, can dictate what you grow, craft, or buy. Though the money changes are working as intended, the actual tasks aren’t updated. This can make it difficult to keep track of the boons the events give. It also blocks other seasonal events and tasks from populating your tracker.</p>

<p>Along with the in-progress mechanics, there are a few prominent bugs that pop up in <em>Faire Trade</em>. One that occurred multiple times was when the employee's pay, and then everything bought and sold after, would stack on the right side of the screen. This wouldn’t be such a bad thing, but the total cash you have doesn’t change when this happens. You only see how much you actually have when you are looking to purchase something from a trader or at the sales counter, or when you have the profit task being tracked. Another bug is that some item descriptions will remain onscreen forever and never go away. You’ll need to exit to the main menu to have it disappear. This was far less prevalent of an issue, though.</p>

<p><em>Faire Trade</em> is a unique shop manager that builds on <em>Winkeltje: The Little Shop</em>. As long as you can handle some mechanics not working properly during EA, you’ll be able to experience different crafting skills, building seasonal rooms, and unlocking room recipes. I’m excited to see where the title goes as development continues.</p>
