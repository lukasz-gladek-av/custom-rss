            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/geforce-now-monthly-playtime-limit-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nvidia has announced that streaming service GeForce Now will begin imposing monthly playtime limits on new subscribers to two of its three currently available tiers, starting from next year.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GeForceNOW/comments/1glr3yc/gfn_thursday_updates_november_7_2024/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Reddit update</a>, Nvidia says it's renaming its Priority subscription tier to Performance, and that new subscribers to both the Performance and Ultimate tiers will be limited to 100 hours per month of playtime beginning "at the start of next year".</p>

<p>If you're an existing Performance or Ultimate member on or before December 31st this year, then you won't start seeing the monthly limits kick in until January 2026, which Nvidia says is a gift "to thank the GeForce Now community for joining the cloud gaming revolution".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/geforce-now-monthly-limits-tiers.jpg?itok=SXoZq7YD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/geforce-now-monthly-limits-tiers.jpg?itok=ZYJCMz87 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>GeForce Now is changing in some pretty big ways next year.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Nvidia, the new limit "comfortably accommodates 94% of members, who typically enjoy the service well within this timeframe", although the company doesn't provide any further info about exactly how long people mostly use the service for each month.</p>

<p>You'll be able to buy extra hours if you run over the limit, too; $2.99 will get you 15 more hours on the Performance tier, while you'll have to pay $5.99 for the same privilege if you're on the Ultimate tier, although naturally, the quality of your streaming is better on this tier.</p>

<p>In addition, up to 15 hours of unused playtime will roll over each month, so if you do find yourself going under the limit for one month, you'll be able to enjoy an equivalent amount of extra time the following month.</p>

<p>On the plus side, Performance members will be able to enjoy 1440p gaming instead of 1080p, and the tier is also getting access to ultrawide support, although 4K and 120fps remains reserved for Ultimate members.</p>

It's similar to services like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-cloud-gaming-beta-available-now-on-xbox-series-xs-and-xbox-one">Xbox Cloud Gaming</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazon-luna-announced-as-new-cloud-gaming-service-in-early-access">Amazon Luna</a>.</p>

<p>You can sign up for the service over on the official GeForce Now <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">website</a> if you're interested.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-xbox-release-kojima-ip</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/death-stranding-gets-surprise-xbox-release-kojima-snaps-up-ip.1029801/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-xbox-release-kojima-ip<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hideo Kojima's&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>has received a surprise Xbox release today, and the gaming legend has also announced that he and his studio Kojima Productions have acquired the&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>IP.</p>

<p>Per a press release, <i>Death Stranding&nbsp;</i>is now available on Xbox Series X|S (although not on Xbox One), as well as the Microsoft Store and, uh, Amazon Luna.</p>

<p>Kojima Productions says that this release is part of its strategy to "focus on bringing [its] award-winning IP&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>to more platforms and audiences", and as part of that mission, the studio also "now has full ownership" of&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>as an IP.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/death-stranding-xbox-kojima-dropkick.jpg?itok=jlin_5jD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/death-stranding-xbox-kojima-dropkick.jpg?itok=bIpoE2iv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>is now available on Xbox Series X|S, in all its weird glory.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that the version of <i>Death Stranding&nbsp;</i>that's&nbsp;available on Xbox Series X|S now is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-directors-cut-is-coming-soon-to-playstation-5">the Director's Cut</a>, which means it includes a new location, new delivery items to help you out with your treks, and extra combat moves, plus lots more.</p>

<p>That's in addition to the base&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>game, of course, which remains the same profoundly odd and yet strangely compelling "walking simulator" it was when it first <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-release-date-announced-along-with-new-trailer">launched on PS4 back in 2019</a>.</p>

<p>Right now, Kojima Productions is hard at work on a sequel to&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding</em>. The appropriately-named&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach&nbsp;</em>will <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-trailer-revealed-at-game-awards-2022">once again star Norman Reedus</a> as protagonist Sam Porter-Bridges, along with other returning stars like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideo-kojima-explains-additional-hands-on-fragiles-shoulders-in-death-stranding-2-on">Léa Seydoux</a> and Troy Baker.</p>

<p>Said sequel is currently set to launch next year for PS5, although now that Kojima has gained control of the <i>Death Stranding&nbsp;</i>IP, it may very well come to other platforms in due course as well.</p>




<p>Filming for <i>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</i>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-filming-and-recording-completed">completed back in May</a>, so it looks like progress on the game continues apace. Let's hope it doesn't get delayed.</p>

<p>While you wait for that, you can grab&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1850570/DEATH_STRANDING_DIRECTORS_CUT/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA11260_00-DEATHSTRAND00001" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and now <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/death-stranding/9nkchzztl308" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> as well. You can check out <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/death-stranding-review">our review of it here</a>, and I'd recommend doing so if you want a wild read.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-private-division-sale</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/take-two-sells-indie-label-private-division-to-undisclosed-buyer.1029750/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-private-division-sale<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Take-Two has sold off its indie label Private Division to an unknown buyer, citing a need to "focus [its] resources on growing [its] core and mobile businesses for the long-term".</p>

<p>In a set of <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/e938f73a-cfd7-46ac-b308-3f5b55acaeb7" rel="noopener" target="_blank">prepared remarks</a> accompanying Take-Two's latest financial results, company president Karl Slatoff says that the transaction involved the mystery buyer "purchas[ing Take-Two's] rights to substantially all of Private Division's live and unreleased titles".</p>

<p>It looks like Early Access action RPG&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/no-rest-for-the-wicked">No Rest for the Wicked</a></em>, which was released back in April,&nbsp;wasn't included in that transaction, though, because Slatoff says that Take-Two "will continue to support" the game. He concludes by thanking Private Division for its "contributions" to Take-Two.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/no-rest-for-the-wicked-take-two-private-division.jpg?itok=WqMTJJ-U 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/no-rest-for-the-wicked-take-two-private-division.jpg?itok=C1c891Eh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Private Division has been sold, but it looks like&nbsp;<em>No Rest for the Wicked&nbsp;</em>hasn't.</figcaption></figure><p>Private Division's fate has been uncertain for some time. When Take-Two <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-interactive-layoffs">laid off 5% of its workforce</a> back in April, a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-01/take-two-interactive-shuts-down-two-game-studios" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bloomberg report</a> noted that many of the workers who would lose their jobs as part of that layoff wave were Private Division employees.</p>

<p>Later, in May, evidence began to pile up that Take-Two had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/intercept-games-shut-down-kerbal-space-program-2">shuttered the developers</a> of&nbsp;<em>Kerbal Space Program 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Rollerdrome</em>, both of which were games published by Private Division. Take-Two itself, however, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-denies-roll7-intercept-closure">denied shutting down those studios</a>.</p>

<p>Towards the end of that same month,&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake developer Bloober Team revealed that its partnership with Private Division for an upcoming new horror IP <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloober-team-private-division-end-partnership">had ended</a>, with Take-Two being the entity that terminated said partnership.</p>

<p>That game may well be new horror project&nbsp;<em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em>, which will now be self-published by Bloober Team. It's circumstantial, of course, but this could be more evidence that Private Division was in the process of being sold even then.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/private-division-take-two-kerbal-space-program.jpg?itok=O8GpP_LW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/private-division-take-two-kerbal-space-program.jpg?itok=QA7WCtgc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You may also know Private Division's name from<em>&nbsp;Kerbal Space Program</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>News of Private Division's sale comes as part of Take-Two's Q2 financial report, in which the company announces that net bookings have risen by 6% overall compared to last year.</p>

<p>According to Take-Two, this financial performance was mainly driven by "strength in the&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Borderlands&nbsp;</em>franchises", and that's without the release of&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-released-early-following-leak-coming-in-2025">due to arrive next year</a>.</p>

<p>You can see the rest of Take-Two's <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/ff9f9b55-43a5-4af5-ab54-13a77102d4b9" rel="noopener" target="_blank">financial report right here</a> if you're interested in the nerdy stats side of things. We don't yet know to whom Private Division was sold, but it's possible we'll find out in the coming weeks. Stay tuned.</p>
