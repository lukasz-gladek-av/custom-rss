            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has listened to feedback regarding the Monster Hunter Secret Lair superdrop. The drop, which promised to bring characters from Capcom's action RPG to Magic: The Gathering, was underwhelming. So the company is delaying the release.</p>

<h2>The <em>Monster Hunter</em> Secret Lair Superdrop Delay Announcement</h2>

<p>In a straightforward <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/back-to-the-drawing-board-with-secret-lair-x-monster-hunter" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>, Wizards of the Coast announced that they will be going back to the drawing board on the <em>Monster Hunter</em> Secret Lair superdrop. In their assessment, the drop, which was announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-announces-magic-gathering-monster-hunter-secret-lair-superdrop" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">last week</a>, fell short of expectations. The studio stated that they can do better.</p>

With the publisher's consent, Capcom and Wizards of the Coast will delay the release to take another crack at this collaboration. More details will be released in 2026.</p>

<p>The fact that the <em>Monster Hunter</em> Secret Lair superdrop has been delayed is exceedingly rare for Wizards of the Coast. Most of the time, the studio is spot on with adapting various characters from different properties into their popular card game. That history includes bringing characters from <em>The Walking Dead</em> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/official-magic-gathering-sonic-hedgehog-secret-lair-is-gonna-go-fast" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Sonic The Hedgehog</em></a>, after all.</p>

<p>If you're a dedicated Monster Hunter fan, some of the creative choices made were head-scratching. Why does Brachydios, a monster known for punching and leaving large globs of explosive slime everywhere, have a card effect that clones instant spells? Why does Zinogre, an extremely fast, lightning-channeling beast, have an exile effect? Why does Nargacuga spawn cat tokens?</p>

<p>But probably the biggest oversight in the eyes of the fandom can be summed up in one word: equipment. In <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Monster Hunter</em></a>, your gear is key to your power and progression. It is the part of the core loop of the franchise. So why weren't there any artifact cards in the superdrop?</p>

<p>Hopefully, Wizards of the Coast's second attempt is a bit closer to the level of quality they usually reach with such collaborative projects.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Hytale Early Access Release Date Set for January After Creator Revival]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hytale-early-access-release-date</link>
            <guid>1367668</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Voxel sandbox game&nbsp;<em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>has been given a January Early Access release date, just over a week after its original creators announced its revival.</p>

<p>Hypixel Studios confirmed the news earlier today via the official&nbsp;<em>Hytale&nbsp;</em><a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-early-access-january-13-2026" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, on which it was revealed that the game will be launching into Early Access on PC on January 13th. Pre-orders will begin on December 13th.</p>

<p>Despite that, Hypixel says you shouldn't pre-order the game "if you don't feel comfortable" doing so. The studio is clear on the fact that&nbsp;<em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>will very much be an Early Access release, which means it'll be "unfinished" and "buggy for a while". Caveat emptor, and all that.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hytale-early-access-release-date-bugs.jpg?itok=etey4Iqv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hytale-early-access-release-date-bugs.jpg?itok=LvScV7nC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll do more than your fair share of running away from bugs, as it were, in&nbsp;<em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>in January.</figcaption></figure><p>In the post, Hypixel reiterates what it said last week as part of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hytale-rescued-early-access-soon" rel="nofollow">its announcement</a> that&nbsp;<em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>had been revived, namely that the game will follow "the original vision from the 2018 trailer" and that the developer will be "returning to a four-year-old legacy build that had been abandoned".</p>

<p>As such, "some parts of the game will feel behind" when it launches in January, but despite that, Hypixel says "momentum is strong", so you can expect plenty of updates and communication from the developer throughout the Early Access period.</p>

<p>If you're the kind of person who wants to mod&nbsp;<em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>to make it your own, then you'll be pleased to know modding and creative tools will be available on day one of Early Access, even though they're "not where [Hypixel wants] them long term".</p>

<p>Hypixel closes by warning players that the Early Access build of&nbsp;<em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>will be "rough", but promises that "the path ahead matters more". It seems like it really is important to set your expectations accordingly here.</p>




<p><em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>began life as a custom&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>server before being spun off into its own entity in 2018, with&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Valorant</em>'s Riot Games <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/riot-games-hytale-acqusition-adds-blocky-adventure-to-roster" rel="nofollow">stepping in to purchase Hypixel</a> in 2020.</p>

<p>However, the partnership between Hypixel and Riot ended earlier this year when the latter <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hytale-canceled-dev-shuts-down" rel="nofollow">shut down the former</a> and seemingly canceled&nbsp;<em>Hytale</em>, although the game has since risen from the ashes under the stewardship of some of the original server's co-founders.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>when it launches on PC via Early Access on January 13th next year. Stay tuned for more.</p>
