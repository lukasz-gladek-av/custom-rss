            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/thick-as-thieves-preview-spiritual-successor-to-classic<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>What’s a good heist without high stakes? <em>Thick as Thieves</em> aims to up the ante with its PVPVE, competitive thievery. From Warren Specter’s studio, OtherSide Entertainment, this game has much potential.</p>

<p>We got a chance to see <em>Thick as Thieves</em> in action during a hands-off demonstration at Summer Game Fest 2025. Unfortunately, we were only able to see the single-player aspect of Thick as Thieves, since the venue’s internet decided to stop working.</p>

<p>Despite this, Director of Product Michael Fitch says that despite very much being a multiplayer game, the PVE aspect much also be important. So yes, you can play <em>Thick as Thieves</em> by yourself if you so choose.</p>



<h2>Pick Your Poison</h2>

<p>First things first: pick your character. Each character in <em>Thick as Thieves</em> has their own abilities; essentially, they each have one killer advantage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Spider, for instance, is quite mobile and is equipped with tools like a grappling hook to get on top of roofs and other obstacles. The Chameleon, on the other hand, can take the form of an NPC.</p>



<p>The Chameleon, in particular, sounds quite intriguing, as his playstyle revolves around subterfuge and trickery by trying to mimic the habits of an NPC.</p>

<p>Whatever the case, at the start of every match, each thief is assigned the same job by the Thieves Guild. The objective is to obtain a special book, which is purportedly hidden in a manor. We don’t know much beyond that, which is why collecting clues is crucial.</p>



<h2>Making Garrett Proud</h2>

<p>This does hearken back to games like <em>Thief</em> where you’d have to collect clues scattered around the environment to eventually find your way to the target. Indeed, <em>Thick as Thieves </em>is described as a spiritual successor to <em>Thief</em>, so you can expect it to share similar gameplay elements like reading those notes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Eventually, we find out how to obtain the book. The way in which you find your target piece of loot will change from game to game, so there is a degree of unpredictability here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Grabbing the target will start a timer that alerts other thieves that someone has the item and are working their way to the exit. This is where, presumably, most players will come out of the woodwork and try to fight you.</p>



<h2><em>Thick as Thieves&nbsp;</em>Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>I wish I could have seen more of the multiplayer aspect, because that’s really at the heart of <em>Thick as Thieves’</em> gameplay. It simply doesn’t seem quite as exciting with one player.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And that’s related to another concern of mine: the game’s longevity. Immersive sims are already a niche genre, and <em>Thick as Thieves </em>will depend on a healthy audience. I just don’t know if that audience is there, but I really hope it is.</p>

<p>But, with minds like Warren Specter behind <em>Thick as Thieves</em>, I have faith in the project. Should it gather the numbers needed to thrive, this title has potential to create a lot of long-lasting memories.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zelda-movie-delayed-may-2027<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced that its upcoming live-action&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda&nbsp;</em>movie will be releasing later than initially anticipated, although since the movie is such a long way off anyway, the delay likely won't mean much.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Nintendo/status/1932075231885382103" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Nintendo legend Shigeru Miyamoto revealed earlier today that the&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>movie, which was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/live-action-zelda-movie-march-2027" rel="nofollow">due to come out in March 2027</a>, will instead be releasing in theaters on May 7th. Like I said, both of these dates are pretty much too far off for the delay to be too meaningful.</p>

<p>According to Miyamoto, the movie was delayed in order to give the filmmakers and producers "extra time to make the film as good as it can be", which is a pretty standard reason for delaying a project. That famous quote about delaying and rushing <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/did-miyamoto-really-say-a-delayed-game-is-eventually-good-but-a-rushed-game-is-forever-bad" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wasn't actually said by Miyamoto</a>, but it feels apropos here anyway.</p>

<p>We do, however, know that the movie will definitely be live-action as opposed to an animation, and it'll be helmed by&nbsp;<em>The Maze Runner&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes&nbsp;</em>director Wes Ball, with production being handled by Miyamoto, Ball, and Avi Arad.</p>

<p>It's likely we're going to have to wait quite some time before we get more information about the&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>movie, especially given this delay, but it's not all bad news; while you're waiting, the Switch 2 just made its predecessor's&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>library a much smoother experience.</p>

<p>The Switch 2 Edition upgrades for&nbsp;<em>Breath of the Wild&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>&nbsp;bring smoother frame rates and better visuals, of course, but <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-upgrades-switch-1" rel="nofollow">free updates</a> for&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Link's Awakening&nbsp;</em>are also available, smoothing out their choppy frame rates and performance issues on the Switch 2.</p>




<p>The live-action&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda&nbsp;</em>movie is now set to launch on May 7th, 2027. We'll bring you more on this one as soon as we get it.</p>
