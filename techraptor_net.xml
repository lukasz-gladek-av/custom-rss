            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's developer CyberConnect2's 30th birthday, and to celebrate this milestone, the studio has announced <em>.hack//Z.E.R.O.</em>, a brand new installment in the long-running <em>.hack </em>series over which the company has full control.</p><p>As revealed in <a href="https://x.com/cc2information/status/2023355425437921703" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a social media post</a> (and via an accompanying trailer), <em>.hack//Z.E.R.O. </em>will be "fully self-published by CyberConnect2, from planning to development to release", with usual publisher Bandai Namco granting CyberConnect2 permission to fully manage the project itself.</p><p>According to a newly-revealed <a href="https://www.cc2.co.jp/hackzero/en/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">official teaser website</a>, <em>.hack//Z.E.R.O. </em>will be a "novel RPG experience" that will blend the franchise's "trademark duality of fantasy (game world) and reality (real world) with modern expectations", and not only that, but it'll also feature "100% pure CyberConnect2 spirit".</p><figure role="group">

<p>The new project's music will be composed by legendary Japanese violinist and composer Taro Hakase, whose "dexterous...violin" helped to "kick-start the project", according to CyberConnect2.</p><p>Outside of these details, we don't know too much about <em>.hack//Z.E.R.O.</em>, but we do know it'll be the first full <em>.hack </em>RPG since 2010's <em>.hack//Link</em>, which was released for the PSP (which should tell you just how long it's been).</p><p>In the interim, a fighting game, <em>.hack//Versus</em>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hackgu-last-recode-hits-north-america-on-november-3rd" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a8c65b9d-94a0-406f-9822-3dd79877c7ec" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">a remaster</a> of the <em>.hack//GU </em>trilogy have been released, but <em>.hack </em>fans have been waiting quite some time for the continuation of the core series.</p><p>If you're not familiar with the <em>.hack </em>series, the games revolve around a game-within-a-game known simply as <em>The World</em>. It's not dissimilar to anime and manga properties like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/solo-leveling-arise-overdrive-release-date" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2cb237f6-edfc-48d7-83cb-b6bc1d2f5bf9" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Solo Leveling</em></a><em> </em>and <em>Sword Art Online</em>, although it predates both.</p>
<p>We don't yet know when we can expect <em>.hack//Z.E.R.O. </em>to launch, although if the game wants to arrive in time for CyberConnect2's 30th anniversary, then a release this year would probably be advantageous. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Metal Gear </em>and <em>Castlevania </em>programmer and designer Shutaro Iida has passed away at the age of 52 after a battle with cancer, according to a post on his X account.</p><p>The <a href="https://x.com/CurryHermit/status/2023200658544083439" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">post</a>, which was spotted by <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/shutaro-iida-castlevania-bloodstained-metal-gear-has-passed-away.1436926/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ResetEra user Foffy</a> earlier today, confirms that Iida died on February 10th due to pancreatic cancer. He's been fighting the illness for some time, according to Foffy's translation.</p><p>If you don't know Iida by name, you'll almost certainly know him from his work; he served as a programmer on several <em>Castlevania </em>titles, including iconic games like <em>Aria of Sorrow </em>and <em>Portrait of Ruin</em>, as well as working as a level designer on <em>Castlevania: Harmony of Despair</em>.</p><figure role="group">

<p>As well as the <em>Castlevania </em>games, Iida also worked on <em>Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain </em>and its demo-sized predecessor <em>Ground Zeroes </em>as a programmer; he appears to be a big part of why the enemy AI in those games is so solid, as it were.</p><p>After working at Konami, Iida joined former <em>Castlevania </em>producer Koji Igarashi to work on 2019's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/bloodstained-ritual-of-night-review-iga-to-please" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="562798e1-8db8-47e0-a4db-1e081d708785" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">excellent</a> <em>Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night</em>, on which he served as director, with Iga occupying the role of producer.</p><p>Iida was due to lead the upcoming followup <em>Bloodstained: The Scarlet Engagement </em>as well. According to an <a href="https://artplay.co.jp/news/shutaro" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">official statement</a> by Igarashi on the website of his studio ArtPlay, development on that game is "now at its final stages".</p><p>The franchises on which Iida worked live on, too; during the most recent PlayStation State of Play presentation, it was announced that a brand new <em>Castlevania </em>game is in the works, and that a second <em>Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection </em>will be released.</p><figure role="group">
