            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Riot Games has announced the Early Access release date for&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>fighter&nbsp;<em>2XKO</em>, and if you want to check the game out, you'll be able to do so very shortly indeed.</p>

<p>As part of a new video detailing what's going on with the game,&nbsp;<em>2XKO&nbsp;</em>executive producer Tom Cannon revealed that the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/league-of-legends-fighting-game-officially-named-2xko-as-spectacular-new-gameplay-is" rel="nofollow">free-to-play two-on-two fighter</a> will launch on PC via Early Access on October 7th.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there's no word yet on when you can expect the game to land on consoles, although it is due to launch on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S as well as PC. We'll have to wait a little longer to find out when console players can curb stomp Yasuo to their hearts' content.</p>

<p>Each season will bring a new champion, and that includes Season 0, so there's still one more character to be announced for the game; Riot says you should keep an eye out for the trailer and dev update revealing that champ "soon".</p>

<p>When&nbsp;<em>2XKO&nbsp;</em>launches in October, it will bring with it "a full season of content", including combo trials for each character to help you get to grips with their movesets.</p>

<p>Throughout the Early Access period, Riot says it will be introducing features like a battle pass and a ranked play system, as well as "balance tuning", which, if I know the&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>community, will be heavily requested from day one.</p>




<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>2XKO&nbsp;</em>when it launches on PC via Early Access on October 7th. There's no word yet on PS5 or Xbox Series X|S release dates, so stay tuned for more on this and all other things&nbsp;Riot Games.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nioh-3-release-date-seemingly-leaked-via-japanese-amazon-listing.1306968/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The&nbsp;<em>Nioh 3&nbsp;</em>release date may have leaked ahead of a potential spot in today's PlayStation State of Play showcase, if two listings on Amazon Japan are to be believed.</p>

<p>While the listings have been removed, they weren't taken down quickly enough to avoid being spotted by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/nioh-3-launches-february-6-2026" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gematsu</a>, and they appear to point to a release date of February 6th for the upcoming Soulslike action RPG.</p>

<p>Listings for both the standard edition and the Treasure Box edition of&nbsp;<em>Nioh 3&nbsp;</em>were spotted on Amazon Japan, and both of them bear the same release date.&nbsp;<em>Nioh 3&nbsp;</em>is currently slated for an early 2026 launch, so while these dates might be placeholders, they feel a little too specific for that.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nioh-3-release-date-amazon-japan-leak-boss.jpg?itok=vPhbEpQk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nioh-3-release-date-amazon-japan-leak-boss.jpg?itok=yk4uJj15 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It looks like&nbsp;<em>Nioh 3&nbsp;</em>is launching this February.</figcaption></figure><p>In case you're interested,&nbsp;<em>Nioh 3</em>'s Treasure Box edition will apparently include goodies like an art book, a soundtrack CD, and a furry key chain (that's a key chain with fur on it, rather than the alternative).</p>

<p>While it hasn't been confirmed that&nbsp;<em>Nioh 3&nbsp;</em>will feature during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-state-of-play-september-2025-confirmed" rel="nofollow">today's State of Play show</a>, the game is currently a PlayStation 5 console exclusive, and Amazon Japan listings appearing now (and then being removed) seems to suggest that they were supposed to go live following an announcement.</p>

<p>It's possible that&nbsp;<em>Nioh 3</em>'s release date will instead be announced during tomorrow's Koei Tecmo Tokyo Game Show program, which will be dedicated to&nbsp;<em>Nioh 3</em>, although a release date reveal during State of Play followed by a TGS gameplay deep dive seems more likely to me.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Nioh 3&nbsp;</em>is, well, it's the third game in Koei Tecmo and Team Ninja's&nbsp;<em>Nioh&nbsp;</em>series, which marries fast-paced hack-and-slash gameplay with Soulslike exploration and boss battles.</p>




<p><em>Nioh 3&nbsp;</em>is set for release sometime early next year (and probably on February 6th) for PC and PlayStation 5. Stay tuned for more on this.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/genshin-impact-to-honkai-nexus-anima-can-hoyo-fans-keep-up</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/from-genshin-impact-to-honkai-nexus-anima-can-hoyo-fans-keep-up.1306965/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As <em>Genshin Impact</em>'s fifth anniversary draws near, it's clear that HoYoverse has big plans in store for their most prolific game. <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-luna-i" rel="nofollow">The Song of the Welkin Moon arc has only just begun with the Luna I update</a>, but it's a strong indicator of where the developers plan to take <em>Genshin </em>in the coming years.</p>

<p>Surface-level improvements include more expressive character animations, more visually distinct playable areas and NPCs within the same region, and being able to interact with playable characters in the open world via the Anecdotes system.</p>

<p>Chances are that there are behind-the-scenes upgrades too as new characters are starting to get their own unique elemental sub-reactions, bosses are getting more complicated mechanics, and there's even going to be a brand new game mode called "Miliastra Wonderland" where players can create custom game modes and maps for others to enjoy.</p>

<p>Given that <em>Genshin's</em> Luna I update comes with the caveat of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-ps4-support-ending" rel="nofollow">ceasing operations for the PS4 version of the game</a>, it wouldn't be too much of a stretch to claim that it is also&nbsp;a modernization package in disguise. While the limitations of mobile hardware will likely prevent the developers from going too crazy, this does suggest that HoYoverse wants Genshin to be their "big tent" game with a bit of something for everyone.&nbsp;</p>




<h2><em>Genshin Impact</em>&nbsp;| The Only One Who Can Kill Me is Me</h2>

<p>Ironically, the biggest speed bump in <em>Genshin Impact's</em> new era is going to be HoYoverse itself. Currently, HoYoverse is running five different live-service games at once. When <a href="https://hna.hoyoverse.com/en-us" rel="nofollow"><em>Honkai: Nexus Anima</em></a> releases in the future, there are going to be six concurrently running live-service games that will likely have a significant amount of audience overlap.</p>

<p>Most of the promotional material for <em>Nexus Anima</em> shows that it's going to bring together characters from all of HoYoverse's IPs. The obvious problem is that with six different games running at once, fans are going to have to start rationing their time more aggressively.</p>

<p>Of course, no one is forcing anyone to play all six games at once. If we are limiting the discussion to <em>Genshin Impact</em>, <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/en-us/" rel="nofollow"><em>Honkai: Star Rail</em></a>, and <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/en-us/main" rel="nofollow"><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em></a>, one can feasibly play all three without much trouble. That's (presumably) not an entirely realistic picture of the games' audience though. Chances are that most people are playing other games at the same time.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/genshin-impact-talent-mat-domain.jpg?itok=PNkuGSed 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/genshin-impact-talent-mat-domain.jpg?itok=ElMoOmDI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Guess everyone will have to wait until Sunday for their materials.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Genshin Impact |&nbsp;</em>Farming Isn't Much, But It's Honest Work&nbsp;</h2>

<p>HoYoverse would probably love it if people took breaks from games developed by other studios, but that seems unlikely. Even with the Luna I update, <em>Genshin </em>retains some odd mechanics that other HoYoverse games have seemingly abandoned. The most annoying example would probably be how the developers insist on locking character and weapon upgrade materials to certain days of the week.</p>

<p>Smaller, otherwise inconsequential annoyances build up over time as well. <em>Genshin </em>still lacks a stamina overflow mechanic. You have to manually convert resin to Condensed Resin, albeit at better rates with the Luna I update. You can't directly upgrade lower tier materials into higher tier materials from the character screen. There's no way to downgrade higher tier materials either.</p>

<p>There's also the fact that you have to manually collect character level-up materials, another practice that has been minimized with HoYoverse's subsequent games. Granted, this is more of a quirk of open-world games more than a fault of <em>Genshin </em>itself, yet all signs point to <em>Honkai: Nexus Anima</em> having its own open-world portion to some degree.</p>

<p>If <em>Honkai: Nexus Anima</em> is swooping in with its own open world with potentially improved comparable features, then <em>Genshin's</em> main selling point might start to look like an inconvenience. People will still play <em>Genshin </em>for the story or the user-generated content, but if building characters becomes a hassle, then they might not really bother with farming enemies and collecting random flowers.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/genshin-impact-nod-krai-fatui-boss_0.jpg?itok=s7-UmxTq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/genshin-impact-nod-krai-fatui-boss_0.jpg?itok=aljE2gpz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>At least you can brute force his shields... for now.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Genshin Impact |&nbsp;</em>HP Inflation? In This Economy? It's More Likely Than You Think</h2>

<p>If people aren't putting in the effort to build characters, then that would imply that they don't really need to play the endgame modes to completion, and if they're not playing the endgame modes, then there's less of a need to pull characters. Pulling characters for their open world mobility is an option, although whether this represents a sizable portion of the audience is anyone's guess.</p>

<p>Something has to make way eventually. <em>Honkai: Star Rail's</em> combat can be entirely automated. <em>Zenless Zone Zero's </em>non-endgame activities let you spend an entire day's worth of stamina in literal seconds. You could build up endgame-ready characters almost passively in both games and then focus on the story or events. <em>Genshin </em>has no such luxury, and it's starting to become quite noticeable now thanks to both Imaginarium Theater and the Luna I era of boss mechanics.</p>

<p>It's not as if HoYoverse is allergic to porting mechanics from one game to another. The ability to build your own Artifact didn't originate from <em>Genshin</em>, and <em>Genshin's </em>improvements to the mechanic has made its way to other HoYoverse games to some degree. The same goes for the in-game character guides and the Anecdotes feature.</p>

<p>Alternatively, HoYoverse may be counting on<em> Honkai: Nexus Anima</em> to pressure <em>Genshin's</em> player base to spend more. If there's less time to play, then people might be willing to part with some money to bypass the more tedious activities so that they can concentrate on story and endgame activities. The mechanism already exists in the game, people just have to be desperate enough to spend.</p>




<h2><em>Genshin Impact |&nbsp;</em>Hold Up, Let HoYo Cook</h2>

<p>None of this precludes the existence of a middle ground. <em>Honkai: Nexus Anima</em> may have open world elements, but its core gameplay loop appears to revolve around minigames and autochess. Neither particularly encroaches upon <em>Genshin's&nbsp;</em>territory, and it's hard to imagine a scenario where autochess requires any huge commitment of time or attention.</p>

<p>Furthermore, as we've seen with the release of&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> and <em>Zenless Zone Zero</em>, people can just bounce around and take breaks whenever there's a relative lull in content. You might miss out on some premium currency or an event here and there, but if you're planning to play these games over the course of years then it's almost irrelevant.</p>

<p>Regardless, HoYoverse might want to consider ironing out some of <em>Genshin Impact's</em> more annoying quirks to keep people happy in the long run. The Luna I update is certainly a step in the right direction, offering both meaningful content and mechanics that can be used to reduce the tedium of farming (albeit only in the current event).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The real test would be when&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Nexus Anima</em>&nbsp;releases. Will people stay with <em>Genshin Impact</em> in spite of its somewhat archaic approach to character building, among other annoyances, or will&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Nexus Anima&nbsp;</em>be a good enough open-world replacement? Or will both games be able to coexist? Even if players can manage with an additional game, what about the next game, or the one after that? Only time will tell.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Magic: The Gathering Spider-Man Interview: Mark Rosewater, Corey Bowen, & Team]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/mtg-spider-man-interview-mark-rosewater-corey-bowen-team</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/magic-the-gathering-spider-man-interview-mark-rosewater-corey-bowen-team.1306764/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>News that Spider-Man, and more broadly Marvel, would be coming to <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> made waves a few years ago through their offices, particularly with <em>Magic</em>’s Head Designer Mark Rosewater. With just a few days until the set releases, I had the chance to talk to Rosewater, the set’s Lead Designer Corey Bowen, Principal Designer Jadine Klomparens, and Senior Art Director Sarah Wassell about everything Spider-Man and how they translated it to <em>Magic</em>.</p>

<h2>What Makes Spider-Man Spider-Man?</h2>

<p>Spider-Man is the most popular superhero in the world, so there’s obviously a lot people love about the character and the world he lives in. For Universes Beyond, translating the core pillars of why people love any one franchise is key to the set’s design.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, I asked the team what it was they loved about <em>Spider-Man</em> and what they wanted to make sure showed up in the set. Rosewater hit what I think is what most people are drawn to with <em>Spider-Man</em>:&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Superheroes are kind of larger than life ... They were grander than you and they’re something you could look up to and admire. But Peter Parker was you. He had actual problems that you had... Peter Parker is late on his rent and has trouble getting a date, you know?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For each Universes Beyond set, the team identifies who could serve as Subject Matter Experts for the property they are adapting. These are people very passionate and knowledgeable about whatever they're adapting and could come from anywhere in the company. They then become key resources and sounding boards throughout the design process.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/spider-man-no-more-mtg-card.jpg?itok=T7vL1PUU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/spider-man-no-more-mtg-card.jpg?itok=oRSZaLax 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In <em>Spider-Man</em>'s case, Rosewater served that role with some others, so his keying in on what he loved about Spider-Man, an everyday guy who happens to be a superhero, is something that shines through the set.</p>

<p>Personally for Rosewater, he said that when he heard they were talking to Marvel about making sets with their properties, the concept of Universes Beyond fully clicked with him. He now could feel the same level of excitement others in the offices felt about things they were deeply passionate about making their way into <em>Magic</em>.</p>

<p>Bowen expanded on the key aspects of <em>Spider-Man</em> and how they approached designing cards:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A lot of times he’s making choices between should I be a hero? Should I cater towards my life? ... We try to really make sure we had a lot of family moments, a lot of those grounded moments in the set.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Specifically, Bowen mentioned that is why there are quite a few Modal choice cards in the set. The choice of what ability you activate mirrors the choices Spider-Man is faced with.</p>

<p>School Daze is a card where Peter is stuck with the choice of suiting up to protect the city or get his homework done. &nbsp;Another one Bowen mentioned was Heroes’ Hangout, where the tension between the dual-life of any of the heroes plays out.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For Bowen specifically, he really loves the relationship <em>Spider-Man</em> has with villains. The balance between the serious and humorous is something that stands out, where Spider-Man is constantly quipping and making jokes, talking with the villains.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Flavor text on the cards did a lot of the heavy lifting here, with little quotes of Spider-Man making fun of the likes of Vulture or Rhino. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>Making the Abstract Into Cards&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Moreso than in other sets of <em>Magic</em>, I noticed that there are a lot of “high concept” cards in <em>Spider-Man</em>. By that I mean, they’re not exactly obvious as ideas for a card. Web a guy? Easy card. Rent is Due? Not something you maybe think of right away.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mtg-rent-is-due-card.jpg?itok=805XiBE1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mtg-rent-is-due-card.jpg?itok=3ERvMILd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>I asked for a little bit more on the design process of Rent is Due. In this card’s specific case, Bowen said they wanted a card to show Peter’s bad luck, the troubles he has in life.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rent is Due was one of the more difficult cards for the team to design Klomparens said, but they eventually landed on having it synergize with treasure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There’s a few ways cards come to be in <em>Magic</em>, and a lot of the time it’s a question of what the set needs. There may be a lack of synergy in one color or maybe they need more cards to fit the identity of one color, like some more card draw in blue for example.</p>

<p>With Universes Beyond more often than your standard sets, they get to start from the point of: how do we get the flavor of the set right? What do we absolutely need to make this set feel like <em>Spider-Man</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/magic-gathering-final-fantasy-precons-review-warkin-good-fun" rel="nofollow"><em>Final Fantasy</em></a>, or <em>Lord of the Rings</em>?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rent is Due was one of those cards that started out as just a concept of a card that would convey <em>Spider-Man</em> in a great way. “Parker Luck” is such a big thing to fans they wanted to make sure it was represented in the set, so the challenge is how they can find a satisfying mechanic that will make sense with the flavor of the card.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mtg-supportive-parents.jpg?itok=YX1X8JaU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mtg-supportive-parents.jpg?itok=ZY2cmTJG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Klomparens said that Rent is Due is an example of a card they probably wouldn’t have come to naturally if they were just designing cards in the normal process. It was something necessitated by the property they were adapting and a concept their subject matter experts like Rosewater identified early on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a designer, Rosewater said that is one of the beautiful things of making Universes Beyond. They get to start designing in a place they never would have started before, which naturally leads to cards they haven’t made before.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The Art of Spider-Man in Magic&nbsp;</h2>

<p>It would be impossible not to talk about the art of <em>Spider-Man</em> in this set. There are a ton of iconic moments, covers, and panels from the long history of the comics, meaning that the team had an embarrassment of riches to draw from.</p>

<p>Because comics are already a medium that has strong visual language, which <em>Magic </em>cards necessitate as well, they had a lot of strong material to both be inspired by and to identify as something to use for things like bonus sheet cards or alternate art.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For senior art director Wassell, she said it was very intimidating:&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There’s so much of it and there’s such a legacy. It’s such a popular thing and people know so much about this stuff, you know? Working on Universes Beyond is such a challenge... Once we started on Marvel ... we got to really dig into this to make sure that we’re doing it justice because we didn’t want to leave anything important out.</p>
</blockquote>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/spider-man-counterspell-bonus-sheet-mtg.jpg?itok=PSTYYueF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/spider-man-counterspell-bonus-sheet-mtg.jpg?itok=J2B-KC1c 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Wassell said that the team of art directors all knew they would need to do a ton of research to do this right, to make sure they didn’t miss anything obvious. Part of the difficulty in that is that even just for <em>Spider-Man</em>, there are over 60 years worth of comics to take into consideration.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She mentioned that they luckily had “enough brains around” and the subject matter experts like Rosewater to help narrow down their focus. It was a lot of group conversations and brainstorming to get it right.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I asked how the process went a little more and how they approached representing the various runs and eras of<em> Spider-Man</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rosewater said they had this program that was like a giant wall that anyone could put up comics, certain panels, covers, or whatever they like on it to show they thought it was a good candidate to use for a card or as inspiration. That's where a lot of it started.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/spider-man-reanimate-mtg-card.jpg?itok=iSoHArPY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/spider-man-reanimate-mtg-card.jpg?itok=lKmYAI7k 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Certain iconic works were just immediately obvious and didn't need a ton of discussion, like breaking out of the grave for Kraven’s Last Hunt or walking away with his suit in the trash can.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, Wassell said they started with those must-haves like the above. They then moved on to discuss the most exciting moments, broadening their search some more. Once they had so much material, the job then became asking questions about what they had too much of, what they needed more of, and more along those lines to narrow down the focus of what they were looking at.</p>

<p>I asked if they were trying to make sure the whole run of Spider-Man was represented or if they focused on a few particularly popular runs. Rosewater said they made a conscious effort to make sure they were hitting the biggest moments every decade, asking themselves what they could use from the '60s, '70s, etc.</p>

<p>One of the biggest boons to the <em>Spider-Man</em> set is just how many comic and cover artists of <em>Spider-Man</em>&nbsp;are represented, both in classics everyone has seen and new pieces using their talents. They no doubt know how to make <em>Spider-Man</em> look like <em>Spider-Man</em>.</p>

<p>A lot of the biggest names feature art straight from a comic or cover, like art from Steve Ditko, Todd McFarlane, John Romita, Sr., Mark Bagley, and a whole lot more. Then you have new art from current Marvel artists like Jay David Ramos, Roberta Ingranata, Lucas Werneck, and more.</p>

I asked Wassell if there was any real trepidation or concern handing some reins to the Marvel artists, but she said there wasn’t really much to worry about.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At most, she said that talking to artists has to do with more logistical issues. Things like “the fact that the cards are small and that the frame goes here... a lot of that work tends to just be helping artists wrap their heads around that.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>As we wrapped up our talk, I took the opportunity to ask the team for any advice as I was heading to my pre-release event immediately after. They told me they found Mayhem to be a fun mechanic that has worked well in pre-release. Hopefully I would get the cards to make a deck for it.</p>

<p>Well, I didn't. Thankfully, I had all sorts of green and white spider heroes to build around and ended up winning the event. Still, thanks for the advice team!</p>

<hr><p>Pre-release events may have already happened or are still happening at your local game store, so you can get your hands on some <em>Spider-Man</em> cards now if you wish. Otherwise, the set fully releases on September 26.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher 2K and developer Gearbox have announced that the Switch 2 version of recently-released looter shooter&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>is being delayed indefinitely, and that pre-orders on the platform will be canceled.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://x.com/Borderlands/status/1970609156936868102" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on social media, the game is being delayed on Switch 2 in order to "deliver the best possible experience to [the two studios'] fans", and also to "better align [the Switch 2 release] with the addition of cross-saves".</p>

<p>2K and Gearbox didn't announce a new release date or window, but they did promise to reveal more once they've "fully adjusted" their plans for&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>on Switch 2.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/borderlands-4-switch-2-port-delayed-psycho.jpg?itok=m_NGB1Wm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/borderlands-4-switch-2-port-delayed-psycho.jpg?itok=9Okcs85w 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>is being indefinitely delayed on Switch 2.</figcaption></figure><p>Pre-orders are being canceled "in accordance with Nintendo's policy", according to 2K and Gearbox. You can initiate the cancellation process yourself if you want, but it'll automatically begin on September 26th (that's this Friday). Naturally, if you have a physical pre-order in place, you should contact the retailer.</p>

<p>News of&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em>'s delay on Switch 2 comes after widespread criticism of the game's performance on PC (and consoles, but criticism seems primarily aimed at the PC version), prompting Gearbox's Randy Pitchford to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/randy-pitchford-borderlands-4-performance-comments" rel="nofollow">passionately leap to the game's defense</a>.</p>

<p>Despite Pitchford's assertions that&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em>'s PC performance is fine, 2K and Gearbox have pledged to continue improving&nbsp;the game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/borderlands-4-pc-performance-top-priority" rel="nofollow">calling PC performance their "top priority"</a>.</p>

<p>All of the talk around&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em>'s performance also doesn't seem to have hurt the game sales-wise, at least not in the initial surge; reports estimate that the game has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/borderlands-4-sales-revenue" rel="nofollow">managed to shift around 2.5 million copies</a>, with the majority of those sales being on PC.</p>
