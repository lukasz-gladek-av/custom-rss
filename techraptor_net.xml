The iconic board game, which started as a critique of unchecked capitalism, has been around for <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/monopoly-hasbro-100th-anniversary-edition-announced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a century</a> with countless spin-offs. But Hasbro's plans involve a retooling of the original, and the official introduction of premium expansions.</p>

<h2>The <em>Monopoly</em> 2025 Roadmap</h2>

<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/492505/monopoly-new-version-expansions-announced" rel="nofollow">Polygon</a>, Hasbro senior vice president Brian Baker stated the changes coming to Monopoly in 2025 was to make the board game more inviting to modern players.</p>

The game will now be contained in a square box instead of its tradtional rectangle, allowing for easier storage. In addition, the play money, deed, Community Chest, and Chance cards have been revised. The metal movers, house and hotel models have also been made bigger.</p>

<p>All of these new game pieces can easily be organized and set up thanks to a new robust plastic organizer. According to Baker this was done so the game would be easier to set up and put away..</p>

<p>But the biggest change coming to <em>Monopoly</em> in 2025 is the official introduction of expansion packs. These expansions are designed to speed up the process of play.</p>

It adds a spinner to the board, allowing players to let it ride without adding money back into the in-game economy.</p>

<p>The second expansion is <em>Monopoly Go To Jail</em>. This expansion lessens the impact of going to jail with the introduction of corruption cards. Thesecards are only available to convicted felons.</p>

<p>Third is the <em>Monopoly Buy Everything Expansion</em>. As the name implies, it allows you to buy anything. Even the bank.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“We don’t necessarily need to sell more Monopolys,” Baker said. “Most people already own Monopoly. What they’re looking for is a reason to play it again.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This new version of <em>Monopoly</em> and its expansions will be coming to Amazon, Target, and Wal-Mart later this year. The base game will be sold at an MSRP of $19.99. The expansions are available at an MSRP of $9.99 each.</p>
