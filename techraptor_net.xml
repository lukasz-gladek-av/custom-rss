            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/toem-2-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Swedish studio Something We Made has announced&nbsp;<em>Toem 2</em>, a followup to its 2021 monochromatic photography puzzler, and it's currently in the very early stages of development.</p>

<p>We don't know too much about the game right now, but Something We Made is promising a "brand new adventure" that's all about "documenting the world's little wonders", so it sounds very much like the sequel will be following in <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/toem" rel="nofollow">the original game</a>'s footsteps.</p>

<p>It looks like <i>Toem 2</i>'s visual style will also be an upgrade over the original; while it'll sport the same monochromatic color scheme, the graphics seem to have been improved, and it seems as though the new game will adopt a more traditional 3D perspective as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/toem-2-announced-square.jpg?itok=BFcetWiX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/toem-2-announced-square.jpg?itok=-z3YFmQt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Toem 2&nbsp;</em>looks like it's taking a slightly different visual direction to the original.</figcaption></figure><p>Like the first game,&nbsp;<em>Toem 2&nbsp;</em>will revolve around "uncovering little details" in the game's world, and you'll also be "helping friends along the way", so it sounds like you'll be taking on photography requests just like in&nbsp;<em>Toem</em>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we don't have a release date or even a release window for&nbsp;<em>Toem 2&nbsp;</em>yet; Something We Made says the game is in very early development right now, so it could be a few years before we hear from this one again.</p>

<p>While you wait, you can check out the teaser trailer for&nbsp;<em>Toem 2&nbsp;</em>right here. It shows off what the game's art style will be like, but (understandably given the game's stage of development) it doesn't give too much away beyond that.</p>




<p>If you didn't check out the original&nbsp;<em>Toem</em>, it was a low-key cozy photography game in which you took on a variety of tasks given to you by a range of quirky characters.</p>

<p>The original game is available to check out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1307580/TOEM_A_Photo_Adventure/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/toem/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/toem/9n7zcllr01b3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/toem-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>, and you can wishlist&nbsp;<em>Toem 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2900640/TOEM_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a> if you want to keep up with its progress.</p>
