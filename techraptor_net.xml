            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rise-of-ronin-pc-release-march<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Koei Tecmo and developer Team Ninja have announced a&nbsp;<em>Rise of the Ronin&nbsp;</em>PC release, and it's less than two months away.</p>

<p>Per an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1340990/view/510696338398118902" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on the game's brand new Steam page,&nbsp;<em>Rise of the Ronin&nbsp;</em>will launch on PC on March 11th, making it the latest in a string of PS5 exclusives to come to PC after their console release (with the most recent being&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth" rel="nofollow"><em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em></a>).</p>

<p>As you'd probably expect from a PC release,&nbsp;<em>Rise of the Ronin</em>'s graphical options will be greatly expanded on PC compared to its PS5 version. New features include support for 8K resolution and 120fps, as well as ultrawide compatibility and support for ray tracing.</p>

<p>Koei Tecmo's desire to get&nbsp;<em>Rise of the Ronin&nbsp;</em>out of its PS5 exclusivity cage makes a lot of sense, especially in the light of Square Enix claiming its PS5 exclusives&nbsp;<em>Rebirth&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;</i><em>Final Fantasy XVI&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-16-rebirth-profits-square-enix" rel="nofollow">didn't meet the company's expectations</a>.</p>

<p>Last we heard, Koei Tecmo seemed pleased with&nbsp;<em>Rise of the Ronin</em>'s sales, claiming the game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rise-of-ronin-sales-koei-tecmo-financials" rel="nofollow">outpacing the&nbsp;<em>Nioh&nbsp;</em>series</a> in terms of its launch sales.</p>

<p>Still, more sales are always better for publishers, and so putting the game on PC and exposing it to a wider audience can only be a sensible move. You can check out the PC reveal trailer for&nbsp;<em>Rise of the Ronin&nbsp;</em>here. It's in Japanese, but the game is getting an English-language PC release too.</p>




<p>If you missed out on&nbsp;<em>Rise of the Ronin</em>, it's an open-world action RPG set in the Bakumatsu era of Japanese history, during which Japan's rapid modernization and increasing connection to the West caused conflict within the country's borders.</p>

<p>You can check the game out right now on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/rise-of-the-ronin/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, and it's coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1340990/Rise_of_the_Ronin/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> on March 11th.
