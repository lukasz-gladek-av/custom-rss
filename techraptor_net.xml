            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingmakers-delayed-q1-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Redemption Road and publisher tinyBuild have announced that ambitious upcoming action-strategy sandbox hybrid game&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>has been delayed until next year.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2109770/view/4445711438670988556" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an announcement on Steam</a> (which is, rather amusingly, worded as though it were an old-timey town crier decree), the two studios say that&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>will now launch "nay later than the end o' Q1 2025". I suppose the originally-slated release window of 2024 was pretty much unattainable given we're in December now.</p>

<p>The premise of&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>is a pretty novel one; it revolves around players being able to travel back in time with modern weaponry and lay waste to medieval armies in order to change the course of a war and "stave off the apocalypse".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingmakers-delayed-shooting.jpg?itok=zY9dK4Ei 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingmakers-delayed-shooting.jpg?itok=WKlZAUh3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>promises some astoundingly historically inaccurate action-sandbox shenanigans.</figcaption></figure><p>It's not a million miles away from the premise of 2009 FPS&nbsp;<em>Darkest of Days</em>, although&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>isn't an FPS; rather, it's an ambitious and sprawling mixture of action, strategy, city-building, and sandbox gameplay.</p>

<p>You'll engage in battles in which soldiers are "controlled by a next-gen multi-threaded AI" and animated by "a unique procedural animation system". In those battles, you'll use modern weaponry like machine guns, attack helicopters, and air strikes to "wreak absolute havoc on the battlefield".</p>

<p>The game will also feature base-building elements and real-time strategy gameplay; you'll be able to zoom out and issue orders to your soldiers before joining the fray yourself, watching the plan you've built be executed in real time.</p>




<p><em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>may not be out yet, but its publisher tinyBuild clearly has faith that it's going to be a smash hit. Back in August, the studio announced that a&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingmakers-movie-announced" rel="nofollow">movie is in production</a> in conjunction with movie studio Story Kitchen.</p>

<p>We still don't have a full release date for&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>yet, but given the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tinybuild-financials-2023" rel="nofollow">financial straits tinyBuild appears to be in right now</a>, it likely can't come soon enough. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2109770/Kingmakers/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wishlist the game on Steam right now</a> if you want to keep up with its progress.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-moved-forward</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-moved-forward-one-week.1052463/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-moved-forward<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Warhorse Studios has moved the&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>release date forward a week, and there are new goodies coming for the game this week as well.</p>

<p>Over <a href="https://x.com/WarhorseStudios/status/1864354217139314820" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on social media platform X</a>, the studio confirms that the game's new release date is February 4th, which is exactly a week before the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-delay" rel="nofollow">originally intended launch date of February 11th</a>.</p>

<p>That should come as a pleasant surprise for&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance&nbsp;</em>fans, especially since the game's original release date technically constituted a delay. It was originally meant for release sometime in 2024.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-early-henry-horse.jpg?itok=2_uzGPdP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-early-henry-horse.jpg?itok=eC1LdW1B 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll now be able to play&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>a whole week early.</figcaption></figure><p>In the release date announcement post, Warhorse also says that more info about&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>is on the way this week, with a new story trailer for the game set to debut later today.</p>

<p>Additionally, we'll also be learning the&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>PC specs this week, as well as "console specs", which presumably refers to what modes the console versions of the game will offer, as well as whether it'll join the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/full-ps5-pro-enhanced-list-launch" rel="nofollow">list of PS5 Pro-enhanced games</a>.</p>

<p>If you're not across&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>, it's the sequel to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-sales-8m" rel="nofollow">hugely successful</a> 2018 RPG&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em>, an open-world adventure that emphasizes realistic combat and historical detail.</p>

<p>The second game will once again revolve around protagonist Henry of Skalitz, which also means that like its predecessor, it'll be set in 15th-century medieval Europe.</p>




<p>As well as bringing back many elements from the first game, including multiple approaches to combat and quest completion,&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>will also feature ranged weaponry like crossbows, as well as firearms.</p>

<p>Lest you think the introduction of new features will cause Warhorse to scale the story back, however, think again; the studio confirmed back in August that&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>'s script <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-script-words" rel="nofollow">contains over two million words</a>.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>when it launches on February 4th for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1771300/Kingdom_Come_Deliverance_II/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/9N4W31HSMVVD" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

Did you watch the adventures of Mando and Grogu during the Mandalorian TV show and think, that's some of me right there? Well, the board game <em>Star Wars&nbsp;the Mandalorian Adventures</em> takes you right into the first season of the stellar TV show, featuring art, characters, and scenarios from it. In this review, we'll have a look at how it plays, who you can play, and will try to keep it as spolier free as possible.</p>

<p>We've covered a whole host of <em>Star Wars</em>-themed games on the site, from the collectible card game <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/star-wars-unlimited-review-trading-card-gamings-new-hope" rel="nofollow">Star Wars Unlnimted</a> to the miniature wargames <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/star-wars-x-wing-minatures-game-2nd-edition-core-set-review-perfect-time-to-join" rel="nofollow">X-Wing</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/star-wars-legion-core-set-review-pick-dark-or-light-and-go-to-war" rel="nofollow">Legion</a>, and also <em>Star Wars</em> video games like the recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/star-wars-outlaws-review" rel="nofollow">Star Wars Outlaws</a>.</p>

<p><em>Star Wars</em> <em>the Mandalorian Adventures</em> features an incredibly easy core set of mechanics, and also one of the best onboarding systems I've seen. The game takes place using a book as the playmat, a system we've seen used to great success in other tabletop games. The map pages also feature the rules for that scenario, keeping everything handily in front of you. As you progress through the game's scenarios, you'll add components until you've unlocked the whole game. This system adds in elements as you play, none of which are particularly complicated, but this feels aimed at non-gamers, rather than veteran tabletop players. I felt like I could have gone all in during the first scenario, but adding elements as you go does have a nice flow to it.</p>

<p>During the game, players take turns, acting cooperatively to complete the mission. Games can be played solo, with a player controlling more characters if that's your preferred style of play. Each character has a deck of 12 cards, and each card has a power, between 1 and 4. All characters start with 3 of each power, and you randomly draw 4 of those cards into your hand. Each turn you get to take 2 actions, which you do by placing a card in the action slot on the board. There are 4 types of action:</p>

<ul><li>Move - Which lets your character move around the map</li>
	<li>Attack - Which lets you try to take out the enemies on the map</li>
	<li>Intel - Which lets you view unknown threats, or move threats</li>
	<li>Plan - Which lets you draw cards from the planning deck that might help you later on</li>
</ul><figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-the-mandalorian-adventures-3.jpg?itok=Uhn_WVG7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-the-mandalorian-adventures-3.jpg?itok=vk7mR8gJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>After every game of&nbsp;<em>Star Wars the Mandalorian Adventures,</em> you unlock new rules and cards from the Guide deck.</figcaption></figure><p>The power of the card you place in the action slot is how effective that action is. You can move further, attack harder, view threats further away, and draw more cards to find a good one. You can also only do each action once per turn, which adds a great tactical element to which 2 actions you pick, and which cards you place. If you can't quite reach to attack an enemy this turn, do you save your high power card for the attack, or use it to move this turn and attack with a lower powered card?</p>

<p>Once you've had your turn, the cards stay on the board, and after any player's turn, if the combined score of any cards in a slot is 5 or more, then an event happens, if the combined total is 6, then a crisis and then an event happens. This adds another great dynamic to the game as events/crises can never be avoided in total, but they can be worked around until you're in a better position to deal with them. It noticeability adds a risk element early game, as everyone wants to move, but if everyone does, you'll quickly have an event, so working out between you who should move and who should plan and intel the threats can work in your favor until you're ready to activate an event.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-the-mandalorian-adventures-4.jpg?itok=BIlCh7ZN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-the-mandalorian-adventures-4.jpg?itok=j5WJn-Y_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Star Wars The Mandalorian Adventures</em> includes 8 playable characters from the first season of the TV show.</figcaption></figure><h2>Who Can You Play In Star Wars The Mandalorian Adventures?</h2>

<p><em>Star Wars the Mandalorian Adventures</em> has 8 playable characters, each with their own themed action deck. The characters you can play are:</p>

<ul><li>The Mandalorian</li>
	<li>IG-11</li>
	<li>Paz Vizsla</li>
	<li>Burg</li>
	<li>Migs Mayfield</li>
	<li>Xi'an</li>
	<li>Cara Dune</li>
	<li>Greef Karga</li>
</ul><p>Even though the power spread across all the decks are the same, each character also has bonus actions on their cards, which can be used if played for that specific action type. For example, Mando has the Beskar Armor Plan card, which instead of planning, if played in the plan spot, he can search the plan deck for a defend card, and Paz has the Heavy Blaster Cannon attack action, which instead of attacking, can be used to deal 2 damage to up to 3 different threats at 1 range.</p>

<p>Each of the characters feels unique, which I was extremely pleased to see. Getting theme into board games is challenging, and <em>Star Wars the Mandalorian Adventures</em> manages to do it well, capturing each character uniquely and making the play experience with each, and with different combinations rewarding.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-the-mandalorian-adventures-5.jpg?itok=742xQ-Ut 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-the-mandalorian-adventures-5.jpg?itok=Tmwwze1d 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>In each of the&nbsp;<em>Star Wars the Mandalorian Adventures</em> decks, each character has a few unique power cards with thematic abilities.</figcaption></figure><h2>How Many Missions Does Star Wars The Mandalorian Adventures Have?</h2>

<p><em>Star Wars the Mandalorian Adventures</em> has 4 scenarios to play through in the map book, and each should be played in order as you work through the guide deck. Once you've played through and unlocked all the content, all of the scenarios can be played through again with different missions, and with different characters. I was actually surprised at the replayability of the game. It initially looked like it would be a quick and unrewarding experience, but there's a lot of replayability out of the box. It does also say that these are missions inspired by Season 1 of the TV show, so we might see another 2 games/expansions (and a bonus one for the Book of Boba Fett?).</p>

<h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On Star Wars The Mandalorian Adventures?</h2>

<p>I was very surprised by <em>Star Wars the Mandalorian Adventures</em>. I'm a huge fan of the TV show, but at first, on reading through the rules, and seeing that it only had 4 scenarios, it looked very basic. But it actually has a lot of depth behind the simple mechanics. It's not hyper-tactical, but is it fun, and the onboarding is extremely well done. It would be very easy to get a non-gamer <em>Star Wars</em> fan to play this and enjoy it, without having to spend ages explaining the rules, or having to manage them while they play through the first game</p>



<p>If you're a Mandalorian or <em>Star Wars</em> fan, then you will almost certainly enjoy this. It's a great experience, with a lot more depth than I initially thought. If you're not a <em>Star Wars </em>fan, then this might lose a lot of its drive. The mechanics are solid, but there are other adventure-style games out there that you might enjoy more. If you've never seen <em>Star Wars</em>&nbsp;or the Mandalorian, then I would recommend watching the TV show first, as there are some spoilers in here about the characters and different situations.</p>
