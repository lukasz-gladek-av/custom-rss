We've been a few years removed from all of AAA just having to focus on realism in graphics, and the results of that have been awesome. The art direction from those big and small has been stellar, with 2024 being no different.</p>

<p>Here are the nominees for TechRaptor's 2024 Best Visual Design for outstanding, cohesive aesthetic.</p>

<ul><li>Astro Bot</li>
	<li>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</li>
	<li>Metaphor: ReFantazio</li>
	<li>Neva</li>
	<li>Senua's Saga: Hellblade II</li>

<hr><h2>Third Place -&nbsp;Neva</h2>



<p>Developer: Nomada Studio | Release Date: October 15th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Andrew Otton</p>

<p>To this day, <em>Gris </em>remains one of the most beautiful games ever made (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/2018-techraptor-awards-best-visuals-award" rel="nofollow">winning this award in 2018</a>), so it's no surprise to see the next game from Nomada Studio on this list either.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Neva </em>is full of beautiful hand-drawn art and animations that place you in a fantastical world inspired in large part by Studio Ghibli works. It is striking, evocative, and uses clean lines and clear flat images to make it easy to see exactly what's on the screen.</p>

<p>It feels cliche to make this statement, but every frame of <em>Neva </em>feels like its own piece of unique, gorgeous art. That is an incredible feat, as when that phrase is used for something like film, the creator controls the camera. Here, we get to shift focus and move around at will. So it's quite the testament that Nomada was able to make every piece of <em>Neva </em>so enrapturing.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Second Place - Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</h2>



<p>Developer: Square Enix | Release Date: February 29th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Robert Scarpinito</p>

<p><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> set the stage for an incredible retelling of a legendary JRPG, dutifully recreating Midgard in amazing detail. However, everyone knew the next steps beyond Midgard would be vast; would <em>Rebirth </em>be able to to live up to the hype?</p>

<p>Square Enix delivered, bringing its world to life in stunning beauty, lush colors, and vibrant environments. Green plains, rocky canyons, dusty deserts, all populated with lived-in towns that dot the landscape. And if you've entered and explored Gold Saucer, I don't need to tell just how breathtaking and overwhelming that place is.</p>

<p>The character models are also worth noting here. Cloud and the rest of the party, along with Sephiroth, all look and feel as iconic as they did in the '90s, but with modern-day details and flourishes. They have flair, and their character models are easily among the best in this semi-realistic animated style.</p>

<h2>Winner - Metaphor: ReFantazio</h2>



<p>Developer: Atlus | Release Date: October 11th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Austin Suther</p>

<p>Is<em> Metaphor: Refantazio</em> a graphically impressive game? No, not particularly. So why, then, did it win best visual design? Running on the same engine as <em>Persona 5 </em>and <em>Catherine</em>, it’s a dated engine, no doubt. It’s what Studio Zero does with those limitations that’s impressive.</p>

<p><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> is a masterclass in UI design. It has a visual flair to it that only Atlus games seem to capture. Its Renaissance-esque style fits its vibrant and magical setting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Character portraits are another highlight; they are incredibly well-drawn and bring<em> Metaphor</em>’s cast of characters to life, making up for what the graphics lack.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Take a look at some of <em>Metaphor’</em>s “Human” designs, too, and you’ll see inspiration from Hieronymus Bosch, a real-life painter. The designs translate wonderfully into the game and create an unmatched and undeniably distinguished style.&nbsp;</p>

Gangs and cutthroats roam the shadows, mages and scientists vie to unlock the secrets of the vaults and the taint of Chaos still lingers beneath the city.

<p>We've been fans of Cubicle 7's <em>Warhammer</em> roleplaying games for a while, and you can read our preview of the full <em>Soulbound</em> rulebook <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-soulbound-preview" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and our review of the <em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplaying Game</em> core rulebook <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-fantasy-roleplay-4th-edition-review" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>Before we get into <em>Age of Sigmar Soulbound</em>, it's worth noting the difference between <em>Age of Sigmar (AoS)</em>, and <em>Warhammer</em> (now known as <em>Warhammer the Old World</em> in Games Workshop's latest tabletop iteration). The original <em>Warhammer</em> was Games Workshop's fantasy wargaming system.</p>

<p>In 2015 (a decade this year and we're still having this conversation) Games Workshop had a narrative event called the End Times, which ended the Old World and started the new <em>Age of Sigmar</em> system, along with moving the narrative completely away and into a new fantasy setting (with many of the same elements, but also a lot of changes). Games Workshop has also since re-released (in January 2024) the <em>Warhammer Fantasy</em> game, which you can read our review of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-old-world-review-hit-refresh" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>I mention the above because Cubicle 7 publishes 2 <em>Warhammer</em> roleplaying systems. <em>Age of Sigmar Soubound</em>, for which we are reviewing the Starter Set here, is set in Games Workshop's premier fantasy setting, and&nbsp;<em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay (WFRP)</em>, which is set in Games Workshop's original fantasy system. <em>WFRP</em> also persevered throughout the removal of <em>Warhammer Fantasy</em> from Games Workshop's wargaming range throughout the 2015-2024 gap.</p>

<p>We'll go into details of both settings in our coverage of the systems, but a quick summary is that <em>Warhammer Fantasy</em> is set in a more traditional fantasy setting, with the races of humans, elves, dwarves, orcs, and Skaven (ratmen) all battling over the map of the Old World, and&nbsp;<em>Age of Sigmar</em> sees the different races fighting across 8 different Mortal Realms, 8 unique planes of existence, connected through realm gates. A lot of the classic races are included, but they have a unique Games Workshop twist in <em>AoS</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/age-of-sigmar-soulbound-starter-set-4.jpg?itok=8ow_ZpnD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/age-of-sigmar-soulbound-starter-set-4.jpg?itok=YlDpgsu1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Along with the books, the <em>Soulbound</em> Starter Set has everything else 5 players need to play the adventure.</figcaption></figure><h2>A Starting Adventure</h2>

<p>Most roleplaying products start with a single book, either a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/arkham-horror-roleplaying-game-core-rulebook-review-this-is-halloween" rel="nofollow">Core Rulebook</a>, which contains everything players and Games Masters (GM) need to run the games,&nbsp;or a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-player-handbook-review-mixed-messaging-around-strong" rel="nofollow">Players Handbook</a>, which focuses on the core mechanics and player options, expanding into other books for the Games Master&nbsp;(which we see historically in <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em> by Wizards of the Coast). <em>Soulbound</em> has a Core Rulebook available, but also to make it even easier, the <em>Soulbound</em> Starter Set has everything 5 players plus a GM need to play their first few games in one easy package, with no printing or other products required.</p>

<p>This <em>Soulbound</em> starter set contains extremely well-produced, visually engaging, and coordinated components that allow players to get going easily, with an experienced GM. The GM gets 2 books, Faltering Light, which is the adventure and rules for running <em>Soulbound</em> out of the Starter Set, and the Brightspear City Guide, which fleshes out the city that the adventure is set in with details and adventure hooks (and stats for other enemies) for continuing your campaign in the city.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Faltering Light acts as a tutorial, guiding players through the rules whist exploring the adventure, and it works for someone who might be new to running roleplaying games as a GM too, but they will need to do some preparation beforehand. Reading through the whole adventure, making notes, and getting the hang of the rules, as they will be the one guiding the players through their first games. This preparation will set you up for your future career as a GM running games, as you don't have the player's luxury of just turning up on game night to play, most GMs do a lot of background work in preparing the adventure for the players.</p>

<p>The players can get going pretty quickly with <em>Soulbound</em> out of the Starter Set, as the character sheets are very well produced, starting with a full-color image of the character on the back, along with character details including a fantastic 'why play' section on the front. The sheets open up to show all the stats, talents, and equipment, as well as a quick rules breakdown for the character sheet elements so you don't need to keep grabbing the rulebook. They also have a character background section, where you can pick goals, connections, and secrets to add depth and your own spin on the character.</p>

<p>The final starter set components are dice (a set of 8 custom 6-sided dice, but it's helpful if all players have their own set of 4 to 8 dice), an introductory leaflet, that doubles as the party details sheet on the back, some quick reference rules sheets a double-sied Brightspear map for the players. The box is also dual use, and the GM can use as a screen to keep his notes and rolls secret, and handily has its own map and quick reference sheets printed on the inside.</p>

<p>The <em>Soulbound</em> Starter Set player experience begins with selecting a character. The <em>Soulbound</em> Core Rulebook has an impressive 23 character types to choose from, and the Starter Set has 5 pre-generated characters from those, taking a traditional roleplaying party of classes and races with the <em>Age of Sigmar </em>spin on it. Each character has a unique feel and party role, but will also feel comfortable to those who might be new to roleplaying. For example, Vel Arturious is a Stormcast Eternal, one of Sigmar's immortal fighters who like to go toe to toe with the enemy and Imren Sealgaire is an Idoneth Deepkin Tidecaster, a sea-elf magic user.</p>

<p>The other members of the party include Xan Bemyr, a human war priest, Malgra Dainsson, a dwarven engineer, and Darach a walking tree ranger (think a cross between Aragorn from <em>The&nbsp;Lord of the Rings</em> and Groot from <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/age-of-sigmar-soulbound-starter-set-3.jpg?itok=2CY8UReJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/age-of-sigmar-soulbound-starter-set-3.jpg?itok=j8mWBxA0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The inside of the <em>Soulbound</em> Starter Set box handily doubles as a screen for the Games Master, with some useful details printed on the inside.</figcaption></figure><h2>Chaos Everywhere!</h2>

<p>The core <em>Soulbound</em> system is slightly different from what you might have experienced in other systems, and it has some interesting complexity that provides a lot of flexibility in what is an epicly heroic system. As with any system, <em>Soulbound</em> requires a player to roll a dice and beat a number set by the difficulty of the task. The number of dice the player rolls comes from 1 of 3 core stats, Body, Mind, and Soul. Additional dice are added for skills that the character may have that apply to the test.</p>

<p>The flexibility comes with the combination of the target number required to roll, most tests require a 4 but this is raised and lowered depending on how difficult the test is. The number of successes required can also change depending on the circumstances. This system allows flexibility beyond single-roll systems, allowing the GM to flex between difficulty and complexity. Finding a specific sentence in an unknown book in a library would require a lot of low successes, picking a lock might require a single high success, and picking the lock on the greatest safe ever made, would require a lot of high successes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The system flows very well and is introduced as you progress through the adventure, which is intriguing, but very focused on a specific aspect of Chaos, which would be my only criticism of the adventure. It gives a great first impression, but not a very rounded one to someone who might be brand new to the setting. It would of course be difficult to give a fully rounded impression of the whole setting, as it's taken Cubicle 7 years and multiple supplements to cover all of it, but an introduction to some of the races and all of the Chaos gods would have been nice to see (and obviously a lot more work for a less experienced GM, or an experienced GM new to the setting).</p>

<h2>Age Of Sigmar Soulbound Starter Set Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>The <em>Age of Sigmar Soulbound</em> Starter Set is a great package, incredibly well-produced with great-looking components. The characters give a rounded first introduction to the setting, with awesome character sheets full of detail. The 2 books for the Games Master do a great job of introducing the setting and system and also allowing the GM to expand without buying further products if they want to test beyond the initial adventure with their players. The system itself is fun and engaging, fitting well with the heroic nature of the setting.</p>
