            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/summer-game-fest-2025-date-revealed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Geoff Keighley's summer gaming show Summer Game Fest has revealed when it will be returning this year, and although the date probably won't come as a surprise, it's nice to know when we'll need to tune in, as it were.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://x.com/summergamefest/status/1908965477185139060" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the official Summer Game Fest X account, the presentation will be returning on June 6th this year, likely kicking off the summer game showcase period in general. Presentations from the likes of Xbox, Ubisoft, and Devolver Digital will probably follow, if <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-xbox-showcase-2024-announcement" rel="nofollow">past years</a> are <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/devolver-digital-wont-be-at-e3-2023-studio-confirms" rel="nofollow">anything to go by</a>.</p>

<p>In the post, Keighley and Summer Game Fest promise to showcase "what's next in video games" during the show. It'll be held in person, but you'll be able to watch the whole event as a livestream on YouTube as well.</p>

More info about the event in general will also be revealed then.</p>

<p>So, what can we expect from Summer Game Fest this year? It'll be taking place a day after the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">upcoming launch of the Nintendo Switch 2</a>, so I'd expect to see more games that will be released <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-launch-lineup" rel="nofollow">during the launch window</a> of Nintendo's newest console.</p>

<p>Given that&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>was shown to have a 2025 release window during last week's Switch 2 Direct show, Summer Game Fest 2025 could well be the show during which we finally get a release date for Team Cherry's long-awaited Metroidvania.</p>

<p>Other than that, it's all to play for; expect new announcements and reveals from some of the world's biggest gaming studios, as well as dark horse contestants and indie gems alike.</p>

Put us out of our misery.</figcaption></figure><p>Whatever gets revealed during this year's Summer Game Fest show, you'll be able to watch it all unfold on June 6th. Specific times and more will likely be revealed in May.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Marathon Gameplay Reveal Set for Later This Week]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marathon-gameplay-reveal-date-announced</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marathon-gameplay-reveal-set-for-later-this-week.1157007/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marathon-gameplay-reveal-date-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bungie has announced that it will premiere the first&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>gameplay trailer later this week, following an ARG (alternate reality game) the shooter's community worked together to solve over the weekend.</p>

<p>As revealed in a press release,&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>'s first gameplay trailer will air on Saturday, April 12th at 1pm Eastern (that's 10am Pacific and around 6pm GMT). Bungie says the trailer will contain "gameplay, news, and updates" about <i>Marathon</i>.</p>

<p>Whether or not a release date, or even a release window, for the game will appear remains to be seen. Bungie's&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>reboot was first revealed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-resurrects-marathon-playstation-showcase" rel="nofollow">all the way back in May 2023</a>, and after explaining the basic concepts of the extraction shooter <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/learn-what-marathon-is-all-about-in-new-video-from-bungie" rel="nofollow">in a followup video</a>, Bungie said it would go dark for "an extended period" to develop the game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marathon-gameplay-reveal-date-cat.jpg?itok=wrCIF9JL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marathon-gameplay-reveal-date-cat.jpg?itok=3PYUD971 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bungie's&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>gameplay reveal confirmation was characteristically odd.</figcaption></figure><p>Setting up an alternate reality game for a&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>reveal feels particularly appropriate given the esoteric nature of the original games' storytelling, so perhaps this is a signal that the new&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>intends to keep at least some of the narrative direction of its 90s forebears.</p>

<p>Reportedly, the new&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>has been experiencing something of a troubled production.</p>

<p>Not only has Bungie been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/destiny-2-developer-bungie-suffers-layoffs-among-reported-delays-for-final-shape-and" rel="nofollow">hit by layoffs</a>&nbsp;on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-layoffs-200-employees" rel="nofollow">more than one occasion</a> over the past couple of years, but&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>director Christopher Barrett was reportedly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marathon-director-fired-report-bungie" rel="nofollow">fired from the game in spring 2024</a>, a decision Barrett subsequently challenged in a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-christopher-barrett-lawsuit-evidence" rel="nofollow">lawsuit aimed at Sony</a>.</p>

<p>Amidst this turmoil, Bungie has always maintained that work on&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>continues apace, and it looks like we're about to see what the studio has been up to for the last couple of years.</p>




<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>, it's an extraction shooter in which players must scour the planet of Tau Ceti IV for loot while "exploring the lost colony that once inhabited the surface".</p>

<p>The game is a pseudo-reboot of the original&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>series, which Bungie developed in the 90s. In many ways, that series is the precursor to&nbsp;<em>Halo</em>&nbsp;(or perhaps that should be the "forerunner"), as it offers similarly elliptical storytelling based around alien civilizations, AI, and other sci-fi concepts.</p>

<p>In any case, we'll get to see what Bungie has been working on when the first&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>gameplay trailer debuts on Saturday, April 12th. Stay tuned for more.</p>
