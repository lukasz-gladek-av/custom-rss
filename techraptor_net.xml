            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I'm a big fan of <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3579fb91-ffa9-4c99-a750-de9f92ba642f" href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a>,</em> and when I can't find the time to get a group of friends together, I'm always down to try different experiences that seek to recreate the experience. The latest of these is <em>Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked</em>. A tabletop experience where abilities are replaced by cards as you go dungeon crawling through the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9cb3f917-f831-4c81-8cb8-54e040b09040" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-forgotten-realms-heroes-of-faerun-and-adventures-in-faerun-review" rel="nofollow">Forgotten Realms</a>, but where does it successfully recreate the experience, and where does it falter?</p>

<p><em>Battlemarked </em>is, as the name would suggest, a new title in the <em>Demeo </em>series of turn-based RPGs that leans into recreating the feeling of moving miniatures around a board and taking on waves of enemies as you dive deeper into interesting dungeons. This time around, the game has received a <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> coat of paint with character classes reflecting those from the TTRPG, cards of popular abilities and spells, and the campaigns are now set in the Forgotten Realms.</p>

<p>At launch, the game will release with two Campaigns, <em>Embers of Chaos</em> and <em>Crown of Frost</em>. In my time previewing the game, I dove into Embers of Chaos. Here, the surrounding areas of Neverwinter are in turmoil, and stress is rising between groups of humans and elves as strange attacks are on the rise.</p>

While there's certainly a number of name drops and references, it's still very clear this is a combat and tactics forward game, and not as much into building any kind of vast story.</p>

<p>There's no worry with not creating that experience, it's just good to make sure you don't go in expecting that.</p>

<h2><em>Battlemarked </em>Gameplay Works Like A Board Game</h2>

<p><em>Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked </em>leans heavily into the turn-based combat and simplified action economy of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. Starting a new area, your party will appear on the edge of the map, and you'll move them one by one, each character being able to take two actions per turn.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/demeo-x-dungeons-dragons-battlemarked-character.jpg?itok=4oVOoAe2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/demeo-x-dungeons-dragons-battlemarked-character.jpg?itok=ywP2egoe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>You can move, make a simple attack, or use any of the different items or ability cards at your disposal. With <em>Battlemarked</em>, all of the cards have a <em>D&amp;D</em> theme with simple tweaks like Fire Arrows, as well as Lay on Hands and Blinkstrike. Your hand is limited to 10 cards, but as you take out enemies, you'll slowly earn more cards. It's pretty unlikely you'll ever run out.</p>

<p>This action economy did take me a bit to work out, because moving took an action, but using an attack ability could also move you and let you do an attack. Trying to keep the party together, but also dealing damage efficiently was a bit of a puzzle in itself (and one that I definitely lost a few times.)</p>

<p>When you are ready to attack an opponent, you'll be presented with a die to roll. While it is a D20, the dice you roll is made up of a skull for a miss, a single sword for hit, and two swords for a Critical hit. I'm someone who likes seeing high numbers on dice, so it wasn't as appealing to see the attack dice symbol-based, but it definitely speeds up the game. What was incredibly satisfying in the diorama world of the game is that rolling the dice is physics-based, letting you grab and throw the dice, and watching it bounce all over the terrain.</p>

For the most part, you'll be rolling the Attack Dice though.</p>

<p><em>Battlemarked </em>really has the visuals of <em>Dungons &amp; Dragons</em> down, as someone who plays (way too much) D&amp;D, though it felt like a lot of these systems were a bit too simplified for me. You have a good chance to hit, but you won't always, and your characters' attack stats are all static. It would have been awesome to see some varying damage stats to create more scenarios where you'd go for a risky attack to hope for a high damage roll to finish off an enemy.</p>

<h2>Randomization &amp; Replayability</h2>

<p>When combat is a bit too tough and you fall in battle, you'll get to restart from the beginning of the floor, but the enemies present and their locations will be randomized. This is a fun addition, meaning that no matter how much the environment you move through might be the same, the progression of combat will always be different.</p>

Do you prefer that your Paladin takes less damage on low health, or that there is less chance for Poison damage?</p>

<h2><em>Battlemarked </em>Offers A <em>D&amp;D</em>-lite Combat Experience</h2>

<p>From my time with <em>Battlemarked </em>so far, I've enjoyed the story as it has been laid out, and the visual experience perfectly demonstrates a high-quality game with terrain and miniatures.</p>

<p>I do wish that the combat wasn't so dialed back, but there is a lot of replayability in the layout of enemies in a dungeon and how you best use the cards available to you. With how every part of the game is static numbers and grid-based movement, even when not in active combat, the experience honestly felt closer to my recent experiences with HeroQuest.</p>

<p>If you're interested in getting online with friends and throwing some dice in a strategic setting,&nbsp;<em>Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked</em> is a fun experience, even more so with the different references that you'll run into. If the simplified combat or very light storytelling isn't for you, then you might need to seek your adventure elsewhere.</p>
