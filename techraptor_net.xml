            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company and DeNA have announced a brand new themed booster pack expansion for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>, and it's bringing a ton of new cards for you to collect next week.</p>

<p>Arriving on August 28th,&nbsp;<em>Secluded Springs</em>, like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-eevee-grove" rel="nofollow">Eevee Grove</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-expansion-shining-revelry" rel="nofollow">Shining Revelry</a>&nbsp;</em>before it, is a themed booster pack rather than a mainline expansion (like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-wisdom-of-sea-and-sky-expansion" rel="nofollow"><em>Wisdom of Sea and Sky</em></a>), which effectively means that it's bringing fewer cards and no seismic gameplay changes to&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>.</p>

<p>That doesn't mean you can't expect lots of new cards, though, and true to form,&nbsp;<em>Secluded Springs&nbsp;</em>will bring brand new digital goodies for you, including a gorgeous new Suicune ex card, a new full-art Milotic, and more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-secluded-springs-suicune.jpg?itok=8Mj89KIM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-secluded-springs-suicune.jpg?itok=taH36410 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A new Suicune ex card is just one of the cards that awaits you in&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Secluded Springs&nbsp;</em>expansion.</figcaption></figure><p>You can also look forward to new cards depicting the likes of Entei and Raikou, as well as Mantyke, Slowking, and other 'mons you might find around a hot spring area. By the looks of the art that's been shown for the expansion so far, it's all lovely high-quality stuff, too.</p>

<p>Of course, there's no guarantee that the art for these cards won't turn out to have been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-ho-oh-production-issue-plagiarism" rel="nofollow">inadvertently stolen from fanart pieces</a>, but at least we can probably expect The Pokemon Company to act quickly if that does turn out to be the case.</p>

<p>Just in case you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>, it's a mobile version of the popular&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG&nbsp;</em>card game that simplifies combat rules and renders your collection digitally rather than physically.</p>

<p>It's got plenty of cards from the main game to collect, as well as a number of unique art pieces you can only find within&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>itself, and hey, it's free to play, so you may as well check it out, right?</p>




<p><em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>is available to play now on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.pokemon.pokemontcgp&amp;hl=en_GB" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pok%C3%A9mon-tcg-pocket/id6479970832" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">iOS</a>, and its&nbsp;<em>Secluded Springs&nbsp;</em>themed booster pack launches on August 28th.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Escape from Tarkov 1.0 Release Date Set for November]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/escape-from-tarkov-10-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-tarkov-1-0-release-date-set-for-november.1278186/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Escape from Tarkov&nbsp;</em>developer and publisher Battlestate Games has announced that the game's 1.0 release finally has a release date, and it's just around the corner.</p>

<p>In a new trailer titled "Prepare for Escape" (which is pretty brief and doesn't feature too much in the way of gameplay footage), a man can be seen typing code on a screen, interspersed with footage of soldiers in camo gear engaging in firefights.</p>

<p>Eventually, amidst blaring alarms, the man types a single date on the screen: November 15th. Technically speaking, the trailer doesn't specifically say that this is&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov</em>'s 1.0 release date, but it's hard to imagine what else could warrant this kind of fanfare.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/escape-from-tarkov-1.0-release-date-snow.jpg?itok=VubJzyJu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/escape-from-tarkov-1.0-release-date-snow.jpg?itok=jTBCsqBa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Escape from Tarkov&nbsp;</em>is finally getting a 1.0 release later this year.</figcaption></figure><p>Battlestate first teased a 1.0 release for&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov&nbsp;</em>this year <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/escape-from-tarkov-10-2025-steam-confirmed" rel="nofollow">back in April</a>, and the studio confirmed that the game will be coming to Steam then as well, although whether that'll happen alongside the 1.0 launch remains to be seen.</p>

<p><em>Escape from Tarkov&nbsp;</em>was first released in closed beta back in 2017, and since then, it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/escape-from-tarkov-patch-0-16-0-0" rel="nofollow">undergone</a> a number of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/escape-from-tarkov-patch-01400-brings-new-location-for-beginners-achievements-weapons" rel="nofollow">changes</a> thanks to consistent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/escape-from-tarkov-patch-0135" rel="nofollow">updates</a> (and progress wipes to go along with them, of course).</p>

<p>The game has also spawned a spinoff in the form of <i>Escape from Tarkov: Arena</i>, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/escape-from-tarkov-arena-shows-its-fps-gameplay-in-new-trailer" rel="nofollow">more traditional FPS</a> that forgoes&nbsp;<em>Tarkov</em>'s wide-open areas and PvPvE gameplay for more straightforward player-versus-player deathmatch engagements.</p>

<p>If you wish, you can check out the new Preapre for Escape trailer right here. It doesn't give too much away other than the date, but it's a fun little creation on Battlestate's part regardless.</p>




<p><em>Escape from Tarkov&nbsp;</em>is, as far as we know, due to launch in full on November 15th this year. If you want to check it out ahead of that date, you can <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pick up its beta right now on PC</a>. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Bungie CEO Pete Parsons Steps Down After Over 20 Years]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-pete-parsons-steps-down</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bungie-ceo-pete-parsons-steps-down-after-over-20-years.1278129/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bungie CEO Pete Parsons has announced he's stepping down after over 20 years with the company, and he'll be handing his responsibilities over to another long-time Bungie staffer.</p>

<p>In an announcement on the official Bungie <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/passing_the_torch" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, Parsons says he's "decided to pass the torch" and that now is the "right time for a new beginning", but he doesn't elaborate on his reasons for leaving any further than that.</p>

<p>Parsons will be handing his CEO role over to Justin Truman, who previously served as&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>'s General Manager and the chief development officer of Bungie as a whole. It sounds as though the transition will be instantaneous, since no other date is given.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/destiny-2-bungie-pete-parsons-stepping-down.jpg?itok=XO3gZ-KA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/destiny-2-bungie-pete-parsons-stepping-down.jpg?itok=cEHOpJW5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bungie CEO Pete Parsons is vacating his role after over 20 years with the studio.</figcaption></figure><p>Truman begins his own message by reminding fans of his credentials; he worked as a coder for the original&nbsp;<em>Destiny&nbsp;</em>and served as a designer on&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>, crafting many systems for the game (including the endgame mechanisms, which he says he got "terribly wrong" at launch).</p>

<p>He's also been helping Bungie to develop&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>, so it's fair to say he's been across everything the studio has worked on for the last ten years or so. It's easy to see why Parsons picked Truman for a successor.</p>

<p>Truman inherits a Bungie that is, to put it charitably, struggling somewhat.&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>'s rollout isn't exactly going smoothly; the game was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marathon-release-date-gameplay-revealed" rel="nofollow">due to launch in September</a>, but was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shocking-no-one-bungies-marathon-delayed" rel="nofollow">delayed to an unspecified point in the future</a> following lackluster feedback from the first closed alpha test.</p>

<p>The extraction shooter also found itself in hot water back in May, when it was revealed that artwork used in the game had been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-marathon-art-stolen" rel="nofollow">taken from an online artist</a> without permission or compensation (which, incidentally, is <a href="https://x.com/elementj21/status/1671281580831297536" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">not the first time</a> Bungie has been caught doing something like this).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marathon-bungie-pete-parsons-stepping-down.jpg?itok=YzZcmiRr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marathon-bungie-pete-parsons-stepping-down.jpg?itok=icAyTbcK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>has an uphill battle ahead of it.</figcaption></figure><p>That's all in addition to the fact that the latest&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2&nbsp;</em>expansion,&nbsp;<em>The Edge of Fate</em>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3186490/Destiny_2_The_Edge_of_Fate/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">hasn't exactly been rapturously received</a>, so it looks like Truman has his work cut out if he wants to turn Bungie's fortunes around. We'll have to wait and see whether he achieves that goal.</p>
