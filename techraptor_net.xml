            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, the <em>Fighting Fantasy</em> Set 2 Kickstarter campaign went live. The campaign aims to reprint five more of the iconic solo adventuring book series. It has already reached its initial funding goal.</p>

<h2>The <em>Fighting Fantasy</em> Set 2 Kickstarter Campaign</h2>

<p>As the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sjgames/fighting-fantasy-solo-adventure-gamebooks-back-in-print" rel="nofollow">campaign page</a> states, the <em>Fighting Fantasy</em> Set 2 Kickstarter goal is to release updated versions of books 6-10 in the <em>Fighting Fantasy</em> series. This campaign is part of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/fighting-fantasy-solo-adventure-rpg-series-returns-to-us-through-steve-jackson-games" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">publishing agreement</a> signed by series co-creators Sir Ian Livingstone and Steve Jackson with Steve Jackson games to reprint the books in the United States.</p>

<p>But <em>Fighting Fantasy</em> Set 2 isn't just a reprint of the original 1980s books. The books will still feature the original artwork, but the formatting has been updated and the text size has been increased for easy reading. Finally, each book has a unified design, complete with numbered spines. Each book is around 224-384 pages and is approximately&nbsp;5.0625" x 7.8125", emulating the UK's B-format size.</p>

<p>The pledge tiers for <em>Fighting Fantasy</em> Set 2 are small and straightforward. If you want a single book from Set 2, it will cost you $15. If you want the full five-book set, that is $60. For the most pristine version, there is the slipcase set for $80. The campaign also includes several add-ons including books from <em>Fighting Fantasy</em> Set 1, and similar books from other series like <em>Choose Cthulhu</em>, and <em>The Fantasy Trip</em>.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, the <em>Fighting Fantasy</em> Set 2 Kickstarter campaign has raised&nbsp;<span><span>$106,836, more than four times its initial funding goal of $25,000. The campaign ends December 31 and books are expected to ship on July 2026.</span></span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Cyberpunk 2077 Sales Now at 35m as Sequel Development Ramps Up]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-2077-sales-35m-sequel-work</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>CD Projekt Red has revealed that its open-world action RPG&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>has hit a new sales milestone, and that work on the sequel is ramping up in earnest.</p>

<p>As part of its latest Q3 financial results presentation, the Polish studio says that&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>sales have now passed 35 million, a figure that includes standalone sales and those racked up as part of the Ultimate Edition bundle (which includes the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-release-date-revealed" rel="nofollow"><em>Phantom Liberty&nbsp;</em>expansion</a>).</p>

<p>The new figure means that&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>has sold another five million copies <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-2077-sales-witcher-production" rel="nofollow">since November last year</a>, which is a pretty impressive achievement for a game that was released five years ago (although CD Projekt Red clearly very much considers the game a going concern).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cyberpunk-2077-sales-35m-bike.jpg?itok=usilwnmp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cyberpunk-2077-sales-35m-bike.jpg?itok=pYos0TMt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>has hit 35 million sales, and it's still going strong.</figcaption></figure><p>The presentation also reveals that CD Projekt Red has allocated another 19 staffers to work on&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2&nbsp;</em>since July this year, and that a number of new staff have been added in areas like localization and motion capture across the company as well.</p>

<p>Work on the new&nbsp;<em>Witcher&nbsp;</em>game also continues in earnest, although only three more developers have been hired to work on that project since July. It's likely to be a while before we hear more about&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/witcher-4-official-reveal" rel="nofollow"><em>The Witcher 4</em></a>, although whether that or&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2&nbsp;</em>will be officially unveiled first remains to be seen.</p>

<p>Across the company, sales are up when compared to the same period last year, mainly driven by increased sales of&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>; franchise sales for&nbsp;<em>The Witcher&nbsp;</em>have fallen since then, although the release of the Switch 2, along with its&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>port, probably <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-third-party-game-launch-sales-report" rel="nofollow">helped in that area</a>.</p>

<p>Profits are up as well, and when looking at the year to date as a whole, CD Projekt Red's numbers are looking pretty healthy. Whether the company can sustain that health remains to be seen, however, especially with no new games imminently on the horizon.</p>




<p>We'll probably have to wait a while for new info about&nbsp;<em>The Witcher 4&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2</em>, but in the meantime, you can check out CD Projekt's full financial presentation for the third quarter of its fiscal year <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/pl/wp-content/uploads-pl/2025/11/prezentacja-wynikowa-q3-2025-en.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Almost Twenty Years On, Beyond Good and Evil 2 Is Still in Development as New Job Listings Emerge]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/beyond-good-and-evil-2-new-job-postings</link>
            <guid>1365742</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has posted several new job listings for&nbsp;<em>Beyond Good and Evil 2</em>, which means that almost twenty years after its original announcement, the long-awaited action-adventure game is still in development, although probably no closer to release.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://frvr.com/blog/ubisoft-is-still-working-on-beyond-good-and-evil-2-as-new-job-listings-pop-up-after-years-of-development-hell/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">FRVR</a>, new job listings on the Ubisoft <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/company/careers/search?query=beyond%2520good%2520and%2520evil%25202" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>&nbsp;are calling for a lead quest designer, a VFX artist, and a technical lead network programmer, among others, to work on the company's beleaguered sequel.</p>

<p>According to the listings,&nbsp;<em>Beyond Good and Evil 2&nbsp;</em>is still being built in the Voyager engine, which, as far as we know, hasn't yet been used for any other Ubisoft games. It was developed as a proprietary engine for use within&nbsp;<em>Beyond Good and Evil 2&nbsp;</em>itself.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/beyond-good-and-evil-2-job-listings-gameplay.jpg?itok=0x7f52Ga 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/beyond-good-and-evil-2-job-listings-gameplay.jpg?itok=QL_oWnKG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Beyond Good and Evil 2&nbsp;</em>is still in development...somehow.</figcaption></figure><p>The last time Ubisoft provided an update on&nbsp;<em>Beyond Good and Evil 2&nbsp;</em>was in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/beyond-good-and-evil-2-gets-new-creative-director" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">October last year</a>, when a new creative lead, Fawzi Mesmar, stepped in to replace Emile Morel, who sadly passed away in 2023 of unknown causes.</p>

<p>It's been a very long and very strange journey for&nbsp;<em>Beyond Good and Evil 2&nbsp;</em>thus far. The project was originally announced during E3 in 2008, but subsequently underwent a lengthy period of radio silence before being <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-e3-2017-beyond-good-and-evil-2" rel="nofollow">reintroduced in 2017</a>.</p>

<p>Ubisoft subsequently drip-fed more information about the game in the ensuing years, including info about its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/beyond-good-and-evil-2-devs-show-off-ships-staff-combat" rel="nofollow">combat</a>, details about its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/beyond-good-and-evil-2-livestream-shares-new-world-details" rel="nofollow">world</a>, and confirmation that since it had seamless multiplayer elements, the game would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/beyond-good-and-evil-2-q-reveals-online-connection-required-for-game" rel="nofollow">require an online connection</a> to play.</p>

<p>Since then, however, things have been very quiet on the&nbsp;<em>Beyond Good and Evil 2&nbsp;</em>front; original lead Michel Ancel departed not only the project, but video games as a whole <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/beyond-good-and-evil-2-lead-michel-ancel-leaves-video-games" rel="nofollow">back in 2020</a>, although Ubisoft said at the time that he hadn't been "directly involved" with the game for some time upon his departure.</p>




<p>Whether these job listings amount to a new announcement anytime soon remains to be seen, but for now, there's no indication that Ubisoft is even remotely ready to re-re-re-announce&nbsp;<em>Beyond Good and Evil 2</em>. Stay tuned for more.</p>
