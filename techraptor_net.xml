            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wwe-2k25-release-date-revealed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>2K has announced the&nbsp;<em>WWE 2K25&nbsp;</em>release date, as well as who'll be on the wrestling sim's cover and what kind of new gameplay improvements you can expect.</p>

<p>Per a new trailer,&nbsp;<em>WWE 2K25&nbsp;</em>will officially release across PC and consoles (including last-gen machines, intriguingly enough) on March 14th, and if you pick up one of the game's two special editions, you can play it a week early.</p>

<p>The cover star is none other than "Original Tribal Chief" Roman Reigns. After&nbsp;<em>WWE 2K24</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wwe-2k24-announced" rel="nofollow">WrestleMania Showcase focus</a>, the new game's Showcase mode will instead revolve around Reigns and the extended Anoa'i wrestling family, which also includes The Rock, Rikishi, and Jacob Fatu, among others.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wwe-2k25-release-date-showcase.jpg?itok=5lOFox96 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wwe-2k25-release-date-showcase.jpg?itok=GDqDmiDq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>WWE 2K25</em>'s cover star is Roman Reigns, and he's also heavily involved in the game's Showcase mode.</figcaption></figure><p>The Showcase mode will be titled The Bloodline's Dynasty, and it'll let you relive "historic showdowns" involving the extended Anoa'i family or "flip the script and change the outcome of select match-ups".</p>

<p><em>WWE 2K25&nbsp;</em>will also introduce The Island, a hub featuring "a series of areas built around different WWE themes" in which you'll try to impress Reigns by completing a number of different challenges and tasks.</p>

<p>2K is boasting that&nbsp;<em>WWE 2K25&nbsp;</em>will feature the largest roster of any&nbsp;<em>WWE 2K&nbsp;</em>game to date; it'll feature over 300 wrestlers spanning multiple generations of WWE history, including the likes of Rey Mysterio, Chyna, and Bret "Hitman" Hart, plus more.</p>

<p>Of course, you can also look forward to lots of new match types in&nbsp;<em>WWE 2K25</em>, including intergender wrestling for the first time in the series' history, as well as new Underground Matches, the return of Chain Wrestling, and Bloodline Rules Matches.</p>




<p>Three different versions of the game will be available: <a href="https://wwe.2k.com/2k25/buy/?release=wwe-2k25-standard-edition" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Standard</a>, <a href="https://wwe.2k.com/2k25/buy/?release=wwe-2k25-deadman-edition" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Deadman</a>, and <a href="https://wwe.2k.com/2k25/buy/?release=wwe-2k25-the-bloodline-edition" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bloodline</a>.</p>

<p>The Standard version launches on March 14th, and it'll also get you cross-gen access, which is becoming rarer and rarer these days. Meanwhile, Deadman and Bloodline both pack in extra goodies and launch a week early.</p>

<p><em>WWE 2K25&nbsp;</em>comes out on March 14th (or March 7th, depending on your edition) on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2878960/WWE_2K25/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP1001-PPSA22696_00-WWE2K25000000000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/wwe-2k25-standard-edition/9P6NQMP5LXD6/0017" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-40k-roleplay-wrath-and-glory-stater-set-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><i>A simple job they told me. Travel in luxury aboard the Herald Varonius as an agent of the rogue trader Jakel Varonius and glory will await you. I should have known things are never that easy. It went sour pretty quickly onboard, and throne knowns what horrors and schemes await me in the Gilead System. Still, the Emperor knows I'm not in this for the quiet life.</i></p>

<p>We've been fans of Cubicle 7's <em>Warhammer</em> roleplaying games for a while, and you can read our review of the <em>Age of Sigmar&nbsp;Soulbound</em>&nbsp;starter set&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/age-of-sigmar-soulbound-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplaying Game</em> starter set&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-fantasy-roleplay-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-wrath-and-glory-starter-set-1.jpg?itok=_3mXzx0r 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-wrath-and-glory-starter-set-1.jpg?itok=aK27Opmu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Wrath and Glory </em>Starter Set includes 2 books for the GM to run the adventure.</figcaption></figure><h2>For The Emperor!</h2>

<p>Similar to Cubicle 7s's <em>Warhammer</em> fantasy roleplaying systems, their sci-fi <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> (or <em>40K </em>for short) roleplaying systems also have 2 options, with different mechanics and styles. The <em>Wrath and Glory</em> system that we're looking at here, uses 6-sided dice, similar to the tabletop wargaming system, and is much more combat-focused. Whereas <em>Imperium Maledictum</em> (for which we will review the starter set for next month when it releases), uses a D100 system, similar to that of the <em>WFRP </em>system that Cubicle 7 also produces, and is much more focused on investigation and social encounters.</p>

<p>It's also worth noting that this starter set is slightly different from that released in 2018 by&nbsp;Ulisses Spiele, which we <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/wrath-and-glory-starter-set-review-warhammer-40k-roleplaying" rel="nofollow">reviewed here</a>. With Cubicle 7 taking on the system, they've updated the books (this version includes a completely new adventure) and changed some of the components inside, all for the better.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-wrath-and-glory-starter-set-3.jpg?itok=MP-uNWZj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-wrath-and-glory-starter-set-3.jpg?itok=nBRGGbyu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>While still of a high quality, the&nbsp;<em>Wrath and Glory </em>Starter Set components don't feel as polished as the other <em>Warhammer</em> roleplaying starter sets Cubicle 7 offer.</figcaption></figure><h2>Tools Of The Faithful</h2>

<p>Like the other 2 Cubicle 7 roleplaying starter sets we've covered, <em>Wrath and Glory</em> contains all the components for 6 players plus a Games Master to play through their first adventure and beyond. Each player gets a pre-generated character sheet, which we'll go into more detail below, along with some quick reference sheets for the rules and a map of the system.</p>

<p>The Games Master, who runs the adventure, gets 2 books, the&nbsp;Traitor’s Hymn, the core adventure and rules tutorial for <em>Wrath and Glory,</em> and&nbsp;The Varonius Flotilla, a sourcebook full of details of characters the players might meet, along with ships and local politics, which can be used to either flesh out the included adventure, or create your own to expand beyond the Traitor's Hymn.</p>

<p>The maps, rules references sheets and box don't feel as polished as the other starter sets that Cubicle 7 offer. The sheets are single-sided and there's no rules reference for the GM on the inside of the box. It's not a huge deal, but compared to the others sets, it does feel like a missed opportunity.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-wrath-and-glory-starter-set-2.jpg?itok=Ffge1wna 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-wrath-and-glory-starter-set-2.jpg?itok=9BI2fdII 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Wrath and Glory </em>Starter Set includes an incredible spread of pre-generated characters that create fantastic party tension with their different loyalties.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Faithfull and Fallen&nbsp;</h2>

<p>The<em> Wrath and Glory</em> starter set includes 6 pre-generated characters, and similarly to the <em>WFRP</em> and <em>Soulbound</em> starters, each character comes with a fold-out sheet full of background details to flesh out the character beyond the stats. Also similarly to the other starters, it has a great spread of characters to introduce players to the setting.</p>

<p>Players can choose from a Rogue Trader, who are half merchant half adventurer, a Sanctioned Psyker, a magic user approved by the Imperium, a Sister of Battle, a warrior devout to the Imperium's religious creed, a Skitarius, a heavily augmented human, a Space Marine Scout, a new recruit to the superhuman soldiers of the Adeptus Astartes, and an Aeldari Ranger, a space-elf sniper.</p>

<p>The mix creates an interesting dynamic within the group, and while they may be loyal to each other, they all have higher goals or loyalties. The Rogue Trader is ultimately only out for themselves, the holier than thou Battle Sister would burn everyone she suspected of treachery, the Skitarius is only loyal to the Machine Cult, similar to the indoctrinated Space Marine who would choose their Chapter over anything, and everyone suspects the alien.</p>

<p>I said the same things in my review of the Cubicle 7 <em>Warhammer</em> fantasy starter set reviews, about the Games Master needing to do some prep (which is standard for all GMs), but here it is a little simpler as the game mechanics are a lot more straight-forward (at least in the starter set, there's a lot of extra awesome depth in the full rules). This means that once the GM has a handle on the rules, they can focus on the adventure. They do have to have some ideas ready on the fly for the Wrath dice, which we discuss below, but that's an essential skill for being a good GM anyway.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-wrath-and-glory-starter-set-4.jpg?itok=UuN2UiJj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-wrath-and-glory-starter-set-4.jpg?itok=4TrAepPB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Wrath and Glory </em>Starter Set custom dice help to keep a simple system even faster to focus on the action. Watch out for the 1 on the red dice though!</figcaption></figure><h2>How To Wage War In The Name Of The Emperor</h2>

<p>The <em>Wrath and Glory</em> system uses 6-sided dice (D6s), with each result of a 4+ being a success (or icon in <em>W&amp;G</em> terms). A roll of 6 counts as 2 icons, and the custom dice included in the <em>Wrath and Glory</em> starter set show this clearly, with skull icons for the 4 and 5, and a skull with a halo for the 6.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This system keeps the game flowing fast, as the Games Master will call out a test target, 3 is standard, and the attribute and skill required for the test. For example, if you're trying to push over something heavy, it would be an Athletics - Strength skill, but if you're trying to jump over a series of obstacles, it would be an Athletics - Agility test. Once the test and difficulty is called, the player rolls a number of D6s equal to the combined attribute and skill they have and simply need to roll a number of icons equal to or above that.</p>

<p>When players collect their dice, they identify one as the Wrath die (the starter set includes a custom red die). This dice has a bonus effect of adding a complication to the roll (success or not) if a 1 is rolled, or the group gains a point of glory or it counts as a critical hit if it shows a 6. I absolutely love this little detail, which, for such a simple mechanic, really adds depth to the rolls, along with keeping players humble. Even when rolling 20 dice for a test requiring 3 icons, that little Wrath dice can still spoil your day with a complication when you succeed.</p>

<h2>Wrath and Glory Starter Set Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>The <em>Wrath and Glory</em> starter set is a great introduction to roleplaying in the <em>Warhammer 40K</em> setting. The adventure has both intrigue and combat, showing the strength of the system in both areas and really allows you to get behind blasting the enemies of the Emperor. The characters are all fantastic, and if the players have a little background knowledge of the setting, can really get into the depths of the suspicions between each of them. If everyone is coming in cold to the setting, the character sheets do a great job of bringing you in, and telling you who you like and don't. The starter set mechanics are simple enough that you don't need to spend ages working out results, allowing you to focus on the combat, and are a great introduction and stepping stone to the full system.&nbsp;The Varonius Flotilla book allows you to expand well beyond the introductory adventure and gives you a few sessions' worth of material for the GM to work with if you want to test the system more before investing further.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dauntless-developer-phoenix-labs-lays-off-the-majority-of-the-studio.1093692/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dauntless-developer-phoenix-labs-more-layoffs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm&nbsp;</em>developer Phoenix Labs has laid off the majority of its remaining employees as part of what it describes as "unfortunate but necessary changes to our operations".</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/phoenix-labs_activity-7289705935696969728-PaIL/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on LinkedIn, the studio says the layoffs were a "tough decision" and that it "recognize[s] and deeply appreciate[s] the contributions of every individual impacted". The studio stops short of saying exactly how many employees will be affected by these layoffs.</p>

<p>If you're wondering what this might mean for&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>(or, indeed, for cozy sim&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm</em>), Phoenix Labs says it'll share more on its plans for these games "in the coming weeks".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/phoenix-labs-dauntless-layoffs-ice-monster.jpg?itok=VqegnAn- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/phoenix-labs-dauntless-layoffs-ice-monster.jpg?itok=P2RJgd2v 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dauntless</em>' Phoenix Labs has laid off the majority of its remaining staff.</figcaption></figure><p>Beyond the rather vague "unfortunate but necessary changes", Phoenix Labs doesn't offer any kind of reason as to why this decision has been made.</p>

<p>However, the studio has come in for criticism recently regarding the most recent major&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>update, otherwise known as Awakening.</p>

<p>The update has proven unpopular with players, resulting in the game hitting an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/331370/Dauntless/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Overwhelmingly Negative rating on Steam</a>, where it was released on the same day as the Awakening update landed.</p>

<p>Criticism included the update's changes to monetization, progression, and other gameplay systems, with some laying the blame at the feet of Phoenix Labs' owner Forte Labs, a blockchain-focused company that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/what-happens-when-a-secretive-blockchain-company-buys-your-game-studio" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">purchased</a> the studio from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dauntless-developer-phoenix-labs-acquired-by-garena" rel="nofollow">former owner Garena</a> (from which Forte itself spun off) in 2023.</p>




<p>The changes to <em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>proved unpopular enough to prompt Phoenix Labs to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dauntless-awakening-update-apology" rel="nofollow">issue an apology</a> and promise to make "immediate adjustments" back in December, but if the game's current Steam <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/331370/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">player count</a> (at time of writing) is anything to go by, those changes haven't made much of a difference.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that even if Phoenix Labs' layoffs are directly related to&nbsp;<em>Dauntless</em>' recent performance, the studio is far from alone in laying off employees; these layoffs are taking place against the backdrop of a much wider wave of staff cuts, project cancellations, and studio closures.</p>

<p>Other studios hit in recent months include&nbsp;<em>Unknown 9: Awakening&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unknown-9-awakening-layoffs-cancellation-reflector" rel="nofollow">Reflector Entertainment</a>, tech giant <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-layoffs-january-2025" rel="nofollow">Microsoft</a>, and (reportedly)&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&nbsp;</em>outfit <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rocksteady-layoffs-end-of-2024" rel="nofollow">Rocksteady</a>, among many others.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/orcs-must-die-deathtrap-roadmap<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Robot Entertainment has revealed the post-launch&nbsp;<em>Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap&nbsp;</em>roadmap, and it includes a new War Mage, a new enemy type, and much more.</p>

<p>The game, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/orcs-must-die-deathtrap-announcement" rel="nofollow">announced last year</a>, launched for PC and Xbox Series X|S today, but Robot Entertainment isn't resting on its laurels. The developer took to Steam earlier today to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2273980/view/533214336538116486" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">share its vision</a> for where&nbsp;<em>Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap&nbsp;</em>will go in the future.</p>

<p>In the post, Robot Entertainment organizes forthcoming updates into two categories: In the Works and Coming "Soon", and "The Road Ahead". It's probably not too difficult to guess what each category represents.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/orcs-must-die-deathtrap-roadmap-skeletons.jpg?itok=Mhu4OMCb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/orcs-must-die-deathtrap-roadmap-skeletons.jpg?itok=DGfyTDK3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap&nbsp;</em>has barely been out a few hours, but its developer has already shared the game's post-launch plans.</figcaption></figure><p>In the former category, Robot Entertainment promises a new War Mage in the form of Master Gabriella, who's appeared in previous&nbsp;<em>Orcs Must Die!&nbsp;</em>games as well. She'll have "an exciting kit of tricks" and will reintroduce Arcane magic into the game.</p>

<p>Next up, the Resort Canal map will ask you to defend two rifts simultaneously, and it'll take place in the game's Coastal biome. You can also look forward to a new Unstable Orc enemy, which takes a great deal of punishment before it dies to compensate for its slow movement.</p>

<p>Rounding out the Coming Soon category are an Alchemy lab, which will offer you buffs for each run, and a new Gnome Balloonist Sentinel, which will "add more ceiling space for traps".</p>

<p>As for the road ahead, Robot Entertainment says it plans to support&nbsp;<em>Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap&nbsp;</em>"for as long as possible", and that the studio has "ideas for a wide variety of content and features".</p>




<p><em>Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap&nbsp;</em>is the latest game in the&nbsp;<em>Orcs Must Die!&nbsp;</em>series, combining the franchise's traditional action-tower defense hybrid gameplay with a new roguelite-inspired approach and "deeper progression systems".</p>

<p>You can grab the game right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2273980/Orcs_Must_Die_Deathtrap/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/orcs-must-die-deathtrap/9p0302f6v9vt" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>
