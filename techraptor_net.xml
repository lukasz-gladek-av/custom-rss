            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Amazon has revealed more cast members for the upcoming <em>Tomb Raider </em>TV show, and there are more than a few legendary faces joining the series, including celebrated British actors like Jason Isaacs and Bill Paterson.</p><p>As revealed <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/entertainment/tomb-raider-prime-video-phoebe-waller-bridge-sophie-turner" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">by Amazon</a>, the show will include iconic <em>Tomb Raider </em>characters like Lara Croft's butler Winston, her uncle Atlas DeMornay (who you can meet as part of the so-called <em>Survivor Trilogy</em>), and Zip, who made his debut as part of the <em>Legend </em>sub-series.</p><p>DeMornay will be portrayed by Jason Isaacs, best known for roles like Lucius Malfoy in the <em>Harry Potter </em>movies and General Zhukov in <em>The Death of Stalin</em>. Winston, meanwhile, will be played by Bill Paterson, who you may know as <em>House of the Dragon</em>'s Lyman Beesbury or the father in <em>Fleabag</em>.</p><figure role="group">

<p>They're joined by screen legend Sigourney Weaver, who will be portraying "mysterious, high-flying woman" Evelyn Wallis, ostensibly a new character created for the show. Since Weaver is playing her, though, you can expect her to be a major player, and I'd be shocked if she wasn't the main antagonist of the series.</p><p>Another British icon joining <em>Tomb Raider </em>is Celia Imrie, who will play the British Museum's "Head of Advancement" Francine. She, according to Amazon, is "focused solely on raising funds and glasses of champagne".</p><p>Sadly, we still don't have a release date for the <em>Tomb Raider </em>TV show, but we do know it'll be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tomb-raider-live-action-series" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e3656d82-1a10-44f8-b35b-c2f90b2993db" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">headed up by <em>Fleabag</em>'s Phoebe Waller-Bridge</a> and that <em>Game of Thrones </em>star Sophie Turner <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazon-tomb-raider-lara-croft" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="8353268c-a5b7-45ad-b3ba-18b83eaad069" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">will be portraying Lara Croft</a>. Production for the show will begin on January 19th.</p><p>It's been all go in the world of <em>Tomb Raider </em>recently; not only is the show moving ahead at full pelt, but two - yes, two - new <em>Tomb Raider </em>games were announced during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-game-awards-2025-recap" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7f71e644-2289-45c0-a1c9-dc56c3797e8a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">this year's Game Awards</a>. One's a remake of the original <em>Tomb Raider</em> and the other is an all-new title.</p>
<p>We'll likely get more information about the <em>Tomb Raider </em>TV show, including a release date, later this year, and more details about the two aforementioned games will probably be forthcoming as well. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
