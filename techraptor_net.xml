            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/shadow-labyrinth-preview-pax-east-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At PAX East 2025, we had the chance to play through a <em>Shadow Labyrinth </em>preview build while chatting with Bandai Namco Senior <em>Pac-Man</em> Brand Manager Knoah Piasek about this new experience: a game that combines fast-paced action gameplay with classic <em>Pac-Man</em> mechanics.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Brilliantly designed with crisp gameplay, <em>Shadow Labyrinth</em> is an exciting new metroidvania that captivated me with its impressive enemy design and challenging boss battles. After getting killed a few times, its&nbsp;mechanics clicked and I found myself taking on more difficult enemies and defeating bosses many times my size.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Shadow Labyrinth </em>is definitely a game worth looking forward to – read more on our thoughts in our <em>Shadow Labyrinth</em> preview!&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Shadow Labyrinth's</em>&nbsp;Gameplay - A Three-Pronged Approach&nbsp;</h2>

<p>At its core, <em>Shadow Labyrinth</em> is a metroidvania that splits its gameplay into three unique aspects. The majority of the time, the player will be the Swordsman, jumping and slashing their way through the environments and using a grappling hook to get some verticality.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To climb on walls, The Swordsman can turn into Pac-Man on certain surfaces, adding another dimension to traversing the environment. In true <em>Pac-Man</em> fashion, you're also able to consume upgrades as you move along. This also leads into some of the trickier puzzle sections, requiring you to quickly jump from surface to surface while avoiding blades and other obstacles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The third and final form is Gaia, a powerful and huge transformation that gives you an edge against tough boss battles. The Gaia form can only be held for a limited time, so use it wisely.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"That's the brute-force form," Piasek said. "Great for boss battles, but there are some environmental puzzles where Gaia is helpful, too. Areas with breakable walls you can blast through."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Exploring the maze-like worlds and switching between each form will allow players to find upgrades like new health tanks and gain the resources required to upgrade attacks and weapons. I was able to upgrade the damage on my sword during my <em>Shadow Labyrinth </em>preview, making my first boss encounter much more manageable.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Meet the Unique &amp; Challenging <em>Shadow Labyrinth</em> Bosses</h2>

<p><em>Shadow Labyrinth</em>'s boss battles felt reminiscent of battles I encountered while playing&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/metroid-dread" rel="nofollow"><em>Metroid Dread</em></a> several years ago. Going up against a dinosaur-looking monster many times my size, with capabilities you're not yet familiar with, was an absolute blast that kept me on my toes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I had to use all three forms to battle this boss – slashing at him with my sword, climbing the walls as Pac-Man to avoid massive energy blasts, and transforming into Gaia to deal as much damage as possible once he was stunned. Though I nearly died on my attempt, I was able to take this boss down. It also helped that Piasek was by my side helping to instruct me on when to dodge and attack.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For fans of metroidvania-style games with unique boss battles that test your reflexes to the limit, <em>Shadow Labyrinth </em>has plenty to offer in this department, and this mechanic is just one of the many reasons why I'm looking forward to the <em>Shadow Labyrinth</em> release date later this summer.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Shadow Labyrinth</em> Preview | Final Thoughts&nbsp;</h2>

<p>When I was preparing for PAX East this year, I did not think I'd be seeing a game that combines the classic arcade-style of <em>Pac-Man</em> with labyrinth-crawling swordplay, but here we are. Initially, I was impressed at just how easy the <em>Shadow Labyrinth</em> gameplay was to pick up.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The development team wanted to keep this as simple and intuitive as possible, while including hardcore action," Piasek said.</p>

<p>While I played through my <em>Shadow Labyrinth</em> preview on a PC at PAX East, I did ask about the console release as well, including how <em>Shadow Labyrinth</em> will run on Switch 2.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It runs great on Switch," Piasek said. "On Switch 2, it runs 4K 60 FPS, and full-HD in handheld mode. It's the best way to play portable, and the best way to play if you're a Nintendo ecosystem-only gamer."&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Shadow Labyrinth</em>&nbsp;releases on July&nbsp;18, 2025, and it'll give fans of games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hollow-knight" rel="nofollow"><em>Hollow Knight</em></a> and <em>Metroid Dread</em> much to look forward to this summer!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/square-enix-financials-2024-25<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has released its financial summary for the 2024-25 fiscal year, and while sales are down, profits are up, largely thanks to the performance of a certain retro JRPG remake.</p>

<p>In its latest financial presentation, Square Enix reveals that sales have fallen by around 9% <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/square-enix-financials-profits-down" rel="nofollow">over last year</a>, That admittedly isn't a particularly precipitous fall, although it's not exactly likely to put smiles on the executive board's faces.</p>

<p>What might do that, however, is the fact that profits are up by around 20%, largely driven by the company's "digital entertainment" (i.e. video games) sector. One game in particular, Square Enix says, stands out as a success this fiscal year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-square-enix-financials.jpg?itok=0f2nxVeH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-square-enix-financials.jpg?itok=gz0KFChd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Square Enix's profits are up this year thanks to one game in particular.</figcaption></figure><p>In the report, Square Enix singles out&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em>'s "stronger sales" than the company's "initial assumptions" as a driving factor behind this year's profit increase. Back in February, Square Enix revealed the game had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-outsold-expectations" rel="nofollow">outsold expectations</a>.</p>

<p>Other new releases this year included&nbsp;<em>SaGa Emerald Beyond</em>, <i>Life Is Strange: Double Exposure</i>, and a port of previously iOS-exclusive RPG&nbsp;<em>Fantasian</em>, as well as&nbsp;<em>Visions of Mana</em>.</p>

<p>Square Enix doesn't provide sales figures for these titles, but we do know that&nbsp;<em>Visions of Mana</em>'s developer was hit by massive layoffs <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/visions-of-mana-layoffs-netease-report" rel="nofollow">on the day of the game's release</a>, prompting its director to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/visions-of-mana-director-quits-ouka-joins-square-enix" rel="nofollow">quit and sign up with Square Enix</a> instead (before <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/visions-of-mana-director-kenji-ozawa-sasanqua" rel="nofollow">opening up his own studio</a> back in March).</p>

<p>The company also points to the success of&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>expansion&nbsp;<em>Dawntrail&nbsp;</em>in its MMO department, which, along with&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest X</em>'s January update, contributed to a 2.6 billion yen increase in operating income for the MMO area.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-square-enix-financials.jpg?itok=h-nP92Sn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-square-enix-financials.jpg?itok=h11npdAr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail&nbsp;</em>contributed to a boost in profits for Square Enix's MMO sector this year.</figcaption></figure><p>In terms of Square Enix's future, the company is currently working on major new entries in the&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts&nbsp;</em>franchises, although it's been quite some time since we heard from either of them.</p>

<p>Still, the publisher has assured fans that&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts IV&nbsp;</em>is, in fact, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-hearts-missing-link-canceled" rel="nofollow">still in development</a>, and&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest&nbsp;</em>producer Yuji Horii has made similar <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/yujii-horii-still-working-really-hard-on-dragon-quest-xii-series-could-be-compatible-with-switch-2-1541753/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">assurances</a> with regards to&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest XII</em>, so we can but hope.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-hearts-missing-link-canceled<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has announced that "GPS based action RPG"&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link&nbsp;</em>has been canceled, although the long-absent&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts IV&nbsp;</em>remains in development, according to the studio.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/KHMLink_NA/status/1922540374167364055" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on X, Square Enix says that it "worked hard on developing and adjusting"&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link</em>, but that the studio would be unable to "offer a service that players would find satisfactory over a long period of time".</p>

<p>Square Enix closes by saying that "the&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts&nbsp;</em>series will continue", and that the development team is&nbsp;"hard at work on&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts IV</em>", imploring fans to "keep an eye out for further updates", although no timeframe for those updates is revealed.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingdom-hearts-missing-link-canceled-combat.jpg?itok=cg-Dox8d 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingdom-hearts-missing-link-canceled-combat.jpg?itok=9YTxRbHd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link&nbsp;</em>will forever remain...well...missing.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-hearts-4-announced" rel="nofollow">first revealed back in 2022</a>, alongside flagship series entry&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts IV</em>. A number of closed beta tests were held in the period between then and now, but it seems that they didn't help Square Enix refine the game enough for release.</p>

<p>The game was to take place between the events of&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts Union&nbsp;</em><i>χ&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts Dark Road</em>, both smartphone spinoffs (although what constitutes a "spinoff" in the murky world of&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts&nbsp;</em>can be fluid at the best of times).</p>

<p>Gameplay-wise, it was to adapt the action-RPG gameplay for which&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts&nbsp;</em>has become known, with players battling Heartless and other enemies in and around the land of Scala ad Caelum. Disney characters like Aladdin,&nbsp;<em>Toy Story</em>'s Woody, and&nbsp;<em>Tangled</em>'s Rapunzel were set to appear.</p>




<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts IV</em>, very little has been revealed about the game since that debut trailer back in 2022. We know it'll once again star series protagonist Sora, and that it'll take place in the modern city of Quadratum, but other than that, it's shrouded in mystery.</p>

<p>Somewhat alarmingly, series creator Tetsuya Nomura has also declared that it's possible he <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tetsuya-nomura-kingdom-hearts-retirement" rel="nofollow">won't finish the series before he retires</a>, so if you were hoping for closure from&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts&nbsp;</em>(for some reason), you might be disappointed.</p>
