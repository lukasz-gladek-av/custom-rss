            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/esa-announces-iicon-not-e3<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The ESA, the driving force behind E3, has announced a new event by the name of iicon, but don't get your hopes up; it really doesn't sound a heck of a lot like E3 at all.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.theesa.com/entertainment-software-association-unveils-iicon-game-changing-thought-leader-summit-to-harness-the-power-of-interactive-entertainment-and-shape-the-future-of-business-and-culture/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on its website, the ESA (which stands for Entertainment Software Association) describes iicon as an event aiming to "connect visionaries, thought leaders and innovators from across industries to harness the power of interactive entertainment".</p>

<p>In short, it sounds like iicon is much more corporate-minded than E3; it's more for business executives and industry figures than the general public, so don't expect to see any jaw-dropping game or console reveals.</p>

<p>According to the site, iicon promises "visionary keynotes, engaging discussions and workshops, and elite networking opportunities" with execs "shaping the future of entertainment, business, and technology".</p>

<p>The event won't just be about gaming, either; it also promises to incorporate other industries adjacent to gaming and interactive media, like film, TV, and music, as well as "sports, healthcare, education, finance, and more".</p>

<p>The ESA says that attendance will be "by invitation only", so it doesn't sound like you'll just be able to buy a ticket and rock up as a member of the public, which seems like it's in keeping with iicon's more exclusive approach.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/e3-2019-esa.jpg?itok=_bGvK2N_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/e3-2019-esa.jpg?itok=7r0mPMqU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The ESA's new iicon event does not sound much like E3.</figcaption></figure><p>Companies like Take-Two, Ubisoft, and Xbox have already signed up for iicon, which should provide another clue that the event won't be anything like E3; after all, some of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-wont-actually-be-at-e3-2023-but-will-still-host-live-event-in-los-angeles" rel="nofollow">companies</a> confirming their attendance publicly <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-nintendo-sony-skipping-e3-2023" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">shunned</a> E3 in the years before its demise.</p>

<p>In case you need a reminder, the ESA officially killed E3 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/e3-is-officially-dead" rel="nofollow">in December 2023</a>&nbsp;following a chaotic couple of years that included show cancellations and studios turning down appearances at the convention.</p>

<p>That's another reason iicon will almost certainly be nothing like E3; it would be a very unusual (and arguably foolish) business move to create an event exactly like one that was canned not even a year and a half ago.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in ESA news, meanwhile, the trade body recently took President Trump to task over his <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/esa-trump-tariffs-comments" rel="nofollow">newly-introduced tariffs</a>, which the organization says could cause "significant harm to everyday Americans". Trump has paused tariffs on Canada and Mexico, but has gone ahead with a 10% tariff on China-imported goods.</p>

<p>In any case, the inaugural iicon event will take place between April 27th and 30th next year at the Las Vegas Fontainebleau Resort. Stay tuned for more.</p>
