            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/next-gen-xbox-hardware-sneak-peek<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Xbox has given us a small sneak preview into the next generation of its hardware, and it sounds as though the multi-device, multi-storefront approach will continue across the next few years, at least.</p>

<p>In a new video, Xbox president Sarah Bond discusses what's next for Xbox and its hardware, and while it sounds like there will be new consoles from the company, they're going to look pretty different from what we're used to.</p>

<p>Bond says that Xbox has formed a "multi-year partnership" with AMD to create chips for its new devices, including "next-generation Xbox consoles". Said machines will also include backwards compatibility with previous-gen Xbox games, by the sound of things.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-next-gen-hardware-amd.jpg?itok=pm9HxZPJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-next-gen-hardware-amd.jpg?itok=pB-fTji8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Xbox is teaming up with AMD for the next generation of its consoles.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Bond, this is all in service of building a platform that allows you to play games that aren't constrained to a single device or a single store ecosystem.</p>

<p>While we don't know exactly what that means, it sounds as though next-gen Xbox devices will allow you to access stores outside of the Microsoft Store. That could mean PC stores like Steam, GOG, or the Epic Store become accessible on Xbox devices, which would give console gamers a much broader spectrum of games to play.</p>

<p>In closing, Bond says the Xbox team is working closely with the Windows folks to ensure that "Windows is the number one platform for gaming". It's arguably telling that she says "Windows" rather than "Xbox"; that could imply that next-gen Xbox hardware will run on the Windows platform rather than a bespoke ecosystem for consoles.</p>




<p>In recent years, Xbox has been moving away from its own exclusive ecosystem in favor of releasing its games on other platforms; titles like&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 5</em>,&nbsp;<em>Grounded</em>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gears-of-war-reloaded-announced" rel="nofollow"><i>Gears of War Reloaded</i></a>, all of which either were or would have been Xbox exclusives, have been released on other platforms.</p>

<p>It's fair to say Xbox has roundly lost the latest "console wars", if such things are still ongoing (which Xbox would like you to believe they aren't); if last year's <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/xbox-series-xs-sales-are-reportedly-less-than-half-of-the-ps5s-with-microsoft-on-track-for-a-repeat-of-ps4-vs-xbox-one/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sales figures</a> are to be believed, then the Xbox Series X|S range is selling much worse than the PS5, which is probably why Bond and her company want to get out of the exclusive business.</p>

<p>Of course, we're still probably a good few years away from next-generation Xbox hardware, so we're probably going to have to wait a while to discover what the company's vision for its new direction is. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Marvel Cosmic Invasion Preview - Co-op Buddies, Assemble!]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/marvel-cosmic-invasion-preview-co-op-buddies-assemble</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-cosmic-invasion-preview-co-op-buddies-assemble.1222092/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/marvel-cosmic-invasion-preview-co-op-buddies-assemble<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've been really impressed with Marvel's video game lineup, recently. I'm not even that big on superheroes, but these games coming from Marvel constantly have me excited -- games like&nbsp;<em>Marvel</em><em>'s Wolverine&nbsp;</em>and the recently announced&nbsp;<em>Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</em>. Perhaps most of all, though, I'm eager to see the release of the upcoming beat 'em up,&nbsp;<em>Marvel's Cosmic Invasion</em>.</p>

<p>Even better, I was able to play&nbsp;<em>Marvel's Cosmic Invasion</em>&nbsp;earlier this month at Summer Game Fest 2025. A retro-style beat 'em up with a roster of popular and slightly more niche Marvel heroes, grab a few friends and some brewskies for this one, since you'll be hooked to the CRT all night long.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>A Diverse Roster to Choose From</h2>

<p>First things first, hero selection. You're not picking one character to play as, but two. You can switch between these in the middle of combat, which makes combat more varied and dynamic. There are 15 heroes in all, so plenty of combinations are possible. So far, Marvel and developer Tribute Games seem pretty tight-lipped on this beat 'em up's roster.</p>

<p>Just recently, we saw the announcement of She-Hulk and Rocket Raccoon as new inclusions to the current selection, that being Spider-Man, Captain America, Venom, Wolverine, Nova, Storm, and Phyla-Vell. Clearly, they're going for a nice mix of heroes here, so really, anyone could show up. Heck, Squirrel Girl or Jeff seem just as likely as Iron Man or Thor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For my first playthrough, I went with Captain America and Venom. Any duo should be optimal, though, since this is a beat 'em up, after all. Gameplay is really tight. You could theoretically button mash and be fine, but there's a bit of nuance to each skillset to make every hero feel true to their personality and powers.</p>



<h2>Venom and Captain American = BFFs</h2>

<p>Captain America, for instance, throws his shield and has a strong uppercut to take down pesky air enemies. He's an all-rounder with a decent set of moves, if a bit generic. Great for juggling enemies, though, which I tried my best to do at every chance I could get!</p>

<p>Venom, on the other hand, is this chaotic mass of goo that wreaks havoc on the battlefield. He morphs into different shapes and can take down groups of enemies pretty fast. Despite his size, he's agile both on the ground and while swinging around with his web.</p>



<p>My favorite aspect of Venom,<em>&nbsp;</em>though, is his move that grabs enemies. You can pound bad guys into the ground, or throw them. I was always flinging guys around, throwing them off ledges and wherever else I could have them insta-die. He can grab in mid-air too, so flying enemies better look out.</p>

<p>I played with TechRaptor Editor-in-Chief Andrew Otton, and he went with Spider-Man and Wolverine. He seemed to favor Wolverine, who was just an absolute menace on the battlefield, tearing things up. Now, for our second go-around, I went with two new characters as did Andrew.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My new team now comprises Spider-Man and&nbsp;Phyla-Vell. She's a character I'm very unfamiliar with, but her toolkit seems to tick all the right boxes. She floats around and uses her sword to attack. What I really like about&nbsp;Phyla-Vell is that she can throw her sword, and once it hits an enemy, press the button again and she teleports to the sword.</p>



<p>This allows you to travel across the battlefield and meet enemies and reinforcements head-on. I could definitely see her being a mainstay to my team. Andrew also took a liking to Storm who, from a gameplay perspective, seems like another mechanically diverse character. Tribute Games does a good job at making every character shine in their own special ways.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Each character has a special move you can use once a gauge is full, but there's also a sort of tag-team mechanic. It reminds me of&nbsp;<em>Marvel vs. Capcom</em>&nbsp;to some degree, where the one character you have benched can come in and land a hit or two; of course, you can always outright switch and play as them with the click of a button.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em>&nbsp;Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em>&nbsp;is super fast-paced, and so great to play with others. I like that there's more to it than just simple button mashing, and I can't wait to see what combinations I can make once the full roster is revealed. Really, if you enjoyed the developer's previous beat 'em up,&nbsp;<em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge,&nbsp;</em>you'll like this just as much, if not even more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-eevee-grove<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has announced a new&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>expansion, and if you're a fan of adorably indistinct fox-cat-dog 'mon Eevee, then you're going to love this one.</p>

<p>As revealed on the official&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.pokemon.com/uk/pokemon-news/its-a-cuteness-overload-in-pokemon-tcg-pockets-upcoming-eevee-grove-expansion" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, the&nbsp;<em>Eevee Grove&nbsp;</em>expansion launches on June 26th, bringing with it new cards based on Eevee and many of its evolutions (colloquially referred to as Eeveelutions, for obvious reasons).</p>

<p>The expansion, which follows on from previous large-scale expansions like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-celestial-guardians-set" rel="nofollow">Celestial Guardians</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-update-new-expansion-release-date" rel="nofollow"><em>Space-Time Smackdown</em></a>, will introduce more than 100 new cards to collect, including an Eevee ex card with the adorably-named ability "Veevee 'volve". All together now: d'awwww.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-eevee-grove-expansion-eevee-ex.jpg?itok=EqFp3FxH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-eevee-grove-expansion-eevee-ex.jpg?itok=wJRUIxLs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Eevee and its chums are the focus of the new&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>expansion.</figcaption></figure><p>Other cards we've seen so far include a very cute full-art Leafeon and a Vaporeon in repose, as well as cards based on other Eeveelutions like Umbreon, Flareon, and Sylveon. In short, if you're a fan of Eevee and its subsequent forms, you're going to love this.</p>

<p>Of course, it's not just Eevee; you'll also find a new Trainer card in the form of&nbsp;<em>Scarlet and Violet</em>'s Penny, who allows you to look at a random Supporter card in your opponent's deck (as long as it isn't Penny) and steal its effect, as well as shuffling that card back into the deck.</p>

<p>A new Eevee Bag item is also being added as a Trainer card, which buffs Eeveelutions and allows you to heal them as well. If you're building an Eevee-centric deck, you'll want this as part of your arsenal.</p>




<p>If you're not a fan of Eevee...well, first, I'd urge you to check your priorities and get the help you need. Assuming you don't want to do that, however, you'll find other 'mons included in this expansion, like Swirlix, Alcremie, and Milcery.</p>

<p><em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Eevee Grove&nbsp;</em>expansion launches on June 26th. Stay tuned for more on all things&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>.</p>
