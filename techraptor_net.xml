            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot has revealed that future&nbsp;<em>Far Cry&nbsp;</em>games will likely have much more of a multiplayer focus, and he says the shift is to ensure longevity.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ubisoft-assassins-creed-mirage-saudi-arabia" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Game File</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisoft-confirms-far-cry-will-more-predominantly-push-multiplayer-in-future/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">VGC</a>), Guillemot spoke about the future of the&nbsp;<em>Far Cry&nbsp;</em>series during the New Global Sport Conference in Saudi Arabia, at which he was asked about what was next for the first-person shooter franchise.</p>

<p>In response to that question, Guillemot said that the goal for the&nbsp;<em>Far Cry&nbsp;</em>series is to "bring the multiplayer aspects more predominantly pushed" so that the franchise and its games "can also be played for a long time by players".</p>

<p>The last game in the&nbsp;<em>Far Cry&nbsp;</em>series was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/far-cry-6-release-date-revealed-for-late-2021" rel="nofollow">launched almost four years ago</a>. Ubisoft hasn't announced exact sales figures for&nbsp;<em>Far Cry 6</em>, but in its <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/7FRH9Pjch7t9yXb4GMFgi0/db479fa1ae07fc5264f8b16e1d7a15f8/Ubisoft_FY22_Earnings_PR_English_Final.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">2021-22 financial report</a>, the studio claimed the game was behind the series' "best year ever".</p>

<p>Of course, given Ubisoft's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-creative-houses-q1-financials" rel="nofollow">recent</a> financial <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-financials-layoffs-possible" rel="nofollow">woes</a>, it stands to reason that the company would want to shore up sales for its major brands as much as possible, but whether shifting to multiplayer will work that magic for&nbsp;<em>Far Cry&nbsp;</em>remains to be seen.</p>

<p>The next installment in the&nbsp;<em>Far Cry&nbsp;</em>franchise has yet to be officially announced by Ubisoft, but in December last year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-far-cry-7-and-maverick/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">rumors suggested</a> that the game had been internally pushed from a 2025 release window to 2026, so it may be some time before we hear from the series again.</p>




<p>If Guillemot's comments are to be believed, then it's likely that when&nbsp;<em>Far Cry 7&nbsp;</em>does arrive, it'll push its multiplayer aspect much more prominently, so you might want to grab a friend or two to play it with. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fortnite Is Getting An Exact Amount V-Bucks Option Next Month]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-v-bucks-exact-amount</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite-is-getting-an-exact-amount-v-bucks-option-next-month.1294707/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic has announced that you'll soon be able to buy exact amounts of V-Bucks in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>, so if you want something that's 500 V-Bucks but you've only got 400, you won't need to buy hundreds more to make up the difference.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/new-v-bucks-exact-amount-purchasing-offer-in-fortnite?lang=en-US" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on the game's official website, Epic confirms that this feature is coming on October 14th, and that it'll be available not only in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>, but also in&nbsp;<em>Rocket League&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;Fall Guys&nbsp;</i>as well.</p>

<p>There's a catch, though: you won't be able to take advantage of this feature on PlayStation. It'll be available on every other platform, though, so presumably, thanks to the wonders of cross-progression, you can just play somewhere else, top up your account, then head back to PlayStation to enjoy your spoils.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fortnite-v-bucks-exact-amount-window.jpg?itok=doI5o5o0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fortnite-v-bucks-exact-amount-window.jpg?itok=11tTQtza 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>is getting an Exact Amount button for V-Bucks purchases.</figcaption></figure><p>You can also take advantage of the new Exact Amount offer on the&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>web shop, so even if you don't have another platform to hand, you can grab your V-Bucks there if you'd prefer to top up with just what you need.</p>

<p>Although the PlayStation limitation will be frustrating for those playing on that platform, Epic says it'll "work to make [the new feature] available everywhere", so you may see the option appearing on PlayStation in future as well.</p>

<p>Exact Amount offers will be available "in increments of 50" for&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Rocket League</em>'s in-game currencies, while in&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys</em>, increments of 100 will be available, with balances being rounded up to the nearest 100. Epic says this is being done in order to "align with item prices".</p>

<p>News of this latest&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>feature follows the revelation back in July that&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-ios-uk-cma" rel="nofollow">may never return to iOS in the UK</a> thanks to decisions made by the country's CMA regulatory body, although the game did make its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-ios-app-store-returns" rel="nofollow">triumphant return to the US App Store back in May</a>.</p>

Surprise!</figcaption></figure><p>We're in the midst of&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s Shock 'n Awesome season at the moment, which introduces bugs that are reminiscent of (but totally legally distinct from)&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>'s Terminids for you to fight.</p>

<p>You can do that, and a lot more besides, in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>for free right now on...well, on pretty much every platform going, although you may want to avoid PlayStation if you're looking to use the new Exact Amount feature.</p>
