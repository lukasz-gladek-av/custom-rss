            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lords-of-fallen-20-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>CI Games has released&nbsp;the&nbsp;<em>Lords of the Fallen&nbsp;</em>2.0 update, representing what the developer and publisher calls the "definitive edition" of its game. As you'd expect, it's packing plenty of improvements.</p>

<p>The release of&nbsp;<em>Lords of the Fallen&nbsp;</em>2.0, along with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lords-of-fallen-update-15-modifiers" rel="nofollow">many updates</a> the game has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lords-of-fallen-update" rel="nofollow">received</a> since its launch back in October 2023, mean that CI Games has "aligned the game with our original vision", the developer says.</p>

<p>Changes include shared progression co-op, which allows players to play together across a shared campaign, as well as a free friend's pass. Much like the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-friends-pass-crossplay" rel="nofollow">friend's pass offered by Hazelight's&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em></a>, this pass allows a friend to experience the game alongside you for free, even if they don't own&nbsp;<em>Lords of the Fallen</em>.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to changes like a new lamp guidance mechanic, which allows you to find the nearest Vestige so you can get some respite from your adventure, as well as a dedicated jump button, an overhauled character creator, and much more.</p>

<p>More info on&nbsp;<em>Lords of the Fallen</em>'s 2.0 update, including other changes we haven't covered in our brief highlights, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1501750/view/527592442371768508" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">can be found here</a>, and you can check out a trailer spotlighting some of the game's new features below.</p>




<p>Despite its name,&nbsp;<em>Lords of the Fallen&nbsp;</em>2.0 isn't actually a sequel to <i>Lords of the Fallen</i>. You'll <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lords-of-fallen-2-2026-epic-exclusive" rel="nofollow">have to wait until 2026 for that</a>, assuming it doesn't get delayed or canceled.</p>

<p>Until then,&nbsp;<em>Lords of the Fallen&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1501750/Lords_of_the_Fallen/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/lords-of-the-fallen/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/lords-of-the-fallen/9N3CJZ3HFHTF" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. You can read my review of the original 2023 version (as opposed to the original 2014 version) <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/lords-of-fallen-review-dark-soul-reaver" rel="nofollow">right here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-release-date-dlc-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has announced the release date for&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>on Nintendo Switch 2, and the game's major second DLC pack,&nbsp;<em>A Pirate's Fortune</em>, has also been revealed.</p>

<p>As revealed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-release-date-revealed-at-star-wars-celebration" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">during a livestream</a>,&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>will land on Nintendo's console on September 4th. The console itself is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">due for launch on June 5th</a>, so you won't have to wait too long between buying your Switch 2 and picking up Ubisoft's open-world&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>adventure.</p>

<p>If you already own&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>and you're waiting for news of the next DLC adventure, Ubisoft has you covered on that front as well.&nbsp;<em>A Pirate's Fortune&nbsp;</em>is the name of the game's second story pack, and it's coming in May.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-outlaws-dlc-2-a-pirates-fortune.jpg?itok=JcFN7WgX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-outlaws-dlc-2-a-pirates-fortune.jpg?itok=jLHc3OZv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>' second DLC,&nbsp;<em>A Pirate's Fortune</em>, is due out in May.</figcaption></figure><p>Arriving on May 15th,&nbsp;<em>A Pirate's Fortune&nbsp;</em>takes Kay Vess to the Khepi system, where she'll be teaming up with legendary pirate Hondo Ohnaka in order to take on Stinger Tash and her mean-sounding Rokana Raiders.</p>

<p>In true pirate fashion, you'll also be raiding a tomb; the Khepi Tomb will offer "secrets and hidden treasures" for you to discover. What's more, a whole new faction, the Miyuki Trade League, will offer up new Trailblazer rewards, and all you have to do in return is smuggle dangerous goods across the galaxy. What's new, right?</p>

<p>Along with the paid DLC,&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>will also be getting some free&nbsp;<em>Skeleton Crew</em>-inspired cosmetics on May 15th, including an outfit for Nix. Be sure to check that out if you want to dress up your cute little friend.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, it's an open-world action-adventure game developed by Ubisoft. Taking place between&nbsp;<em>The Empire Strikes Back&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Return of the Jedi</em>, the game follows scoundrel Kay Vess as she tries to pull off the heist of a lifetime.</p>

<p>Originally released last year, the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-february" rel="nofollow">underperformed compared to Ubisoft's expectations</a>, becoming one of the cornerstones of a change in strategy that involves day-one Steam releases and the adoption of an altered season pass model.</p>

<p>Our <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/star-wars-outlaws-review" rel="nofollow">Erren liked it</a>, though, and if you want to find out whether you do, there's a free demo for the game you can check out across all platforms.</p>

<p><em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>is available now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2842040/Star_Wars_Outlaws/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/star-wars-outlaws/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/star-wars-outlaws/9P87S3NP6SR2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. The Switch 2 version launches on September 4th.</p>
