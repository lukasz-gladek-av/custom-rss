            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has revealed that its open-world action RPG&nbsp;<em>Dragon's Dogma 2&nbsp;</em>has hit another major sales milestone, so if you're hoping for more titles in the series, this should hopefully serve as a strong motivator for the publisher.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/DragonsDogma/status/1990948257384526335" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message</a> on social media earlier today, Capcom announced that&nbsp;<em>Dragon's Dogma 2&nbsp;</em>sales have hit four million. That, naturally, includes all of the platforms on which the game is available, as well as both physical and digital shipments.</p>

<p>To celebrate the new milestone, Capcom also released a new piece of artwork thanking players who've already picked the game up. It's pretty heartwarming, so feel free to give yourself a pat on the back if you're one of the "Arisen" the artwork is thanking.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragons-dogma-2-sales-4m-artwork.jpg?itok=9iNNBoim 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragons-dogma-2-sales-4m-artwork.jpg?itok=fq_TzvMI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon's Dogma 2&nbsp;</em>has reached four million sales around the world.</figcaption></figure><p>The new milestone means that&nbsp;<em>Dragon's Dogma 2&nbsp;</em>has managed to amass another 1.5 million sales for itself since last count <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragons-dogma-2-sales" rel="nofollow">back in April last year</a>, so it's selling pretty steadily, if perhaps not quite as meteorically as some of Capcom's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-sales-10m-village-11m" rel="nofollow">other titles</a>.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Dragon's Dogma 2</em>, it's the sequel to the 2012 cult classic&nbsp;<em>Dragon's Dogma</em>, with that game's director Hideaki Itsuno returning to direct (although he's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideaki-itsuno-lightspeed-studios" rel="nofollow">since departed Capcom</a> to join Tencent subsidiary LightSpeed Studios).</p>

<p>Although&nbsp;<em>Dragon's Dogma 2&nbsp;</em>is a sequel (the clue's in that number after the name), it's perhaps better thought of as a reboot or a followup; it takes place in a parallel world and doesn't require any knowledge of the first game to enjoy.</p>

<p>You'll once again take the role of the Arisen, who must command Pawns in order to slay a dragon, all while exploring a vast open world littered with sidequests and locations to discover.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and developer Sucker Punch have announced that open-world action-adventure game&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yotei&nbsp;</em>is getting a New Game Plus mode next week, so you'll soon be able to start a fresh run tooled up to the nines.</p>

<p>In a PlayStation Blog <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/19/new-game-plus-comes-to-ghost-of-yotei-november-24/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, Sony reveals that New Game Plus is coming to&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yotei&nbsp;</em>on November 24th (that's this coming Monday at time of writing). As you'd expect, it'll allow you to start a new run with all of your armor, abilities, and weapons from your previous playthrough.</p>

<p>Naturally, you will need to finish&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yotei</em>'s main story before you can enjoy New Game Plus, but once you've unlocked the mode, you can also look forward to two extra difficulty levels to challenge you even further, plus two new Trophies to earn.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-new-game-plus-duel.jpg?itok=XXSCSW_d 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-new-game-plus-duel.jpg?itok=81XRKgb- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll soon be able to jump into New Game Plus mode in&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yotei</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>New Game Plus will also bring a new Ghost Flower currency that can be exchanged for new cosmetic armor sets and weapon dyes, as well as ten new charms and an extra tier of armor and weapon upgrades.</p>

<p>This update isn't just bringing New Game Plus goodies, however. It's also introducing replayable content once you've finished the main game, and a new stats screen will tell you just how well you did when you replay said content.</p>

<p>New accessibility options, including directional button remapping, are also on the way, along with enhanced Photo Mode features like a new composition grid and adjustable shutter speed to help you snap that perfect shot.</p>




<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yotei</em>, it's the second game in what is now Sony and Sucker Punch's&nbsp;<em>Ghost&nbsp;</em>franchise. It serves as an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ghost-of-yotei-ghost-of-tsushima-followup-2025" rel="nofollow">indirect followup</a> to 2019's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima" rel="nofollow"><em>Ghost of Tsushima</em></a>, pitting new protagonist Atsu against the Yotei Six, who slaughtered her family years before the game's narrative takes place.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yotei&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/ghost-of-yotei/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and you can read our very own Tyler's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/ghost-of-yotei-review-new-ghost-in-familiar-tale" rel="nofollow">review of it here</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Finals PS4 Support Ending When Season 10 Begins in March]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-finals-ps4-support-ending</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-finals-ps4-support-ending-when-season-10-begins-in-march.1358359/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Embark Studios has announced that its competitive FPS&nbsp;<em>The Finals&nbsp;</em>will be losing PS4 support next year, so if you're still playing on Sony's last-gen console, it might be time to upgrade.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/reachthefinals/status/1990810282529046592" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message</a> on social media, Embark says that PS4 support for the game will be coming to an end on March 18th, which is also when the shooter's tenth season is set to start.</p>

<p>Embark says it's retiring the game on PS4 in order to "focus [its] support on current generation hardware", and it's far from alone in making that decision; it joins illustrious company like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-ps4-support-ending" rel="nofollow"><em>Genshin Impact</em>'s HoYoverse</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pubg-ps4-and-xbox-one-support-ending-in-november" rel="nofollow"><em>PUBG</em>'s Krafton</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-finals-ps4-support-ending-gold.jpg?itok=bqZXBdA4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-finals-ps4-support-ending-gold.jpg?itok=CeCk3NWg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Finals&nbsp;</em>is losing PS4 support soon.</figcaption></figure><p>If and when you do decide to make the leap from PS4, all of the progress you've made on&nbsp;<em>The Finals&nbsp;</em>will be stored in your Embark account, so you'll be able to pick up where you left off wherever you are.</p>

<p>This news also doesn't affect players on current-gen platforms or PC, nor does it affect Xbox One owners, because, well,&nbsp;<em>The Finals&nbsp;</em>never got itself an Xbox One release. In fact, judging from <a href="https://x.com/jordychinchin/status/1990914208905515479" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">some</a> of the <a href="https://x.com/0xmikubeam/status/1991020255057961288" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">replies</a> to Embark's social media message, many people were unaware&nbsp;<em>The Finals</em> was available on PS4.</p>

<p>News of <i>The Finals</i>' sunsetting on PS4 comes as Embark Studios celebrates another major success, namely extraction shooter&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders</em>, which launched last month to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/arc-raiders-sales-4m" rel="nofollow">very strong sales indeed</a>.</p>

<p>That game looks set to become part of Embark's regular stable alongside <em>The Finals</em>; it's already <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/arc-raiders-cosmetics-duos" rel="nofollow">received a major update</a> lowering some of its cosmetic prices and rebalancing duo queueing, and more updates and patches are planned for the future as well.</p>

It's also up for grabs (for free!) on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/the-finals/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2073850/THE_FINALS/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/the-finals/9PGD71CMDS0Z" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>
