            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-of-seikyu-early-access-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Ace Entertainment and publisher Fireshine Games have announced the&nbsp;<em>Tales of Seikyu&nbsp;</em>Early Access release date, and it won't be long before you get to live an idyllic life amongst the yokai.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2340520/view/535474378243048018" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Steam,&nbsp;<em>Tales of Seikyu&nbsp;</em>will be arriving on PC via Steam Early Access on May 21st, and yes, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-vi-release-date-delay" rel="nofollow">unlike&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em></a>, that's May 21st this year, not next.</p>

<p>In&nbsp;<em>Tales of Seikyu</em>, you'll be building your dream farmhouse, all while shapeshifting into various yokai forms in order to make exploration and day-to-day life easier. Think&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/spirittea" rel="nofollow"><em>Spirittea</em></a>, but where you get to transform into the creatures, and you're not a million miles away.</p>

Together with your sister Kon, you'll build a life among these mythical beings.</p>

<p>Forms you can shapeshift into over the course of&nbsp;<em>Tales of Seikyu&nbsp;</em>include the Crow Tengu, which grants you flight, as well as the water-dwelling Slime and the farmland-tending Boar.</p>

<p>As you'd expect from a life sim like this, you can grow and tend to crops, raise livestock, and build your homestead, kitting it out with custom-crafted furniture to add that all-important personal touch. Of course, you can also cook meals from the ingredients you grow and source from the local area.</p>

<p>Naturally,&nbsp;<em>Tales of Seikyu&nbsp;</em>also features a romance system, with "a variety of romanceable partners" available, each of whom has "their own unique personalities and heartwarming stories". The game's "extraordinary" villagers will have a range of quests for you to complete as well.</p>




<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Tales of Seikyu&nbsp;</em>when it launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2340520/Tales_of_Seikyu/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on May 21st. There's no word of a console release for the game yet.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/second-grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rockstar has released a second&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI&nbsp;</em>trailer just a few days after announcing that the game would, in fact, no longer make its intended release window of fall 2025.</p>

<p>Last week, Rockstar announced that&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI&nbsp;</em>will be launching on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-vi-release-date-delay" rel="nofollow">on May 26th next year</a>, acknowledging that the date is "later than [fans] expected" but reaffirming its desire to "try and exceed [players'] expectations" with the game.</p>

<p>Now, the developer has released a brand new&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI&nbsp;</em>trailer in which we get a closer look at the lives of protagonists Jason and Lucia, although the trailer still doesn't contain any actual "on-the-ground" gameplay, so to speak.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-2-lucia-jason.jpg?itok=jbwGECVF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-2-lucia-jason.jpg?itok=lZTJt_Bt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A new&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI&nbsp;</em>trailer is here, but it doesn't say much about the game's gameplay.</figcaption></figure><p>In the trailer, we're reacquainted with our two main characters, both of whom were first introduced as part of the original&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto&nbsp;</em><em>VI&nbsp;</em>trailer all the way back in December 2023 (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-released-early-following-leak-coming-in-2025" rel="nofollow">yes, it really has been that long</a>).</p>

<p>At the outset of the trailer, we see Lucia getting out of prison, with Jason at the gates to greet her. What follows is a fairly typical montage of&nbsp;<em>GTA</em>-style debauchery, with heists, partying, and over-the-top action setpieces all playing out against a backdrop of 80s music.</p>

<p>Over the course of the trailer, we hear Zenglen's "Child Support", Wang Chung's "Everybody Have Fun Tonight", Tammy Wynette's "Talkin' to Myself Again", and the Pointer Sisters' "Hot Together", all of which will presumably be on&nbsp;<em>GTA VI</em>'s soundtrack alongside Tom Petty's "Love Is a Long Road" from the debut trailer.</p>




<p>We also get to meet a number of the characters who will populate&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em>'s fictional state of Leonida, and it looks like everyone's favorite gun-toting maniac Phil Cassidy will be making a return from his&nbsp;<em>GTA: Vice City&nbsp;</em>glory days, too.</p>

<p><em>Grand Theft Auto VI&nbsp;</em>launches for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S on May 26th, 2026. You can find lots more info about the game, including details about its characters and story, <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/VI" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">via the official website</a>.</p>
