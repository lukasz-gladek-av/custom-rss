            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/horizon-mmo-canceled-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>An MMORPG based on Sony and Guerrilla Games' successful IP&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>has apparently been canceled. The project was reportedly a collaboration between Sony and&nbsp;<em>Guild Wars&nbsp;</em>studio NCSoft.</p>

<p>Bear with me on this one. Back in 2023, Sony and NCSoft <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-and-ncsoft-announce-strategic-partnership-to-collaborate-in-various" rel="nofollow">announced a "strategic partnership"</a>, and that partnership was reported to include a&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>MMO, with leaker Kurakasis <a href="https://x.com/Kurakasis/status/1741262087647543736" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pointing to job listings</a> for something called "Project H" (also "Project Skyline") in December that same year.</p>

<p>Now, however, Korean publication <a href="https://news.mtn.co.kr/news-detail/2025011314314667267" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">MTN</a> (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/looks-like-horizons-unannounced-mmo-has-been-quietly-cancelled" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>) has reported that Project H has been canceled following a project review at NCSoft, along with several other titles in development at the company.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/horizon-mmo-canceled-report-aloy.jpg?itok=HnasnYjv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/horizon-mmo-canceled-report-aloy.jpg?itok=WfRjSZmL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>An MMO based on&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>has apparently been canceled.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, all of this should be taken with a pinch of salt, because Sony and NCSoft never officially announced the&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>MMO in question, so naturally, it also hasn't officially been canceled.</p>

<p>However, cancelling such a project would fit in with what appears to be a wider retreat from the live service market on Sony's part. Earlier this week, the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-live-service-games-canceled" rel="nofollow">canceled two live service games</a> in development at Bluepoint and Bend, with the former reportedly being a&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>spinoff.</p>

<p>The retreat is likely inspired by the colossal failure of hero shooter&nbsp;<em>Concord</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds" rel="nofollow">shut down just two weeks after it launched</a> last year. The game's developer would go on to be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-shuts-down-two-studios-including-concord-creator" rel="nofollow">closed down by Sony</a>, along with Neon Koi, previously known as Savage Game Studios.</p>

<p>It's also worth noting that assuming this MMO was actually in development, it's probably not the&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>multiplayer game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/guerrilla-working-on-multiplayer-horizon-game" rel="nofollow">announced back in December 2022</a>, as that's in development at Guerrilla itself rather than a third-party studio (although that could well end up being canceled too).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/disney-lorcana-archazias-island-is-coming-this-march<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At this year's London Toy Fair, Ravensburger and The Walt Disney Company announced a new set of cards for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/disney-lorcana" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Disney Lorcana</em></a>. The latest set for the popular card game, <em>Disney Lorcana Archazia's Island</em>, will introduce more beloved characters for collectors and players alike.</p>

<h2>The Disney Lorcana Archazia's Island Announcement</h2>

<p>In an official press release, Ravensburger showcased some card and product artwork for <em>Disney Lorcana Archazia's Island</em>.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disney-lorcana-archazias-island-booster-box.jpg?itok=NhG-0Zti 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disney-lorcana-archazias-island-booster-box.jpg?itok=cNIMY_dm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The first of these are the booster boxes. The artwork shows Encanto's Mirabelle, Bolt sporting a steampunk-esque leg attachment, Belle from Beauty and the Beast stepping into her father's footsteps with an engineer's outfit and an electric tool, The Mad Hatter brewing some tea, and Iago with his brazen scowl.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disney-lorcana-archazias-island-product-artwork.jpg?itok=NG63Wdkr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disney-lorcana-archazias-island-product-artwork.jpg?itok=fHPoWoUM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>A more robust <em>Disney Lorcana Archazia's Island</em> image shows not just starter decks, but game mats and card sleeves. The card sleeves sport both Cinderella and Ursula. One game mat features Tigger in a pirate outfit covered in rope high in a crow's nest. The other features the superhero team, Big Hero 6, in full costume.</p>

<p>As for the starter decks, they are appropriately on theme. The first shows Belle and The Beast and appears to be a Ruby and Sapphire deck. The Beast is more dapper than normal, sporting a glowing quill and even a monocle. I suppose Belle has rubbed off on him in the best way. The second starter deck sports Iago and Jafar and is an Amethyst and Steel deck.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disney-lorcana-reign-of-jafar-poster.jpg?itok=oWxoFeJn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disney-lorcana-reign-of-jafar-poster.jpg?itok=HOHsczli 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Jafar's more regal appearance may be foreshadowing the next set after <em>Disney Lorcana Archazia's Island</em>. The aptly named <em>Reign of Jafar</em> involves the villain taking over Archazia's island, corrupting it into a menacing fortress.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disney-lorcana-fabled-poster.jpg?itok=vCWMorkI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disney-lorcana-fabled-poster.jpg?itok=jf5JFfYD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>What comes after this hostile takeover? Well, if the art of the next set is anything to go on, something more nostalgic. The third set, <em>Fabled</em>, features a more classical version of Mickey and Minnie Mouse in medieval garb riding horses. The set will most likely be fairytale-themed with some early 1920s animation deep cuts thrown in for good measure.</p>

<p>Disney Lorcana Archazia's Island will be released in March 2025. <em>Reign of Jafar</em> will be released on June 6, 2025, with pre-release events happening on May 30, 2025. <em>Fabled</em> will be released sometime in Q3 of 2025.</p>
