            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced that it will be raising the prices of all of the original Nintendo Switch models, plus certain accessories for the console, this weekend.</p>

<p>According to an <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/nintendo-switch-pricing-update/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">update</a> on the official Nintendo website, prices for all three console models will be raised "based on market conditions". Just as a reminder, that includes the original Switch, the OLED model, and the Switch Lite, plus "select Nintendo Switch accessories", although Nintendo doesn't specify which ones.</p>

<p>Additionally, "certain Nintendo Switch 2 accessories, select amiibo, and the Nintendo Sound Clock: Alarmo" will also see price increases. Nintendo hasn't revealed by how much the prices for these products will rise, however.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-price-hike-alarmo.jpg?itok=ytnZPRqS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-price-hike-alarmo.jpg?itok=8_Bg-V9b 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's not just the Switch that's getting a price hike.</figcaption></figure><p>Intriguingly, the Switch 2 won't be hit with the same price rise. It's likely that since the console has just been released, Nintendo wants to build up a larger player base before it ratchets up the price of the new machine.</p>

<p>The company does, however, say that it may be necessary to adjust Switch 2 prices in future. I'd imagine that whether this happens or not is contingent on whether President Trump <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0l6g13rlwko" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">increases tariffs or introduces new ones</a>, and since these things can be unpredictable at the best of times, Nintendo is playing its cards close to its chest for now.</p>

<p>While Nintendo doesn't overtly state that it's raising Switch prices due to tariffs, it's almost certainly the reason behind the hike. Nintendo has moved a lot of its manufacturing to Vietnam, a country that's just had 20% tariffs imposed on its exports to the US, and (as is often the way of tariffs) the company is likely passing that cost on to the consumer for its older console.</p>

<p>As a reminder, the original announcement of sweeping tariffs on a number of countries delayed the Switch 2's pre-order date <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/us-switch-2-pre-orders-delayed-tariffs" rel="nofollow">a couple of months ago</a>. Various industry bodies, including <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/esa-trump-tariffs-comments" rel="nofollow">the ESA</a>&nbsp;and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/game-manufacturers-association-opposes-new-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow">Game Manufacturers Association</a> (on the tabletop side), have decried the introduction of tariffs, claiming that they'll have a hugely detrimental impact on the gaming industry.</p>

Now's the time to do so if you're on the fence!</p>
