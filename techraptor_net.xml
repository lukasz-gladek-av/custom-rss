            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We need more puzzle games in the hands of the people. Forget the daily Wordle, or those insipid color sort games, you gotta say to yourself that "the day doesn’t start until I complete this <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/baba-is-you" rel="nofollow"><em>Baba is You</em></a> level", or until you figure out what gets wetter as it dries. Thank goodness Enhance have got this in mind also, as <em>Lumines Arise</em> has, well, risen.</p>

<p>This is the latest game from Enhance Games, the Japan-based studio fronted by Tetsuya Mizuguchi, who was also the director of the original <em>Lumines </em>in 2004. With Enhance, Mizuguchi and co. have been refining a certain transcendental experience that collides with almost menial puzzle gameplay, whether it’s <em>Rez Infinite</em>, the widely revered <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/tetris-effect" rel="nofollow"><em>Tetris Effect</em></a>, or the bustling nature of <em>Humanity</em>.</p>

<p><em>Lumines Arise</em> sees itself neck-and-neck with the likes of <em>Tetris Effect</em>, not just because of its block-based gameplay, but the way it presents itself; almost hoity-toity in fashion. Let it be stated for the record that I personally don’t see what the gift is in <em>Tetris Effect</em>, as its aesthetic clashed way too much mechanically with what <em>Tetris </em>is, and indeed became. What was once 5 minutes on the john with a Game Boy was now lampooning as an artistic endeavor, embarrassed to provide flow.</p>



<p>By contrast, the gameplay of <em>Lumines </em>is simplistic to the point of oversight. You are given two different tones of blocks that always come in the shape of 2x2, and it’s your job to create other 2x2 squares of one tone or the other. Sometimes they spawn in as such, a free point bonus if you will, but you also have to time your drops to the beat of the song playing. It's a very delicate dance, one that surprisingly punishes brute force quite often.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Still, there is a lifeline in the form of a “linker”. Say you have a long 1x1 line of one tone that snakes across your messy board, and a linker of that tone is able to connect to it? That entire line is completely erased, leading to a major reset of the board's opportunities. Despite a much more stilted execution of combos, it's very similar to<em> <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/puyo-puyo-tetris-2" rel="nofollow">Puyo Puyo</a></em> in that regard.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is also a new power-up similar to the “Zone” bonus in <em>Tetris Effect</em>, in the form of “Burst”. Like with Zone, a square of one tone will form and expand, with each single 1x1 square added with the same tone, making it grow and eat any other squares. With that monstrous square formed, a new one spawns of the other tone, and boom, another major reset.</p>



<p>It’s an exceptionally powerful ability, one which seems almost negligible since the linkers work to the same effect, but it works with the visual design brilliantly. Each board blossoms with the progression, and with much broader strokes than the underspoken developments of <em>Tetris Effect</em>’s backgrounds and songs. Still, with time, <em>Lumines Arise</em> effectively evolves into something very different.</p>

<p>While the painting of <em>Arise </em>is similar to <em>Effect</em>, the painter in question is one much more indebted to how <em>Lumines </em>came to existence to begin with. This was always meant to be “transcendental”, to instill a purity through new-age affirmations, even back in 2004, when Mizuguchi’s Sega experience influenced every part of <em>Lumines</em>’ Y2K aesthetic. As it stands, <em>Lumines Arise</em> IS the game that should define Enhance as a studio.</p>

<p>The end result is absolutely magical. From the moment you begin to see yourself in the same shoes of holistic block-based puzzle gameplay, you begin to notice the songs are providing more influence on the board. It's not just that the background is thumping behind the actual action, but the blocks transform, they intertwine with those elements until it becomes what <em>Lumines </em>wanted to be from the beginning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You’ll notice in the corner of gameplay that there’s a little individual reacting to your gameplay, and that’s your Loomii; a customizable avatar who adds a surprising amount of personality to proceedings. They’ll meditate, they’ll rave, they’ll float and interact with other Loomii’s you come across, and it’s nice to see that be the blueprint for <em>Lumines Arise</em>’s general connectivity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As with any <em>Lumines </em>game, the songs are a huge part of the core experience, and here, they're all earworms. The ones that are purely instrumental are the heaviest hitters, with legitimate structure throughout, and the right amount of dynamic co-operation with each square clear and combo chain. It's a huge upgrade on the underspoken and otherwise one-note house music that <em>Lumines </em>tended to pair itself with.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Lumines Arise</em> also tries to expand how it plays with mission modes, which tries to extract the same amount of variety that <em>Tetris Effect</em> does with what it can do with its gameplay. In <em>Arise</em>’s case, it isn’t nearly to the same effect, largely choosing to test the player on timing, as opposed to gimmickry, but when it does provide a unique angle, <em>Lumines </em>Arise runs with it. The “Egg” challenge in particular is both humorous and invigorating to plow through.</p>



<p>With each level clear, you’re also subject to achieving points that can be used on the “Loomi-Pon”, a pseudo-gacha machine which can generate unlockables for your Loomii. These range from cosmetic heads and decorations for their body to different adjectives and titles for your profile. There’s a LOT to unlock, in what is <em>Lumines Arise</em>’s biggest problem, which is with general UX.</p>

<p>For something so welcoming and desperate, it’s surprising to see the GUI of <em>Lumines Arise</em> be an absolute nightmare to navigate. Trying to customize your Loomii with new items is an excruciating effort of trying to find the one item that doesn’t have a tiny lock symbol next to it, and the titles? Forget about it, sifting through hundreds of words on each side? Just grating to get through.</p>

<p>Still, this is <em>Lumines Arise</em>’s only true blemish, as the rest is a beautiful cacophony of particle effects of genuine awe-struck talent. Similar to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/once-upon-katamari-review-ureshii-matsuri" rel="nofollow"><em>Katamari</em></a>’s blissful exercises of saccharine joy, Mizuguchi’s baby has grown into something that looks back on its history, the way it communicated to players, and now we have a statement of pure intent. That statement? Enjoy yourself.</p>

<h2><em>Lumines Arise&nbsp;</em>Review | Final Verdict</h2>

<p>Despite a heinous UX, <em>Lumines Arise</em> genuinely finds itself leaps and bounds above Enhance’s previous titles, in what should become a mainstay title. The gameplay of <em>Lumines </em>is the pinnacle of the phrase “easy to learn, hard to master”, and nowhere is it better showcased than here. A beautiful sprawling entity of brilliant music, fantastic visual design, and worthwhile vibes.</p>
