            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has revealed that it isn't planning to implement any kind of upgrade path for the Switch 2 version of the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em>&nbsp;package.</p>

<p>In a new FAQ on its website, Square Enix says there is "no upgrade path currently available or planned" for the game, and that if you want to play the Switch 2 version, you'll have to buy that one separately, regardless of whether you've purchased the Switch version or not.</p>

<p>As with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-switch-2-500k-sales" rel="nofollow">other Switch games</a>, the Switch 2 version of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake&nbsp;</em>will come complete with improved visuals and performance on Nintendo's newest console, although Square Enix does say there are "no differences in the story, game content, or in which items can be obtained" between both versions.</p>

<p>Additionally, you can't transfer save data between the two versions, nor can you use download codes for the Switch 2 version on the original Switch game, or vice-versa. They're treated as separate software, so they're not inter-compatible in any way.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, though, if you've played&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake&nbsp;</em>on the original Switch, that still entitles you to in-game bonuses for the new games, even if you buy them on Switch 2.</p>

<p>It's worth reading Square Enix's full FAQ for the Switch and Switch 2 versions of its new HD-2D&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest&nbsp;</em>games if you've got any other questions about how the games will work across Nintendo hardware.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bithell Games and publisher Big Fan have announced that fast-paced tactical game&nbsp;<em>John Wick Hex&nbsp;</em>is being delisted from all storefronts in just a couple of days.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1405790/view/596280216846860675" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on Steam,&nbsp;<em>John Wick Hex&nbsp;</em>will be removed from digital storefronts on July 17th. That includes PC and consoles; as the two studios say, as of that date, "new purchases of&nbsp;<em>John Wick Hex&nbsp;</em>will not be possible, regardless of platform or storefront".</p>

<p>However, if you do already own the game, then you'll still be able to play it after that date. That includes both physical and digital copies, thankfully, so it's not completely disappearing.</p>

<p>Announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/john-wick-goes-tactical-on-epic-store-with-john-wick-hex" rel="nofollow">in May 2019</a> and released in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/john-wick-hex-launches-for-pc-on-october-8th-consoles-to-follow" rel="nofollow">October that same year</a>, the game takes place prior to the events of the popular&nbsp;<em>John Wick&nbsp;</em>movies. It sees the titular hitman descending into the underworld to rescue allies Winston and Charon from a new enemy calling himself Hex.</p>

<p>Gameplay-wise,&nbsp;<em>John Wick Hex&nbsp;</em>offers what Bithell calls "fight-choreographed chess brought to life as a video game", with the gameplay "capturing the series' signature gun fu style while expanding its story universe".</p>

<p>You can check out a trailer for&nbsp;<em>John Wick Hex</em>, which shows off the game's unique graphic novel art style and some of its tactical gameplay, right here.</p>




<p>Big Fan and Bithell Games didn't give any reason for the sudden delisting of&nbsp;<em>John Wick Hex</em>, but it's almost certainly got something to do with licensing rights, given that the game is based on an existing property.</p>

<p>If you do want to grab&nbsp;<em>John Wick Hex&nbsp;</em>before it's delisted, you can do so right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1405790/John_Wick_Hex/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1050-CUSA18381_00-JOHNWICKHPS4SIEA" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 4</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/john-wick-hex/9pb1c8s0922m" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox One</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/john-wick-hex-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> (as well as their current-gen successors via backwards compatibility).</p>
