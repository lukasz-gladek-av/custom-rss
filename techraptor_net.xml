            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Just over 3 years ago, we reviewed the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bushido-two-player-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow">current 2-player starter set</a> for <em>Bushido</em> Risen Sun. That set introduced 2 rival families, which could be included as ronin across all factions. Civil Hands Unclean, which adds new ronin sent in support of the families, is releasing soon as an expansion to the 2-player starter set. In this article, we'll have a look at the new fighters and which factions can use them. We also have a preview of an upcoming card that's currently in playtesting at the end of the review.</p>

<p>We've been covering <em>Bushido&nbsp;</em>for years, so if you'd like to learn more about the game, check out <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/bushido-risen-sun-guide" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">our guide to <em>Bushido Risen Sun</em></a>, our <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bushido-two-player-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">review of the <em>Bushido Risen Sun</em>&nbsp;2-player starter set</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/start-collecting-bushido-risen-sun-part-1-introduction-and-developer-interview" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">our "Start Collecting" guide to <em>Bushido</em></a>, which includes an interview with the game's developer.</p>

<p>In the <em>Bushido</em> 2-Player Starter Set, the&nbsp;Hozumi and the Kiyozumi family are at war, framed by the Romeo and Juliet love story of Koga and&nbsp;Hinadori. Civil Hands Unclean is a 2-Player Starter Set Expansion, and while the <em>Bushido</em> 2PSS isn't required to use this product (the minitures it contains are Ronin and can be used by a variety of factions), it continues the story, and the contents add directly to the original box, taking both forces up to the full 100-rice warbands.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bushido-civil-hands-unclean-2.jpg?itok=bEOTaQqx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bushido-civil-hands-unclean-2.jpg?itok=foeJViio 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The <em>Bushido</em> Civil Hands Unclear 2-Player Starter Set Expansion adds new fighters to both families.</figcaption></figure><h2>Old Reinforcements</h2>

<p>Hozumi Daihanji, the senior Hozumi, has called on warriors from his past to assist in the feud. The first of these is Gocho, a battle-tested warrior, summoned back from retirement. While not a dangerous fighter, Gocho does well in groups of Ashigaru, with a ki feat that can grant other ashigaru within its aura a fear stat equal to the number of friendly ashigaru within it, and while Gocho has a Frightened marker, which his steadfast trait negates a lot of, other friendly ashigaru gain fearless.</p>

<p>Gocho can join Prefecture of Ryu, Minimoto, and Shiho warbands, and his Permission to Speak unique effect means that he can be included in themes for those warbands as if he were friendly ashigaru.</p>

<p>The second fighter Daihanji summoned is a former bandit leader who, after being defeated, swore to aid Daihanji when needed. Tozoku has some history with&nbsp;Kenmeina from the opposing family, which is demonstrated through the Hatred trait. In offence, Tozoku has a Bandit Blade ki feat that can remove enemy dice from a melee exchange, with the option for your opponent to transfer ki to Tozoku to keep the dice.</p>

<p>Tozoku also comes with a Hozumi Introduction enhancement that can be purchased, allowing them and other Hozumi models to be included in themes as if they were faction models. Tozoku can be taken by Ito, Silvermoon, Descencion, Jung, and Shiho warbands.</p>

<p>To aid their cause,&nbsp;Kiyozumi Sadaka has called upon a distant cousin from the great Ito clan, Ito Saiaku. Although Ito in name, Saiaku's profile is a ronin profile, and they deploy with their 2 servants. Saiaku is an interesting unit. He can sacrifice either of the 2 servants to prevent damage and has a melee of 3 with Prowess (1), which allows him to reroll a dice during the exchange. He has to use fortune each turn, which is a coin flip to gain 2 or zero ki a turn. Saiaku and the 2 servants must also use leech each turn, which they can't do off each other, so you'll need to keep other fighters nearby, or risk them all gaining control markers and your opponent getting an action out of each of them.</p>

<p>Saiaku does have some solid ki feats, including a once per game that can stop your opponent outright winning the tactical roll that turn and also negating the tactician trait from the unit using it for the rest of the game. An aura ki feat that increases the cost of ki feats and ki boosts from all units within the aura by 1, and my favorite, Inflated Reputation, which gives Saiaku Fear (6) until the end of the turn, unless he has 3 marked wound boxes, as his facade fails.</p>

<p>Saiaku can also have any number of Enhancement - Equipment cards, and one of the servants, Tahei, has a ki feat that can add any permitted Ronin Enhancement - Equipment card to Saiaku. If this ability isn't used each turn, Saiaku and both servants are removed from play. So you will want to bring a stock of permitted equipment cards to throw on Saiaku throughout the game, gaining him more abilities with each turn, along with making sure Tahei has ki to spend and is nearby Saiaku to use it.</p>

<p>Ito Saiaku comes with the permanent unique effect of allowing themselves and Kiyozumi models to be taken in themes as if they were faction models, and can be taken as standard by the Cult of Yurei, Ito Clan, Silvermoon Syndicate, and the Shiho Clan.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bushido-civil-hands-unclean-5.jpg?itok=0sBSswhf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bushido-civil-hands-unclean-5.jpg?itok=4MayuTFI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ito Saiaku drags his 2 servants, Tahei and Matashichi in support of the Kiyozumi clan in <em>Bushido</em> Civil Hands Unclean.</figcaption></figure><h2>Witches Boon</h2>

<p>GCT Studios have kindly offered us a preview of an upcoming card for the next cycle deck that's currently undergoing playtesting, so is subject to change:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Jade Witch</strong> <em>Enhancement</em></p>

<p>When the Attached model Targets a Soulless model with a Ki Feat, the Ki Feat loses {Opposed Ki}.</p>

<p>When the Attached model performs a Simple Ki Feat Action, this model gains a Spell Token.</p>

<p>The Attached model may remove 2 Spell Tokens to gain a third Activation Counter that turn but it must perform a Simple Ki Feat Action during that Activation.</p>

<p>For effects that count number of Shisai, this model counts as 2 Shisai. (it does not count as 2 models for any other purpose).</p>

<p>Requirement [Ayako] Rice Cost: 1 Max: 1</p>

<p><em>A messiah may draw the attention of the people, but the priestess has the notice of the kami.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This enhancement card, for the Ito Clan, means that Ayako's ki feats all become regular tests against soulless models, rather than opposed tests. All 3 of her ki feats are also simple, meaning that she can essentially use 2 ki feats a turn and still take another action. The final part of the enhancement, making Ayako count as 2 Shisai, means that for her own unique ability, she grants herself Resistance (2) and Willpower (2), giving her an advantage of opposed ki tests.</p>

<p>GCT will be revealing more cards from the upcoming cycle as it approaches release.</p>

<p>Civil Hands Unclean includes some incredibly thematic new units that play into their lore very well. It expands the <em>Bushido</em> 2-Player Starter Set perfectly and adds interesting dynamics to the game. Not all factions can use the units in this set, Savage Wage, Shadow Wind, Temple of Ro-Kan, The Awoken and&nbsp;Kinshi Temple are locked out, but if you have the 2-Player Starter Set, you can build 2 100-rice warbands under the Kiyozumi and Hozumi themes, and add these units to any factions that allow their use.</p>

<p>The <em>Bushido</em> Civil Hands Unclean 2-Player Starter Set Expansion will be available soon as a Retailer exclusive.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>No one knows how it started, but everyone knows that they are here. The Savage Wave of oni, demons from myth and legend, and waves of goblins, has descended on the Jwar Isles. Before they fully become oni, there is a rite of passage, and the onisho need to pass through the ring of fire to prove their worth or perish in the attempt. You might think that not being full oni means they're not as powerful, their rage not as all-consuming. You would be wrong. In this article, we'll have a look at the new Ring of Fire themed warband for the Savage Wave. We'll talk about the new and returning fighters, and where you can go next.</p>

<p>We've been covering <em>Bushido&nbsp;</em>for years, so if you'd like to learn more about the game, check out <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/bushido-risen-sun-guide" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">our guide to <em>Bushido Risen Sun</em></a>, our <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bushido-two-player-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">review of the <em>Bushido Risen Sun</em>&nbsp;2-player starter set</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/start-collecting-bushido-risen-sun-part-1-introduction-and-developer-interview" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">our "Start Collecting" guide to <em>Bushido</em></a>, which includes an interview with the game's developer.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/Inari%27s%20Judgement%20%281%29.jpg?itok=HIZRB8L7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/Inari%27s%20Judgement%20%281%29.jpg?itok=NZXYfWyT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Thematically Themed</h2>

<p>When selecting a warband in <em>Bushido</em>, you must first choose a faction from the 13 available to select your fighters from. Each faction also has access to theme cards, which offer special abilities but restrict the units that can be included in the warband. The Savage Wave is a faction for <em>Bushido</em>, and The Ring of Fire is a theme card that restricts you to onisho, but gives them some incredible benefits that play into their theme.</p>

<p>Using the theme, all friendly onisho gain the last stand trait, which means that if they're reduced to 0 wounds, they're not removed from the battlefield until the end of the turn. Normally, units with last stand can't heal, but onisho can still heal using their consume soul or soul thirst abilities. For every onisho that's removed from play during a game, when an onisho uses oni rage, consume soul, or soul thirst, they gain ki and heal an amount equal to the number of friendly units removed so far.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bushido-ring-of-fire-2.jpg?itok=yL1sNQ0e 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bushido-ring-of-fire-2.jpg?itok=5IuxAJRP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Ring of Fire onisho for <em>Bushido</em> are just as brutal as the fully fledged oni.</figcaption></figure><h2>All The Rage All The Time</h2>

<p>The Ring of Fire themed warband includes 5 onisho for the Savage Wave, 3 new models, and 2 returning models with updated sculpts. All of the onisho here have the consume soul ki feat, which is a once-per-turn instant use, that allows them to heal wounds equal to the ki stat of an enemy model removed from play within 3 inches of them.</p>

<p>The Ring of Fire theme is led by Junec, who comes armed with Brutal (1), +2 damage swords, along with armor 2 and tough 1, making them difficult to damage, and even more difficult to remove with their healing through enemy removal and last stand ability with the theme. They also have ki feats that let them use banzai to charge for 1 activation (rather than 2), and add +1 to their brutal trait.</p>

<p>Backing up Junec are Jokash and Kuroko. Jokash comes armed with the pole-armed style agoniser, which is only +1 damage (most of the onisho have +2 damage weapons), but it does have reach to allow them to go first in combat if they're not in base-to-base contact. Their indomitable trait means they ignore small and tiny enemy models they're engaged with for penalties and have their melee stat ki boost reduced by the number of them they're engaged with. With armor 3 and tough 1, throwing them into hordes of smaller enemies only benefits them.</p>

<p>Kuroko is armed with a +2 damage ranged arbalest to hit targets you can't reach in melee. The onisho don't benefit from killing targets at range, and with reload 1 and 2 ammo (which can be replenished by taking no actions for a turn), you will want to throw Kuroko into the fray and use the arbalest stock in melee, unless you need to use the arblast to get past armored and tough foes.</p>

<p>Boba and Kano are two older sculpts who have received updated models and retained the same stat cards. Boba likes to throw +2 damage iron skulls, with ki feats to increase the attack range and gain rapid fire 2. Kano likes to dish out stunned markers with their batter ki feat and +2 damage club.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bushido-ring-of-fire-3.jpg?itok=C-AzN8RF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bushido-ring-of-fire-3.jpg?itok=lSXXM4Qj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The onisho in the Ring of Fire themed warband for <em>Bushido,</em> totals 87-rice just for the 5 fighters alone.</figcaption></figure><h2>Brutal Cunning</h2>

<p>The rice cost of the included onisho in Ring of Fire is 87, and you can easily make up the rest of the 100-point rice cost with the 17 enhancement and event cards included in the set. Each fighter has a unique card enhancement for them, and the rest are generic enhancements or events. My favorite is the There Can Be Only One event, which means that if there is only 1 friendly onisho remaining, it doesn't remove activation counters while enemy units have activation counters, so they can continue to activate multiple times until your opponent finishes their activations. You're going to be extremely aggressive with your onisho, so it's a great just-in-case card to mean you can dish out some insane damage in a phase where you only have 1 onisho left, especially when combined with the last stand ability.</p>

<p>The Ring of Fire theme is extremely aggressive, allowing you to throw your fighters into combat, knowing that they can heal and are difficult to remove because of layers of armor and tough. They have abilities that allow them to come out on top in combat and deal massive damage when they do. The themed last stand ability means that even if your opponent takes them out, they're still dangerous until the end of the turn, and can still heal and keep going.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bushido-ring-of-fire-5.jpg?itok=NfFueXi0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bushido-ring-of-fire-5.jpg?itok=f9q14Fte 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Bushido</em> has 3 other onisho available already, Goro, Tsuta and Yasei.</figcaption></figure><h2>Increasing Aggression</h2>

<p>On top of the previous 2 onisho who've had updated sculps for this pack, 3 other onisho are available, and another is releasing alongside The Ring of Fire. Goro is a huge onisho, on par with Junec in damage-dealing terms. Tsuta and Yasei are slightly cheaper onisho, with Tsuta having ranged options and the only support ki feat out of the whole group with Idolize that can boost another onisho's melee pool. Yasei deals damage with only their fists, with +2 damage wrestling, and a unique ability that always adds another wound to damage rolls in melee.</p>

<p>Releasing alongside The Ring of Fire is Merlek, an onisho shugenja, or magic user. They still have a +2 damage staff, but also a short-range black magic attack that increases in damage for each enemy they damage. They have a Fall into the Ring ki feat, which gives all oni and onisho in the aura strong, making damage tests easier, and all other models in the aura weak, making damage tests more difficult for them. They also have the most thematic of ki feats for the warband, Ring of Fire, which puts a 4-inch aura in the centre of the battlefield, and units within it can't allocate dice to defense.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bushido-ring-of-fire-4.jpg?itok=SFPi7aEZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bushido-ring-of-fire-4.jpg?itok=WrrtQBBA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Merlek is releasing alongside Ring of Fire, giving the onisho some magical support, but still having devastating melee damage to fall back on.</figcaption></figure><h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On Ring of Fire?</h2>

<p>This is my first experience with the Savage Wave, and they do exactly as you would expect. There's something freeing about throwing your fighters entirely into combat, knowing that your opponent will be on the defensive, and even if they're not, they will struggle to even damage your fighters and, almost impossible to remove them. I love the fact that there is also always the risk of you dropping There Can Be Only One when you've only one fighter left, for an insane final turn with your fighter rushing to deal as much damage as possible while your opponent tries to avoid them. Someone said something about victory points, but I was too busy smashing their forces into the dirt.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ring of Fire will be available to <a href="https://gctstudios.com/catalog/new-specials" rel="nofollow">preorder from the GCT website</a>&nbsp;in the coming months.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Original Subnautica Director Sues Krafton After Dismissal]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/subnautica-charlie-cleveland-lawsuit</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/original-subnautica-director-sues-krafton-after-dismissal.1241463/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Subnautica&nbsp;</em>creators Charlie Cleveland, Max McGuire, and Ted Gill have announced that they're suing Krafton, the parent company of his now-former studio Unknown Worlds, following his dismissal from the company.</p>

<p>As a reminder, Cleveland, along with fellow co-creators McGuire and Gill, was ousted from Unknown Worlds earlier this month. Krafton initially didn't provide a reason for their dismissal, but in a <a href="https://bleedingcool.com/games/krafton-addresses-subnautica-2-changes-while-devs-issue-lawsuit/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">subsequent statement</a>, the company alleged that after what it calls the "failure" of Unknown Worlds' game&nbsp;<em>Moonbreaker</em>, Cleveland "chose to focus on a personal film project" rather than resuming&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>development.</p>

<p>However, as you might expect, Cleveland <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lwsxco/lawsuit_a_community_update_from_charlie/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">disputes</a> Krafton's version of events. He says that he "would never willingly abandon [<em>Subnautica</em>] or the amazing team that has poured their hearts into it", reiterating that he and his team believed the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/subnautica-2-delayed-2026" rel="nofollow">recently-delayed</a>&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2</em>&nbsp;was ready for release in 2025 and that the situation "needs to be made right".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/subnautica-2-charlie-cleveland-lawsuit-fish-scanning.jpg?itok=jXWn_Ml8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/subnautica-2-charlie-cleveland-lawsuit-fish-scanning.jpg?itok=PHCvdirn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Subnautica&nbsp;</em>co-creator Charlie Cleveland is suing Krafton after his dismissal from Unknown Worlds.</figcaption></figure><p>As a result, although Cleveland says he and his fellow&nbsp;<em>Subnautica&nbsp;</em>creators would rather not engage in a public battle with Krafton, they feel it's a necessity to make the situation right.</p>

<p>Cleveland also references the $250 million employee bonus that was reportedly to be paid to employees upon reaching a certain revenue goal in 2025 (which the release of&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>would obviously have greatly helped).</p>

<p>He says that he, Gill, and McGuire will "continue with the earnout/bonus" and that Unknown Worlds employees "deserve it for all their incredible work trying to get this great game into your hands".</p>

<p>As with many corporate lawsuits, this one is likely to run and run, so it's probably going to be quite some time before we hear the result of Cleveland's efforts. He does, however, say that the details of the lawsuit "should eventually become (at least mostly) public", so that information will be revealed in time.</p>




<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>itself, it's currently slated for an Early Access release on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1962700/Subnautica_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/subnautica-2/9PJPCB188SVG" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> in 2026, although whether this lawsuit changes that or not remains to be seen. Stay tuned for more.</p>
